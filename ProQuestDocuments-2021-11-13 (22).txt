MADRID — Spain is recounting its dead.
Like many nations across the world trying to measure the toll that the coronavirus pandemic has taken, Spain has been stymied by unreliable figures.
But in a politically fragmented society, the confusion has led to recrimination and sinister claims, with opposition politicians accusing the fragile coalition government of covering up the real numbers.
“Spaniards deserve a government that doesn’t lie to them,” said Pablo Casado, leader of the opposition Popular Party.
Speaking in Parliament last week, Casado addressed a direct challenge to Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez: “Tell us if it is true that the real number of victims could double the official figures.”
Officially, Spain’s death toll, which remains among the world’s highest, is closing in on 20,000. But there is evidence that it could be far higher, with many deaths — especially those in nursing homes — not properly classified as stemming from the coronavirus.
Sánchez and other officials reject accusations that they have intentionally underreported COVID-19 fatalities, but authorities have begun trying again to measure the losses.
Last week, Spain’s Justice Ministry told civil registries to comb through their death records dating back to March 14, when the country went into lockdown, to find unaccounted-for coronavirus victims.
Spanish officials are not the first to take another look at how they count the dead. In New York City, the official death toll jumped sharply, to over 10,000, when authorities began including people who had not tested positive for COVID-19 but were presumed to have died from it.
A debate over the reliability of coronavirus data has been taking place almost since the beginning of the outbreak and extends from China to the United States. Many countries have not tested enough people to track infections, let alone establish how many deaths have been caused by the virus.
But the debate is taking place with singular ferocity in Spain.
Far-right political party Vox has pushed the cover-up accusations hardest. Last week, it posted on social media a manipulated photo of Madrid’s Gran Vía thoroughfare filled with coffins draped in Spanish flags. The government, Vox claimed, was hiding “the suffering of this tragedy.”
Helena Legido-Quigley, an associate professor of public health at the University of Singapore, said there were many reasons that authorities worldwide should improve the counting of their dead. One is the brutal nature of the pandemic. Untold numbers of people have been forced to remain apart from loved ones as they died — and then unable to hold proper funerals for them.
“We know how important death rituals are in Spain and so many other countries,” Legido-Quigley said. “So the authorities should help reduce the huge impact on a society of having now been forced to dehumanize the process of dying.”
It is not just a matter of lacking testing capability. The problems of counting the dead are also compounded because not all nations have followed the same methodology.
In France, for instance, the counting was changed in early April to add nursing home deaths, which raised the toll by more than 3,000.
“It would have been very useful if we had at least some clearer European Union guidance on how to count deaths, so as to make the numbers more comparable from the start,” Legido-Quigley said.
Some countries were late in labeling COVID-19 as an official cause of death.
The United States announced a code for recording COVID-19 on March 24, weeks after the first American coronavirus fatality was reported. In Britain, COVID-19 joined the list of infections to be mentioned on death certificates only at the same time as the country recorded its first victim.
Spain announced its first coronavirus death March 3. But the infection was identified only in a post-mortem examination conducted weeks after the patient died from what appeared to be pneumonia. And once Spanish hospitals started filling with patients and staffing resources grew scarce, health officials did away with such post-mortems.
While the central government has yet to adjust its official death figure, numbers released by some of Spain’s regions have been shocking, particularly because they have revealed the extent to which nursing homes have been decimated behind closed doors.
Last week, the regional government in Madrid estimated that almost 3,500 people had died in its nursing homes after displaying probable symptoms of the virus. Since they had not been tested, they had not been included in the official tally for Madrid nursing homes — 781.
Past experience with other epidemics like swine fever suggests that it may take several months, if not longer, for nations to have a true understanding of the coronavirus death toll.
“The main reason for getting right the numbers of this disease is that we have a substantial risk of a second wave,” said Dr. Christopher Murray, director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, which has compiled forecasts of death tolls in several countries, including Spain.
“The faster we learn,” he said, “the better our chances” to be prepared for another wave.
Murray said he expected public pressure to force governments to move faster than in the past to provide more accurate counts and also to loosen restrictions on the disclosure of death statistics, which are often applied because of privacy rights.
In several countries, the internal flow of information has been problematic.
In Spain, the central government says it had to rely on numbers provided by the regional administrations that manage the country’s public hospitals. That has set off a blame game, and some regional leaders have been among the most outspoken critics of the government.
José Antonio Monago, the conservative leader in the western region of Extremadura, suggested this month that there had been a government order to “hide the real number” of coronavirus victims. “Whoever dies from the disease does not deserve to fall into oblivion,” he said.
Spain’s interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, rejected the accusation as “very serious” and unfounded.
About 88% of Spaniards want politicians to set aside their differences during the national health emergency, according to a survey published Wednesday by Spain’s public center for sociological research.
Yet as more new figures emerge from the regions, the mutual recriminations have continued. This week, health officials in Catalonia almost doubled their own tally of deaths in the region — to 7,097 — after reviewing data collected by undertakers.
Quim Torra, the region’s leader, said Thursday: “We now have a much clearer situation in Catalonia. I wish the rest of the state would do the same.”
Amid the political bickering, those whose days are spent overseeing the dead, like priests and pallbearers, have taken to making their own back-of-the-envelope calculations. They have been trying to understand the true numbers behind why Spain has had to convert some buildings into emergency morgues, including the country’s largest skating rink, the Ice Palace in Madrid.
“I think the official numbers of the dead obviously don’t add up,” said Juan Antonio Alguacil, who heads a Spanish association of funerary employees.
He said that in late February, before Spain officially registered its first coronavirus death, his colleagues had already been handling an “illogical” increase in the number of pneumonia cases.
“If we want to heal the moral and psychological wound that this pandemic will leave,” Alguacil said, “we have to get the full truth as soon as possible from our authorities about what really occurred.”

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is expected on Thursday to weaken regulations on the release of mercury and other toxic metals from oil and coal-fired power plants, another step toward rolling back health protections in the middle of a pandemic.
The final Environmental Protection Agency rule does not eliminate restrictions on the release of mercury, a heavy metal linked to brain damage. Environmental lawyers said the new method of calculating the costs and benefits of curbing mercury pollution would most likely destroy the legal underpinnings of controls on mercury and many other pollutants.
By reducing the health benefit of regulations on paper, while raising their economic costs, the new method could be used to justify loosening restrictions on any pollutant that the fossil fuel industry has deemed too costly to control.
“That is the big unstated goal,” said David Konisky, a professor of public and environmental affairs at Indiana University. “This is less about mercury than about potentially constraining or handcuffing future efforts by the EPA to regulate air pollution.”
The Trump administration’s long-running effort to reduce regulatory burdens on industry has ramped up in recent weeks despite emerging scientific links between dirty air and COVID-19 death rates. While the nation struggles with the coronavirus, the administration has loosened curbs on automobile tailpipe emissions and opted not to strengthen a regulation on industrial soot emissions.
The deregulatory rush appears designed to secure less restrictive rules quickly, in case Republicans lose control of Congress and the White House in November. A new government could move quickly under the Congressional Review Act to overturn any regulation or federal rule within 60 days of it being finalized — making any rule completed after late May or early June vulnerable.
Mandy Gunasekara, a Republican strategist, testified in February to a House committee that the changes to the mercury rule, then in the planning stages, would “fix a dishonest accounting mechanism that the last administration used to justify any regulatory action regardless of costs.” Gunasekara has since become chief of staff to Andrew R. Wheeler, the EPA administrator.
Environmental lawyers and public health leaders called the timing of the final mercury rule as well as its substance an attack on air quality.
“What is most disconcerting to me is this administration’s lack of interest in science and, frankly, their lack of concern for our nation’s children,” said Aaron Bernstein, interim director of the Center for Climate, Health and the Global Environment at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “Mercury pollution in the United States damages our children’s brains before they even come into the world, and estimates are that that cost is in the billions of dollars.”
Patrick Parenteau, a professor at the Vermont Law School, noted that in virtually every environmental rollback, President Donald Trump’s EPA has acknowledged in the fine print that enormous increases in health problems and deaths will occur because of increased pollution.
A plan to weaken carbon dioxide emissions at power plants, for example, predicted as many as 1,400 additional premature deaths a year. A draft analysis of the soot policy put forward this week showed that tightening the existing standard by 25% could save as many as 12,150 lives a year.
Two people close to the administration said the White House was concerned enough about the public perception of loosening environmental rules during the outbreak that it held the mercury plan for several weeks after it passed a review from the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. EPA officials assured the White House that the agency was merely responding as required to a 2015 Supreme Court ruling that found it must justify the economic impact of the mercury standards.
The weakening of the mercury rule would be one of the most significant regulatory rollbacks engineered by the Trump administration. The existing federal regulation on mercury pollution, completed in 2012, is the most expensive clean air regulation ever written by the EPA.
When it published its draft cost-benefit changes last year, the EPA said the cost of cutting mercury from power plant emissions “dwarfs” the economic benefits and argued that the Obama rule could not be justified as “appropriate and necessary.”
The EPA’s 2012 regulation was the first federal standard to require power plants to install pricey pollution controls to limit mercury emissions — at a cost to industry of $9.6 billion a year. The Obama administration justified that cost by tallying the benefits not just of reducing mercury but also “co-benefits” like reducing sulfur dioxide, fine particulate matter and other pollutants that were also curbed by the equipment.
Driving down mercury emissions alone, the studies at the time found, would yield a $6 million annual benefit, a fraction of the cost of controls. But with the rest of the co-benefits and the projected gains in avoided heart disease, asthma attacks and other health problems, the benefits reached $80 billion over five years. Overall, the Obama administration estimated that the rule would prevent 4,700 heart attacks, 130,000 asthma attacks and 11,000 premature deaths each year.
Under the Trump administration’s new rule, such co-benefits will no longer be calculated with cost, only direct benefits.
While coal producers urged Trump to roll back the rule, the vast majority of electric utility companies have agreed the cost-benefit changes may be of little help to them, because they have already spent the billions of dollars needed to come into compliance. Many of those companies urged the Trump administration to leave the mercury measure in place.
Coal plants subject to the rule “have already spent millions of dollars to install mercury equipment to reduce mercury emissions,” wrote Scott A. Weaver, the director of air quality services for American Electric Power, an Ohio-based electric utility company that operates power plants in 11 states, in a public comment on a draft of the rule.
“Rescinding the standards at this point will create new problems” Weaver wrote, noting that companies that have sought to recoup the cost of installing mercury control equipment through bills to customers may no longer legally be able to do so. That means the new rule could actually cost companies more money.
Despite such assurances, Matthew Davis, a former EPA scientist who worked with the agency’s office of children’s health protection to develop the original rule, said weakening the rule still represented a threat to children’s health.
“The reason we did this rule is because children and developing fetuses are harmed by mercury,” said Davis, who now works at the League of Conservation Voters.
The new rule is a victory for one of Wheeler’s former lobbying clients, Murray Energy Corp., one of the nation’s largest coal companies, which declared bankruptcy last year and is undergoing a reorganization. The company’s former chief executive, Bob Murray, a major donor to Trump’s inauguration fund, personally requested the rollback of the mercury rule soon after Trump took office, in a written “wish list” that he handed to Rick Perry, who was energy secretary at the time.
Jeffrey R. Holmstead, an attorney for the electric utility industry who served in the EPA under President George W. Bush, rejected the idea that the decision was a cynical calculation to set the stage for other regulatory rollbacks.
“It’s not as if the administration has been shy about rolling back other things,” Holmstead said, dismissing environmental concerns. “I don’t think there’s any impact whatsoever from this,” he said.
In Congress, the Obama-era mercury rule has bipartisan support. Sen. Thomas R. Carper of Delaware, the top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works committee, and Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the chairman of an energy and water appropriations subcommittee, wrote an opinion piece in USA Today in November urging the Trump administration to leave the regulation unchanged.
“Changing the rule after billions of dollars have already been spent means that utilities will have less certainty about federal regulations,” they wrote. “The gains we have made over the past decade to protect children and families from dangerous mercury pollution should not be lost.”

WASHINGTON — The Navy is looking into whether it can reinstate Capt. Brett E. Crozier, who was removed from command of the carrier Theodore Roosevelt after he pleaded for more help fighting a novel coronavirus outbreak aboard his ship, Defense Department officials said Wednesday.
Adm. Michael Gilday, chief of naval operations, has indicated that he may reinstate Crozier, who is viewed as a hero by his crew for putting their lives above his career, officials said.
“No final decisions have been made,” Cmdr. Nate Christensen, a spokesman for the admiral, said in a statement on Wednesday to The New York Times. Christensen added that Gilday was reviewing the findings of a preliminary investigation into the events surrounding Crozier’s removal.
But Gilday’s decision could be upended by President Donald Trump, who has not been shy about intervening in military personnel cases. Only five months ago, Trump fired Navy Secretary Richard Spencer for opposing the president’s intervention in support of a member of the Navy SEALs accused of murdering a wounded captive with a hunting knife during a deployment to Iraq in 2017.
No one in the Navy wants those events to be repeated, which included a Twitter admonishment by Trump of how the branch’s leaders handled the SEALs case. But Navy officials insist that Gilday will make a decision based on the findings of the investigation into the Roosevelt crisis, and not on what he believes the president wants him to do.
Trump himself has indicated he may be open to reassessing the events around the firing. He said recently that Crozier “made a mistake,” but he also noted that the captain “had a bad day.” It remained unclear how the president would view a move to reinstate Crozier, or when action would be taken.
Crozier, who is in isolation on Guam with coronavirus, was removed from command on April 2 by Thomas Modly, the acting Navy secretary at the time. The decision drew outrage among the carrier’s crew and across the country and eventually led to Modly’s resignation.
Gilday and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had both cautioned Modly not to fire Crozier until after an investigation into the case has been completed. Modly, believing Trump wanted the captain dismissed, ignored them, officials said.
As of Wednesday, 615 Roosevelt crew members have tested positive for coronavirus; five are in the hospital with one in intensive care, and one has died. The death of the sailor on Monday was a poignant punctuation to Crozier’s plea for help on March 30, after four days in which his superiors rebuffed his request to evacuate the ship. In an emailed letter, he wrote, “Sailors don’t need to die.”
That plea, sent to 20 Navy personnel, became public and angered Modly, which led to his decision to remove the captain from his post.
Gilday indicated last week that he was open to reinstating Crozier once the preliminary investigation was completed. “I am taking no options off the table as I review that investigation,” he told reporters. “I think that is my responsibility.”
Any decision to reinstate Crozier would come with its own problems. Navy officials remain unhappy that the captain sent an unclassified letter seeking help to so many people, instead of relying on his chain of command. For the Navy to reinstate him, Gilday would have to determine that Crozier’s superiors were not being adequately responsive to requests for help before the letter had been sent, Navy officials said.
Gilday already has the findings of an initial investigation into the Roosevelt case. But that investigation was conducted by Adm. Robert Burke, the Navy’s second-highest admiral, who was involved in the situation aboard Roosevelt. As part of the investigation, Burke called the senior medical officer aboard the ship and criticized the doctor, saying he had failed as a leader, according to crew members.
In the run-up to Crozier’s letter, the ship’s medical staff and the captain advocated swift, decisive action, while Crozier’s immediate boss, Rear Adm. Stuart Baker, countered that less drastic measures would still protect the crew and leave the Roosevelt in operation.
Gilday told reporters this month that the investigation would focus in part on why Crozier, a Naval Academy graduate with nearly 30 years of service, felt compelled to send his four-page letter outside normal communications channels and whether that illustrated a breakdown in communications with his chain of command, particularly with Baker. The Navy has said Crozier did not copy Baker on his letter.
Before the results are made public, Gilday will consult with the new acting Navy secretary, James McPherson, as well as with Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Milley.
“The Navy investigation now in progress should take its time and make sure we truly understand the detailed ‘ticktock’ of events that preceded the letter launched by Capt. Crozier,” said James G. Stavridis, a retired admiral and former top commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. “If it becomes clear that his chain of command was not responsive, it makes a potential case for rehabilitation much stronger.”
Esper, the Pentagon’s top civilian, has not indicated where he stands on the investigation. Appearing on Fox News on Wednesday, he appeared to acknowledge that he might eventually have to weigh in. “At some point it likely will come to me,” he said. “But the most important thing though is taking care of our sailors who are now in Guam.”
The investigation will not examine why the Roosevelt, and its nearly 5,000 crew members, made a long-scheduled, four-day port call in Da Nang, Vietnam, beginning on March 5, despite reported cases of coronavirus in the country.
The top U.S. military officer in Pacific, Adm. Philip Davidson, ordered the visit to proceed as a show of military might in a region increasingly worried about China’s growing territorial claims in the South China Sea.
Navy and Pentagon officials have since defended the decision, saying there were only a handful of reported coronavirus cases, mostly in the northern part of the country, at the time the Roosevelt pulled in. Navy officials publicly say they are not sure how the virus got aboard the ship, but privately acknowledge that it almost certainly happened during the port call.
In Guam, many among the Roosevelt’s crew say they are hoping Crozier will return as their captain. One crew member described the commander as prescient during every chapter of the crisis. While the ship’s interim commander, Capt. Carlos Sardiello, who commanded the Roosevelt previously, is viewed favorably by much of the crew, he is not seen to be as receptive to them as Crozier was when he was in charge.

Researchers have confirmed that there are several effective methods for decontaminating the N95 masks worn by health professionals so that they can be used more than once, the National Institutes of Health announced Wednesday.
A substantial body of research already showed that the masks, designed for one-time use, can be reused in a crisis. And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in March authorized reuse because of shortages driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. In recent weeks the Food and Drug Administration has issued emergency approvals for several systems of mask decontamination.
None of these rules or methods are intended for the cloth masks recommended or in some locations required for use by everyone in public. The CDC advises regular washing of homemade fabric masks in a washing machine.
Earlier research had not, of course, involved the new coronavirus. The new research, done at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and used live novel coronavirus, formally known as SARS-CoV-2, to test the mask material. The study determined which decontamination procedures were most effective and how they affected the integrity of the masks.
Vincent Munster, one of the authors of the new work, who collaborated with other government researchers and scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the work built on more than a decade of studies of decontamination.
“We showed that it actually works as well for SARS-CoV-2 as for influenza,” and for bacteria, he said.
The research was posted on MedRxiv, a website where scientists have been posting articles submitted for publication elsewhere that have not yet been through peer review. But NIH publicized the study because it could be helpful to health care professionals in the midst of a crisis, and it was validating and extending previous work, not suggesting untried methods.
Munster and his colleagues tested four methods of killing the virus: UV light, dry heat, vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) and ethyl alcohol. Of those methods, they did not recommend ethyl alcohol because although it killed the virus, it degraded the mask material.
The researchers first tested samples of N95 material to which live virus had been applied. That work was done in a biosecure lab. After treatment, they cultured virus particles from the material to see if the shielding remained effective in limiting transmission.
Then they tested the same methods on whole masks without the virus to determine whether their structure and functioning were damaged after rounds of decontamination.
Munster said that even if decontamination worked perfectly, but the mask no longer fit “then obviously your mask is not really good for reuse anymore.”
Vaporized hydrogen peroxide, a method often available in large hospitals, was effective, and left the masks still functioning for at least three rounds of decontamination, as did UV light.
Dry heat, at 70 degrees Celsius or 158 degrees Fahrenheit, was effective, but the masks withstood only two rounds of decontamination. Munster said that “vaporized hydrogen peroxide would be the method of choice if that’s available.” However, he said, a nursing home might not have that, while for dry heat, what’s needed is basically an oven.
Dr. Lynn Goldman, dean of George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public Health, said in an email that she thought the new research was an “excellent contribution.” She said, it was “helpful to see that either VHP or UV can effectively sterilize N95 masks and make them available for reuse up to three times.”
Another recent study from Canadian researchers, also not yet peer reviewed, confirmed the value of decontamination. It included masks of different brands and found that the material of the mask was still effective after 10 rounds of vaporized hydrogen peroxide decontamination.
One of the authors of that paper, Dr. Anand Kumar at the University of Manitoba, said that his procedure was slightly different from Munster’s in that it did not test the structure and facial fit of the mask, only the filtering ability of the material.
The recommendations and findings in the two papers are intended to be useful for institutions that have health care workers wearing N95 masks. With personal protective equipment in short supply at many overwhelmed hospitals, some front-line workers, including doctors and nurses, have complained that masks were rationed.
The public has been advised not to use or try to buy N95 masks because they would be depriving health care workers of lifesaving equipment.
“And if they do, they shouldn’t try decontaminating them,” Kumar said.

Texto completo: On April 2, a wireless tower was set ablaze in Birmingham. The next day, a fire was reported at 10 p.m. at a telecommunications box in Liverpool. An hour later, an emergency call came in about another cell tower in Liverpool that was going up in flames.
Across Britain, more than 30 acts of arson and vandalism have taken place against wireless towers and other telecom gear this month, according to police reports and a telecom trade group. In roughly 80 other incidents in the country, telecom technicians have been harassed on the job.
The attacks were fueled by the same cause, government officials said: an internet conspiracy theory that links the spread of the coronavirus to an ultrafast wireless technology known as 5G. Under the false idea, which has gained momentum in Facebook groups, WhatsApp messages and YouTube videos, radio waves sent by 5G technology are causing changes to people's bodies that make them succumb to the virus.
The incidents starkly demonstrate how coronavirus conspiracy theories have taken a dark turn by spilling out into the real world. In just a few weeks, the pandemic has given preexisting fringe ideas online new urgency.
Before the coronavirus, rarely did such theories cause as much tangible harm so quickly, disinformation researchers said.
In the United States, one person died after self-medicating with chloroquine, which was touted online as a miracle cure for the coronavirus even though its efficacy is unproven. And Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was assigned more security this month after unfounded theories spread that he was part of a secret cabal working to undermine President Donald Trump.
"Most conspiracies stay online, but this is having real-world impact," said Alexandre Alaphilippe, executive director of the EU DisinfoLab, a Brussels-based group tracking virus conspiracy theories. He called managing pandemic misinformation "a new problem" because the disease is global and people everywhere are hunting for information.
The false theory linking 5G to the coronavirus has been especially prominent, amplified by celebrities like John Cusack and Woody Harrelson on social media. It has also been stoked by a vocal anti-5G contingent, who have urged people to take action against telecom gear to protect themselves. Representatives for Harrelson and Cusack, whose 5G posts have since been deleted, declined to comment.
The idea has deep internet roots. An analysis by The New York Times found 487 Facebook communities, 84 Instagram accounts, 52 Twitter accounts, and dozens of other posts and videos pushing the conspiracy. The Facebook communities added nearly half a million new followers in recent weeks. On Instagram, a network of 40 accounts nearly doubled its audience this month to 58,800 followers.
On YouTube, the 10 most popular 5G coronavirus conspiracy videos posted in March were viewed over 5.8 million times. Today, the conspiracy can be found on Facebook in over 30 countries, including Switzerland, Uruguay and Japan.
British politicians said the conspiracy theory and the violent acts it was causing were unacceptable.
"This is nonsense of the absolute highest order," said Julian Knight, a member of Parliament who leads a committee investigating coronavirus-related online misinformation. He said Facebook and YouTube needed to "get a grip" on the situation or risk undermining the crisis response.
Knight added that the spread of 5G conspiracies raised alarms about how information about a future coronavirus vaccine would be disseminated.
"If we were to get a vaccine for COVID-19, can we trust the social media companies to ensure that the right public health messages are put out about that vaccine?" he asked. "That could be a question of life and death for many people."
Facebook, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, said it was "starting to remove false claims that 5G technology causes the symptoms of or contraction of COVID-19." YouTube said it would reduce recommendations of videos linking the coronavirus to 5G, while Twitter said it had taken action against misleading and harmful content about the illness.
Wild claims about 5G are not new. The technology has an outsize political importance because it may provide countries with a competitive edge, with faster wireless speeds enabling more rapid development of driverless cars and other innovations.
Internet trolls have seized on 5G and its political implications to sow fear, leading to protests in the United States and elsewhere against the technology in recent years. Russians have pushed claims that 5G signals were linked to brain cancer, infertility, autism, heart tumors and Alzheimer's disease, all of which lacked scientific support.
In January, as the coronavirus rippled through Wuhan, China, and beyond, it provided new fodder for anti-5G trolls. On Jan. 19, a post on Twitter speculated on a link between 5G and the disease, according to Zignal Labs, a media insights company that studied 699,000 mentions of the conspiracy this year through April 7.
"Wuhan has 5,000+ #5G base stations now and 50,000 by 2021 -- is it a disease or 5G?" the tweet said.
Telecommunications companies, which have added more security and are working with law enforcement, said the attacks against their workers and equipment had been widespread, threatening communication networks during the crisis. Vodafone said it had experienced at least 15 incidents, while BT has had at least 11. The companies said that in many cases, vandals had damaged existing infrastructure and not new 5G gear.
Police in Belfast, Liverpool and Birmingham said they were continuing to investigate the incidents, reviewing security-camera footage and asking the public for leads.
Anti-5G groups have continued adding hundreds of members. One Facebook user shared photos this week of a wireless tower being constructed in an unidentified area of Britain.
"Light it up," one commenter responded.

Trump's COVID-19 response: Lash out

Texto completo: Whatever our economic or social standing, people share a common need during times of crisis. We need to be kept informed and feel protected without being given false hope. We need steady leadership that knows what it's talking about and that models what it demands of us. And we need to be reminded that we are all in this together.
To a stunning degree, our president is handling the current pandemic the opposite way. He lurches and lashes out, blaming China, the World Health Organization, the press, the Democrats or the governors for his own deficient responses. He spews misinformation, using press briefings as campaign events or to hype his power.
On Monday, he resorted to near-totalitarian rhetoric, declaring, "When somebody is president of the United States, the authority is total." He ignores his chief medical officer's warnings, with plans to rush the country prematurely back into business.
Rather than feel reassured, one is likely to come away from a White House press briefing led by Donald Trump feeling battered and confused. He doesn't need metrics to make decisions, the president boasts; he just knows. "Nobody's ever seen anything like what we've done," he claims, noting governors are "very happy" with him. Was that true after he accused them of hoarding ventilators, to deflect criticism that his administration didn't order enough early on? He had implied it wasn't smart business sense to invest in mass-producing them because their value would soon tank.
Also, soon after declaring he had sole power to end social distancing, Trump accused governors who were forging regional alliances of trying to stage an insurrection. Then, within hours, he'd decided governors should decide when to reopen their states. His mixed messages have become so unhelpful that some news networks have taken to cutting Trump off. Some politicians of his own party, including former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, are suggesting Trump not speak beyond opening statements. Even the highly conservative Wall Street Journal editorial board has weighed in against the president's outbursts at critics, saying, "This isn't impeachment, and COVID-19 isn't shifty Schiff. It's a once-a-century threat..."
Now, during that once-in-a-century threat to world health, the president wants to de-fund the World Health Organization. He faults the U.N. agency for believing China's misinformation. But, as the New York Times points out, "it was Mr. Trump himself who went out of his way to publicly and repeatedly praise the Chinese government for its handling of the virus." He was negotiating a trade deal with China then.
The WHO, it should be noted, was supplying diagnostic COVID-19 tests to countries early on, when we needed them, but the U.S. never asked. Trump initially downplayed the new coronavirus, suggesting that we view it like the flu, and that it posed very low risk to America. He suggested the flu vaccine would protect against it. There is no evidence for that.
He also touted the anti-malaria drug hydroxochloroquine. When a reporter at one of his press briefings asked infectious disease specialist Dr. Anthony Fauci whether medical research showed the malaria drug effective against COVID-19, Trump blocked Fauci from answering.
Trump's Monday press briefing hit a new threshold. He was testy after a weekend New York Times story reported he had wasted more than a month before agreeing in mid-March to "targeted containment efforts." Even the quintessentially diplomatic Fauci had told CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday that those calls for social distancing in February could have saved lives but were ignored or met with heavy pushback. Trump then retweeted a call to fire Fauci. On Monday, he put Fauci in front of the mic, where the doctor tried to downplay some criticisms. Trump, for his part, maintained that nothing was meant by his tweet.
Trump then aired a promotional video of himself that featured praise for his COVID-19 responses, with a timeline of those. In a later back-and-forth with CBS News reporter Paula Reid, who asked what measures he took in February, Trump ended it telling her, "Look, you know you're a fake."
Attacks on journalists have become a staple in Trump's COVID-19 press briefings. When NBC News reporter Peter Alexander once asked what he'd say to reassure Americans who were scared, the president snapped: "I say that you are a terrible reporter. That's what I say."
The president told another reporter who questioned long waits for test results, "You should say congratulations, great job, instead of being so horrid in the way you ask a question." It's significant that even at a time for pulling together, he views the press as the enemy.
Yes, the president did sign a big financial assistance package to help out-of-work Americans and businesses. But he's not modeling behavior Americans should emulate. When we were asked to start social distancing, he was shaking hands and standing shoulder to shoulder with guests. He seemed to scoff at the suggestion that someone in his position wear a mask.
Americans, however, have mostly complied with recommendations to keep a distance, even as family members were dying, or have followed orders to go to work, even at personal risk. Some first responders, teachers, caregivers, health care providers, essential workers and others have made extraordinary sacrifices to take care of others. They deserve better than the unstable behavior their commander-in-chief is modeling. So we must all seek out sound, science-backed information for ourselves.
Most Americans also seem to understand that a crisis of this magnitude, with a lethal virus that knows no boundaries of race or class or politics, is a time we must stand united rather than look out only for our own. If only the president did, too. But for now, maybe the best we can hope is that responsible members of Trump's Cabinet, team of advisers, party and family step in to rein him in before he lets a crisis become a catastrophe.

British politicians said the conspiracy theory and the violent acts it was causing were unacceptable.
"This is nonsense of the absolute highest order," said Julian Knight, a member of Parliament who leads a committee investigating coronavirus-related online misinformation. He said Facebook and YouTube needed to "get a grip" on the situation or risk undermining the crisis response.
Knight added that the spread of 5G conspiracies raised alarms about how information about a future coronavirus vaccine would be disseminated.
"If we were to get a vaccine for COVID-19, can we trust the social media companies to ensure that the right public health messages are put out about that vaccine?" he asked. "That could be a question of life and death for many people."
Facebook, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, said it was "starting to remove false claims that 5G technology causes the symptoms of or contraction of COVID-19." YouTube said it would reduce recommendations of videos linking the coronavirus to 5G, while Twitter said it had taken action against misleading and harmful content about the illness.
Wild claims about 5G are not new. The technology has an outsize political importance because it may provide countries with a competitive edge, with faster wireless speeds enabling more rapid development of driverless cars and other innovations.
Internet trolls have seized on 5G and its political implications to sow fear, leading to protests in the United States and elsewhere against the technology in recent years. Russians have pushed claims that 5G signals were linked to brain cancer, infertility, autism, heart tumors and Alzheimer's disease, all of which lacked scientific support.
In January, as the coronavirus rippled through Wuhan, China, and beyond, it provided new fodder for anti-5G trolls. On Jan. 19, a post on Twitter speculated on a link between 5G and the disease, according to Zignal Labs, a media insights company that studied 699,000 mentions of the conspiracy this year through April 7.
"Wuhan has 5,000+ #5G base stations now and 50,000 by 2021 - is it a disease or 5G?" the tweet said.
Telecommunications companies, which have added more security and are working with law enforcement, said the attacks against their workers and equipment had been widespread, threatening communication networks during the crisis. Vodafone said it had experienced at least 15 incidents, while BT has had at least 11. The companies said that in many cases, vandals had damaged existing infrastructure and not new 5G gear.
Police in Belfast, Liverpool and Birmingham said they were continuing to investigate the incidents, reviewing security-camera footage and asking the public for leads.
Anti-5G groups have continued adding hundreds of members. One Facebook user shared photos this week of a wireless tower being constructed in an unidentified area of Britain.
"Light it up," one commenter responded.

Texto completo: A team from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention has arrived in Sioux Falls to help with the Smithfield Foods coronavirus hot spot, which has become the biggest single source of cases in the United States.
South Dakota's total number of COVID-19 cases increased by 180 to 1,168 on Wednesday. Eighty of the new cases are Smithfield Foods employees, bringing the total to 518 Smithfield employees who have tested positive. There are also now 126 total cases of non-employees that became infected when they came into contact with a Smithfield employee, according to the South Dakota Department of Health.
The 518 employees and 126 non-employees connected to Smithfield makes it the largest cluster in the country (644), according to tracking by the New York Times. The previous top cluster was 585 cases aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt in Guam.
Smithfield announced on Sunday that it would be closing its Sioux Falls plant indefinitely on Wednesday. The plant has 3,700 employees.
Gov. Kristi Noem said the state is "aggressively testing" Smithfield employees and people who have come into contact with them, as well as getting people into isolation as soon as possible.
The CDC team is scheduled to tour the Smithfield plant on Thursday morning and create a checklist of items to complete before the plant can reopen, Noem said during a press conference on Wednesday. Noem said she's working with federal officials and Smithfield leaders to get the plant back online to provide relief for pork producers and the food chain.
Health Secretary Kim Malsam-Rysdon said they requested that the CDC bring in occupational health experts to help the state understand Smithfield's coronavirus situation and what the company can do to protect its workers. Smithfield is cooperating with the state, and they look forward to the mitigation efforts so the plant can reopen, she said.
Lower projected peak Noem announced a lower projection for the state's peak of COVID-19 cases on Wednesday, saying that residents' actions are successfully bending the curve. However, people still need to practice mitigation efforts such as social distancing, wearing masks out in public and washing hands, she said.
"We need to stay the course," she said.
Sioux Falls' peak is now expected in mid-May, and the state's peak is also likely changing, Noem said, but a new timeline wasn't given on Wednesday. If nothing was done about the pandemic, the state would be peaking a week from now with 10,000 hospitalizations, according to state projections.
At the peak in Sioux Falls, the state is now projecting that about 1,200-1,300 hospital beds will be needed and the healthcare systems already have that capacity, Noem said.
State epidemiologist Josh Clayton said the state is now projecting that 2,500 beds and 650 ventilators will be needed at the state's peak instead of the previous projection of 5,000 beds and 1,300 ventilators.
But, Noem said, state officials are still planning for 5,000 hospital beds at the state's peak.
Cases in Minnehaha County increased by 166 to 934 on Wednesday, and in Lincoln County the confirmed cases rose from 55 to 65 cases, according to the state Department of Health.
The state's death toll remains at six as no new deaths were reported on Wednesday. Recoveries increased by 69 to 329 total. Six more people have been hospitalized for a total of 51 people who have been hospitalized at some point since the pandemic began, according to the state health department.
The state has also received Avid testing machines that can rapidly run coronavirus tests, and the state is trying to increase the testing supplies it has for those machines, Malsam-Rysdon said.
Health care facilities in Watertown, Redfield, Huron, Sioux Falls, Mobridge, Martin, Hot Springs and Spearfish will receive the Avid machines. The communities were chosen because they are hard hit by the pandemic or didn't have ready access to commercial labs, as well as increasing the testing ability West River.

Joe Biden's #MeToo Moment

Información de publicación: Wall Street Journal , Eastern edition; New York, N.Y. [New York, N.Y]. 16 Apr 2020: A.14.

Texto completo: If there is a silver lining to the ugly #MeToo accusation against Joe Biden, it is that the reluctance of the left and the media to pursue it as vigorously as charges against other men suggests they may have discovered that principles such as due process and the presumption of innocence still matter in America. Or so we can hope.
The accusation against the presumptive Democratic nominee for President comes from Tara Reade, a former Senate staffer for Mr. Biden. In 1993, she says, then-Sen. Biden pinned her to a wall, put his hand under her skirt and digitally penetrated her. On Sunday The New York Times carried a story that cited a friend who said Ms. Reade told her about the incident right after it is alleged to have happened. It also cited her brother and another friend who said she'd told them over the years. The friends were anonymous.
Mr. Biden denies the accusation, unequivocally. But here's the complication. Mr. Biden has long embraced the view that women must be believed on sexual assault. Except, apparently, for Ms. Reade.
Mr. Biden has a long and convoluted history here. When Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexually harassing her, Mr. Biden, as Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, insisted she would have to make her case publicly so Mr. Thomas could answer the charges. In 1994, for their book "Strange Justice," he told Jane Mayer and Jill Abramson that he acted with "fairness to Thomas, which in retrospect he didn't deserve," and he later apologized to Ms. Hill. Now he wants the fairness standard for himself.
Mr. Biden has long painted himself as a champion for victims of abuse and harassment, saying his proudest legislative achievement was the 1994 Violence Against Women Act. As Vice President he appointed the first White House Adviser on Violence Against Women and served as point man for the Obama Administration's effort to change the "culture on campus" toward sexual assault and harassment. This turned out to mean throwing protections for accused students out the window and allowing the minimum standard of evidence to conclude guilt.
After Mr. Biden had left office, Brett Kavanaugh, Donald Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court, was accused by Christine Blasey Ford of sexually assaulting her when the two were in high school. Mr. Biden spoke generally at the time about these kind of he-said, she-said cases involving a public figure.
"For a woman to come forward in the glaring lights of focus, nationally," he told reporters, "you've got to start off with the presumption that at least the essence of what she's talking about is real, whether or not she forgets facts, whether or not it's been made worse or better over time." Again, except for now.
The accusation against Mr. Biden has also exposed the double standards of the media. When Mr. Kavanaugh was the target, for example, the New York Times reported Julie Swetnick's charges -- including that she'd seen Mr. Kavanaugh at high school parties where women were "gang raped" -- the same day she made them. They were smears backed up by no evidence. There's been much less media appetite to report on Ms. Reade's claims.
Times editor Dean Baquet waited 19 days to report her allegation and was asked by his own media columnist why Mr. Kavanaugh was treated differently. His answer: "So I thought in [Ms. Reade's] case, if The New York Times was going to introduce this to readers, we needed to introduce it with some reporting and perspective. Kavanaugh was in a very different situation. It was a live, ongoing story that had become the biggest political story in the country. It was just a different news judgment moment." It sure was.
We said at the time that we didn't know if Ms. Blasey Ford was telling the truth, and we don't know whether Ms. Reade is now. When women make serious charges they deserve to be taken seriously, but that shouldn't mean assuming an accused man must be lying. The right way to proceed is to decline to make a judgment and examine the claims and supporting evidence. In the case of Ms. Blasey Ford, no corroboration was forthcoming.
All of this is called due process and the presumption of innocence. These protections apply to everyone -- including those who would deny them to others. Such as Mr. Biden.

Oprah addresses virus’ toll on black people

Texto completo: The Mercury News
As African Americans continue to be infected with, and die from, the coronavirus at an alarming rate, Oprah Winfrey is addressing the situation in a special presentation on Apple TV+ and OWN.
In Oprah Talks COVID-19 — The Deadly Impact on Black America, the media mogul looks to bring attention to the devastating impact the pandemic is having on African Americans across the country.
“This coronavirus is shaking up the world,” Winfrey wrote in a Twitter post. “I hope you’ll join me to understand why COVID-19 is having such a deadly impact on black America as I speak to leaders in our community and family members who are having to bury their dead alone.”
The episode is available now, for free, on Apple TV+ (no subscription needed).
In the special, Winfrey speaks with Van Jones, CNN host and CEO of Reform Alliance; Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot; Dr. Aletha Maybank, chief health equity officer at the American Medical Association; and Nikole Hannah-Jones, New York Times staff writer and founder of 1619 Project, a civil rights-themed series as part of the New York Times Magazine.
Additional guests join the conversation from their respective remote locations around the country to share how COVID-19 is impacting certain regions, how citizens can support people most in need and hear personal experiences from those on the frontline fighting this pandemic.
Also featured: a musical performance by Jennifer Hudson.
On Tuesday morning, Winfrey appeared on NBC’s Today, where she spoke to Hoda Kotb about how the coronavirus is “ravaging” the black community.
“Not only is it serious, but people that you don’t know, but probably will know, are losing their loved ones,” she said.
Winfrey went on to note that, among the reasons the black community has been so devastated, is the occupational obligations its citizens are facing.
“We as a people, as African Americans, have jobs that require us to be at work,” she said. “For so many African Americans, there isn’t this ability to telecommute.”
“We certainly understand that the responsibilities and dynamics of some people’s lives, particularly African American and brown people, do not allow you to be able to stay at home,” she continued. “Therefore, they need masks … For now everybody needs to look out for themselves and for their neighbors.”
Winfrey went on to emphasize the need for more testing and stressed that it’s vitally important that African Americans understand the urgency of the situation.
“It’s taking us out,” she said. “It’s killing your cousins and your friends and your neighbors. And you need to do whatever you can to protect yourself.”
Winfrey is backing up her potentially life-saving message with money. Last week she announced that she is donating $10 million to coronavirus relief efforts.

The movie industry was already on a precipice. Did the pandemic just give it a push?
With theaters shuttered all over the world and hundreds of millions of people ordered to stay at home, it’s unclear when the movie industry can resume business as normal, or even whether that “normal” will look anything like Hollywood wants it to. Pivotal pieces of the film calendar — including the summer-blockbuster season and the year-end awards gantlet — have been thrown into disarray, and in their absence the gulf between streaming media and the theatrical experience may only widen further.
How will the movie industry cope with these disruptions, and what will happen to the rest of 2020 if fearful audiences can’t be coaxed back to the theater? Season by season, the outlook is bleak.
Summer: Blockbuster Season Evaporates
If a magic wand could be waved that would eradicate the coronavirus and free people from their homes, the most lucrative summer movie season ever would surely follow.
But there is no magic wand. A potential vaccine for the coronavirus will take at least a year to become available, and in that time, it’s hard to imagine a feasible way for movie theaters to reopen and turn a regular profit. Even if plans were drafted to deep-clean theaters between screenings and limit attendance so moviegoers could still keep a safe distance, will studios still want to screen their would-be blockbusters for such a decimated crowd? These movies often need to make hundreds of millions of dollars simply to break even, an impossible task for a world where only a sliver of the population gets to see them.
Though Universal delayed the Vin Diesel-led “Fast 9” nearly a full year, from May 2020 to April 2021, other studios have been more cautious about making changes to their schedules. Warner Bros. has not yet announced a new release date for Christopher Nolan’s “Tenet,” currently parked on July 17, and though the studio moved “Wonder Woman 1984” off its June 5 berth, that superhero sequel is still set to come out in August. Both films are intended to be billion-dollar grossers, but that hardly seems realistic if people remain discouraged from gathering en masse, especially in hard-hit markets like China.
Still, many in Hollywood are taking a wait-and-see approach to the pandemic. Disney postponed early-summer films like the Marvel entry “Black Widow” and the Pixar title “Soul,” but the studio’s live-action take on “Mulan,” already bumped from its spring slot, is currently scheduled to come out July 24. Is it because the movie is aimed at a young audience, the demographic that has so far proven most resistant to the coronavirus? Or will Disney need every part of its empire projecting confidence in order to get people back into its theme parks and onto its cruise ships by the end of summer?
Some studios have pivoted to digital debuts or shifted smaller and already-released films onto streaming services. Paramount sold its imminent Kumail Nanjiani-Issa Rae comedy, “The Lovebirds,” to Netflix, while Universal just released the pricey animated film “Trolls: World Tour” on demand for $19.99. The studio bragged that “Trolls” set an all-time digital record but declined to release figures, leaving it still unclear how profitable a digital-only release can be for a big-budget tentpole.
And while families will pay less for a “Trolls” rental than they would on several movie tickets, the price still compares unfavorably to a monthly Netflix subscription ($8.99 to $15.99). The streaming behemoth is well-suited to ride out the pandemic, and its summer slate remains unaffected. Audiences’ allegiance to Netflix and other new streaming services will probably grow even more entrenched the longer theaters are closed.
Fall: Film Festivals Are in Doubt
You’ll never hear more coughs than at a film festival screening.
The attendees are typically tired, overscheduled and stressed out — a trade-off for the privilege of seeing great films in advance — and they only grow more worn-down as the festival continues. It is the lucky few who make it to the end without contracting some sort of cold. Now, they’re up against something far worse.
It’s hard to imagine how the finely calibrated calendar of film festivals can continue as planned. South by Southwest was the pandemic’s first major event cancellation in March and the Cannes Film Festival, initially postponed from its usual May slot, looks to be the next, as the French president, Emmanuel Macron, has extended a ban on public events in the country until mid-July.
Films like Wes Anderson’s “The French Dispatch,” which was intended to premiere at Cannes in May before a summer release, have already been pushed to later in the year. Organizers admitted this week that Cannes can’t be held the way it was originally intended: Even if the festival was bumped to a late-summer date, it would face interference from three key film festivals that begin in September and are meant to kick off the prestige movie season.
But will any of those fests still happen? The Venice Film Festival is up first, on Sept. 2, and while a premiere there is usually coveted — last year, “Joker” began its juggernaut run on the Lido — Italy is still reeling from a coronavirus outbreak that has killed more than 20,000 of its citizens so far. Will this devastated country really be ready to throw a glamorous film festival a few months from now? And will Hollywood stars be eager to travel to it?
Subsequent festivals in Telluride, Colorado, and Toronto are considered even more important to launching year-end films. Still, some experts have warned of a potential coronavirus resurgence in the fall, and many may balk at going even if protective measures are taken and capacity is reduced. And if it looks like the 2020 awards season may be compromised, many prestige films could opt to sit out this festival year entirely.
Winter: Will Oscar Season Crumble, Too?
This was supposed to be an afterglow year for the Oscars, a time to bask in the good will generated from Bong Joon Ho’s popular “Parasite” and its triumph in the best-picture category.
Now, just a few months after that history-making moment for a Korean film, the motion picture academy may be pushed into another forward-thinking decision before it’s quite ready: Will the Oscars allow films to be eligible if the pandemic prevents them from receiving a theatrical release?
Some streaming movies have previously earned Oscar attention with only a minimal, obligatory dip into theaters, but the prospect of no theatrical release at all is a bridge the academy has never been willing to cross. After winning recent concessions from Netflix to commit to a longer theatrical release window for the company’s awards titles, the academy may now be especially reluctant to allow mass exceptions. Loosen the rules just this once, and it could prove difficult to put the genie back in the bottle.
Another possibility that’s been floated is extending Oscar eligibility so that the next show will include films released in both 2020 and 2021, something the academy has not done since several double-decker ceremonies in the 1930s. If academy bigwigs embrace that scenario, major Oscar contenders like this December’s “West Side Story” are in danger of becoming old news by the time voters fill out their ballots, and even Netflix might be tempted to push year-end awards films like David Fincher’s “Mank” and Ron Howard’s “Hillbilly Elegy” into 2021.
The academy had planned a board meeting for this week where these issues were almost certain to come up, though it was recently postponed to April 28. In the meantime, some acclaimed films that were set to come out over the next few months are already on hold: Until the academy offers further guidance, these filmmakers and casts don’t want to forsake their Oscar eligibility for a digital release. The only thing that’s certain right now is that many more dominoes have yet to fall.

NEW YORK — With New Yorkers self-quarantining, Rockefeller Center conjures up the promise of life returning to normal someday and the unshakable glory of the city. It was New York’s Depression-era version of building the pyramids. When it opened during the 1930s, the critic Lewis Mumford heaped abuse on it, then seemed to forget that he had ever said anything bad after it became a beloved emblem of art deco-era Manhattan and a midtown magnet.
Or as the famous Gershwin song from the time put it, “They all laughed at Rockefeller Center, now they’re fighting to get in.”
Not at the moment, of course. This is the latest in a series of condensed and edited architectural walks around town, which for the time being I am conducting with architects and others virtually, meaning via phone and Google maps. They’re meant to be consumed virtually, too.
Daniel Okrent is many things — a prolific historian, co-writer of the hit comedy revue “Old Jews Telling Jokes,” an inventor of Rotisserie League Baseball and the first public editor of The New York Times. He also happens to have written the book on Rockefeller Center: “Great Fortune: The Epic of Rockefeller Center.”
He suggested we “meet” on Fifth Avenue, between 49th and 50th streets, at the entrance to the Channel Gardens, the pedestrian passage that declines toward the skating rink, framing a postcard view of 30 Rock, the skyscraper formerly known as the RCA Building.
Michael Kimmelman: Why is it called the Channel Gardens?
Okrent: It’s named after the English Channel because it is flanked by two six-story buildings called the British Empire Building, to the north, and La Maison Française, to the south. To attract tenants, Rockefeller Center advertised itself as a hub for international trade. Congress actually passed a bill in 1932 making these buildings a free port, which enabled importers to bring goods in duty-free and store them on the premises — a commercial masterstroke. Another masterstroke by the developers was the decision to rent the second floor of the building just north of these two — the one guarded by Lee Lawrie’s famous “Atlas” sculpture — to the United States Passport Service for $1 a year. The presence of the passport office helped fill the center’s rental spaces with steamship companies, airlines, consulates, luggage stores and travel agencies.
Kimmelman: I remember as a child getting my passport at the office. My mother would take me to Rockefeller Center, we’d eat at Schrafft’s, and if she was browsing in Saks, we walked back to the subway via the Channel Gardens.
Okrent: Gertrude Stein, in her Gertrude Stein-ish way, said the Channel Gardens view was “the most beautiful thing I have ever seen ever seen ever seen.” Raymond Hood, who led the team of architects that designed Rockefeller Center, thought the slope downhill would help draw people from Fifth Avenue into the complex.
Kimmelman: The shift in grade does act like a portal.
Okrent: Hood had studied at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. It’s significant that he didn’t do a classic, triumphal arch. He designed a modern garden walkway, human-scaled, like the buildings on either side of it. Putting up these two six-story buildings on Fifth Avenue seemed incredibly uneconomical even at the time. But Hood — along with Todd and Rockefeller, the other key figures behind Rockefeller Center — wanted to break up the massing of the giant development to make it less monolithic, more coherent and inviting.
Kimmelman: You’re talking about John R. Todd, the developer, and John D. Rockefeller Jr.
Okrent: Family archivists call him Junior, so I do too. Junior set aside millions of dollars for the gardens, reflecting pools and art — works like Rene Paul Chambellan’s bronze fountainhead sculptures of mermaids and tritons in the Channel Gardens. Decorating a commercial development with gardens and pools and sculpture was unheard-of back then.
Kimmelman: What was on the site before?
Okrent: Since the early 19th century, Columbia University had owned the land — 12 acres bounded by Sixth and Fifth avenues and 49th and 51st streets. By the 1920s Fifth and Madison avenues were booming, but Columbia had let the property go to seed. It was flophouses, whorehouses and speak-easies. At the time, the Metropolitan Opera was looking for someplace to build a new home, and its trustees approached Junior about acquiring the site. He didn’t care much for opera but was a great benefactor of the city. So he negotiated a 99-year lease with the university, with the idea that the Met would build the opera house. The next day, pretty much, the stock market crashed, and the Met’s trustees, who were very rich people, claimed poverty. Couldn’t Junior build the opera house for them? He hit the roof — to the degree that a man so mild could hit the roof.
So he dropped the opera idea and in the teeth of the Depression decided to become a commercial developer.
Kimmelman: I’ve read that Rockefeller Center trailed only the federal government as an employer during those years, accounting for as many as 225,000 jobs, if you include suppliers mining iron ore in Alabama and copper in Arizona, workers fabricating windows in Pennsylvania, etc.
Okrent: The center accounted for as many as 75,000 jobs in New York alone. After the Empire State Building was completed in 1932, remember, it was the only private construction project of any size in the city until after the Second World War. There’s a bas-relief near the rear entrance to 630 Fifth Ave. that pays tribute to the workers who built Rockefeller Center by the well-known sculptor Gaston Lachaise. Although labor and construction prices plummeted during the Depression, Todd and Junior used the opportunity not to cut costs but to spend extravagant amounts on materials like excess structural steel, which they added to various buildings to support lush roof gardens.
The goal was to add luxury and surprise, to enhance the public experience — within a family of materials and forms.
Kimmelman: You might say the plan for Rockefeller Center does something similar, fitting itself into the city grid while standing out.
Okrent: If I had to pick one reason for Rockefeller Center’s success, it’s how it was fitted into the street grid. The Channel Gardens lead down to the skating rink, which originally was conceived as a sunken plaza for high-end shops and restaurants. It was a dead end. It turned out customers didn’t want to climb down a flight of stairs then trudge back out. So the stores and restaurants flopped. Things turned around after they brought in a guy from Cleveland who had figured out a way to maintain artificially refrigerated skating rinks. People were only too happy to pay for the privilege of being the entertainment for passersby, who loved to watch them.
Kimmelman: Meaning the former dead-end plaza was integrated with the flow of the city.
Okrent: It’s a miraculous place. Like a moment’s pause. Half a block away from the city’s main thoroughfare, with benches where you can stop and sit, and plantings in front of the RCA Building, you feel you’re in midtown and also apart from it.
Kimmelman: You haven’t talked about 30 Rock or the RCA Building.
Okrent: I still call it the RCA Building. Can’t help myself. Alice B. Toklas, who visited with Stein, said something like, it’s not the way it goes up into the air, it’s how it comes out of the ground. It rises with an almost physical energy. Hood used the tops of elevator banks as setbacks to let as much light into the office spaces as possible and used the tops of the larger setbacks for gardens. Todd figured tenants would pay another dollar per square foot to have garden access, so he was very happy to let Hood design them.
I like to walk west on 49th Street, around the corner, to the south entrance of the RCA Building, which is decorated with Leo Friedlander’s art deco nudes. Junior’s office was on the 56th floor of the RCA building. It was styled like an 18th-century English baronial mansion. His tastes were conservative. He detested the Friedlander nudes here and also the ones on the 50th Street side of the building so much that he refused to enter the building through those doors. But, significantly, he also never ordered the sculptures to be removed. He saw art as a public service. If we continue west on 49th Street, cross Sixth Avenue and then look back up at the third floor of the RCA Building (you don’t really get a clear view otherwise), we can find four bas-reliefs, carved in stone, still hard to see but striking, also by Lachaise. You might well ask, “What are they doing all the way up there?”
The answer is that when Rockefeller Center was built, the elevated train still ran up Sixth Avenue. Hood positioned the Lachaise reliefs so El riders passing through the station could see them.
Kimmelman: The train stopped at Rockefeller Center’s most famous building.
Okrent: A block north on Sixth Avenue, Radio City Music Hall.
Kimmelman: Designed by Edward Durell Stone and Donald Deskey.
Okrent: It was built to outshine the Roxy Theater, which was across Sixth Avenue. The Roxy had 6,200 seats. So Radio City advertised that it had 6,201. To reach that number, they had to include the chairs in front of the mirrors in the ladies’ rooms and the seats in the elevators for the elevator operators.
Kimmelman: I gather Radio City bombed at the start.
Okrent: They put on lavish shows that flopped. Things turned around when they started to focus on movies. But from Day One the building was a work of art. Remember Chambellan, who did the bronzes in the Channel Gardens? He did wonderful bas-reliefs on the Sixth Avenue side of the music hall, near 50th Street, that represent various forms of entertainment. My favorite was called “Jewish Vaudevillians.” I can never decide whether it was a tribute or an insult. I can tell you that there isn’t 1 in 10,000 people today who notices it depicts Jews.
For years I worked across Sixth Avenue in the Time-Life Building, and I never noticed Hildreth Meière’s polychrome roundels on the music hall’s south wall, representing Dance, Drama and Song. And farther east on 50th Street, the wonderful grillwork covering the fire escapes was Stone’s idea. He was eventually let go, having spent too many hours at the bar of the 21 Club. As one of his colleagues said, “Ed could draw anything except a sober breath.”
Kimmelman: Stone went on to team with Philip L. Goodwin and design the Museum of Modern Art’s first purpose-built home on 53rd Street. Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, Junior’s wife, was a founder of MoMA — one of the great patrons and pioneers of American modernism. Her taste was very different from Junior’s.
Okrent: There were, at one time, plans for a triumphal midblock boulevard linking Rockefeller Center with MoMA, which may explain why MoMA is the only major museum that isn’t on a corner or facing a plaza. The boulevard was supposed to extend, northward, the plaza between the RCA Building and the skating rink, culminating in a second plaza that would front the museum. There were also plans for a network of underground concourses beyond the existing ones at Rockefeller Center that would have connected the center to Grand Central Terminal, but the owners of Saks thwarted that.
Which brings us to a significant hole in the wall farther east on 50th Street, a vehicle entrance ramp that leads to an underground delivery network — one of the most crucial elements of Rockefeller Center. Trucks delivering to the center’s offices or commercial operations drive down to a turntable that directs delivery vehicles toward different spots below street level, where they unload their goods. This means, along 49th Street and 50th Street, between Fifth and Sixth avenues, unlike in the rest of midtown, you don’t have double-parked delivery trucks.
It’s part of what makes Rockefeller Center feel like an oasis.
Kimmelman: You realize we haven’t even circled one block yet.
Okrent: So let’s end back at the building on the corner of Fifth Avenue, where “Atlas” lives. They piped the 18th floor for nitrous oxide and compressed air.
Kimmelman: Laughing gas?
Okrent: To entice dentists. Thirty of them signed leases immediately. The developers had a scheme for everything. The south wing of this building was called the Palazzo d’Italia. Like Britain and France, Italy had its own pavilion. This was the 1930s. The original facade of the Italia building had a Pyrex sculpture that included a slogan associated with the Fascists, “Arte e Lavoro, Lavoro e Arte” [“Art and Work, Work and Art”]. It was covered up once the United States entered World War II.
But there’s still a remnant of fascist Italy. If you cross Fifth Avenue and look back at the building’s roofline, you can see four stone bas-reliefs representing different eras in Italian history. Second from the left: Mussolini’s symbol, the fasces.
Kimmelman: I hate to give a dictator the last word, so let me ask, what happened with the triumphal boulevard?
Okrent: The Rockefellers tried for years to make it happen. But the 21 Club was in the way, and its owners wouldn’t budge.
No matter how powerful the Rockefellers were, in the end even they were no match for the speak-easy business.

John Horton Conway, an English-born Princeton mathematician whose body of work ranged from the rigorously highbrow to the frivolously fun, earning him prizes and a reputation as a creative, iconoclastic and even magical genius, died Saturday in New Brunswick, New Jersey. He was 82.
His wife, Diana Conway, said his death, at a nursing home, was caused by COVID-19.
John Conway’s boundless curiosity produced profound contributions to number theory, game theory, coding theory, group theory, knot theory, topology, probability theory, algebra, analysis, combinatorics and more. Foremost, he considered himself a classical geometer.
“His swath was probably broader than anyone who ever lived,” said mathematician Neil Sloane, a collaborator with Conway and the founder of the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. “I’ve worked with a lot of people, and he was the fastest at solving a problem and would pursue a topic as far as it would go.” (The two were co-authors of 50 papers and published the 706-page book “Sphere Packings, Lattices and Groups.”)
During what Conway called his “annus mirabilis,” roughly 1969 to 1970, he discovered what’s known as the Conway group, an entity in the realm of mathematical symmetry that inhabits 24-dimensional space. He discovered a new type of number, “surreal numbers.” And he invented the cellular automaton Game of Life, which is among the most beautiful mathematical models of computation. He described it as a “no-player never-ending” game.
His friend Martin Gardner, the longtime mathematical games columnist for Scientific American, called the Game of Life Conway’s “most famous brainchild.” He reckoned that when it went viral on the internet — with addicts programming it at home and at work — one quarter of the world’s computers were playing it.
“Conway’s LIFE changed mine,” musician Brian Eno said in an email. “I think Conway himself thought it rather trivial, but for a nonmathematician like me, it was a shock to the intuition, a shattering revelation — to watch glorious complexity emerging from staid simplicity.”
Conway was proudest of his discovery of surreal numbers. (The Stanford computer scientist Donald Knuth had come up with the name while writing the novelette “Surreal Numbers: How Two Ex-Students Turned on to Pure Mathematics and Found Total Happiness.”)
Described by Gardner as “an astonishing feat of legerdemain,” the surreals are a super-continuum of numbers, including all the old-fashioned reals ones (integers, fractions and irrationals like pi) as well as those that go above, beyond, below and within, embracing both the infinites and the infinitesimals.
Conway always hoped that surreal numbers might find practical applications, perhaps in helping to illuminate the universe on the cosmic and quantum scales.
One of Conway’s favorite accomplishments was the Free Will Theorem, conceptualized casually over the course of a decade with his friend and fellow Princeton mathematician Simon Kochen and first published in 2006 (and later revised).
The theorem, simply put, is this: If physicists have free will while performing experiments, then elementary particles possess free will as well. And this, Conway and Kochen reckoned, probably explains why and how humans have free will in the first place.
“In mathematics and physics there are two kinds of geniuses,” Kochen said by phone from his home in Princeton, echoing something once said about the physicist Richard Feynman. “There are the ordinary geniuses — they are just like you and me but they are better at it; if we’d worked hard enough, maybe we could get some of the same results.
“But then there are the magical geniuses,” he added. “Richard Feynman was a magical genius. And the same always struck me about John — he was a magical mathematician. He was a magical genius rather than an ordinary genius.”
John Horton Conway was born on Dec. 26, 1937, in Liverpool, England, the third child and only son of Cyril and Agnes (Boyce) Conway. His father, an autodidact, had left school at age 14 and, with his photographic memory, made a living playing cards. Later he was a technician in the chemistry lab at the Liverpool Institute High School for Boys, setting up experiments for students, among them George Harrison and Paul McCartney.
Conway’s mother, a great reader, especially of Dickens, had worked from age 11. Family lore has it that she boasted about finding her son at age of 4 reciting the powers of two. At 18, in 1956, John left home for the University of Cambridge, where he earned his doctorate. His adviser, Harold Davenport, a number theorist, once said that when he would give Conway a problem to solve, “he would return with a very good solution to another problem.”
As a student, Conway cultivated his acknowledged lifelong preference for being lazy, playing games and doing no work. He could be easily distracted by what he called “nerdish delights.” He once went on a flexagon binge, courtesy of Gardner, who described flexagons as “polygons, folded from straight or crooked strips of paper, which have the fascinating property of changing their faces when they are flexed.”
He built a water-powered computer, which he called Winnie (Water Initiated Nonchalantly Numerical Integrating Engine). He read and annotated H.S.M. Coxeter’s edition of W.W. Rouse Ball’s classic work, “Mathematical Recreations and Essays” and wrote Coxeter a lengthy letter that started a lifelong friendship between these two classical geometers.
Hired at Cambridge as an assistant lecturer, Conway gained a reputation for his high jinks (not to mention his disheveled appearance). Lecturing on symmetry and the Platonic solids, he might bring in a turnip as a prop, carving it one slice at a time into, say, an icosahedron, with its 20 triangular faces, eating the scraps as he went. “He was by far the most charismatic lecturer in the faculty,” his Cambridge colleague Peter Swinnerton-Dyer once said.
Conway invented a profusion of games — like Phutball (short for Philosopher’s Football, which is a little like checkers on a Go board) and collected them in the book “Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays,” in collaboration with Elywn Berlekamp and Richard Guy.
All the gaming was supported by a loyal following of graduate students, among them Simon Norton, with whom Conway published the Monstrous Moonshine conjecture, investigating an elusive symmetry group that lives in 196,883 dimensions. (His doctoral student Richard Borcherds received the prestigious Fields Medal in 1998 for his proof of the conjecture.)
At the University of Cambridge Conway rose to become a professor in mathematics as well as a supernumerary fellow at Gonville and Caius College, his alma mater there. He was named a fellow of the Royal Society in 1981.
In 1985, with four co-authors, he published “The ATLAS of Finite Groups,” one of the most important books in group theory.
That same year, he was invited to give a talk at Princeton, and a job offer followed: In 1987, he took up the position of the John von Neumann professor of applied and computational mathematics. In announcing the hire, Princeton’s president called Conway “one of the most eminent mathematicians of the century.”
At Princeton Conway, with his mischievous and seductive aura, drew news media attention. Asked by a reporter for The New York Times about his life of the mind, he replied: “What happens most of the time is nothing. You just can’t have ideas often.”
He became a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1992. A fellow inductee, the mathematician Robert MacPherson, recalled that at the ceremony Conway accepted his honor in what appeared to be green running shorts.
His first two marriages, to Eileen Howe and Larissa Queen, ended in divorce.
In addition to his wife, he is survived by four daughters from his first marriage, Annie, Ellie and Susie Conway and Rosie Wayman; two sons from his second marriage, Oliver and Alex; a son with Diana Conway, Gareth; three grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.
At Princeton he was almost invariably recruited to give the first-year course intended to persuade students to become math majors. And he offered extracurricular content, like a campus tour titled “How to Stare at a Brick Wall.”
He gave over his summers — prime research time — to teaching at math camps. He was a star attraction, despite the fact that his talks were advertised vaguely as “John Conway Hour, NTBA” (Not to Be Announced). He would take topic requests from students and deliver an extemporaneous lecture.
Math, Conway believed, should be fun. “He often thought that the math we were teaching was too serious,” said Mira Bernstein, a mathematician and a former executive director of Canada/USA Mathcamp, an international summer program for high-school students. “And he didn’t mean that we should be teaching them silly math — to him, fun was deep. But he wanted to make sure that the playfulness was always, always there.”
Conway persevered in finding the fun through triple bypass surgery, a suicide attempt and a number of strokes. Sometimes he would regale anyone willing to listen on the science of rainbows or on his Doomsday rule for calculating the day of the week for any given date.
And there were ever more games of Phutball, which Conway was not very good at. Sometimes, when all seemed lost — when he was almost certainly beaten at his own game, though he might yet magically prevail — he’d delight in borrowing from Mark Twain, admonishing his opponents, “Reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated!”

WASHINGTON — An outbreak of coronavirus infections at an upscale Whole Foods in the heart of the nation’s capital has focused attention on the plight of grocery store workers deemed essential to stay on the job during the pandemic but increasingly falling ill to its ravages.
The Whole Foods near Washington’s trendy Logan Circle told employees on Wednesday that a worker had contracted the virus, one of at least six, but that the store would not close, according to a report by WUSA, a local CBS-affiliated station. Instead, managers would order a deep cleaning with workers staying on the job, according to an email sent to employees that was obtained by the station.
Workers were free to take leave without penalty through the end of April, the email said, but it would be unpaid.
An employee at the store, who declined to be identified, passed a note to a New York Times photographer there on Tuesday stating that 16 employees at the location were confirmed to be infected, a significant outbreak in a city that has so far escaped the horrors of New York, Detroit and New Orleans.
In an email, a spokesman for Whole Foods confirmed that the store had “multiple team members” with diagnoses of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, but that the site had “undergone multiple deep cleanings and disinfections” overnight in recent days that allowed it to remain open during regular business hours.
Another Whole Foods location in Washington’s Foggy Bottom neighborhood was previously closed to the public for cleaning after a worker tested positive for the virus, but the company’s spokesman said the closure was warranted only because overnight cleaning was not available.
Such problems are not isolated. The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which represents over 900,000 grocery workers nationwide, estimated on Monday that 30 of its members had died from COVID-19 and another 3,000 had taken sick days after showing signs of illness or other possible coronavirus-related complications. The union also said that in a survey of 5,000 of its members, 85% said customers in their stores were not practicing social distancing as recommended.
Though Washington has not had the dramas of other cities, it is considered an emerging hot spot, with nearly 2,200 infections and 72 deaths. Its rate of infection, measured against the district’s small population, is above average compared with the states.
The city has required essential businesses to take a variety of steps to enforce social distancing, sending food retailers rushing to install trappings like hand sanitizer stations, plexiglass barriers between workers and customers, and floor stickers marking the government-recommended six-foot separation distance.
However, the protocols largely leave it to stores themselves to enforce other guidelines such as the requirement that patrons wear masks while shopping. More serious measures like closures of essential stores have also been left to management.
At another Whole Foods location in the city’s H Street corridor, foot traffic in and out of the store was funneled to a single entrance, where a guard was stationed to turn away shoppers without a mask.
Last week, officials at the daily White House task force briefing began listing Washington as one of the cities most likely to see a spike in coronavirus cases over the coming weeks, alongside Baltimore and Philadelphia.
As cases have increased, local officials have been forced to balance efforts to enforce public health initiatives with the need to ensure access to groceries.
On April 8, Mayor Muriel E. Bowser issued an order effectively shutting down farmers markets and seafood vendors in the city until they can submit individual social distancing plans and receive approval from the government. On Wednesday, Bowser issued another order requiring all workers and customers of food sellers to wear masks and extending the city’s state of emergency through May 15.
Earlier this month, a Trader Joe’s store in Washington temporarily closed for cleaning after an employee tested positive. The retailer lists at least 18 future closings at other locations around the country on a running list on its website.
A spokeswoman for the Washington’s Health Department said essential businesses were not legally required to make a public disclosure about whether employees had tested positive for the virus. But according to protocols, retailers that do not comply with the mayor’s order could face civil penalties and license revocations.
The danger associated with working in grocery stores that see hundreds of shoppers each day has led to protests from workers involved in getting groceries to consumers. Last month, employees of Whole Foods and workers who fulfill orders for the grocery delivery service Instacart organized strikes over what they described as hazardous working conditions and insufficient protections.
Marc Perrone, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, said many workers have been forced to make do with limited protective gear as masks and other personal protective equipment, or PPE, have been diverted to medical workers and others dealing directly with people who are already symptomatic or known to be exposed to the virus.
“Masks and PPE ultimately went to first responders first, and then highest bidders,” Perrone said. “Some of our employers that we deal with lost shipments that were sent to other countries.”
But Perrone stressed that grocery store workers still come into contact with scores of shoppers on a daily basis, many of whom may be asymptomatic carriers.
Whole Foods employees are not represented by the union, but a coalition of employees who staged a “sickout” to protest working conditions in March have planned another protest on May 1, according to The Guardian.
The dilemma facing grocery stores comes amid a larger debate between policymakers and public health experts about how quickly to relax social distancing guidelines in the interest of spurring economic activity.
On Tuesday, Rep. Trey Hollingsworth, R-Ind., joined other lawmakers calling for a return to more normalcy, telling an Indianapolis radio station that deciding between continuing the stay-at-home orders and getting people back to school and work would be up to Congress.
“It is not zero evil, but it is the lesser of these evils and we intend to move forward in that direction,” he said. “That is our responsibility, and to abdicate that is to insult the Americans that voted us into office.”

Relying on Science and Politics, Merkel Offers a Cautious Virus Reentry Plan [With graphic(s)]

BERLIN — Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday set in motion a plan for Germany to begin lifting social and economic restrictions in place because of the coronavirus, even as she warned that the road ahead would look less like a return to normal than a way to live with a pandemic that has overturned ordinary life.
The chancellor, a physicist by training, was typically restrained and focused on the science as she announced the government’s cautious step-by-step plan, for which she had won the agreement of regional leaders in Germany’s diffuse federal system.
Shorn of any bravado, her announcement seemed again to make Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, a de facto leader on the Continent and something of an example for Western nations looking to navigate the tricky course of rebooting economic activity and fighting the virus.
Her approach stood in stark contrast to the fraught political divisions in the United States, where state authorities have often been at odds with President Donald Trump, who has made forceful but erratic predictions about the virus.
“We have achieved something,” Merkel said at a news conference, “something that by no means was a given at the start — namely that our doctors and carers, all those in the medical field, in the hospitals, were not overwhelmed.”
But she added: “What we’ve achieved is an interim success — no more, no less. And I stress that it is a fragile interim success.”
An economic lockdown will remain largely in place for an additional 20 days, Merkel cautioned, and strict social distancing rules will remain in force.
But some shops will be allowed to reopen beginning next week — although only those with the necessary protections in place to allow strict social distancing to continue, she said.
Older students might be allowed back to school in May but that will be contingent on a radically changed set-up involving small groups, face masks and social distancing rules for school buses.
Every two weeks the government will take stock of infection numbers, Merkel said, to evaluate in real time the impact of each incremental measure that is lifted — and to avoid the danger of infections picking up pace again.
“We can’t have a wrong-headed push forward, even when the best intentions are behind it,” Merkel said. “We need to understand that we need to live with this virus as long as there is no vaccine and no treatment.”
Germany was hit hard by the pandemic but reacted quickly and decisively in trying to slow the spread of the virus.
A month ago, when the number of deaths stood at 90, Merkel’s government imposed strict social distancing rules that banned groups of more than two people of different households from gathering, and that shut down much of the economy.
By Wednesday, the number of infections in Germany stood at 136,616, the third-highest toll in Europe, after Spain and Italy. But the number of new daily infections has tapered off and the number of deaths, now at 3,428, has remained low compared with other countries.
Germany’s strategy of early and widespread testing and its large number of intensive care beds help explain the country’s relatively low mortality rate, but the trust in Merkel’s leadership and the resulting compliance with government measures has contributed too, virologists say.
As in previous stages of the pandemic, Merkel consulted widely before she made her announcement Wednesday. She had studied the recommendations from a panel of 26 top academics from a range of fields including behavioral psychology and ethics, and then hammered out an agreement with the governors of Germany’s 16 states.
Highlighting this broad consensus, the chancellor was flanked at her hourlong news conference not just by her finance minister, but also by the governor of Bavaria and the mayor of Hamburg.
“Germany has a collective philosophy, and the debates of recent days have ended up in a good result,” said Markus Söder, the Bavarian governor, who has not been shy to criticize Merkel in the past. “All states are completely united with the federal government on the strategy and the strategy is caution.”
In a week where several smaller countries in Europe have begun loosening restrictions, many had been eagerly waiting for Germany to come forward with a plan to emerge from the economic lockdown.
Merkel’s announcement came as the German government issued a bleak assessment of the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the economy, saying the country was headed for a steep recession and a surge in joblessness.
Among the first shops allowed to reopen are bookstores, bike stores and car dealers. But they all have to ensure that the number of customers inside is limited while also avoiding long lines from forming outside.
All schools will stay closed for another three weeks and primary schools and nurseries for longer, the chancellor said. Effective immediately, the German government is also “urgently” recommending the use of face masks in enclosed public spaces like shops and public transport, but stopped short of making masks mandatory as they are in neighboring Austria.
Restaurants and bars will have to wait longer, and large events like soccer matches remain banned until Aug. 31. Religious services won’t resume until places of worship have put in place measures to ensure the required distance between worshippers.
During Wednesday’s news conference, the chancellor thanked citizens for obeying strict social distancing rules and living with so many restrictions, stressing that Germany’s relative success in combating the virus was because of their cooperation.
“The curve has become flatter,” Merkel said, referring to the number of new daily infections.
But she cautioned against a false sense of security, saying the achievements could quickly be reversed.
“We don’t have much leeway,” she said.
“If we now allow more public life, in small steps, then it is very important that we can trace infection chains even better,” she said. “That must be our aim: to trace every infection chain.”
To that end, she said, Germany’s testing capacities would be increased. The country is currently capable of testing 100,000 people a day, more than any other country in Europe.
Earlier Wednesday, the European Commission presented a road map for countries in the 27-country bloc planning their own exit strategies. Chief among its recommendations is a German-style testing regime that allows for the tracing and quarantining of those who are sick while also slowly allowing those who are not to go back to some activities.
The chancellor went into detailed explanations of the science behind her own plan.
A key variable the government was looking at, she said, is the so-called reproduction factor of the virus — the number of people an infected person passes the virus on to.
That factor currently stands at about 1, she said, meaning that one person gets infected by every newly infected person. If that factor rose even to 1.1, the German health care system would reach capacity by October, she said.
If it were allowed to rise to 1.2 — so out of five infected people one infects not one but two additional people — that limit is reached by July.
“With 1.3,” Merkel continued, “we have reached the limit of our health care system by June.”
“So you can see how small our leeway is,” she said, “the entire development rests on having a number of infections that we can keep track of and trace.”

At its most luxurious, the home office is a subsidiary of leisure space: a sun-drenched room in a second home from which the boss can check in on everyone back at the office. In its more utilitarian form, it is, at least, personalized and private. There’s a chair, a desk and, ideally, a door. There’s probably other stuff in there too, like filing cabinets and unseasonal clothes and a guest bed. But it’s a place to work.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 29% of wage and salary workers could work at home in some capacity in 2017, while 25% actually did so. Now, however, workers with home offices are spending more time in them than ever intended. Plenty more are simply working from home however and wherever possible: at the table; at the counter; in bed; on the couch; in the garage.
Most workplaces aren’t ready for this. Most living spaces aren’t either. Yet millions of us have been sent home and may be there for a while. Perhaps you are one of them.
Whether you are working, avoiding work, balancing work with care for others or looking for work, chances are your temporary office is neither an optimized nor particularly happy place right now. I have no tips for optimizing it, in the aspirational work-from-home, escape-the-office sense.
Let’s lower our expectations. Here are a few ways to make working from home less miserable, according to experts.
Focus on Posture
Karen Loesing, a certified ergonomics assessment specialist, helps people design their workspaces for maximum comfort and productivity. She can tell you what to buy and how to set it up.
But right now you may not want, or be able, to buy new things. According to Loesing, much of the standard equipment on the market leaves something to be desired anyway. “The average desk for years has been at around 29 inches, and that fits hardly anybody in a correct posture,” she said. (Most people end up with a desk surface that’s too high.)
Wherever you’re able to sit, there are some basic principles to keep in mind, Loesing said. Your hands should be on your keyboard, with your forearms basically flat and elbows bent at a right angle. Your back should be supported (“If you’re not sitting at the back of the chair for support, it’s like you’re holding a weight all day long,” she said) and slightly reclined — around 15 degrees from straight. Your feet should be resting on the ground, with your knees bent as close to 90 degrees as possible.
This may not be easy at the kitchen table in a wooden chair, so do what you can with pillows, boxes, plastic storage containers or books. “Don’t sit on a stabilization ball,” Loesing said. “Those are for gyms.”
Then there’s your screen. “Your whole entire posture is going to be related to where your monitor is,” Loesing said. If your monitor is too low, you’ll slump forward and, sooner or later, be in pain. “If you’re looking straight ahead, you want to be about 4 inches below the top of screen,” she said.
To achieve this setup, place your laptop on a stack of books and connect a keyboard, which should sit on your work surface. (External keyboards are still widely available and affordable if you must order one.)
If your work involves papers, note that commercial document holders are intended to sit between your keyboard and screen. You can use a clipboard or a thin book leaned against the bottom of an external monitor to create this effect. (If you have access to an external display — and don’t discount using your television for this, whether over Wi-Fi, with a feature like Apple AirPlay, or by using a cable — you can turn your laptop’s screen into a document holder.)
Loesing said that many of her clients are enthusiastic about switching to standing desks. “They’ve read all this material about how sitting is the new smoking,” she said. “They’re excited. It’s a novelty.”
Do it if you want — the same guidelines for your monitor and arms apply, although you should be careful when stacking boxes to get your laptop 5 or 6 feet off the ground — but don’t expect to stand all day. Maybe 20% or 30% of the time, Loesing said. Try not to lock your knees. Throw a book on the floor to lift up one foot at a time — this can help ward off discomfort and keep you aware of your posture.
You may be surprised at how quickly standing in place becomes uncomfortable. Walking for hours may feel fine; the discomfort of standing in place, even for much shorter times, can sneak up on you.
When your workspace stops feeling good, the best thing you can do, Loesing said, is move around. Take breaks. Sit somewhere else for a few minutes. Look out the window frequently, and remind yourself that this won’t go on forever.
Create Boundaries
Real offices are designed according to all sorts of theories and principles: correct values for density, plans for lighting and acoustics, flow. The emergency home office, in contrast, was most likely designed for something else: eating, sleeping or storage.
George Evageliou, president of Urban Homecraft, a custom furniture company, suggests taking a moment to visualize the office you want, even if it’s out of reach. “Look for the ideal, understanding that you’re not going to get it,” said Evageliou, who is currently locked down in a 250-square-foot studio apartment. “Whatever you get is going to be better for it.”
This exercise, in the moment, may feel extreme. Ideal: an office with a door, a space to work, a clearer line between the stresses of home and the stresses related to work. Improved reality: a table in a kitchen or living room, cleared off, where nothing can happen but work.
If space is your problem, that’s fine. “Try to create delineations within a room,” Evageliou said. (He spoke to me from a desk installed underneath a lofted bed.) A clear workspace of any sort — a few square feet surrounded by an invisible fence — can help maintain mental boundaries, too.
Knowing that you’re not redesigning your home, or signing up to do this forever, can recast otherwise less-than-appealing prospects as reasonable concessions to a need for privacy, space and emotional separation. “A closet is an ideal place for a desk,” Evageliou said. Yes, it’s a closet. But it’s also, he said, “a great spot to eliminate distractions and focus.”
Having a truly separate space in which to work, no matter how small, can pay off in other ways. “It makes it much more pleasurable to return to the dinner table, or to sit down on the couch and watch TV,” Evageliou said. Maybe most of your home has become a borderless, chaotic work/child care/storage/food preparation zone. A tiny quadrant for thinking and dealing with the outside world will help.
So can its inverse: Pick a truly work-free space, even if it’s just your bed, and keep it sacred.
There may be no space to put to work, or to make sacred against it, in your suddenly more crowded home. Take your dog — or yourself — on a socially distanced walk around a city or suburb in lockdown and you may witness another way in which a need for space, privacy and silence has superseded the aspirational “work from home” ideals of just a few weeks ago.
Ideal: a space of your own to figure out the confusing and terrifying scenario that is confronting everyone in different ways, separate from the rest of your home, maybe with comfortable seating, silence and good lighting. Reality: people on their phones and computers, or with pens in hand and stacks of papers beside them, sitting in the passenger seats of parked cars. You’re not driving anywhere. Why not enjoy, if only for a few minutes, an office with a door, and a view?

March was shaping up to be a good month for Brian Bowen Smith, a photographer in Los Angeles who has worked for Vogue and GQ. He had five big jobs lined up, including shoots for two Netflix posters. All five were canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic.
“There is no work whatsoever,” he said. “It’s kind of scary, actually.”
To fill his newly free hours, Bowen Smith drove to Joshua Tree National Park and trained his camera on the barren landscape. It was a long way from the work that usually pays his bills. In recent years, when he is not photographing Christian Bale, Miley Cyrus and Issa Rae for major magazines, Bowen Smith has shot ad campaigns for Marc Jacobs and other fashion companies.
Now he is telling himself that everything will be OK. “A lot of stuff can be done remotely,” he said. “And maybe that’s going to be our future. Everyone wears masks.”
As practitioners of a craft that requires long hours of getting up close and personal with their subjects, photographers have been affected by social distancing restrictions perhaps more than other media workers.
“Photographers can’t do what reporters can do — they can’t be on the phone,” said María Salazar Ferro, emergencies director of the Committee to Protect Journalists. “They have to be very close to the action.”
Josh Ritchie, a freelance photographer in Florida, estimated that he lost $10,000 in recent weeks because of canceled assignments. To scrounge up money, his attorney has been scouring the web for illegal use of his images.
“At night, I’m binge-watching ‘Tiger King’ and having mini panic attacks,” Ritchie said.
Some photojournalists, like Gary He, have gone in search of images particular to a unique moment. One of He’s photographs, taken last month for the food website Eater, captured an unsettling scene that would have been unremarkable before the spread of the virus: Dozens of people, including delivery workers, crowded on a Manhattan sidewalk as they awaited pickup orders from the restaurant Carbone.
“I did a lot more shooting from across the street than I normally would have,” He said in a text message. And that meant a change in gear. “I use a midrange zoom for most of my work,” he added, “and I’ve been using the longer end of the lens a little bit more these days, to get me a few feet further away from my subjects, mostly for their safety and comfort.”
For an Eater shoot last week focused on New York City restaurant workers, He moved in close, wearing a mask, to take intimate portraits.
Some photographers have come down with the virus. Mark Kauzlarich, a freelance photojournalist and commercial photographer whose work has appeared in The New York Times, The Atlantic and Vanity Fair, said he got very sick last month. Doctors told him it was COVID-19, although he was not tested.
“I had said very openly I was sure I was going to get sick,” he said. “We have to be in the field. There’s no way to completely mitigate.”
Kauzlarich, who is on the mend, sounded as if he would not change his approach. “To be a good journalist,” he said, “you can’t be 40 feet away.”
Anthony Causi, a staff sports photographer for The New York Post, died of COVID-19, the paper announced Sunday. A spokeswoman said The Post did not know how Causi had contracted the disease.
The pandemic may be the biggest news story of a generation and, while taking precautions, many editors have sought to get images that show it. On March 10, Radhika Jones, the editor-in-chief of Vanity Fair, commissioned Alex Majoli to photograph his hard-hit home country, Italy. Vanity Fair published his photo essay on Sicily two weeks later.
Jones said that Majoli’s experience, which has included stints in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq, made her confident that he would take care of himself.
“There is something that is so powerful about an image,” Jones said. “It doesn’t require translation. We made these pictures in Italy, and in certain ways they’re specific to that experience and even specific to this photographer as an Italian. But they’re also about humanity, and they are universal.”
Caitlin Ochs, a freelance photojournalist in Brooklyn, captured images of daily life in the borough amid the outbreak for a Reuters project. Before another assignment, for The Wall Street Journal, an editor at the paper provided her with a Ziploc bag containing N95 masks, gloves and hand sanitizer.
Her daily disinfecting routine, informed by an emergency room nurse whom she photographed, can take more than an hour. At the end of a day’s work, she puts on new gloves and wipes down her equipment — cameras, lenses, lens caps, cables — with a 70% isopropyl alcohol solution. She also sprays the floor, light switches and faucets with a bleach solution. Before she showers, she stuffs her clothes into a garbage bag to wash later.
“Sometimes all this feels crazy, like I’m turning into a hypochondriac,” Ochs said in an email. “But I’m trying to work from the side of being overly cautious.”
Compounding the challenge is the fact that staff jobs for photographers are hard to come by, and many work freelance. The Juntos Photo Coop, made up of four photojournalists in Arizona, published an open letter arguing that the coronavirus crisis had exposed inequitable working conditions for freelance photographers. The group demanded that media organizations provide photographers with protective gear, mental health check-ins and emergency health insurance.
“We’re finding out that the most vulnerable people in our industry are the ones without health insurance, who can’t pay rent, who can’t afford to quarantine,” said Caitlin O’Hara, a Coop member. “We’re going to lose all these diverse voices in our industry if only the people who can afford to quarantine can keep working.”
Despite the hazards, many photojournalists are driven by a need to record what the world looks like at a dramatic time.
“This kind of story is why we all became journalists, no?” said He, the photojournalist. “The pandemic is historic and, especially because of the social distancing, with everyone indoors, there’s a real need for trained storytellers to inform readers about what’s really going on out there.”
He added, “I’d do the work for free if I had to.”

Sherri Denney was in the fourth day of quarantine in her home in Springboro, Ohio, when she thought about the toll the coronavirus was taking. She sat in her recliner chair and cried as the state’s governor checked off the number of dead and sickened, knowing there would be more the next day. Overwhelmed, Denney, 55, tried to put her feelings into words.
“Wow,” she began writing on an old sketch pad, quickly realizing the precise words would not come easy. “That’s all I can say. My emotions are ranging from sadness to fear to anger.”
The week before, a woman in Nevada turned to her own version of journaling. Mimi J. Premo recorded a video on her cellphone, giving voice to a kind of stunned weariness so many Americans are feeling. And in Indianapolis, in an interview recorded by two university research assistants, a man who is diabetic and HIV positive talked about how the speed and unclear ways of transmission “freaks me out.”
The three accounts, snapshots of intimate moments during the pandemic, are a response to a call from historians and archivists across the country to document this extraordinary moment in history.
Universities, archives and historical societies, ranging from the Smithsonian Natural Museum of American History to a tiny college radio station in Pennsylvania, are rushing to collect and curate the personal accounts of how people are experiencing this sprawling public health crisis as told in letters and journals, audio and video oral histories, and on social media.
They are inviting people such as Denney and Premo to share stories and material from the 2020 coronavirus and its aftermath in real time. The idea is to bridge communal history and offer a fully realized look at the outbreak that can help the public, researchers and policymakers better understand how the pandemic permeated our lives.
Whether a somber handwritten journal or an endearing Instagram post, the contributions will offer a look at a nation attacked by a virus coast to coast. The stories document sickness and death. The profound disruption of American rhythms and rituals, evidenced by empty shelves and streets. The gnawing restlessness of sheltering in place. The ways people showed resilience and managed to still find joy.
“What we as contributors record is what the future generations will remember,” said Mark Tebeau, one of the project directors of a virtual archive founded at Arizona State University.
The team of historians and artists launched A Journal of the Plague Year: An Archive of COVID-19 on March 13, two days after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a pandemic. The name was inspired by Daniel Defoe’s novel “A Journal of the Plague Year,” which chronicles the bubonic plague in 1665 London through the lens of one man.
With the help of graduate students and scholars from about 20 universities, the archive has amassed more than 1,400 entries from 500 contributors across the world, including Australia, Peru and China.
Tebeau, a public and digital historian who heads the university’s public history program, said they are also reaching out to marginalized communities to ensure the project is inclusive.
One of the first entries came from Premo, 36, a customer service representative who lives near Las Vegas. She had not left her home for nearly a week in mid-March when she submitted the video. In the clip, just over two minutes, she wonders who might be stricken with COVID-19 next. A neighbor? A friend? A family member?
“No matter how many Skype meetings I have, no matter how much I am on Facebook, no matter how much I write in my journal and try to laugh through the tears, it feels so different,” Premo said.
“Living with this uncertainty is,” she added, pausing in the video, “it’s unsettling but I feel that no matter what happens, I guess it’s hope that keeps my spirits up.”
Last week, the Library of Congress received its first COVID-19 collection: street scenes from New York, New Jersey and California by the photographer Camilo Jose Vergara. In addition to documenting stay-at-home life, mask styles, health care workers, the economic effect and how people are helping one another, the Library of Congress is also collecting web content, data and maps.
The Smithsonian National Museum of American History deployed a Rapid Response Collecting Task Force to chronicle the pandemic. “Museum staff is working to formulate a plan that achieves a balance between the urgency to document the ephemeral aspects of the historic turning points as they happen,” the museum said in a statement, “and the need to provide a long-term historical perspective.”
In response to the pandemic shutdown, StoryCorps, the story-sharing nonprofit, moved its platform online for the first time. Interviews that used to be recorded in a physical studio can now be done using video conference technology. The audio and a photo from each interview will be preserved in the StoryCorps Archive and with the Library of Congress.
And students at Neumann University in Pennsylvania set up a series called the Coronavirus Diaries on the school’s radio station, WNUW-FM. Listeners record themselves sharing pandemic stories using a voice memo app or by leaving a phone message at the station. The diaries air hourly.
Local archives are also calling for oral histories and materials. The Atlanta History Center, for example, is asking the city’s residents for digital files and physical artifacts (the latter would be collected once the center reopens). The project, called Corona Collective, lays out how seemingly mundane items — a no-frills furlough notice, a handmade banner thanking emergency medical workers — help tell the story of how daily life in Atlanta changed.
Similar efforts are cropping up in big cities and small towns. Sometime during spring break in March, Jason Kelly, a professor at the Indianapolis campus of Indiana University, realized the coronavirus was likely to be the defining event for generations. For a professor who teaches digital public history, it meant something else, too: How people experienced the outbreak needed to be captured and organized in a searchable database. That was the seed of what is now the COVID-19 Oral History Project, based at the Arts and Humanities Institute on the Indianapolis campus.
Kelly turned to the 19 graduate students in his digital public history class and asked if they would put other coursework on hold to focus on the project, which uses “rapid response collecting” for COVID-19 lived experiences. Eventually the project will merge with the larger Plague archive.
Such efforts to collect memories in real time was also used by groups after the Sept. 11 attacks, Hurricane Katrina and the Pulse nightclub massacre.
The page from Denney’s diary became one of the first submissions to the coronavirus public memory project set up by Wright State University.
“All of a sudden the pandemic was right here and personal,” said Dawne Dewey, head of special collections and archives at the university. “We put the call out because we need stories to help future generations understand this moment in history.”
The archive, partly housed on the fourth floor of the school library, includes the journals of survivors of the 1918 flu pandemic. One was written by Donald McKinney Wallace, a farmer who served in the Army.
McKinney was sickened with the flu in the fall of 1918. He was quarantined in barracks, separated from others by blankets hung from a wire. He wrote about the daily meal of soft boiled eggs and cold toast, feeling weak, a stubborn fever, isolation and the deaths of fellow soldiers — an account that could have been written today.
“A century ago, people told their stories in written journals,” said Dewey. “Now, we are capturing people’s thoughts and experiences through social media posts, email, audio and photographs.”

For the Foreseeable Future, U.K. Parliament May Meet in Cyberspace [With graphic(s)]

LONDON — In 1858, during what became known as the Great Stink, work was curtailed by an overpowering smell of sewage from the adjacent River Thames. During World War II, the threat from German bombers forced evacuation to a nearby building.
Now, the British Parliament is embarking on another temporary retreat from its centuries-old home, this time into cyberspace.
After an absence of several weeks, lawmakers are anxious to return to the job of holding to account a government with sweeping emergency powers that faces criticism over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic.
Yet, few places are less suited to social distancing than a 19th century, wood-paneled debating chamber where lawmakers routinely squeeze onto overcrowded benches to secure a seat.
So a scramble is underway to make history by converting an ancient institution into a virtual one, with a decision perhaps as early as Thursday.
“It is unprecedented for Parliament not to sit in the chamber or to meet collectively in an alternative place,” said Ruth Fox, director of the Hansard Society, a research organization focused on Parliament and a co-author of a report on holding a virtual legislature.
For some, that cannot come soon enough, because many lawmakers felt sidelined as the hospitalization of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who contracted the virus, left a power vacuum at the heart of the British government. Now convalescing at the prime minister’s country residence, Chequers, Johnson has deputized his functions to the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab.
Ministers also hold daily news conferences, while lawmakers have few similar opportunities to raise the concerns they might have about shortages of basic equipment, like face masks and body gowns, at hospitals and care homes.
“At this time of national emergency, we need a functioning Parliament to hold ministers to account on their response to the coronavirus,” said Keir Starmer, leader of the opposition Labour Party. “There are too many questions that have gone unanswered.”
Caroline Lucas, a lawmaker for the Green Party, argued that, given available technology, the only thing missing was political will. And Alastair Campbell, once a close aide to the former Prime Minister Tony Blair, posted an exhortation on Twitter to bring back Parliament, using a mild expletive to underline his impatience.
The lack of a visible parliamentary presence is all the more jarring after a period when British lawmakers grabbed global attention as they feuded over how to leave the European Union.
Parliament was such a focal point of opposition that Johnson tried to suspend sittings for five weeks during the Brexit crisis, only to be rebuked by Britain’s Supreme Court. The impasse over withdrawal from the European Union was finally broken when Johnson won a big majority in December’s general election.
But going online is not easy for an institution so steeped in tradition that casting a vote requires lawmakers to pass through a narrow lobby where their names are recorded by officials in formal dress.
Paradoxically, the job of facilitating one of the biggest revolutions in the workings of Parliament falls largely to the leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, a man whose mannerisms are so self-consciously old-fashioned that he has been nicknamed “the honorable member for the 18th century.”
Some lawmakers are queasy about the very idea of a virtual Parliament. “The House of Commons met when air raids were going on in the war,” David Davis, a former Cabinet minister, told the newspaper The Observer. “I think it needs to be reconstituted even if it means members of Parliament being tested every day.”
But that would send an odd signal to the public, given that members of Parliament come from all over the country and the government is unlikely to want to encourage travel soon, especially for large gatherings.
As for the House of Lords, the unelected second chamber, many of its members are former politicians who are at high risk because of how old they are — the average was 70 in 2019.
Already, some select committees have used technology to hold hearings virtually, proving that teleworking is possible despite unreliable Wi-Fi, background noise and the inevitable failure of some participants to mute their microphones.
Widening this out to the full chamber of the House of Commons, which has 650 members, raises more issues, however.
One possibility is to have the speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, sit in splendid isolation in the chamber, moderating proceedings via a video link.
Alternatively, Hoyle might be joined by a government minister and a political opponent, with lawmakers using a messaging system to intervene in the debate to ask questions.
“I recognize the urgent need to put new arrangements in place and will do everything I can to ensure the House is presented with the opportunity to take a decision on this matter sooner rather than later,” Hoyle said in a statement.
Lawmakers should be able to take part in Prime Minister’s Questions — the raucous weekly sessions where the head of the government answers sometimes hostile inquiries — and other matters by video link, with the proceedings streamed live, he added.
Longer-term challenges are likely to include how to manage legislation and whether to introduce digital voting. The Hansard Society report co-written by Fox notes that voting apps exist with verification options to ensure security, though she said she thought that lawmakers would be wary of any permanent changes that lessened the need to visit Parliament in person.
For the immediate future, the hope is that agreement can be reached across party lines Thursday, allowing the rules to be changed without needing a vote with at least 40 lawmakers present. If there is consensus, Fox said, it would be possible to wave a plan through.
So, if Parliament resumes next week as scheduled, it will likely be an empty, echoing, imitation of the normally boisterous chamber.
In preparation for the new digital dawn, lawmakers might want to take advice on how to look their best online from Jeremy Vine, a prominent broadcaster, who noted on Twitter that “viewers spend three seconds looking at your face, then they scour the background for something more interesting.”

The United States has responded to the economic havoc wrought by the coronavirus with the biggest relief package in its history: $2 trillion. It essentially replaces a few months of American economic activity with a flood of government money — every penny of it borrowed.
And where is all that cash coming from? Mostly out of thin air.
The traditional view of economic theory holds that governments and central banks have distinct responsibilities. A government sets fiscal policy — spending the money it raises through taxes and borrowing — to run a country. And a central bank uses various levers of monetary policy — like buying and selling government securities to change the amount of money in circulation — to ensure the smooth operation of the country’s economy.
But the relief package, called the CARES Act, will require the government to vastly expand its debt at the same time that the Federal Reserve has signaled its willingness to buy an essentially unlimited amount of government debt. With those twin moves, the United States has effectively undone decades of conventional wisdom, embedding into policy ideas that were once relegated to the fringes of economics.
“It’s an epic moment in terms of breaking down the orthodoxy of church-and-state separation of the fiscal and monetary authority,” said Paul McCulley, a former chief economist of Pimco, a giant asset management shop.
Playing out in the background of this shift is a debate over what is known as modern monetary theory, which says countries that control their own currency can run much larger budget deficits than they typically do, in part because of the power of central banks to create new money to help finance the shortfall.
But to the theory’s adherents, the lock-step maneuvers by the Fed and the government were not the arrival of a far-out idea but the removal of a fig leaf.
“What it’s doing is just making more transparent a relationship between the Treasury and the Fed that has always existed,” said Stephanie Kelton, a professor of economics at Stony Brook University and one of the theory’s major advocates.
For those not attuned to the wonky worlds of monetary policy and government debt, the parallel policy changes might have been easy to miss.
On March 23, facing a roughly 30% stock market crash and growing dysfunction in key bond markets, the Fed announced its latest, and most significant, plan to pump cash into the financial system. The central bank said it would basically buy an unlimited amount of Treasury bonds and government-backed mortgage bonds — whatever was necessary “to support smooth market functioning.”
In the world of central banking, this muted statement qualified as seriously radical. The new policy didn’t put a number on the bonds the Fed would buy, a tacit nod to the idea that it could buy unlimited amounts.
Then, within days, President Donald Trump signed a $2 trillion economic rescue package into law. That package alone equaled about half of what the federal government spent in all of 2019.
Nobody knows exactly how much the relief bill will add to the national debt; it was cobbled together so quickly that there wasn’t time for the Congressional Budget Office to carry out an analysis, though one is expected to be published this week. But the Fed will be the biggest buyer by far of the bonds the government will sell to fund this spending.
Goldman Sachs analysts estimate the Fed will buy $2.4 trillion in Treasury securities as part of its recently reintroduced bond-buying programs. Economists at Morgan Stanley put the number at around $2.5 trillion in 2020 alone, rising to as much as $3 trillion for the entirety of the bond-buying program.
But the Fed isn’t an ordinary bondholder: By law, it has to pay its profits to the Treasury.
That means when the Treasury makes payments on bonds held by the Fed — either paying interest or paying it off at maturity — almost all the money eventually moves back to the Treasury.
When a government bond is involved, the cash moves from one government pocket to another.
“Once the central bank buys them, it’s as if the Treasury never issued them in the first place,” said Kelton, who was an adviser to Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign. “For all intents and purposes, they’re retired.”
The CARES Act borrowing is, in many ways, the natural result of an evolution that began with the 2008 financial crisis. The bond-buying programs that central banks undertook around the world helped ensure low-cost financing for governments running giant deficits as policymakers contended with a deep recession and a prolonged period of lackluster growth. And despite constant, high-decibel warnings that such an approach would surely ignite a surge of inflation, it never happened.
That was a legitimate concern: Financial historians often point to disastrous periods when a central bank printed money for the government to pay its debts. A common example is Weimar Germany, when the central bank churned out bank notes that allowed the fragile government to repay onerous World War I reparations with essentially worthless marks, impoverishing most of the country in the process.
But at other times, the idea has worked just fine: Japan’s central bank has been buying huge chunks of the government’s bonds — effectively financing the central government of the world’s third-largest economy for years — without triggering the kind of inflation that traditional economic views would expect.
Adherents of MMT have long argued that the United States can — and probably should — run much larger budget deficits than it did already. In recent years, this belief has been most often associated with left-leaning politicians such as Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.
But the ideas have found broader currency in some unlikely places, such as Wall Street. In recent years, some at huge money management firms and gold-plated investment banks have increasingly turned to MMT as a useful analytical framework to understand the strong links between central banks and markets that have grown since the financial crisis.
“MMT has been invoked so many times by completely mainstream people and politicians,” said L. Randall Wray, a professor of economics at Bard College who has written seminal papers on modern monetary theory. “Even Trump used almost word for word what we’ve been saying all along.” (“You never have to default because you print the money,” Trump said as a candidate in 2016.)
Other experts counter that coordination between the Fed and the Treasury may be justified in a national crisis, but that a continuing large-scale expansion of government deficits could have negative consequences, such as higher inflation.
“I think the Treasury did the right thing. I think the Fed is doing largely the right thing,” said Glenn Hubbard, a professor of finance and economics at Columbia University. “There shouldn’t be an ongoing dance of borrowing money and printing money. This isn’t the lesson to learn from this episode.”
Even so, the growing comfort with the Treasury Department’s relying on the Fed to buy its bonds — and help finance large deficits — is an important shift in the conventional thinking of politicians and policymakers, said McCulley, who retired from Pimco in 2015 and now teaches at Georgetown University.
“What this crisis has brought to the forefront is that this isn’t an academic debate anymore whatsoever,” he said.
McCulley said the speed with which the crisis took hold — and the unique circumstances of a nearly nationwide lockdown of consumers — meant political leaders had little choice but to vastly expand deficits. And, he said, those who usually question how deficits will be paid for have been rendered mute.
“How do we pay for it?” McCulley said. “We print the damn money.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts endorsed Joe Biden on Wednesday, becoming the most high-profile progressive woman in the party to try to help the former vice president expand his appeal among liberal voters.
Her announcement follows Sen. Bernie Sanders’ on Monday and former President Barack Obama’s on Tuesday. Warren’s support had been a foregone conclusion, but she left the timing of her announcement up to Biden’s team, according to people familiar with the matter. There was no holdup or demand for concessions, these people said.
The process of securing prominent endorsements for Biden has been underway for some time, people close to the campaign said, but some Democrats said it was important to give Sanders space to endorse on his own terms, out of respect for his campaign and his supporters, whom Biden must now win over. Obama’s endorsement made repeated overtures to Sanders and his backers.
The series of endorsements has been a carefully choreographed show of force, reminiscent of the one-two-three punch of support Biden received from Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Beto O’Rourke before Super Tuesday. It is also a show of unity designed to quash any narrative of a fractured Democratic Party.
Democrats are indeed, for once, in array, which was far from an inevitable outcome after a primary in which the party’s ideological fault lines were bitterly clear. The relatively swift arrival of two liberal challengers, Warren and Sanders, into the Biden camp is a striking reminder of the sense of urgency among Democrats to coalesce against President Donald Trump when the public’s attention is so focused on the coronavirus.
During the primary campaign, Biden criticized Warren as having an “elitist attitude” and repeatedly jabbed at Sanders for not being a card-carrying Democrat. Warren and Sanders were also sharply critical and still differ with Biden on many issues — but their endorsement announcements this week were as positive and helpful as one could hope for from ideological opponents.
Two swing-state senators, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Gary Peters of Michigan, also formally backed Biden on Wednesday, as did Valerie Jarrett, a former senior adviser to Obama.
In her endorsement video, Warren said, “In this moment of crisis, it’s more important than ever that the next president restores Americans’ faith in good, effective government.
“Joe Biden has spent nearly his entire life in public service. He knows that a government run with integrity, competence and heart will save lives and save livelihoods. And we can’t afford to let Donald Trump continue to endanger the lives and livelihoods of every American.”
Since Warren ended her own campaign, she and Biden have spoken multiple times about policy issues, including Biden’s plan to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. At the staff level, Warren’s chief campaign strategist, Joe Rospars, and Anita Dunn, a senior adviser to Biden, have been engaged in talks bridging the two camps.
In late March, Biden endorsed forgiving at least $10,000 in federal student loans and credited Warren for the proposal. Over the weekend, he said during his podcast that he supported immediately increasing Social Security payments by $200 a month, another proposal that Warren had championed.
“One thing I appreciate about Joe Biden is that he will always tell you where he stands,” Warren said in her endorsement video. “When you disagree, he’ll listen — not just listen, but really hear you and treat you with respect, no matter where you’re coming from. And he has shown throughout this campaign that when you come up with new facts or a good argument, he’s not too afraid or too proud to be persuaded.”
The Biden campaign has broadly signaled a willingness to hire staff from formal rivals as they gear up for the general election matchup with Trump, and some outreach is already underway, but there have been no promises to hire a specific number of aides, a person familiar with the matter said.
While the daily stream of endorsements this week were unmistakably designed to signal party unity, Biden has also sometimes struggled to drive a consistent message of his own amid the coronavirus outbreak. He has often been overshadowed by Trump and the governors who are on the front lines of the fight. This week, he was back in the spotlight.
“It’s a difficult news environment,” said Jennifer Palmieri, a former senior aide to Hillary Clinton and Obama. “I think it’s smart to do a dramatic show of force and have everyone go in one week, because it just serves to raise the stakes for Democrats. It raises the stakes for November.”
“You sacrifice the longevity of the storyline,” Palmieri added, “but I think you want to have the drama of everyone going in one week rather than the drumbeat.”
Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, said she was not worried about disunity. The primary “just didn’t have the vitriol” of 2016, she said, and Democratic voters are overwhelmingly in favor of a singular goal.
“They just really want Trump to be gone,” Greenberg said.
But even with the party largely united, and the leaders of its progressive and more moderate factions publicly emphasizing unity, a small but vocal segment of Sanders’ supporters have dissented.
David Sirota, a former aide to Sanders who has said he plans to vote for Biden in the general election, responded to Warren’s endorsement by suggesting that Warren should have campaigned differently when she was in the race and that perhaps if she had, she would have done what Sanders himself did not: beat Biden.
“We have to defeat Donald Trump, and these endorsements are all about that goal, so I don’t begrudge it all,” Sirota said. “I’ll never understand why Sen. Warren went silent and never amplified her long-standing criticism of Biden and his bankruptcy bill in the primary, when she was in a position to defeat the vice president. She might be the nominee had she done that.”
Biden’s campaign is hoping to use this week’s endorsements as a means to pump up his fundraising, which people involved in the campaign have said has gotten tougher in the last month as the economy has cratered.
Notably, both Obama and Warren posted a link asking for donations to Biden, and Obama quickly signed an email to the Biden campaign list.
A weaker fundraiser than his top rivals in the primary, Biden now enters the general election at a distinct financial disadvantage. Trump and the Republican National Committee have been stockpiling cash for three years and announced Monday that they had entered April with $240 million cash on hand in the president’s reelection committee and other shared party accounts.
Without traditional in-person events, Biden has had to shift to videoconference fundraisers with top donors, which some contributors have been slow to embrace. He has a virtual fundraiser scheduled for later Wednesday, hosted by Joe Kiani, chairman of Masimo, a medical device company.
Biden and his team have also turned their attention to the search for a running mate, pointing to mid-April as the time frame for assembling a search committee.
“They’ll be announcing it soon, I’m sure,” Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, one of Biden’s national campaign chairs, said in an interview this week. He said details on the committee could come as soon as “early next week.” The Biden campaign had no additional comment.
Richmond has said he expects to be involved in the search process in some capacity and has advocated for appointing a committee that reflects the diversity of the party.
Biden, who committed to choosing a woman to be his running mate, is expected to consider a number of his former presidential rivals. Warren, Klobuchar and Sen. Kamala Harris are often mentioned, along with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and other Democratic leaders.

The News Is Making People Anxious. You’ll Never Believe What They’re Reading Instead. [With graphic(s)]

Although it can be hard to see past the daily deluge of devastating headlines, there is plenty of good news in the world right now — and a great deal of interest in reading it.
Instagram accounts dedicated to good news, such as @TanksGoodNews and @GoodNews_Movement, have seen follower counts skyrocket in recent weeks. At the end of March, actor John Krasinski introduced a “news network for good news” on YouTube; within a week, Some Good News had surpassed 1.5 million subscribers and 25 million views. Google searches for “good news” spiked a month ago and have only continued to rise.
“We’ve seen an unprecedented level of growth in the past four weeks,” said Lucia Knell, the director of brand partnerships at Upworthy, who noted that the company saw a 65% growth in followers on Instagram and 47% increase in on-site page views in March, compared to the previous month.
Upworthy was founded in 2012 with a commitment to positive storytelling. At the time, Facebook’s algorithm appeared to favor inspiring, clickbaity headlines; you may recall seeing them all over your feed. But in 2013, Upworthy and other good-news sites saw page views drop considerably after Facebook adjusted its algorithm.
Major news organizations (including The New York Times) have created their own good-news properties over the years. Now, more than ever, readers are seeing a need for them.
“It’s just been an avalanche of people writing and saying how much they need these stories or they read a story and tears are just streaming down their face,” said Allison Klein, who runs the Inspired Life blog at The Washington Post. “People are constantly saying thank you for showing something that made them not feel terrible.”
Supply and Demand
David Beard, the executive editor for newsletters at National Geographic, said that the demand for good news right now is unlike anything he’s seen before. “People are looking for a reason to go on,” he said.
In response, National Geographic has created two good news-themed newsletters. One is focused on kids and families. The other is a coronavirus-free newsletter titled Your Weekly Escape. “I think of it as like a meditation app, but it’s journalism,” Beard said. Both newsletters “were a reaction to this onslaught of terrible news,” he said.
The Washington Post is also striving to meet demand. In addition to publishing stories regularly to Inspired Life, the company turned its weekly good-news newsletter, The Optimist (which Beard developed when he was on staff), into a biweekly send and created The Daily Break, which highlights one uplifting story per day.
Good news has been a boon for independent publishers, too. Lori Lakin Hutcherson, the founder and editor-in-chief of Good Black News, said that stories on her site have been spreading “like wildfire” recently.
“Just looking at shares and clicking through,” she said, “these are stories that have been about 12 times more popular than the standard.” Good Black News has always attracted a steady audience of black readers, Lakin Hutcherson said, but in the last two months she’s seen an influx of interest outside her usual demographic.
Branden Harvey, the founder of Good Good Good, said that in seeking out these stories, readers aren’t necessarily looking for an escape from the news. “More than just wanting to be distracted from COVID, they want a genuine sense of hopefulness in the response to COVID,” he said.
“It’s not that people don’t want news about the coronavirus,” Lakin Hutcherson said. “They just want news about it that’s more positive or that are showing people come together and fight this and offering ways individuals can help.”
Uplifting Memes for COVID-19
Just as Facebook boosted good news in the early 2010s, Instagram has become a place for positive storytelling to proliferate. Good news has spread on popular meme accounts over the last several weeks, and several account administrators have begun trading positive stories in a group chat.
George Resch, a fixture in the Instagram meme world known online as @Tank.Sinatra, created a good news account in 2017 after Hurricane Harvey. He publishes across platforms, including Twitter and Facebook, but he said that Instagram is where the posts perform best. “I’m seeing more growth on my page than I’ve seen since the first year,” he said.
The team behind the World Record Egg recently introduced a good-news Instagram account called @Sunny_Side_News. The account ballooned to more than 162,000 followers in a week without any promotion.
The most popular good-news accounts are focused on delivering coronavirus-related stories with a positive, productive message.
Alissa Khan-Whelan, a founder of @Sunny_Side_News, said she thinks carefully about how to frame stories to mitigate stress on readers and encourage sharing.
“We tend not to use the negative language,” she said. “The other day I could have used the word ‘death’ in the headline. I thought, Do I want someone scrolling to see the word death? Instead I used ‘lives lost.’” But good-news publishers said that news that’s framed too positively can also end up alienating readers.
“There’s a line,” said Resch. “You can’t come across as preachy and sappy.”
Fact-Checking the Content
Often, the most widely shared good-news items are baseless. National Geographic, for its part, has been vigilant about correcting the record. A story sparked by a tweet about swans returning to the Venice canals racked up hundreds of thousands of retweets but quickly fell apart under scrutiny. And when footage of an orangutan washing her hands began to spread on social media, urging viewers to “be more like Sandra,” the writer Natasha Daly informed readers that the video was real but had nothing to do with public health measures; it was filmed in November 2019.
“For these stories to really have lasting power they have to be rigorous journalism,” said Klein, of The Washington Post. “We don’t just pull a cool video or tweet off the internet.”
Nontraditional media companies like @TanksGoodNews and @Sunny_Side_News also do their part to verify stories before publishing them to Instagram.
“It’s a massive responsibility to use your platform to share news, so we always want to be very strict with our sources and ensure we fact check everything,” said Khan-Whelan.
Kristi Carter, the founder and CEO of Global Positive News Network, said her website cites only reputable sources when aggregating news. The company is also making a push into original, nonnews content, such as interviews with nonprofits and startups making change in the world. Carter plans to introduce a podcast this month, in which she will interview actresses and entrepreneurs about ways to stay positive during the pandemic.
News for the Public Good
News publishers often use metadata to keep advertising off articles about tragedy. And brands that advertise on their websites now seem to be taking a similar tack, using software to restrict their ads from appearing alongside coronavirus news, The Wall Street Journal reported.
Good news should theoretically offer a safe space for brands, but some good-news sites are feeling the crunch from advertisers, too.
“Our advertisers are pretty unsure of what’s going to happen in one month or two months, so they’re holding onto their money right now,” said Harvey of Good Good Good. “We are seeing a lot fewer brands willing to pull the trigger.”
The administrators of good-news accounts on Instagram say they have not monetized their accounts yet, despite their popularity. For some, it’s on principle.
“I haven’t made a penny,” said Michelle Figueroa, who runs @GoodNews_Movement.
“I don’t monetize,” said Mauro Gatti, the founder of @The_Happy_Broadcast. “I refuse 100% of inbound requests because I want to keep it focused on the goal of improving mental health.”
Klein said she doesn’t see the interest in good news slowing anytime soon. Across the country people are still isolated, stressed out and grieving.
“A lot of traffic on good news stories is driven by social media,” she said, “especially now when everyone’s stuck in their house. While in the past someone might have scrolled through a headline that might be a feel-good story, now they might stop and click on it.”
“There’s so many ways this pandemic is affecting people’s lives,” said Lakin Hutcherson, “but one thing we all have in common is the need for relief from it.”

BRUSSELS — President Emmanuel Macron, never very popular, has touched his highest approval ratings in France since the onset of the coronavirus. As Italy has been devastated, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has hit a remarkable 71%, up 27 points. Even in Britain, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson waffled over a strong response, then became seriously ill himself, the government is the most popular in decades.
There is nothing like a good crisis to get diverse populations to rally around their leaders. When people are confused and afraid, they tend to trust their governments because to think that authorities are themselves confused and afraid, let alone incompetent, is too much to bear.
The question is whether that will last once the crisis eases, criticism mounts and normal politics resumes. Usually, it does not last long. Formal inquiries into the inevitable errors and mistakes soon follow, and voters, if allowed, often take their revenge, even on the most effective leaders.
And it is safe to say that many of those getting a boost for the moment have been less than effective, judging by the crushing toll of a virus impervious to partisan bluster and unforgiving of mistakes.
The uncertainties may best be demonstrated in the United States, where President Donald Trump, in a highly charged election year, got only a small bump up that did not last, given widespread ambivalence about how the White House has handled the pandemic.
“The initial instinct is to rally around the flag because it is seen as unpatriotic and unhelpful not to do so,” said Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations. “But societies can’t be mobilized in perpetuity. There’s inevitably a fatigue, and people will ask more difficult questions.”
George Robertson, the former NATO secretary-general and British defense secretary, put it bluntly: “People do rally around, but it evaporates fast.”
But for now, at least, most government leaders have seen a surge in popular support as they combat a natural calamity that has wreaked havoc, even if sometimes made worse by their own inaction or miscalculation.
One might expect competent leadership to benefit more. That has been largely the case in countries, particularly in northern Europe, that imposed tough measures early that allowed them to start reopening tentatively this week.
In Austria, where returning workers are required to wear masks, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz’s approval has risen to 77%, up 33 points. Similarly, Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands has 75% support, up 30 points.
As some children return to school and her government prepares Danes for a phased reopening that could take many months, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen’s support is up 40 points, to 79%.
The virus has even managed to revive the lame-duck government in Germany, which had been shedding support to both the Greens and the far-right. Support for Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose performance has been mostly applauded both inside and outside the country, has risen 11 points, to 79%.
But even in the countries hardest hit by the virus, leaders have also gotten a boost, in ways that at first glance would not seem to make perfect sense.
Italy has the highest death toll in the world behind the United States, and the government seemed to fumble through a piecemeal response that was always a step behind the virus. But Conte has seen his overall approval rating soar.
“In a warlike situation, you want to trust who governs you, and that goes for bad leaders and competent ones,” said Nathalie Tocci, director of Italy’s Institute of International Affairs. “But my hunch is that ultimately true colors will show.”
Already there are signs that some leaders are slipping from their peaks as public patience wears thin.
In the case of Macron, who acknowledged mistakes as he announced an extension of France’s lockdown this week, polls show him back down to 43% from 59% March 13, the highest rating of his administration.
“Macron has never been much above 25%,” said Christian Lequesne, a professor of European Politics at Sciences Po, citing the yellow vest movement, union unhappiness with economic reforms and a popular perception that Macron is more a man of the banks than of the people.
“The French are beginning to focus on the frustrations, like the lack of masks and were we prepared for such a pandemic,” Lequesne said. “I’m sure when the lockdown is finished those questions will immediately be put into public debate, and it will be in the interest of opposition parties to blame the government.”
Macron’s presumed presidential opponent, Marine Le Pen of the far-right, populist National Rally, has been largely quiet in this time of national trauma, Lequesne said. “But when she speaks, she stresses the mask issue, the inability to manage the situation, and argues that we should have shut the borders completely.”
The crisis surrounding the coronavirus has produced much the same pattern as more violent conflict, when shows of support are typically immediate, if ephemeral.
In October 1979, President Jimmy Carter had a 31% approval rating. But after the siege of the U.S. Embassy in Iran, his approval hit 58% in January 1980. Carter was defeated by Ronald Reagan that November.
President George Bush’s approval rating rose from 58% in January 1991 to 87% after he drove Iraqi forces out of Kuwait. But he lost in 1992 to Bill Clinton.
President George W. Bush had a 51% approval rating in a Gallup poll just before Sept. 11. By the end of the month, his approval rating hit 90%. He narrowly won reelection three years later.
Trump’s smaller-than-expected bump, given the coronavirus, has made him something of an outlier. While other world leaders are reaching highs in the 70% range, his approval ratings hover between 40% and 45%, reflecting his strong base but also widespread criticism of his performance.
One “positive” result of the virus, Tocci said, may be the discrediting of populism and a return to trust in expertise and more rational government.
“The whole nationalist populist surge was connected to an historical moment where you could afford to play with fire,” she noted. “But now the situation is really bad, so much more dangerous, and people don’t want the easy nonsense from media-savvy populists.”
She cited polls showing that Matteo Salvini, the noisy Italian populist, has been losing support on the right, while another far-right opposition politician, Giorgia Meloni, “on the rational, coolheaded, nonpopulist right,” has done better.
Much of the public reaction may ultimately depend on how long the sense of crisis lasts, the onslaught of the virus being uncertain and open-ended. The unlocking of the lockdown will itself be fraught with political danger.
“Though we see these leaders making decisions, they’re not making them from a position of strength but from uncertainty and weakness,” said Nicholas Dungan, a Paris-based senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.
“They’re not leading so much as administering,” he said. “And once people are out and about and not confined anymore doing their duty, people are going to be quite angry, and this will lead to greater instability.”
Tony Travers, professor of government at the London School of Economics, noted that Winston Churchill was revered for having presided over the victory over Adolf Hitler but was summarily tossed out of office in 1945.
“Winning a war is absolutely no recipe for staying in office,” Travers said. “When the threat of illness goes away, then the consequences of being protected from the threat are very different.”
Governments will have to decide how to stagger a return to relative normality and how to deal with the emotional issues of inequality, unemployment and debt that will surge to the fore of the political debate.
“When we come out of this, the reckoning will start,” said Robin Niblett, director of the British foreign policy research institute Chatham House. “When people realize the expense, there will be questions of who gets taxed, how much the state owns and how much will people chafe against the controls,” he said.
Much remains unclear across the world, but “there is the potential for some serious political wind shears,” Niblett said. “Leaders are going to have a very rocky time toward autumn as the bills get delivered.”

MOSCOW — In a remote alpine meadow in Kyrgyzstan a few years ago, a teenage boy killed and skinned a marmot. Five days later, his parents carried the sweating, delirious boy to a village hospital where he died of bubonic plague.
Like a ghost from the medieval past, the plague still makes occasional, unwelcome appearances in remote regions of the former Soviet Union, where it survives today in wild rodents.
Over the centuries, with improved public hygiene, the plague declined as a threat. Today, as a bacterial infection, it is treatable with antibiotics, if caught in time.
But the plague was still a lethal menace in the 1920s and also an embarrassment for the Soviet Union, which established a specialized state agency to track and contain it.
Successors to that agency still exist in Russia and in half a dozen other countries that were once Soviet republics, and, with their ready quarantine plans and trained personnel, they have become a mainstay of the regional response to the coronavirus.
It is too early to tell if the former Soviet antiplague centers, as the sites were called, have made any difference in the coronavirus outbreak, which so far has infected more than 21,000 Russians, killing 170.
At most, the legacy Soviet system helped delay the spread, and it is just one data point in assessing why the coronavirus moved more slowly in Russia, Ukraine and other former Soviet countries than in Western Europe and the United States. Luck, border closures or officials covering up the true numbers of deaths could also explain the low numbers.
Infections are in any case now shooting up, and those countries seem to be headed the way of the rest of the world toward bulging hospitals and morgues. But employees of the antiplague centers say their early work helped, becoming a silver lining to the region’s long-lingering plague problem.
“Of course, it helped” early on, said Ravshan Maimulov, director of a regional antiplague service in Kyrgyzstan who examined the teenage plague victim when he died in 2013. He used the same quarantine plan that he had instituted after the boy’s death to respond to the coronavirus in March.
When the 15-year-old had arrived at the village hospital, “the body was still damp from sweat and I felt swelling under the armpits and chin,” Maimulov said. But the boy was too far gone to save, and he died within hours.
Maimulov, 57, trained at a Russian antiplague institute called Microbe. After the boy’s death, he had the authority to immediately put in motion plans for a lockdown, even though at that point they had only a partial diagnosis.
He relayed the news to a regional governor in code — they would need to implement “Formula 100” — lest word leak and inhabitants of the village, Ichke-Zhergez, should try to flee before the door slammed shut.
“We needed to prevent them all from running away,” he said.
By the next morning, police checkpoints were in place and the village was sealed.
On his recommendation, authorities in the surrounding Issyk-Kul region used the same approach in March in introducing coronavirus lockdowns.
“We worked under the operative plan for the plague,” Maimulov said in a telephone interview.
The region of about half a million people has reported three coronavirus cases, he said. Kyrgyzstan has reported five deaths.
Russia maintains 13 antiplague centers, from the Far East to the Caucasus Mountains, five plague research institutes and multiple field stations. In March, the authorities moved new laboratory equipment into the antiplague center in Moscow to expand its ability to test for coronavirus.
The Microbe institute, originally dedicated wholly to bubonic plague but later expanded to tackle other infections such as cholera, yellow fever, anthrax and tularemia, models the spread of the coronavirus.
Starting in January, directors of antiplague centers in the Eurasian Economic Union, the Moscow-led trade alliance of Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Russia, held conference calls about the coronavirus. And a plague institute in Odessa, Ukraine, is among agencies responding to the coronavirus there, officials said.
“The very fact that Russia and the other former Soviet states are, exactly, former Soviet states means a common legacy,” in health care, said Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center. A legacy of focus on epidemics helped, he said. Soviet health care had haphazard success at treating individuals but “could respond like the military to epidemics,” he noted.
Other analysts of former Soviet medical services say that, in the longer term, the Soviet legacy will prove no gift. The capacity to counter epidemics had degraded while little was done to improve an ability to treat patients, according to Yevgeny S. Gontmakher, a professor at the Higher School of Economics and an authority on Russian health care.
“The plague doctors were the elite of a hundred years ago, not today,” he said.
In Kyrgyzstan, Maimulov works in a wooden laboratory in what had been, until a few weeks ago, the medical backwater of plague control. Most years, he plans for campaigns of spraying insecticide into rodent burrows, to kill fleas and slow the spread in animals.
The disease cannot be fully stamped out.
“They are rodents; they reproduce quickly,” he said. “It’s not worthwhile to kill them.”
The family of the 15-year-old boy were herding sheep in the mountains and trapping marmots for fur as a sideline. The boy skinned the marmot with a razor blade. Although the Black Death typically spreads by flea bite, in this instance the boy caught it simply by nicking his finger.
Eventually, 32 villages were put under quarantine while about 700 nurses went door to door looking for infection. Marmot hides were collected and burned. But the antiplague team had acted quickly enough. The boy was the only confirmed case.

Macron Vows to Rebuild Notre Dame by 2024, Despite Virus and Other Blows [With graphic(s)]

PARIS — On the evening of April 15, 2019, the world watched Notre Dame burn.
Confused tourists pointed their smartphones as smoke billowed out of the cathedral’s rooftop. Horrified Parisians watched from the banks of the Seine as flames tore through the centuries-old attic, sending the spire crashing into the vaults below. President Emmanuel Macron, beamed to television sets around the world, vowed to rebuild by 2024, when Paris will host the Summer Olympic Games.
But one year later, all the tourists are gone, and the streets are empty. Parisians are confined to their homes, as Macron tries to prevent the coronavirus pandemic from overwhelming France’s hospitals and tanking its economy.
The world’s attention is elsewhere.
“Our days, our thoughts, our lives today are monopolized by this terrible crisis that we are going through,” Macron, referring to the COVID-19 outbreak, said in a short video published on social media as he thanked “those who yesterday saved” the Cathedral of Notre Dame and “those who today are rebuilding it.”
All the tributes initially planned for Wednesday to mark the anniversary were scrapped. They included a reception at the Élysée Palace to honor the workers tending to Notre Dame; an official ceremony with the cathedral choir; and a performance of a musical about Notre Dame in front of City Hall.
The construction site itself was shut down last month when France went into lockdown, just as workers were about to start delicately removing thousands of scaffolding tubes, twisted and charred by the fire, that still cling on top of the cathedral.
But Gen. Jean-Louis Georgelin, a former army chief of staff named by Macron to head the Notre Dame renovation task force, said that despite the pandemic, the “emotional intensity” of the fire “has not died down.”
“Interest in this construction project has not waned,” he said.
The cathedral, where 13 million visitors used to crowd each year, is still closed to the public, and there have been only two religious ceremonies inside since the fire, including one last week for Good Friday.
“France is now facing two enormous challenges,” Georgelin said, “rebuilding the cathedral, which in a way is France’s soul,” and confronting a “gigantic sanitary, economic and social crisis.”
Still, the virus and its human toll — over 17,000 people have died in France so far — overshadowed commemorations for a fire that killed no one and left most of the cathedral still standing.
Monsignor Benoist de Sinety, the Paris archdiocese vicar general, told Le Figaro last week that after the fire, “We didn’t hesitate to talk about a catastrophe, or a tragedy.
“What do those words weigh today?” said de Sinety, who represents the archdiocese on the Notre Dame task force’s board. “It would be a mistake to showcase a monument and a construction project, as important as they may be, when the emergency is now human and social.”
No one denies the differences between the two events. But some see similarities.
“The question we could ask the good Lord is: Why?” said Monsignor Patrick Chauvet, Notre Dame’s rector. “That is the question I was asking when I was on the plaza one year ago; that is the question I ask yet again today.”
He added, “This first anniversary, at the height of the pandemic, maybe also signals to the world that this 850-year-old injured lady is close to all those who are injured.”
To drive that message home, one tribute did take place Wednesday. Notre Dame’s biggest bell — dating from 1683 and made of 13 tons of bronze — rang out at 8 p.m. to “unite” with the thousands of people around France who cheer and clap from their windows every evening to support health workers, Georgelin said.
A 200-foot crane still towers above the cathedral, a looming reminder of the work that lies ahead after a string of setbacks.
Workers rushed to shore up the building after the fire, which investigators still believe was accidental, caused perhaps by discarded cigarettes or an electrical short-circuit. The vault is punctured by three gaping holes, and the flying buttresses are propped up by giant wooden blocks. A hundred or so sensors monitor Notre Dame’s every movement.
But construction was halted for weeks last summer because of concerns over lead contamination from the damaged roof and spire. Work picked up again at a much slower pace, with stringent decontamination protocols for the 80 or so workers, who must wear protective gear and shower upon every entry and exit.
Then, bad fall and winter weather — especially strong winds — delayed the schedule even further.
Macron said Wednesday that Notre Dame’s restoration was a “symbol of our people’s resilience, of its ability to overcome hardships” and that “we will do everything” to stick to the 2024 goal.
Critics say that is increasingly unrealistic.
“I do not believe in it for a minute,” Emmanuel Grégoire, the deputy mayor of Paris, said of the deadline, telling Le Monde this week that legal or public procurement challenges could also delay the project.
But officials like Georgelin insist that 2024 is an “extremely mobilizing” goal, pointing out that it is a deadline to reopen the cathedral for religious services, not to finish the renovation completely.
“Obviously, everything won’t be done, but the inside will,” Georgelin said, adding that he expected a two-month delay from the lockdown.
“Two months out of 60 doesn’t justify throwing in the towel and saying that the schedule won’t hold,” he said.
Once the old scaffolding is removed, workers will be able to ascertain the state of the vaults, which are still covered in charred wood and metal, giving architects a better sense of Notre Dame’s overall sturdiness.
Actual renovation work — and final decisions on how to rebuild the roof and spire — aren’t expected before 2021. But city authorities say the plaza in front of the cathedral and the crypt underneath it will reopen much sooner, as lead decontamination efforts were just ending when the lockdown started.
Money has not been as much of an issue as time. About 340,000 donors pledged nearly $1 billion after the fire. Only about $200 million have been cashed in so far, but most donations are legally binding.
When billionaires whipped out their checkbooks last year for Notre Dame — right after months of yellow vest turmoil — it created an intense debate in France about wealth inequality. Some of that debate has played out again in recent weeks, as some argued France’s public health system could have used similar funds.
When Macron visited a hospital in Paris in February to discuss the coronavirus crisis, Dr. François Salachas, a neurologist, confronted the president over hospital underfunding.
“When we had to save Notre Dame, there was no lack of people who were moved,” Salachas said, in a clip that was widely circulated on social media. “Now we have to save public hospitals, which are going up in flames at the same speed that Notre Dame almost did.”
Christophe Girard, deputy mayor of Paris in charge of culture, said that “those who were on the front lines one year ago were the emergency workers, the Red Cross, the firefighters” — the same ones, he noted, who are now on the front-lines of battling the coronavirus.
“The biggest entrepreneurs, the biggest patrons, the biggest companies” had not hesitated to give out millions for the cathedral, Girard added. “What we are able to do for Notre Dame, we should be able to do for the most essential things.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts endorsed Joe Biden on Wednesday, the latest in a string of prominent endorsements for the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.
Her announcement follows Sen. Bernie Sanders’ endorsement Monday and former President Barack Obama’s on Tuesday. Warren’s support had been a foregone conclusion for a while, but she left the timing of her announcement up to Biden’s team, according to people familiar with the matter. There was no holdup or demand for concessions, these people said.
The series of endorsements has been a carefully choreographed show of force, reminiscent of the one-two-three punch of support that Biden received from Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Beto O’Rourke before Super Tuesday. It is also a show of unity designed to quash the narrative of a fractured Democratic Party.
Two swing-state senators, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Gary Peters of Michigan, also formally backed Biden on Wednesday.
“In this moment of crisis, it’s more important than ever that the next president restores Americans’ faith in good, effective government,” Warren said in her endorsement video. “Joe Biden has spent nearly his entire life in public service. He knows that a government run with integrity, competence and heart will save lives and save livelihoods. And we can’t afford to let Donald Trump continue to endanger the lives and livelihoods of every American.”
Since Warren ended her own campaign, she and Biden have spoken multiple times about policy issues, including Biden’s plan to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. At the staff level, Warren’s chief campaign strategist, Joe Rospars, and Anita Dunn, a senior adviser to Biden, have been engaged in talks bridging the two camps.
In late March, Biden endorsed forgiving at least $10,000 in federal student loans and credited Warren for the proposal. Over the weekend, he said during his podcast that he supported immediately increasing Social Security payments by $200 a month, another proposal that Warren had championed.
“One thing I appreciate about Joe Biden is that he will always tell you where he stands,” Warren said in her endorsement video. “When you disagree, he’ll listen — not just listen, but really hear you and treat you with respect, no matter where you’re coming from. And he has shown throughout this campaign that when you come up with new facts or a good argument, he’s not too afraid or too proud to be persuaded.”
The Biden campaign has broadly signaled a willingness to hire staff from formal rivals as they gear up for the general election matchup with Trump, but there have been no promises to hire a specific number of aides, a person familiar with the matter said.
Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, said she was not worried about disunity. The primary “just didn’t have the vitriol” of 2016, she said, and Democratic voters are overwhelmingly in favor of a singular goal.
“They just really want Trump to be gone,” Greenberg said.

Zoo May Feed Animals to Animals as Funds Dry Up in Pandemic [With graphic(s)]

BERLIN — The polar bear would be the last to go.
So says a zoo in northern Germany, which drew up a startling contingency plan if the financial strain caused by the government-ordered shutdown because of the coronavirus outbreak did not ease up soon:
Slaughter some zoo animals and feed them to others.
The director of the zoo, Tierpark Neumünster, about an hour’s drive north of Hamburg, told the German news agency DPA that such measures would be carried out only as a last resort.
“If — and this is really the worst, worst case of all — if I no longer have any money to buy feed, or if it should happen that my feed supplier is no longer able to deliver due to new restrictions, then I would slaughter animals to feed other animals,” the director, Verena Kaspari, was quoted as saying.
No information was available on which animals would be slaughtered first and which would be saved under the plan. Kaspari could not be immediately reached for comment. But the zoo, which has about 700 animals over 24 hectares, confirmed her comments Wednesday.
It also said that a prized polar bear named Vitus, called the largest polar bear in Germany and standing nearly 12 feet tall, would be spared until it was the last animal standing.
The zoo’s drastic proposal appeared to be an attempt not only to call attention to its dire financial situation but also to lay out a blueprint to keep some of its precious attractions during a pandemic the likes of which has not been seen in modern memory. Some zoos have been known to cull healthy animals to prevent inbreeding, and nature preserves occasionally have open hunting season to thin herds.
But Tierpark Neumünster’s peacetime proposal is unheard-of, said Jan Bauer, who runs a zoo similar in size, the Tierpark Dessau, 180 miles southeast of Neumünster.
“Of course, it’s for everyone to decide for themselves,” Bauer said in a telephone interview Wednesday. “But if we didn’t have any food, the animal sponsors and the locals would certainly donate some.”
Bauer, who also leads the German Zoo Society, admitted that since part of his budget comes from the city of Dessau, he has to worry less about costs, even without paying visitors. His zoo also does not have penguins or polar bears, which are expensive to keep.
The Neumünster zoo’s plan was revealed as Germany’s strategy for stemming the outbreak has drawn global attention. Despite having more than 130,000 coronavirus cases, Germany has a low fatality rate. Unlike the United States and other European countries scrambling to find hospital space and personal protective equipment for medical staff on the front lines, it also has a relatively high number of available intensive care beds and ventilators.
The zoo, which before the lockdown drew about 150,000 visitors annually, had relied on paying customers to stay open, Kaspari explained to the news agency. But that revenue stream dried up when it had to close March 15 because of the national shutdown.
German state governments have been lauded for quickly delivering financial aid to small and medium businesses to weather the shutdown. But the zoo appears to have been struggling to access the rescue funds.
“We are not getting any city funds, and all the state funds we have applied for so far have not yet arrived,” Kaspari said.
Tierpark Neumünster is one of Germany’s 600 to 800 zoos and animal parks. Volker Homes, the director of the Association of Zoological Gardens, declined to comment on the situation in Neumünster, one of its 71 members, but he acknowledged that the financial position of zoos was of the highest priority since the shutdown, as were the measures needed to gradually reopen them.
On Wednesday, the German government was expected to announce plans for a partial reopening of public life. When and under what conditions the nation’s zoos and animal parks would be allowed to open their doors remained unclear. Last week, a district mayor called for the Tierpark Berlin, one of two major zoos in the German capital, to reopen for a limited number of visitors.
While acknowledging the difficult situation that zoos face during the lockdown, Lea Schmitz, a spokeswoman for Deutscher Tierschutzbund, a German animal welfare association, rejected the notion that zoos in the country were at the point of having starving animals.
“Zoos bear the responsibility for their animals — even in times of crisis,” Schmitz said by phone. “Instead of conjuring up horror scenarios, the Neumünster Zoo should do everything possible to get its animals through this crisis with its own financial reserves, if those are available, government aid or other public funds.”
Despite the eye-popping plan, the Neumünster zoo isn’t alone in shocking the public’s sensibilities with proposals to cull healthy animals. In 2015, a zoo in Odense, Denmark, the country’s third-largest city, put to death a female lion after seeking in vain to find her another home. It publicly dissected the corpse of the 9-month-old animal in front of an audience — including children.
Another Danish zoo, in Copenhagen, previously sparked worldwide outrage when it killed a 2-year-old giraffe named Marius — ostensibly to reduce the risk of inbreeding — before dissecting him and feeding him to lions.

Seeking New Businesses and Better Lives, Investors on the Coasts Move Inland [With graphic(s)]

Will Price grew up traveling the world, the son of a globe-trotting banker, and became a venture capitalist in California’s Silicon Valley. But when he wanted to raise a family, he moved to Montana and started a fund of his own.
“We moved just to get out of the Bay Area,” said Price, founder and general partner of Next Frontier Capital. “I wanted to bring capital to places where capital hadn’t previously invested.”
Price, 48, is part of a growing wave of VC professionals leaving the congested, costly coasts for quieter, less expensive locales where they are helping fund startups in places like Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico and North Carolina. No longer do ambitious young entrepreneurs have to relocate to California, New York or Boston to build a business. Startup ecosystems coalescing across the United States have sparked a surge in small businesses, many with national or even global ambitions.
The trend, focused largely on software companies or online businesses, has been facilitated by cloud computing, which gives anyone with an internet connection and a credit card access to almost unlimited computing power. Beyond that, experts agree that a few key ingredients are necessary to get an innovation hub rolling: a nearby research university, local wealth and an airport with flights to the coasts.
In Montana, Price discovered several businesses that were profitable and growing. Submittable, a company based in Missoula, automates the processing of all kinds of online submissions, including job applications and peer-reviewed journal articles. When Price periodically visited its offices, he noticed another company that kept taking more space in the building. That was LumenAd, which sells software for digital advertisers so they can compare things like video views that are counted differently on different ad platforms.
“No one in Silicon Valley had ever heard of them before,” said Price, although the company was No. 29 on Inc.’s 2019 list of the 5,000 fastest-growing U.S. startups.
Price persuaded Ryan Hansen, the company’s founder and chief executive, to let him invest. The subsequent $2 million funding round brought in strategic board members, who have helped Hansen, 34, look beyond regional markets to global ones.
“COVID-19 will accelerate the demographic shift away from coasts,” Price said, echoing a sentiment heard from other VCs that the demand for capital may dip in a recession, but the inland trend will continue.
The big coastal venture firms, Sequoia Capital and Greylock Partners, do invest in startups in the interior of the country. But their appetite is generally conditional on being able to evaluate the businesses based on financial metrics: How much does it cost to acquire a customer? What’s the customer churn rate?
It typically takes several million dollars in revenue for companies to develop meaningful data, so the challenge for entrepreneurs between the coasts is how to raise enough money to build a business that has a track record to interest outside investors.
“It’s a catch-22,” Price said. “Without a local source of capital to get startups over that hurdle, the big firms will never look at you.”
These new hubs are following the trajectory of Silicon Valley, which got its start in the mid-1950s. But Silicon Valley — and New York City and Boston, the other places where startup capital is concentrated — have been victims of their own success. Real estate prices have soared, salaries have surged and competition at all levels has intensified. For a young person, it is now almost impossible to buy a house in Silicon Valley or New York.
Even Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, has said that he would not start a company in Silicon Valley these days.
“The infrastructure exists for people to do stuff like this in more places,” he told a crowd in late January at a conference in Utah.
Tore Steen grew up outside New York City and worked in Silicon Valley until the dot-com bust of 2001. After that he spent a few years in Atlanta before deciding with his wife that they wanted a less stressful lifestyle. They moved to Portland, Oregon, and Steen, 51, worked at a website analytics company before the 2008 financial crisis interfered.
“We made the tough choice not to pack up and scurry back to the Bay Area, because this is where we wanted to raise our boys,” he said.
Steen found an opportunity with a digital identity company, Janrain. Then, in 2013, he left to co-found CrowdStreet, a commercial real estate investment platform. His partner, Dino Vendetti, is another transplant from Silicon Valley, who had started one of the first early-stage venture funds in Oregon years earlier.
Steen’s story is being repeated across the country, where venture funds are setting up to fund smart people who are coming out of local universities or corporate offices or who are returning after years working in larger cities.
“After the financial crisis, the careers of many people stalled, and they moved to lower-cost, higher-quality-of-life places to reinvent themselves,” Vendetti, 58, said.
He moved to Bend, Oregon, in 2011 after years working in California’s venture capital industry. He visited 10 Western cities on startup scouting trips and found that there were outstanding entrepreneurs in all of them struggling to find funding because there was insufficient local venture capital.
Many promising cities have angel investor groups formed by local investors. They are enough to get an entrepreneur started but not to scale up to any size.
“There’s usually a gaping hole in what’s classically called early-stage venture capital,” Vendetti said.
Having a $25 million to $50 million fund in a market is critical to completing the equation.
Without that, the most promising startups move to the coasts, where the talent and money from their success stays.
“The wealth that gets generated gets reinvested in the next wave of funds and startups,” said Vendetti, adding that very little of it makes its way back to the regional markets that the entrepreneurs came from.
In Canada, Jordan Jacobs, managing partner and co-founder of Radical Ventures, said that Toronto, too, had suffered from a lack of venture capital. Startups were steadily siphoned off to Silicon Valley. But the growth of artificial intelligence research in the university-rich region led even California funds to encourage AI-related startups to stay. They encouraged him to start a fund that could build startups into which they could then put money.
“What was missing was local capital,” Jacobs said.
Mark Kvamme, co-founder of Drive Capital in Columbus, Ohio, has $1.2 billion under management. He grew up in the Bay Area, worked at Apple in the early years, started and sold a company and went into venture capital with his winnings. Then, in 2010, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a friend, asked him to come work on economic development. Kvamme never left.
“I think the best market for venture capital happens to be Middle America,” he said, adding that if the region were a country, the Midwest would be fourth largest by gross domestic product and include nearly half the U.S. population.
In 2019, Kvamme, 59, said 6,000 companies came looking for capital. The Midwest could support a dozen more funds of the same size, he said.
“If we had co-investors here, this place would be just going crazy,” Kvamme said.
His investments include several robotics companies because there is so much manufacturing in the Midwest. One is a fully robotic vertical farm that produces leafy greens, spun out of Carnegie Mellon University. The Pennsylvanian startup’s 60,000-square-foot solar-powered warehouse grew 500,000 pounds of produce in its first year of operation.
“If you have access to capital, you have access to customers, you have access to talent; why not stay where you are?” he said.

LONDON — In 1858, during what became known as the Great Stink, work was curtailed by an overpowering smell of sewage from the adjacent River Thames. During World War II, the threat from German bombers forced evacuation to a nearby building.
Now, the British Parliament is embarking on another temporary retreat from its centuries-old home, this time into cyberspace.
After an absence of several weeks, lawmakers are anxious to return to the job of holding to account a government with sweeping emergency powers that faces criticism over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic.
Yet, few places are less suited to social distancing than a 19th century, wood-paneled debating chamber where lawmakers routinely squeeze onto overcrowded benches to secure a seat.
So a scramble is underway to make history by converting an ancient institution into a virtual one, with a decision perhaps as early as Thursday.
“It is unprecedented for Parliament not to sit in the chamber or to meet collectively in an alternative place,” said Ruth Fox, director of the Hansard Society, a research organization focused on Parliament and a co-author of a report on holding a virtual legislature.
For some, that cannot come soon enough, because many lawmakers felt sidelined as the hospitalization of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who contracted the virus, left a power vacuum at the heart of the British government. Now convalescing at the prime minister’s country residence, Chequers, Johnson has deputized his functions to the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab.
Ministers also hold daily news conferences, while lawmakers have few similar opportunities to raise the concerns they might have about shortages of basic equipment, like face masks and body gowns, at hospitals and care homes.
“At this time of national emergency, we need a functioning Parliament to hold ministers to account on their response to the coronavirus,” said Keir Starmer, leader of the opposition Labour Party. “There are too many questions that have gone unanswered.”
Caroline Lucas, a lawmaker for the Green Party, argued that, given available technology, the only thing missing was political will. And Alastair Campbell, once a close aide to the former Prime Minister Tony Blair, posted an exhortation on Twitter to bring back Parliament, using a mild expletive to underline his impatience.
The lack of a visible parliamentary presence is all the more jarring after a period when British lawmakers grabbed global attention as they feuded over how to leave the European Union.
Parliament was such a focal point of opposition that Johnson tried to suspend sittings for five weeks during the Brexit crisis, only to be rebuked by Britain’s Supreme Court. The impasse over withdrawal from the European Union was finally broken when Johnson won a big majority in December’s general election.
But going online is not easy for an institution so steeped in tradition that casting a vote requires lawmakers to pass through a narrow lobby where their names are recorded by officials in formal dress.
Paradoxically, the job of facilitating one of the biggest revolutions in the workings of Parliament falls largely to the leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, a man whose mannerisms are so self-consciously old-fashioned that he has been nicknamed “the honorable member for the 18th century.”
Some lawmakers are queasy about the very idea of a virtual Parliament. “The House of Commons met when air raids were going on in the war,” David Davis, a former Cabinet minister, told the newspaper The Observer. “I think it needs to be reconstituted even if it means members of Parliament being tested every day.”
But that would send an odd signal to the public, given that members of Parliament come from all over the country and the government is unlikely to want to encourage travel soon, especially for large gatherings.
As for the House of Lords, the unelected second chamber, many of its members are former politicians who are at high risk because of how old they are — the average was 70 in 2019.
Already, some select committees have used technology to hold hearings virtually, proving that teleworking is possible despite unreliable Wi-Fi, background noise and the inevitable failure of some participants to mute their microphones.
Widening this out to the full chamber of the House of Commons, which has 650 members, raises more issues, however.
One possibility is to have the speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, sit in splendid isolation in the chamber, moderating proceedings via a video link.
Alternatively, Hoyle might be joined by a government minister and a political opponent, with lawmakers using a messaging system to intervene in the debate to ask questions.
“I recognize the urgent need to put new arrangements in place and will do everything I can to ensure the House is presented with the opportunity to take a decision on this matter sooner rather than later,” Hoyle said in a statement.
Lawmakers should be able to take part in Prime Minister’s Questions — the raucous weekly sessions where the head of the government answers sometimes hostile inquiries — and other matters by video link, with the proceedings streamed live, he added.
Longer-term challenges are likely to include how to manage legislation and whether to introduce digital voting. The Hansard Society report co-written by Fox notes that voting apps exist with verification options to ensure security, though she said she thought that lawmakers would be wary of any permanent changes that lessened the need to visit Parliament in person.
For the immediate future, the hope is that agreement can be reached across party lines Thursday, allowing the rules to be changed without needing a vote with at least 40 lawmakers present. If there is consensus, Fox said, it would be possible to wave a plan through.
So, if Parliament resumes next week as scheduled, it will likely be an empty, echoing, imitation of the normally boisterous chamber.
In preparation for the new digital dawn, lawmakers might want to take advice on how to look their best online from Jeremy Vine, a prominent broadcaster, who noted on Twitter that “viewers spend three seconds looking at your face, then they scour the background for something more interesting.”

Will Price grew up traveling the world, the son of a globe-trotting banker, and became a venture capitalist in California’s Silicon Valley. But when he wanted to raise a family, he moved to Montana and started a fund of his own.
“We moved just to get out of the Bay Area,” said Price, founder and general partner of Next Frontier Capital. “I wanted to bring capital to places where capital hadn’t previously invested.”
Price, 48, is part of a growing wave of VC professionals leaving the congested, costly coasts for quieter, less expensive locales where they are helping fund startups in places like Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico and North Carolina. No longer do ambitious young entrepreneurs have to relocate to California, New York or Boston to build a business. Startup ecosystems coalescing across the United States have sparked a surge in small businesses, many with national or even global ambitions.
The trend, focused largely on software companies or online businesses, has been facilitated by cloud computing, which gives anyone with an internet connection and a credit card access to almost unlimited computing power. Beyond that, experts agree that a few key ingredients are necessary to get an innovation hub rolling: a nearby research university, local wealth and an airport with flights to the coasts.
In Montana, Price discovered several businesses that were profitable and growing. Submittable, a company based in Missoula, automates the processing of all kinds of online submissions, including job applications and peer-reviewed journal articles. When Price periodically visited its offices, he noticed another company that kept taking more space in the building. That was LumenAd, which sells software for digital advertisers so they can compare things like video views that are counted differently on different ad platforms.
“No one in Silicon Valley had ever heard of them before,” said Price, although the company was No. 29 on Inc.’s 2019 list of the 5,000 fastest-growing U.S. startups.
Price persuaded Ryan Hansen, the company’s founder and chief executive, to let him invest. The subsequent $2 million funding round brought in strategic board members, who have helped Hansen, 34, look beyond regional markets to global ones.
“COVID-19 will accelerate the demographic shift away from coasts,” Price said, echoing a sentiment heard from other VCs that the demand for capital may dip in a recession, but the inland trend will continue.
The big coastal venture firms, Sequoia Capital and Greylock Partners, do invest in startups in the interior of the country. But their appetite is generally conditional on being able to evaluate the businesses based on financial metrics: How much does it cost to acquire a customer? What’s the customer churn rate?
It typically takes several million dollars in revenue for companies to develop meaningful data, so the challenge for entrepreneurs between the coasts is how to raise enough money to build a business that has a track record to interest outside investors.
“It’s a catch-22,” Price said. “Without a local source of capital to get startups over that hurdle, the big firms will never look at you.”
These new hubs are following the trajectory of Silicon Valley, which got its start in the mid-1950s. But Silicon Valley — and New York City and Boston, the other places where startup capital is concentrated — have been victims of their own success. Real estate prices have soared, salaries have surged and competition at all levels has intensified. For a young person, it is now almost impossible to buy a house in Silicon Valley or New York.
Even Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, has said that he would not start a company in Silicon Valley these days.
“The infrastructure exists for people to do stuff like this in more places,” he told a crowd in late January at a conference in Utah.
Tore Steen grew up outside New York City and worked in Silicon Valley until the dot-com bust of 2001. After that he spent a few years in Atlanta before deciding with his wife that they wanted a less stressful lifestyle. They moved to Portland, Oregon, and Steen, 51, worked at a website analytics company before the 2008 financial crisis interfered.
“We made the tough choice not to pack up and scurry back to the Bay Area, because this is where we wanted to raise our boys,” he said.
Steen found an opportunity with a digital identity company, Janrain. Then, in 2013, he left to co-found CrowdStreet, a commercial real estate investment platform. His partner, Dino Vendetti, is another transplant from Silicon Valley, who had started one of the first early-stage venture funds in Oregon years earlier.
Steen’s story is being repeated across the country, where venture funds are setting up to fund smart people who are coming out of local universities or corporate offices or who are returning after years working in larger cities.
“After the financial crisis, the careers of many people stalled, and they moved to lower-cost, higher-quality-of-life places to reinvent themselves,” Vendetti, 58, said.
He moved to Bend, Oregon, in 2011 after years working in California’s venture capital industry. He visited 10 Western cities on startup scouting trips and found that there were outstanding entrepreneurs in all of them struggling to find funding because there was insufficient local venture capital.
Many promising cities have angel investor groups formed by local investors. They are enough to get an entrepreneur started but not to scale up to any size.
“There’s usually a gaping hole in what’s classically called early-stage venture capital,” Vendetti said.
Having a $25 million to $50 million fund in a market is critical to completing the equation.
Without that, the most promising startups move to the coasts, where the talent and money from their success stays.
“The wealth that gets generated gets reinvested in the next wave of funds and startups,” said Vendetti, adding that very little of it makes its way back to the regional markets that the entrepreneurs came from.
In Canada, Jordan Jacobs, managing partner and co-founder of Radical Ventures, said that Toronto, too, had suffered from a lack of venture capital. Startups were steadily siphoned off to Silicon Valley. But the growth of artificial intelligence research in the university-rich region led even California funds to encourage AI-related startups to stay. They encouraged him to start a fund that could build startups into which they could then put money.
“What was missing was local capital,” Jacobs said.
Mark Kvamme, co-founder of Drive Capital in Columbus, Ohio, has $1.2 billion under management. He grew up in the Bay Area, worked at Apple in the early years, started and sold a company and went into venture capital with his winnings. Then, in 2010, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a friend, asked him to come work on economic development. Kvamme never left.
“I think the best market for venture capital happens to be Middle America,” he said, adding that if the region were a country, the Midwest would be fourth largest by gross domestic product and include nearly half the U.S. population.
In 2019, Kvamme, 59, said 6,000 companies came looking for capital. The Midwest could support a dozen more funds of the same size, he said.
“If we had co-investors here, this place would be just going crazy,” Kvamme said.
His investments include several robotics companies because there is so much manufacturing in the Midwest. One is a fully robotic vertical farm that produces leafy greens, spun out of Carnegie Mellon University. The Pennsylvanian startup’s 60,000-square-foot solar-powered warehouse grew 500,000 pounds of produce in its first year of operation.
“If you have access to capital, you have access to customers, you have access to talent; why not stay where you are?” he said.

Zoo May Feed Animals to Animals as Funds Dry Up in Pandemic [With graphic(s)]

BERLIN — The polar bear would be the last to go.
So says a zoo in northern Germany, which drew up a startling contingency plan if the financial strain caused by the government-ordered shutdown because of the coronavirus outbreak did not ease up soon:
Slaughter some zoo animals and feed them to others.
The director of the zoo, Tierpark Neumünster, about an hour’s drive north of Hamburg, told the German news agency DPA that such measures would be carried out only as a last resort.
“If — and this is really the worst, worst case of all — if I no longer have any money to buy feed, or if it should happen that my feed supplier is no longer able to deliver due to new restrictions, then I would slaughter animals to feed other animals,” the director, Verena Kaspari, was quoted as saying.
No information was available on which animals would be slaughtered first and which would be saved under the plan. Kaspari could not be immediately reached for comment. But the zoo, which has about 700 animals over 24 hectares, confirmed her comments Wednesday.
It also said that a prized polar bear named Vitus, called the largest polar bear in Germany and standing nearly 12 feet tall, would be spared until it was the last animal standing.
The zoo’s drastic proposal appeared to be an attempt not only to call attention to its dire financial situation but also to lay out a blueprint to keep some of its precious attractions during a pandemic the likes of which has not been seen in modern memory. Some zoos have been known to cull healthy animals to prevent inbreeding, and nature preserves occasionally have open hunting season to thin herds.
But Tierpark Neumünster’s peacetime proposal is unheard-of, said Jan Bauer, who runs a zoo similar in size, the Tierpark Dessau, 180 miles southeast of Neumünster.
“Of course, it’s for everyone to decide for themselves,” Bauer said in a telephone interview Wednesday. “But if we didn’t have any food, the animal sponsors and the locals would certainly donate some.”
Bauer, who also leads the German Zoo Society, admitted that since part of his budget comes from the city of Dessau, he has to worry less about costs, even without paying visitors. His zoo also does not have penguins or polar bears, which are expensive to keep.
The Neumünster zoo’s plan was revealed as Germany’s strategy for stemming the outbreak has drawn global attention. Despite having more than 130,000 coronavirus cases, Germany has a low fatality rate. Unlike the United States and other European countries scrambling to find hospital space and personal protective equipment for medical staff on the front lines, it also has a relatively high number of available intensive care beds and ventilators.
The zoo, which before the lockdown drew about 150,000 visitors annually, had relied on paying customers to stay open, Kaspari explained to the news agency. But that revenue stream dried up when it had to close March 15 because of the national shutdown.
German state governments have been lauded for quickly delivering financial aid to small and medium businesses to weather the shutdown. But the zoo appears to have been struggling to access the rescue funds.
“We are not getting any city funds, and all the state funds we have applied for so far have not yet arrived,” Kaspari said.
Tierpark Neumünster is one of Germany’s 600 to 800 zoos and animal parks. Volker Homes, the director of the Association of Zoological Gardens, declined to comment on the situation in Neumünster, one of its 71 members, but he acknowledged that the financial position of zoos was of the highest priority since the shutdown, as were the measures needed to gradually reopen them.
On Wednesday, the German government was expected to announce plans for a partial reopening of public life. When and under what conditions the nation’s zoos and animal parks would be allowed to open their doors remained unclear. Last week, a district mayor called for the Tierpark Berlin, one of two major zoos in the German capital, to reopen for a limited number of visitors.
While acknowledging the difficult situation that zoos face during the lockdown, Lea Schmitz, a spokeswoman for Deutscher Tierschutzbund, a German animal welfare association, rejected the notion that zoos in the country were at the point of having starving animals.
“Zoos bear the responsibility for their animals — even in times of crisis,” Schmitz said by phone. “Instead of conjuring up horror scenarios, the Neumünster Zoo should do everything possible to get its animals through this crisis with its own financial reserves, if those are available, government aid or other public funds.”
Despite the eye-popping plan, the Neumünster zoo isn’t alone in shocking the public’s sensibilities with proposals to cull healthy animals. In 2015, a zoo in Odense, Denmark, the country’s third-largest city, put to death a female lion after seeking in vain to find her another home. It publicly dissected the corpse of the 9-month-old animal in front of an audience — including children.
Another Danish zoo, in Copenhagen, previously sparked worldwide outrage when it killed a 2-year-old giraffe named Marius — ostensibly to reduce the risk of inbreeding — before dissecting him and feeding him to lions.

PARIS — On the evening of April 15, 2019, the world watched Notre Dame burn.
Confused tourists pointed their smartphones as smoke billowed out of the cathedral’s rooftop. Horrified Parisians watched from the banks of the Seine as flames tore through the centuries-old attic, sending the spire crashing into the vaults below. President Emmanuel Macron, beamed to television sets around the world, vowed to rebuild by 2024, when Paris will host the Summer Olympic Games.
But one year later, all the tourists are gone, and the streets are empty. Parisians are confined to their homes, as Macron tries to prevent the coronavirus pandemic from overwhelming France’s hospitals and tanking its economy.
The world’s attention is elsewhere.
“Our days, our thoughts, our lives today are monopolized by this terrible crisis that we are going through,” Macron, referring to the COVID-19 outbreak, said in a short video published on social media as he thanked “those who yesterday saved” the Cathedral of Notre Dame and “those who today are rebuilding it.”
All the tributes initially planned for Wednesday to mark the anniversary were scrapped. They included a reception at the Élysée Palace to honor the workers tending to Notre Dame; an official ceremony with the cathedral choir; and a performance of a musical about Notre Dame in front of City Hall.
The construction site itself was shut down last month when France went into lockdown, just as workers were about to start delicately removing thousands of scaffolding tubes, twisted and charred by the fire, that still cling on top of the cathedral.
But Gen. Jean-Louis Georgelin, a former army chief of staff named by Macron to head the Notre Dame renovation task force, said that despite the pandemic, the “emotional intensity” of the fire “has not died down.”
“Interest in this construction project has not waned,” he said.
The cathedral, where 13 million visitors used to crowd each year, is still closed to the public, and there have been only two religious ceremonies inside since the fire, including one last week for Good Friday.
“France is now facing two enormous challenges,” Georgelin said, “rebuilding the cathedral, which in a way is France’s soul,” and confronting a “gigantic sanitary, economic and social crisis.”
Still, the virus and its human toll — over 17,000 people have died in France so far — overshadowed commemorations for a fire that killed no one and left most of the cathedral still standing.
Monsignor Benoist de Sinety, the Paris archdiocese vicar general, told Le Figaro last week that after the fire, “We didn’t hesitate to talk about a catastrophe, or a tragedy.
“What do those words weigh today?” said de Sinety, who represents the archdiocese on the Notre Dame task force’s board. “It would be a mistake to showcase a monument and a construction project, as important as they may be, when the emergency is now human and social.”
No one denies the differences between the two events. But some see similarities.
“The question we could ask the good Lord is: Why?” said Monsignor Patrick Chauvet, Notre Dame’s rector. “That is the question I was asking when I was on the plaza one year ago; that is the question I ask yet again today.”
He added, “This first anniversary, at the height of the pandemic, maybe also signals to the world that this 850-year-old injured lady is close to all those who are injured.”
To drive that message home, one tribute did take place Wednesday. Notre Dame’s biggest bell — dating from 1683 and made of 13 tons of bronze — rang out at 8 p.m. to “unite” with the thousands of people around France who cheer and clap from their windows every evening to support health workers, Georgelin said.
A 200-foot crane still towers above the cathedral, a looming reminder of the work that lies ahead after a string of setbacks.
Workers rushed to shore up the building after the fire, which investigators still believe was accidental, caused perhaps by discarded cigarettes or an electrical short-circuit. The vault is punctured by three gaping holes, and the flying buttresses are propped up by giant wooden blocks. A hundred or so sensors monitor Notre Dame’s every movement.
But construction was halted for weeks last summer because of concerns over lead contamination from the damaged roof and spire. Work picked up again at a much slower pace, with stringent decontamination protocols for the 80 or so workers, who must wear protective gear and shower upon every entry and exit.
Then, bad fall and winter weather — especially strong winds — delayed the schedule even further.
Macron said Wednesday that Notre Dame’s restoration was a “symbol of our people’s resilience, of its ability to overcome hardships” and that “we will do everything” to stick to the 2024 goal.
Critics say that is increasingly unrealistic.
“I do not believe in it for a minute,” Emmanuel Grégoire, the deputy mayor of Paris, said of the deadline, telling Le Monde this week that legal or public procurement challenges could also delay the project.
But officials like Georgelin insist that 2024 is an “extremely mobilizing” goal, pointing out that it is a deadline to reopen the cathedral for religious services, not to finish the renovation completely.
“Obviously, everything won’t be done, but the inside will,” Georgelin said, adding that he expected a two-month delay from the lockdown.
“Two months out of 60 doesn’t justify throwing in the towel and saying that the schedule won’t hold,” he said.
Once the old scaffolding is removed, workers will be able to ascertain the state of the vaults, which are still covered in charred wood and metal, giving architects a better sense of Notre Dame’s overall sturdiness.
Actual renovation work — and final decisions on how to rebuild the roof and spire — aren’t expected before 2021. But city authorities say the plaza in front of the cathedral and the crypt underneath it will reopen much sooner, as lead decontamination efforts were just ending when the lockdown started.
Money has not been as much of an issue as time. About 340,000 donors pledged nearly $1 billion after the fire. Only about $200 million have been cashed in so far, but most donations are legally binding.
When billionaires whipped out their checkbooks last year for Notre Dame — right after months of yellow vest turmoil — it created an intense debate in France about wealth inequality. Some of that debate has played out again in recent weeks, as some argued France’s public health system could have used similar funds.
When Macron visited a hospital in Paris in February to discuss the coronavirus crisis, Dr. François Salachas, a neurologist, confronted the president over hospital underfunding.
“When we had to save Notre Dame, there was no lack of people who were moved,” Salachas said, in a clip that was widely circulated on social media. “Now we have to save public hospitals, which are going up in flames at the same speed that Notre Dame almost did.”
Christophe Girard, deputy mayor of Paris in charge of culture, said that “those who were on the front lines one year ago were the emergency workers, the Red Cross, the firefighters” — the same ones, he noted, who are now on the front-lines of battling the coronavirus.
“The biggest entrepreneurs, the biggest patrons, the biggest companies” had not hesitated to give out millions for the cathedral, Girard added. “What we are able to do for Notre Dame, we should be able to do for the most essential things.”

The United States has responded to the economic havoc wrought by the coronavirus with the biggest relief package in its history: $2 trillion. It essentially replaces a few months of American economic activity with a flood of government money — every penny of it borrowed.
And where is all that cash coming from? Mostly out of thin air.
The traditional view of economic theory holds that governments and central banks have distinct responsibilities. A government sets fiscal policy — spending the money it raises through taxes and borrowing — to run a country. And a central bank uses various levers of monetary policy — like buying and selling government securities to change the amount of money in circulation — to ensure the smooth operation of the country’s economy.
But the relief package, called the CARES Act, will require the government to vastly expand its debt at the same time that the Federal Reserve has signaled its willingness to buy an essentially unlimited amount of government debt. With those twin moves, the United States has effectively undone decades of conventional wisdom, embedding into policy ideas that were once relegated to the fringes of economics.
“It’s an epic moment in terms of breaking down the orthodoxy of church-and-state separation of the fiscal and monetary authority,” said Paul McCulley, a former chief economist of Pimco, a giant asset management shop.
Playing out in the background of this shift is a debate over what is known as modern monetary theory, which says countries that control their own currency can run much larger budget deficits than they typically do, in part because of the power of central banks to create new money to help finance the shortfall.
But to the theory’s adherents, the lock-step maneuvers by the Fed and the government were not the arrival of a far-out idea but the removal of a fig leaf.
“What it’s doing is just making more transparent a relationship between the Treasury and the Fed that has always existed,” said Stephanie Kelton, a professor of economics at Stony Brook University and one of the theory’s major advocates.
For those not attuned to the wonky worlds of monetary policy and government debt, the parallel policy changes might have been easy to miss.
On March 23, facing a roughly 30% stock market crash and growing dysfunction in key bond markets, the Fed announced its latest, and most significant, plan to pump cash into the financial system. The central bank said it would basically buy an unlimited amount of Treasury bonds and government-backed mortgage bonds — whatever was necessary “to support smooth market functioning.”
In the world of central banking, this muted statement qualified as seriously radical. The new policy didn’t put a number on the bonds the Fed would buy, a tacit nod to the idea that it could buy unlimited amounts.
Then, within days, President Donald Trump signed a $2 trillion economic rescue package into law. That package alone equaled about half of what the federal government spent in all of 2019.
Nobody knows exactly how much the relief bill will add to the national debt; it was cobbled together so quickly that there wasn’t time for the Congressional Budget Office to carry out an analysis, though one is expected to be published this week. But the Fed will be the biggest buyer by far of the bonds the government will sell to fund this spending.
Goldman Sachs analysts estimate the Fed will buy $2.4 trillion in Treasury securities as part of its recently reintroduced bond-buying programs. Economists at Morgan Stanley put the number at around $2.5 trillion in 2020 alone, rising to as much as $3 trillion for the entirety of the bond-buying program.
But the Fed isn’t an ordinary bondholder: By law, it has to pay its profits to the Treasury.
That means when the Treasury makes payments on bonds held by the Fed — either paying interest or paying it off at maturity — almost all the money eventually moves back to the Treasury.
When a government bond is involved, the cash moves from one government pocket to another.
“Once the central bank buys them, it’s as if the Treasury never issued them in the first place,” said Kelton, who was an adviser to Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign. “For all intents and purposes, they’re retired.”
The CARES Act borrowing is, in many ways, the natural result of an evolution that began with the 2008 financial crisis. The bond-buying programs that central banks undertook around the world helped ensure low-cost financing for governments running giant deficits as policymakers contended with a deep recession and a prolonged period of lackluster growth. And despite constant, high-decibel warnings that such an approach would surely ignite a surge of inflation, it never happened.
That was a legitimate concern: Financial historians often point to disastrous periods when a central bank printed money for the government to pay its debts. A common example is Weimar Germany, when the central bank churned out bank notes that allowed the fragile government to repay onerous World War I reparations with essentially worthless marks, impoverishing most of the country in the process.
But at other times, the idea has worked just fine: Japan’s central bank has been buying huge chunks of the government’s bonds — effectively financing the central government of the world’s third-largest economy for years — without triggering the kind of inflation that traditional economic views would expect.
Adherents of MMT have long argued that the United States can — and probably should — run much larger budget deficits than it did already. In recent years, this belief has been most often associated with left-leaning politicians such as Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.
But the ideas have found broader currency in some unlikely places, such as Wall Street. In recent years, some at huge money management firms and gold-plated investment banks have increasingly turned to MMT as a useful analytical framework to understand the strong links between central banks and markets that have grown since the financial crisis.
“MMT has been invoked so many times by completely mainstream people and politicians,” said L. Randall Wray, a professor of economics at Bard College who has written seminal papers on modern monetary theory. “Even Trump used almost word for word what we’ve been saying all along.” (“You never have to default because you print the money,” Trump said as a candidate in 2016.)
Other experts counter that coordination between the Fed and the Treasury may be justified in a national crisis, but that a continuing large-scale expansion of government deficits could have negative consequences, such as higher inflation.
“I think the Treasury did the right thing. I think the Fed is doing largely the right thing,” said Glenn Hubbard, a professor of finance and economics at Columbia University. “There shouldn’t be an ongoing dance of borrowing money and printing money. This isn’t the lesson to learn from this episode.”
Even so, the growing comfort with the Treasury Department’s relying on the Fed to buy its bonds — and help finance large deficits — is an important shift in the conventional thinking of politicians and policymakers, said McCulley, who retired from Pimco in 2015 and now teaches at Georgetown University.
“What this crisis has brought to the forefront is that this isn’t an academic debate anymore whatsoever,” he said.
McCulley said the speed with which the crisis took hold — and the unique circumstances of a nearly nationwide lockdown of consumers — meant political leaders had little choice but to vastly expand deficits. And, he said, those who usually question how deficits will be paid for have been rendered mute.
“How do we pay for it?” McCulley said. “We print the damn money.”

MOSCOW — In a remote alpine meadow in Kyrgyzstan a few years ago, a teenage boy killed and skinned a marmot. Five days later, his parents carried the sweating, delirious boy to a village hospital where he died of bubonic plague.
Like a ghost from the medieval past, the plague still makes occasional, unwelcome appearances in remote regions of the former Soviet Union, where it survives today in wild rodents.
Over the centuries, with improved public hygiene, the plague declined as a threat. Today, as a bacterial infection, it is treatable with antibiotics, if caught in time.
But the plague was still a lethal menace in the 1920s and also an embarrassment for the Soviet Union, which established a specialized state agency to track and contain it.
Successors to that agency still exist in Russia and in half a dozen other countries that were once Soviet republics, and, with their ready quarantine plans and trained personnel, they have become a mainstay of the regional response to the coronavirus.
It is too early to tell if the former Soviet antiplague centers, as the sites were called, have made any difference in the coronavirus outbreak, which so far has infected more than 21,000 Russians, killing 170.
At most, the legacy Soviet system helped delay the spread, and it is just one data point in assessing why the coronavirus moved more slowly in Russia, Ukraine and other former Soviet countries than in Western Europe and the United States. Luck, border closures or officials covering up the true numbers of deaths could also explain the low numbers.
Infections are in any case now shooting up, and those countries seem to be headed the way of the rest of the world toward bulging hospitals and morgues. But employees of the antiplague centers say their early work helped, becoming a silver lining to the region’s long-lingering plague problem.
“Of course, it helped” early on, said Ravshan Maimulov, director of a regional antiplague service in Kyrgyzstan who examined the teenage plague victim when he died in 2013. He used the same quarantine plan that he had instituted after the boy’s death to respond to the coronavirus in March.
When the 15-year-old had arrived at the village hospital, “the body was still damp from sweat and I felt swelling under the armpits and chin,” Maimulov said. But the boy was too far gone to save, and he died within hours.
Maimulov, 57, trained at a Russian antiplague institute called Microbe. After the boy’s death, he had the authority to immediately put in motion plans for a lockdown, even though at that point they had only a partial diagnosis.
He relayed the news to a regional governor in code — they would need to implement “Formula 100” — lest word leak and inhabitants of the village, Ichke-Zhergez, should try to flee before the door slammed shut.
“We needed to prevent them all from running away,” he said.
By the next morning, police checkpoints were in place and the village was sealed.
On his recommendation, authorities in the surrounding Issyk-Kul region used the same approach in March in introducing coronavirus lockdowns.
“We worked under the operative plan for the plague,” Maimulov said in a telephone interview.
The region of about half a million people has reported three coronavirus cases, he said. Kyrgyzstan has reported five deaths.
Russia maintains 13 antiplague centers, from the Far East to the Caucasus Mountains, five plague research institutes and multiple field stations. In March, the authorities moved new laboratory equipment into the antiplague center in Moscow to expand its ability to test for coronavirus.
The Microbe institute, originally dedicated wholly to bubonic plague but later expanded to tackle other infections such as cholera, yellow fever, anthrax and tularemia, models the spread of the coronavirus.
Starting in January, directors of antiplague centers in the Eurasian Economic Union, the Moscow-led trade alliance of Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Russia, held conference calls about the coronavirus. And a plague institute in Odessa, Ukraine, is among agencies responding to the coronavirus there, officials said.
“The very fact that Russia and the other former Soviet states are, exactly, former Soviet states means a common legacy,” in health care, said Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center. A legacy of focus on epidemics helped, he said. Soviet health care had haphazard success at treating individuals but “could respond like the military to epidemics,” he noted.
Other analysts of former Soviet medical services say that, in the longer term, the Soviet legacy will prove no gift. The capacity to counter epidemics had degraded while little was done to improve an ability to treat patients, according to Yevgeny S. Gontmakher, a professor at the Higher School of Economics and an authority on Russian health care.
“The plague doctors were the elite of a hundred years ago, not today,” he said.
In Kyrgyzstan, Maimulov works in a wooden laboratory in what had been, until a few weeks ago, the medical backwater of plague control. Most years, he plans for campaigns of spraying insecticide into rodent burrows, to kill fleas and slow the spread in animals.
The disease cannot be fully stamped out.
“They are rodents; they reproduce quickly,” he said. “It’s not worthwhile to kill them.”
The family of the 15-year-old boy were herding sheep in the mountains and trapping marmots for fur as a sideline. The boy skinned the marmot with a razor blade. Although the Black Death typically spreads by flea bite, in this instance the boy caught it simply by nicking his finger.
Eventually, 32 villages were put under quarantine while about 700 nurses went door to door looking for infection. Marmot hides were collected and burned. But the antiplague team had acted quickly enough. The boy was the only confirmed case.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts endorsed Joe Biden on Wednesday, the latest in a string of prominent endorsements for the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.
Her announcement follows Sen. Bernie Sanders’ endorsement Monday and former President Barack Obama’s on Tuesday. Warren’s support had been a foregone conclusion for a while, but she left the timing of her announcement up to Biden’s team, according to people familiar with the matter. There was no holdup or demand for concessions, these people said.
The series of endorsements has been a carefully choreographed show of force, reminiscent of the one-two-three punch of support that Biden received from Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Beto O’Rourke before Super Tuesday. It is also a show of unity designed to quash the narrative of a fractured Democratic Party.
Two swing-state senators, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Gary Peters of Michigan, also formally backed Biden on Wednesday.
“In this moment of crisis, it’s more important than ever that the next president restores Americans’ faith in good, effective government,” Warren said in her endorsement video. “Joe Biden has spent nearly his entire life in public service. He knows that a government run with integrity, competence and heart will save lives and save livelihoods. And we can’t afford to let Donald Trump continue to endanger the lives and livelihoods of every American.”
Since Warren ended her own campaign, she and Biden have spoken multiple times about policy issues, including Biden’s plan to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. At the staff level, Warren’s chief campaign strategist, Joe Rospars, and Anita Dunn, a senior adviser to Biden, have been engaged in talks bridging the two camps.
In late March, Biden endorsed forgiving at least $10,000 in federal student loans and credited Warren for the proposal. Over the weekend, he said during his podcast that he supported immediately increasing Social Security payments by $200 a month, another proposal that Warren had championed.
“One thing I appreciate about Joe Biden is that he will always tell you where he stands,” Warren said in her endorsement video. “When you disagree, he’ll listen — not just listen, but really hear you and treat you with respect, no matter where you’re coming from. And he has shown throughout this campaign that when you come up with new facts or a good argument, he’s not too afraid or too proud to be persuaded.”
The Biden campaign has broadly signaled a willingness to hire staff from formal rivals as they gear up for the general election matchup with Trump, but there have been no promises to hire a specific number of aides, a person familiar with the matter said.
Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, said she was not worried about disunity. The primary “just didn’t have the vitriol” of 2016, she said, and Democratic voters are overwhelmingly in favor of a singular goal.
“They just really want Trump to be gone,” Greenberg said.

Although it can be hard to see past the daily deluge of devastating headlines, there is plenty of good news in the world right now — and a great deal of interest in reading it.
Instagram accounts dedicated to good news, such as @TanksGoodNews and @GoodNews_Movement, have seen follower counts skyrocket in recent weeks. At the end of March, actor John Krasinski introduced a “news network for good news” on YouTube; within a week, Some Good News had surpassed 1.5 million subscribers and 25 million views. Google searches for “good news” spiked a month ago and have only continued to rise.
“We’ve seen an unprecedented level of growth in the past four weeks,” said Lucia Knell, the director of brand partnerships at Upworthy, who noted that the company saw a 65% growth in followers on Instagram and 47% increase in on-site page views in March, compared to the previous month.
Upworthy was founded in 2012 with a commitment to positive storytelling. At the time, Facebook’s algorithm appeared to favor inspiring, clickbaity headlines; you may recall seeing them all over your feed. But in 2013, Upworthy and other good-news sites saw page views drop considerably after Facebook adjusted its algorithm.
Major news organizations (including The New York Times) have created their own good-news properties over the years. Now, more than ever, readers are seeing a need for them.
“It’s just been an avalanche of people writing and saying how much they need these stories or they read a story and tears are just streaming down their face,” said Allison Klein, who runs the Inspired Life blog at The Washington Post. “People are constantly saying thank you for showing something that made them not feel terrible.”
Supply and Demand
David Beard, the executive editor for newsletters at National Geographic, said that the demand for good news right now is unlike anything he’s seen before. “People are looking for a reason to go on,” he said.
In response, National Geographic has created two good news-themed newsletters. One is focused on kids and families. The other is a coronavirus-free newsletter titled Your Weekly Escape. “I think of it as like a meditation app, but it’s journalism,” Beard said. Both newsletters “were a reaction to this onslaught of terrible news,” he said.
The Washington Post is also striving to meet demand. In addition to publishing stories regularly to Inspired Life, the company turned its weekly good-news newsletter, The Optimist (which Beard developed when he was on staff), into a biweekly send and created The Daily Break, which highlights one uplifting story per day.
Good news has been a boon for independent publishers, too. Lori Lakin Hutcherson, the founder and editor-in-chief of Good Black News, said that stories on her site have been spreading “like wildfire” recently.
“Just looking at shares and clicking through,” she said, “these are stories that have been about 12 times more popular than the standard.” Good Black News has always attracted a steady audience of black readers, Lakin Hutcherson said, but in the last two months she’s seen an influx of interest outside her usual demographic.
Branden Harvey, the founder of Good Good Good, said that in seeking out these stories, readers aren’t necessarily looking for an escape from the news. “More than just wanting to be distracted from COVID, they want a genuine sense of hopefulness in the response to COVID,” he said.
“It’s not that people don’t want news about the coronavirus,” Lakin Hutcherson said. “They just want news about it that’s more positive or that are showing people come together and fight this and offering ways individuals can help.”
Uplifting Memes for COVID-19
Just as Facebook boosted good news in the early 2010s, Instagram has become a place for positive storytelling to proliferate. Good news has spread on popular meme accounts over the last several weeks, and several account administrators have begun trading positive stories in a group chat.
George Resch, a fixture in the Instagram meme world known online as @Tank.Sinatra, created a good news account in 2017 after Hurricane Harvey. He publishes across platforms, including Twitter and Facebook, but he said that Instagram is where the posts perform best. “I’m seeing more growth on my page than I’ve seen since the first year,” he said.
The team behind the World Record Egg recently introduced a good-news Instagram account called @Sunny_Side_News. The account ballooned to more than 162,000 followers in a week without any promotion.
The most popular good-news accounts are focused on delivering coronavirus-related stories with a positive, productive message.
Alissa Khan-Whelan, a founder of @Sunny_Side_News, said she thinks carefully about how to frame stories to mitigate stress on readers and encourage sharing.
“We tend not to use the negative language,” she said. “The other day I could have used the word ‘death’ in the headline. I thought, Do I want someone scrolling to see the word death? Instead I used ‘lives lost.’” But good-news publishers said that news that’s framed too positively can also end up alienating readers.
“There’s a line,” said Resch. “You can’t come across as preachy and sappy.”
Fact-Checking the Content
Often, the most widely shared good-news items are baseless. National Geographic, for its part, has been vigilant about correcting the record. A story sparked by a tweet about swans returning to the Venice canals racked up hundreds of thousands of retweets but quickly fell apart under scrutiny. And when footage of an orangutan washing her hands began to spread on social media, urging viewers to “be more like Sandra,” the writer Natasha Daly informed readers that the video was real but had nothing to do with public health measures; it was filmed in November 2019.
“For these stories to really have lasting power they have to be rigorous journalism,” said Klein, of The Washington Post. “We don’t just pull a cool video or tweet off the internet.”
Nontraditional media companies like @TanksGoodNews and @Sunny_Side_News also do their part to verify stories before publishing them to Instagram.
“It’s a massive responsibility to use your platform to share news, so we always want to be very strict with our sources and ensure we fact check everything,” said Khan-Whelan.
Kristi Carter, the founder and CEO of Global Positive News Network, said her website cites only reputable sources when aggregating news. The company is also making a push into original, nonnews content, such as interviews with nonprofits and startups making change in the world. Carter plans to introduce a podcast this month, in which she will interview actresses and entrepreneurs about ways to stay positive during the pandemic.
News for the Public Good
News publishers often use metadata to keep advertising off articles about tragedy. And brands that advertise on their websites now seem to be taking a similar tack, using software to restrict their ads from appearing alongside coronavirus news, The Wall Street Journal reported.
Good news should theoretically offer a safe space for brands, but some good-news sites are feeling the crunch from advertisers, too.
“Our advertisers are pretty unsure of what’s going to happen in one month or two months, so they’re holding onto their money right now,” said Harvey of Good Good Good. “We are seeing a lot fewer brands willing to pull the trigger.”
The administrators of good-news accounts on Instagram say they have not monetized their accounts yet, despite their popularity. For some, it’s on principle.
“I haven’t made a penny,” said Michelle Figueroa, who runs @GoodNews_Movement.
“I don’t monetize,” said Mauro Gatti, the founder of @The_Happy_Broadcast. “I refuse 100% of inbound requests because I want to keep it focused on the goal of improving mental health.”
Klein said she doesn’t see the interest in good news slowing anytime soon. Across the country people are still isolated, stressed out and grieving.
“A lot of traffic on good news stories is driven by social media,” she said, “especially now when everyone’s stuck in their house. While in the past someone might have scrolled through a headline that might be a feel-good story, now they might stop and click on it.”
“There’s so many ways this pandemic is affecting people’s lives,” said Lakin Hutcherson, “but one thing we all have in common is the need for relief from it.”

March was shaping up to be a good month for Brian Bowen Smith, a photographer in Los Angeles who has worked for Vogue and GQ. He had five big jobs lined up, including shoots for two Netflix posters. All five were canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic.
“There is no work whatsoever,” he said. “It’s kind of scary, actually.”
To fill his newly free hours, Bowen Smith drove to Joshua Tree National Park and trained his camera on the barren landscape. It was a long way from the work that usually pays his bills. In recent years, when he is not photographing Christian Bale, Miley Cyrus and Issa Rae for major magazines, Bowen Smith has shot ad campaigns for Marc Jacobs and other fashion companies.
Now he is telling himself that everything will be OK. “A lot of stuff can be done remotely,” he said. “And maybe that’s going to be our future. Everyone wears masks.”
As practitioners of a craft that requires long hours of getting up close and personal with their subjects, photographers have been affected by social distancing restrictions perhaps more than other media workers.
“Photographers can’t do what reporters can do — they can’t be on the phone,” said María Salazar Ferro, emergencies director of the Committee to Protect Journalists. “They have to be very close to the action.”
Josh Ritchie, a freelance photographer in Florida, estimated that he lost $10,000 in recent weeks because of canceled assignments. To scrounge up money, his attorney has been scouring the web for illegal use of his images.
“At night, I’m binge-watching ‘Tiger King’ and having mini panic attacks,” Ritchie said.
Some photojournalists, like Gary He, have gone in search of images particular to a unique moment. One of He’s photographs, taken last month for the food website Eater, captured an unsettling scene that would have been unremarkable before the spread of the virus: Dozens of people, including delivery workers, crowded on a Manhattan sidewalk as they awaited pickup orders from the restaurant Carbone.
“I did a lot more shooting from across the street than I normally would have,” He said in a text message. And that meant a change in gear. “I use a midrange zoom for most of my work,” he added, “and I’ve been using the longer end of the lens a little bit more these days, to get me a few feet further away from my subjects, mostly for their safety and comfort.”
For an Eater shoot last week focused on New York City restaurant workers, He moved in close, wearing a mask, to take intimate portraits.
Some photographers have come down with the virus. Mark Kauzlarich, a freelance photojournalist and commercial photographer whose work has appeared in The New York Times, The Atlantic and Vanity Fair, said he got very sick last month. Doctors told him it was COVID-19, although he was not tested.
“I had said very openly I was sure I was going to get sick,” he said. “We have to be in the field. There’s no way to completely mitigate.”
Kauzlarich, who is on the mend, sounded as if he would not change his approach. “To be a good journalist,” he said, “you can’t be 40 feet away.”
Anthony Causi, a staff sports photographer for The New York Post, died of COVID-19, the paper announced Sunday. A spokeswoman said The Post did not know how Causi had contracted the disease.
The pandemic may be the biggest news story of a generation and, while taking precautions, many editors have sought to get images that show it. On March 10, Radhika Jones, the editor-in-chief of Vanity Fair, commissioned Alex Majoli to photograph his hard-hit home country, Italy. Vanity Fair published his photo essay on Sicily two weeks later.
Jones said that Majoli’s experience, which has included stints in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq, made her confident that he would take care of himself.
“There is something that is so powerful about an image,” Jones said. “It doesn’t require translation. We made these pictures in Italy, and in certain ways they’re specific to that experience and even specific to this photographer as an Italian. But they’re also about humanity, and they are universal.”
Caitlin Ochs, a freelance photojournalist in Brooklyn, captured images of daily life in the borough amid the outbreak for a Reuters project. Before another assignment, for The Wall Street Journal, an editor at the paper provided her with a Ziploc bag containing N95 masks, gloves and hand sanitizer.
Her daily disinfecting routine, informed by an emergency room nurse whom she photographed, can take more than an hour. At the end of a day’s work, she puts on new gloves and wipes down her equipment — cameras, lenses, lens caps, cables — with a 70% isopropyl alcohol solution. She also sprays the floor, light switches and faucets with a bleach solution. Before she showers, she stuffs her clothes into a garbage bag to wash later.
“Sometimes all this feels crazy, like I’m turning into a hypochondriac,” Ochs said in an email. “But I’m trying to work from the side of being overly cautious.”
Compounding the challenge is the fact that staff jobs for photographers are hard to come by, and many work freelance. The Juntos Photo Coop, made up of four photojournalists in Arizona, published an open letter arguing that the coronavirus crisis had exposed inequitable working conditions for freelance photographers. The group demanded that media organizations provide photographers with protective gear, mental health check-ins and emergency health insurance.
“We’re finding out that the most vulnerable people in our industry are the ones without health insurance, who can’t pay rent, who can’t afford to quarantine,” said Caitlin O’Hara, a Coop member. “We’re going to lose all these diverse voices in our industry if only the people who can afford to quarantine can keep working.”
Despite the hazards, many photojournalists are driven by a need to record what the world looks like at a dramatic time.
“This kind of story is why we all became journalists, no?” said He, the photojournalist. “The pandemic is historic and, especially because of the social distancing, with everyone indoors, there’s a real need for trained storytellers to inform readers about what’s really going on out there.”
He added, “I’d do the work for free if I had to.”

Coronavirus Has Lifted Leaders Everywhere. Don’t Expect That to Last. [With graphic(s)]

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
BRUSSELS — President Emmanuel Macron, never very popular, has touched his highest approval ratings in France since the onset of the coronavirus. As Italy has been devastated, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has hit a remarkable 71%, up 27 points. Even in Britain, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson waffled over a strong response, then became seriously ill himself, the government is the most popular in decades.
There is nothing like a good crisis to get diverse populations to rally around their leaders. When people are confused and afraid, they tend to trust their governments because to think that authorities are themselves confused and afraid, let alone incompetent, is too much to bear.
The question is whether that will last once the crisis eases, criticism mounts and normal politics resumes. Usually, it does not last long. Formal inquiries into the inevitable errors and mistakes soon follow, and voters, if allowed, often take their revenge, even on the most effective leaders.
And it is safe to say that many of those getting a boost for the moment have been less than effective, judging by the crushing toll of a virus impervious to partisan bluster and unforgiving of mistakes.
The uncertainties may best be demonstrated in the United States, where President Donald Trump, in a highly charged election year, got only a small bump up that did not last, given widespread ambivalence about how the White House has handled the pandemic.
“The initial instinct is to rally around the flag because it is seen as unpatriotic and unhelpful not to do so,” said Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations. “But societies can’t be mobilized in perpetuity. There’s inevitably a fatigue, and people will ask more difficult questions.”
George Robertson, the former NATO secretary-general and British defense secretary, put it bluntly: “People do rally around, but it evaporates fast.”
But for now, at least, most government leaders have seen a surge in popular support as they combat a natural calamity that has wreaked havoc, even if sometimes made worse by their own inaction or miscalculation.
One might expect competent leadership to benefit more. That has been largely the case in countries, particularly in northern Europe, that imposed tough measures early that allowed them to start reopening tentatively this week.
In Austria, where returning workers are required to wear masks, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz’s approval has risen to 77%, up 33 points. Similarly, Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands has 75% support, up 30 points.
As some children return to school and her government prepares Danes for a phased reopening that could take many months, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen’s support is up 40 points, to 79%.
The virus has even managed to revive the lame-duck government in Germany, which had been shedding support to both the Greens and the far-right. Support for Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose performance has been mostly applauded both inside and outside the country, has risen 11 points, to 79%.
But even in the countries hardest hit by the virus, leaders have also gotten a boost, in ways that at first glance would not seem to make perfect sense.
Italy has the highest death toll in the world behind the United States, and the government seemed to fumble through a piecemeal response that was always a step behind the virus. But Conte has seen his overall approval rating soar.
“In a warlike situation, you want to trust who governs you, and that goes for bad leaders and competent ones,” said Nathalie Tocci, director of Italy’s Institute of International Affairs. “But my hunch is that ultimately true colors will show.”
Already there are signs that some leaders are slipping from their peaks as public patience wears thin.
In the case of Macron, who acknowledged mistakes as he announced an extension of France’s lockdown this week, polls show him back down to 43% from 59% March 13, the highest rating of his administration.
“Macron has never been much above 25%,” said Christian Lequesne, a professor of European Politics at Sciences Po, citing the yellow vest movement, union unhappiness with economic reforms and a popular perception that Macron is more a man of the banks than of the people.
“The French are beginning to focus on the frustrations, like the lack of masks and were we prepared for such a pandemic,” Lequesne said. “I’m sure when the lockdown is finished those questions will immediately be put into public debate, and it will be in the interest of opposition parties to blame the government.”
Macron’s presumed presidential opponent, Marine Le Pen of the far-right, populist National Rally, has been largely quiet in this time of national trauma, Lequesne said. “But when she speaks, she stresses the mask issue, the inability to manage the situation, and argues that we should have shut the borders completely.”
The crisis surrounding the coronavirus has produced much the same pattern as more violent conflict, when shows of support are typically immediate, if ephemeral.
In October 1979, President Jimmy Carter had a 31% approval rating. But after the siege of the U.S. Embassy in Iran, his approval hit 58% in January 1980. Carter was defeated by Ronald Reagan that November.
President George Bush’s approval rating rose from 58% in January 1991 to 87% after he drove Iraqi forces out of Kuwait. But he lost in 1992 to Bill Clinton.
President George W. Bush had a 51% approval rating in a Gallup poll just before Sept. 11. By the end of the month, his approval rating hit 90%. He narrowly won reelection three years later.
Trump’s smaller-than-expected bump, given the coronavirus, has made him something of an outlier. While other world leaders are reaching highs in the 70% range, his approval ratings hover between 40% and 45%, reflecting his strong base but also widespread criticism of his performance.
One “positive” result of the virus, Tocci said, may be the discrediting of populism and a return to trust in expertise and more rational government.
“The whole nationalist populist surge was connected to an historical moment where you could afford to play with fire,” she noted. “But now the situation is really bad, so much more dangerous, and people don’t want the easy nonsense from media-savvy populists.”
She cited polls showing that Matteo Salvini, the noisy Italian populist, has been losing support on the right, while another far-right opposition politician, Giorgia Meloni, “on the rational, coolheaded, nonpopulist right,” has done better.
Much of the public reaction may ultimately depend on how long the sense of crisis lasts, the onslaught of the virus being uncertain and open-ended. The unlocking of the lockdown will itself be fraught with political danger.
“Though we see these leaders making decisions, they’re not making them from a position of strength but from uncertainty and weakness,” said Nicholas Dungan, a Paris-based senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.
“They’re not leading so much as administering,” he said. “And once people are out and about and not confined anymore doing their duty, people are going to be quite angry, and this will lead to greater instability.”
Tony Travers, professor of government at the London School of Economics, noted that Winston Churchill was revered for having presided over the victory over Adolf Hitler but was summarily tossed out of office in 1945.
“Winning a war is absolutely no recipe for staying in office,” Travers said. “When the threat of illness goes away, then the consequences of being protected from the threat are very different.”
Governments will have to decide how to stagger a return to relative normality and how to deal with the emotional issues of inequality, unemployment and debt that will surge to the fore of the political debate.
“When we come out of this, the reckoning will start,” said Robin Niblett, director of the British foreign policy research institute Chatham House. “When people realize the expense, there will be questions of who gets taxed, how much the state owns and how much will people chafe against the controls,” he said.
Much remains unclear across the world, but “there is the potential for some serious political wind shears,” Niblett said. “Leaders are going to have a very rocky time toward autumn as the bills get delivered.”

BERLIN — Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday set in motion a plan for Germany to begin lifting social and economic restrictions in place because of the coronavirus, even as she warned that the road ahead would look less like a return to normal than a way to live with a pandemic that has overturned ordinary life.
The chancellor, a physicist by training, was typically restrained and focused on the science as she announced the government’s cautious step-by-step plan, for which she had won the agreement of regional leaders in Germany’s diffuse federal system.
Shorn of any bravado, her announcement seemed again to make Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, a de facto leader on the Continent and something of an example for Western nations looking to navigate the tricky course of rebooting economic activity and fighting the virus.
Her approach stood in stark contrast to the fraught political divisions in the United States, where state authorities have often been at odds with President Donald Trump, who has made forceful but erratic predictions about the virus.
“We have achieved something,” Merkel said at a news conference, “something that by no means was a given at the start — namely that our doctors and carers, all those in the medical field, in the hospitals, were not overwhelmed.”
But she added: “What we’ve achieved is an interim success — no more, no less. And I stress that it is a fragile interim success.”
An economic lockdown will remain largely in place for an additional 20 days, Merkel cautioned, and strict social distancing rules will remain in force.
But some shops will be allowed to reopen beginning next week — although only those with the necessary protections in place to allow strict social distancing to continue, she said.
Older students might be allowed back to school in May but that will be contingent on a radically changed set-up involving small groups, face masks and social distancing rules for school buses.
Every two weeks the government will take stock of infection numbers, Merkel said, to evaluate in real time the impact of each incremental measure that is lifted — and to avoid the danger of infections picking up pace again.
“We can’t have a wrong-headed push forward, even when the best intentions are behind it,” Merkel said. “We need to understand that we need to live with this virus as long as there is no vaccine and no treatment.”
Germany was hit hard by the pandemic but reacted quickly and decisively in trying to slow the spread of the virus.
A month ago, when the number of deaths stood at 90, Merkel’s government imposed strict social distancing rules that banned groups of more than two people of different households from gathering, and that shut down much of the economy.
By Wednesday, the number of infections in Germany stood at 136,616, the third-highest toll in Europe, after Spain and Italy. But the number of new daily infections has tapered off and the number of deaths, now at 3,428, has remained low compared with other countries.
Germany’s strategy of early and widespread testing and its large number of intensive care beds help explain the country’s relatively low mortality rate, but the trust in Merkel’s leadership and the resulting compliance with government measures has contributed too, virologists say.
As in previous stages of the pandemic, Merkel consulted widely before she made her announcement Wednesday. She had studied the recommendations from a panel of 26 top academics from a range of fields including behavioral psychology and ethics, and then hammered out an agreement with the governors of Germany’s 16 states.
Highlighting this broad consensus, the chancellor was flanked at her hourlong news conference not just by her finance minister, but also by the governor of Bavaria and the mayor of Hamburg.
“Germany has a collective philosophy, and the debates of recent days have ended up in a good result,” said Markus Söder, the Bavarian governor, who has not been shy to criticize Merkel in the past. “All states are completely united with the federal government on the strategy and the strategy is caution.”
In a week where several smaller countries in Europe have begun loosening restrictions, many had been eagerly waiting for Germany to come forward with a plan to emerge from the economic lockdown.
Merkel’s announcement came as the German government issued a bleak assessment of the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the economy, saying the country was headed for a steep recession and a surge in joblessness.
Among the first shops allowed to reopen are bookstores, bike stores and car dealers. But they all have to ensure that the number of customers inside is limited while also avoiding long lines from forming outside.
All schools will stay closed for another three weeks and primary schools and nurseries for longer, the chancellor said. Effective immediately, the German government is also “urgently” recommending the use of face masks in enclosed public spaces like shops and public transport, but stopped short of making masks mandatory as they are in neighboring Austria.
Restaurants and bars will have to wait longer, and large events like soccer matches remain banned until Aug. 31. Religious services won’t resume until places of worship have put in place measures to ensure the required distance between worshippers.
During Wednesday’s news conference, the chancellor thanked citizens for obeying strict social distancing rules and living with so many restrictions, stressing that Germany’s relative success in combating the virus was because of their cooperation.
“The curve has become flatter,” Merkel said, referring to the number of new daily infections.
But she cautioned against a false sense of security, saying the achievements could quickly be reversed.
“We don’t have much leeway,” she said.
“If we now allow more public life, in small steps, then it is very important that we can trace infection chains even better,” she said. “That must be our aim: to trace every infection chain.”
To that end, she said, Germany’s testing capacities would be increased. The country is currently capable of testing 100,000 people a day, more than any other country in Europe.
Earlier Wednesday, the European Commission presented a road map for countries in the 27-country bloc planning their own exit strategies. Chief among its recommendations is a German-style testing regime that allows for the tracing and quarantining of those who are sick while also slowly allowing those who are not to go back to some activities.
The chancellor went into detailed explanations of the science behind her own plan.
A key variable the government was looking at, she said, is the so-called reproduction factor of the virus — the number of people an infected person passes the virus on to.
That factor currently stands at about 1, she said, meaning that one person gets infected by every newly infected person. If that factor rose even to 1.1, the German health care system would reach capacity by October, she said.
If it were allowed to rise to 1.2 — so out of five infected people one infects not one but two additional people — that limit is reached by July.
“With 1.3,” Merkel continued, “we have reached the limit of our health care system by June.”
“So you can see how small our leeway is,” she said, “the entire development rests on having a number of infections that we can keep track of and trace.”

At its most luxurious, the home office is a subsidiary of leisure space: a sun-drenched room in a second home from which the boss can check in on everyone back at the office. In its more utilitarian form, it is, at least, personalized and private. There’s a chair, a desk and, ideally, a door. There’s probably other stuff in there too, like filing cabinets and unseasonal clothes and a guest bed. But it’s a place to work.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 29% of wage and salary workers could work at home in some capacity in 2017, while 25% actually did so. Now, however, workers with home offices are spending more time in them than ever intended. Plenty more are simply working from home however and wherever possible: at the table; at the counter; in bed; on the couch; in the garage.
Most workplaces aren’t ready for this. Most living spaces aren’t either. Yet millions of us have been sent home and may be there for a while. Perhaps you are one of them.
Whether you are working, avoiding work, balancing work with care for others or looking for work, chances are your temporary office is neither an optimized nor particularly happy place right now. I have no tips for optimizing it, in the aspirational work-from-home, escape-the-office sense.
Let’s lower our expectations. Here are a few ways to make working from home less miserable, according to experts.
Focus on Posture
Karen Loesing, a certified ergonomics assessment specialist, helps people design their workspaces for maximum comfort and productivity. She can tell you what to buy and how to set it up.
But right now you may not want, or be able, to buy new things. According to Loesing, much of the standard equipment on the market leaves something to be desired anyway. “The average desk for years has been at around 29 inches, and that fits hardly anybody in a correct posture,” she said. (Most people end up with a desk surface that’s too high.)
Wherever you’re able to sit, there are some basic principles to keep in mind, Loesing said. Your hands should be on your keyboard, with your forearms basically flat and elbows bent at a right angle. Your back should be supported (“If you’re not sitting at the back of the chair for support, it’s like you’re holding a weight all day long,” she said) and slightly reclined — around 15 degrees from straight. Your feet should be resting on the ground, with your knees bent as close to 90 degrees as possible.
This may not be easy at the kitchen table in a wooden chair, so do what you can with pillows, boxes, plastic storage containers or books. “Don’t sit on a stabilization ball,” Loesing said. “Those are for gyms.”
Then there’s your screen. “Your whole entire posture is going to be related to where your monitor is,” Loesing said. If your monitor is too low, you’ll slump forward and, sooner or later, be in pain. “If you’re looking straight ahead, you want to be about 4 inches below the top of screen,” she said.
To achieve this setup, place your laptop on a stack of books and connect a keyboard, which should sit on your work surface. (External keyboards are still widely available and affordable if you must order one.)
If your work involves papers, note that commercial document holders are intended to sit between your keyboard and screen. You can use a clipboard or a thin book leaned against the bottom of an external monitor to create this effect. (If you have access to an external display — and don’t discount using your television for this, whether over Wi-Fi, with a feature like Apple AirPlay, or by using a cable — you can turn your laptop’s screen into a document holder.)
Loesing said that many of her clients are enthusiastic about switching to standing desks. “They’ve read all this material about how sitting is the new smoking,” she said. “They’re excited. It’s a novelty.”
Do it if you want — the same guidelines for your monitor and arms apply, although you should be careful when stacking boxes to get your laptop 5 or 6 feet off the ground — but don’t expect to stand all day. Maybe 20% or 30% of the time, Loesing said. Try not to lock your knees. Throw a book on the floor to lift up one foot at a time — this can help ward off discomfort and keep you aware of your posture.
You may be surprised at how quickly standing in place becomes uncomfortable. Walking for hours may feel fine; the discomfort of standing in place, even for much shorter times, can sneak up on you.
When your workspace stops feeling good, the best thing you can do, Loesing said, is move around. Take breaks. Sit somewhere else for a few minutes. Look out the window frequently, and remind yourself that this won’t go on forever.
Create Boundaries
Real offices are designed according to all sorts of theories and principles: correct values for density, plans for lighting and acoustics, flow. The emergency home office, in contrast, was most likely designed for something else: eating, sleeping or storage.
George Evageliou, president of Urban Homecraft, a custom furniture company, suggests taking a moment to visualize the office you want, even if it’s out of reach. “Look for the ideal, understanding that you’re not going to get it,” said Evageliou, who is currently locked down in a 250-square-foot studio apartment. “Whatever you get is going to be better for it.”
This exercise, in the moment, may feel extreme. Ideal: an office with a door, a space to work, a clearer line between the stresses of home and the stresses related to work. Improved reality: a table in a kitchen or living room, cleared off, where nothing can happen but work.
If space is your problem, that’s fine. “Try to create delineations within a room,” Evageliou said. (He spoke to me from a desk installed underneath a lofted bed.) A clear workspace of any sort — a few square feet surrounded by an invisible fence — can help maintain mental boundaries, too.
Knowing that you’re not redesigning your home, or signing up to do this forever, can recast otherwise less-than-appealing prospects as reasonable concessions to a need for privacy, space and emotional separation. “A closet is an ideal place for a desk,” Evageliou said. Yes, it’s a closet. But it’s also, he said, “a great spot to eliminate distractions and focus.”
Having a truly separate space in which to work, no matter how small, can pay off in other ways. “It makes it much more pleasurable to return to the dinner table, or to sit down on the couch and watch TV,” Evageliou said. Maybe most of your home has become a borderless, chaotic work/child care/storage/food preparation zone. A tiny quadrant for thinking and dealing with the outside world will help.
So can its inverse: Pick a truly work-free space, even if it’s just your bed, and keep it sacred.
There may be no space to put to work, or to make sacred against it, in your suddenly more crowded home. Take your dog — or yourself — on a socially distanced walk around a city or suburb in lockdown and you may witness another way in which a need for space, privacy and silence has superseded the aspirational “work from home” ideals of just a few weeks ago.
Ideal: a space of your own to figure out the confusing and terrifying scenario that is confronting everyone in different ways, separate from the rest of your home, maybe with comfortable seating, silence and good lighting. Reality: people on their phones and computers, or with pens in hand and stacks of papers beside them, sitting in the passenger seats of parked cars. You’re not driving anywhere. Why not enjoy, if only for a few minutes, an office with a door, and a view?

Sherri Denney was in the fourth day of quarantine in her home in Springboro, Ohio, when she thought about the toll the coronavirus was taking. She sat in her recliner chair and cried as the state’s governor checked off the number of dead and sickened, knowing there would be more the next day. Overwhelmed, Denney, 55, tried to put her feelings into words.
“Wow,” she began writing on an old sketch pad, quickly realizing the precise words would not come easy. “That’s all I can say. My emotions are ranging from sadness to fear to anger.”
The week before, a woman in Nevada turned to her own version of journaling. Mimi J. Premo recorded a video on her cellphone, giving voice to a kind of stunned weariness so many Americans are feeling. And in Indianapolis, in an interview recorded by two university research assistants, a man who is diabetic and HIV positive talked about how the speed and unclear ways of transmission “freaks me out.”
The three accounts, snapshots of intimate moments during the pandemic, are a response to a call from historians and archivists across the country to document this extraordinary moment in history.
Universities, archives and historical societies, ranging from the Smithsonian Natural Museum of American History to a tiny college radio station in Pennsylvania, are rushing to collect and curate the personal accounts of how people are experiencing this sprawling public health crisis as told in letters and journals, audio and video oral histories, and on social media.
They are inviting people such as Denney and Premo to share stories and material from the 2020 coronavirus and its aftermath in real time. The idea is to bridge communal history and offer a fully realized look at the outbreak that can help the public, researchers and policymakers better understand how the pandemic permeated our lives.
Whether a somber handwritten journal or an endearing Instagram post, the contributions will offer a look at a nation attacked by a virus coast to coast. The stories document sickness and death. The profound disruption of American rhythms and rituals, evidenced by empty shelves and streets. The gnawing restlessness of sheltering in place. The ways people showed resilience and managed to still find joy.
“What we as contributors record is what the future generations will remember,” said Mark Tebeau, one of the project directors of a virtual archive founded at Arizona State University.
The team of historians and artists launched A Journal of the Plague Year: An Archive of COVID-19 on March 13, two days after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a pandemic. The name was inspired by Daniel Defoe’s novel “A Journal of the Plague Year,” which chronicles the bubonic plague in 1665 London through the lens of one man.
With the help of graduate students and scholars from about 20 universities, the archive has amassed more than 1,400 entries from 500 contributors across the world, including Australia, Peru and China.
Tebeau, a public and digital historian who heads the university’s public history program, said they are also reaching out to marginalized communities to ensure the project is inclusive.
One of the first entries came from Premo, 36, a customer service representative who lives near Las Vegas. She had not left her home for nearly a week in mid-March when she submitted the video. In the clip, just over two minutes, she wonders who might be stricken with COVID-19 next. A neighbor? A friend? A family member?
“No matter how many Skype meetings I have, no matter how much I am on Facebook, no matter how much I write in my journal and try to laugh through the tears, it feels so different,” Premo said.
“Living with this uncertainty is,” she added, pausing in the video, “it’s unsettling but I feel that no matter what happens, I guess it’s hope that keeps my spirits up.”
Last week, the Library of Congress received its first COVID-19 collection: street scenes from New York, New Jersey and California by the photographer Camilo Jose Vergara. In addition to documenting stay-at-home life, mask styles, health care workers, the economic effect and how people are helping one another, the Library of Congress is also collecting web content, data and maps.
The Smithsonian National Museum of American History deployed a Rapid Response Collecting Task Force to chronicle the pandemic. “Museum staff is working to formulate a plan that achieves a balance between the urgency to document the ephemeral aspects of the historic turning points as they happen,” the museum said in a statement, “and the need to provide a long-term historical perspective.”
In response to the pandemic shutdown, StoryCorps, the story-sharing nonprofit, moved its platform online for the first time. Interviews that used to be recorded in a physical studio can now be done using video conference technology. The audio and a photo from each interview will be preserved in the StoryCorps Archive and with the Library of Congress.
And students at Neumann University in Pennsylvania set up a series called the Coronavirus Diaries on the school’s radio station, WNUW-FM. Listeners record themselves sharing pandemic stories using a voice memo app or by leaving a phone message at the station. The diaries air hourly.
Local archives are also calling for oral histories and materials. The Atlanta History Center, for example, is asking the city’s residents for digital files and physical artifacts (the latter would be collected once the center reopens). The project, called Corona Collective, lays out how seemingly mundane items — a no-frills furlough notice, a handmade banner thanking emergency medical workers — help tell the story of how daily life in Atlanta changed.
Similar efforts are cropping up in big cities and small towns. Sometime during spring break in March, Jason Kelly, a professor at the Indianapolis campus of Indiana University, realized the coronavirus was likely to be the defining event for generations. For a professor who teaches digital public history, it meant something else, too: How people experienced the outbreak needed to be captured and organized in a searchable database. That was the seed of what is now the COVID-19 Oral History Project, based at the Arts and Humanities Institute on the Indianapolis campus.
Kelly turned to the 19 graduate students in his digital public history class and asked if they would put other coursework on hold to focus on the project, which uses “rapid response collecting” for COVID-19 lived experiences. Eventually the project will merge with the larger Plague archive.
Such efforts to collect memories in real time was also used by groups after the Sept. 11 attacks, Hurricane Katrina and the Pulse nightclub massacre.
The page from Denney’s diary became one of the first submissions to the coronavirus public memory project set up by Wright State University.
“All of a sudden the pandemic was right here and personal,” said Dawne Dewey, head of special collections and archives at the university. “We put the call out because we need stories to help future generations understand this moment in history.”
The archive, partly housed on the fourth floor of the school library, includes the journals of survivors of the 1918 flu pandemic. One was written by Donald McKinney Wallace, a farmer who served in the Army.
McKinney was sickened with the flu in the fall of 1918. He was quarantined in barracks, separated from others by blankets hung from a wire. He wrote about the daily meal of soft boiled eggs and cold toast, feeling weak, a stubborn fever, isolation and the deaths of fellow soldiers — an account that could have been written today.
“A century ago, people told their stories in written journals,” said Dewey. “Now, we are capturing people’s thoughts and experiences through social media posts, email, audio and photographs.”

WASHINGTON — An outbreak of coronavirus infections at an upscale Whole Foods in the heart of the nation’s capital has focused attention on the plight of grocery store workers deemed essential to stay on the job during the pandemic but increasingly falling ill to its ravages.
The Whole Foods near Washington’s trendy Logan Circle told employees on Wednesday that a worker had contracted the virus, one of at least six, but that the store would not close, according to a report by WUSA, a local CBS-affiliated station. Instead, managers would order a deep cleaning with workers staying on the job, according to an email sent to employees that was obtained by the station.
Workers were free to take leave without penalty through the end of April, the email said, but it would be unpaid.
An employee at the store, who declined to be identified, passed a note to a New York Times photographer there on Tuesday stating that 16 employees at the location were confirmed to be infected, a significant outbreak in a city that has so far escaped the horrors of New York, Detroit and New Orleans.
In an email, a spokesman for Whole Foods confirmed that the store had “multiple team members” with diagnoses of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, but that the site had “undergone multiple deep cleanings and disinfections” overnight in recent days that allowed it to remain open during regular business hours.
Another Whole Foods location in Washington’s Foggy Bottom neighborhood was previously closed to the public for cleaning after a worker tested positive for the virus, but the company’s spokesman said the closure was warranted only because overnight cleaning was not available.
Such problems are not isolated. The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which represents over 900,000 grocery workers nationwide, estimated on Monday that 30 of its members had died from COVID-19 and another 3,000 had taken sick days after showing signs of illness or other possible coronavirus-related complications. The union also said that in a survey of 5,000 of its members, 85% said customers in their stores were not practicing social distancing as recommended.
Though Washington has not had the dramas of other cities, it is considered an emerging hot spot, with nearly 2,200 infections and 72 deaths. Its rate of infection, measured against the district’s small population, is above average compared with the states.
The city has required essential businesses to take a variety of steps to enforce social distancing, sending food retailers rushing to install trappings like hand sanitizer stations, plexiglass barriers between workers and customers, and floor stickers marking the government-recommended six-foot separation distance.
However, the protocols largely leave it to stores themselves to enforce other guidelines such as the requirement that patrons wear masks while shopping. More serious measures like closures of essential stores have also been left to management.
At another Whole Foods location in the city’s H Street corridor, foot traffic in and out of the store was funneled to a single entrance, where a guard was stationed to turn away shoppers without a mask.
Last week, officials at the daily White House task force briefing began listing Washington as one of the cities most likely to see a spike in coronavirus cases over the coming weeks, alongside Baltimore and Philadelphia.
As cases have increased, local officials have been forced to balance efforts to enforce public health initiatives with the need to ensure access to groceries.
On April 8, Mayor Muriel E. Bowser issued an order effectively shutting down farmers markets and seafood vendors in the city until they can submit individual social distancing plans and receive approval from the government. On Wednesday, Bowser issued another order requiring all workers and customers of food sellers to wear masks and extending the city’s state of emergency through May 15.
Earlier this month, a Trader Joe’s store in Washington temporarily closed for cleaning after an employee tested positive. The retailer lists at least 18 future closings at other locations around the country on a running list on its website.
A spokeswoman for the Washington’s Health Department said essential businesses were not legally required to make a public disclosure about whether employees had tested positive for the virus. But according to protocols, retailers that do not comply with the mayor’s order could face civil penalties and license revocations.
The danger associated with working in grocery stores that see hundreds of shoppers each day has led to protests from workers involved in getting groceries to consumers. Last month, employees of Whole Foods and workers who fulfill orders for the grocery delivery service Instacart organized strikes over what they described as hazardous working conditions and insufficient protections.
Marc Perrone, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, said many workers have been forced to make do with limited protective gear as masks and other personal protective equipment, or PPE, have been diverted to medical workers and others dealing directly with people who are already symptomatic or known to be exposed to the virus.
“Masks and PPE ultimately went to first responders first, and then highest bidders,” Perrone said. “Some of our employers that we deal with lost shipments that were sent to other countries.”
But Perrone stressed that grocery store workers still come into contact with scores of shoppers on a daily basis, many of whom may be asymptomatic carriers.
Whole Foods employees are not represented by the union, but a coalition of employees who staged a “sickout” to protest working conditions in March have planned another protest on May 1, according to The Guardian.
The dilemma facing grocery stores comes amid a larger debate between policymakers and public health experts about how quickly to relax social distancing guidelines in the interest of spurring economic activity.
On Tuesday, Rep. Trey Hollingsworth, R-Ind., joined other lawmakers calling for a return to more normalcy, telling an Indianapolis radio station that deciding between continuing the stay-at-home orders and getting people back to school and work would be up to Congress.
“It is not zero evil, but it is the lesser of these evils and we intend to move forward in that direction,” he said. “That is our responsibility, and to abdicate that is to insult the Americans that voted us into office.”

NEW YORK — With New Yorkers self-quarantining, Rockefeller Center conjures up the promise of life returning to normal someday and the unshakable glory of the city. It was New York’s Depression-era version of building the pyramids. When it opened during the 1930s, the critic Lewis Mumford heaped abuse on it, then seemed to forget that he had ever said anything bad after it became a beloved emblem of art deco-era Manhattan and a midtown magnet.
Or as the famous Gershwin song from the time put it, “They all laughed at Rockefeller Center, now they’re fighting to get in.”
Not at the moment, of course. This is the latest in a series of condensed and edited architectural walks around town, which for the time being I am conducting with architects and others virtually, meaning via phone and Google maps. They’re meant to be consumed virtually, too.
Daniel Okrent is many things — a prolific historian, co-writer of the hit comedy revue “Old Jews Telling Jokes,” an inventor of Rotisserie League Baseball and the first public editor of The New York Times. He also happens to have written the book on Rockefeller Center: “Great Fortune: The Epic of Rockefeller Center.”
He suggested we “meet” on Fifth Avenue, between 49th and 50th streets, at the entrance to the Channel Gardens, the pedestrian passage that declines toward the skating rink, framing a postcard view of 30 Rock, the skyscraper formerly known as the RCA Building.
Michael Kimmelman: Why is it called the Channel Gardens?
Okrent: It’s named after the English Channel because it is flanked by two six-story buildings called the British Empire Building, to the north, and La Maison Française, to the south. To attract tenants, Rockefeller Center advertised itself as a hub for international trade. Congress actually passed a bill in 1932 making these buildings a free port, which enabled importers to bring goods in duty-free and store them on the premises — a commercial masterstroke. Another masterstroke by the developers was the decision to rent the second floor of the building just north of these two — the one guarded by Lee Lawrie’s famous “Atlas” sculpture — to the United States Passport Service for $1 a year. The presence of the passport office helped fill the center’s rental spaces with steamship companies, airlines, consulates, luggage stores and travel agencies.
Kimmelman: I remember as a child getting my passport at the office. My mother would take me to Rockefeller Center, we’d eat at Schrafft’s, and if she was browsing in Saks, we walked back to the subway via the Channel Gardens.
Okrent: Gertrude Stein, in her Gertrude Stein-ish way, said the Channel Gardens view was “the most beautiful thing I have ever seen ever seen ever seen.” Raymond Hood, who led the team of architects that designed Rockefeller Center, thought the slope downhill would help draw people from Fifth Avenue into the complex.
Kimmelman: The shift in grade does act like a portal.
Okrent: Hood had studied at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. It’s significant that he didn’t do a classic, triumphal arch. He designed a modern garden walkway, human-scaled, like the buildings on either side of it. Putting up these two six-story buildings on Fifth Avenue seemed incredibly uneconomical even at the time. But Hood — along with Todd and Rockefeller, the other key figures behind Rockefeller Center — wanted to break up the massing of the giant development to make it less monolithic, more coherent and inviting.
Kimmelman: You’re talking about John R. Todd, the developer, and John D. Rockefeller Jr.
Okrent: Family archivists call him Junior, so I do too. Junior set aside millions of dollars for the gardens, reflecting pools and art — works like Rene Paul Chambellan’s bronze fountainhead sculptures of mermaids and tritons in the Channel Gardens. Decorating a commercial development with gardens and pools and sculpture was unheard-of back then.
Kimmelman: What was on the site before?
Okrent: Since the early 19th century, Columbia University had owned the land — 12 acres bounded by Sixth and Fifth avenues and 49th and 51st streets. By the 1920s Fifth and Madison avenues were booming, but Columbia had let the property go to seed. It was flophouses, whorehouses and speak-easies. At the time, the Metropolitan Opera was looking for someplace to build a new home, and its trustees approached Junior about acquiring the site. He didn’t care much for opera but was a great benefactor of the city. So he negotiated a 99-year lease with the university, with the idea that the Met would build the opera house. The next day, pretty much, the stock market crashed, and the Met’s trustees, who were very rich people, claimed poverty. Couldn’t Junior build the opera house for them? He hit the roof — to the degree that a man so mild could hit the roof.
So he dropped the opera idea and in the teeth of the Depression decided to become a commercial developer.
Kimmelman: I’ve read that Rockefeller Center trailed only the federal government as an employer during those years, accounting for as many as 225,000 jobs, if you include suppliers mining iron ore in Alabama and copper in Arizona, workers fabricating windows in Pennsylvania, etc.
Okrent: The center accounted for as many as 75,000 jobs in New York alone. After the Empire State Building was completed in 1932, remember, it was the only private construction project of any size in the city until after the Second World War. There’s a bas-relief near the rear entrance to 630 Fifth Ave. that pays tribute to the workers who built Rockefeller Center by the well-known sculptor Gaston Lachaise. Although labor and construction prices plummeted during the Depression, Todd and Junior used the opportunity not to cut costs but to spend extravagant amounts on materials like excess structural steel, which they added to various buildings to support lush roof gardens.
The goal was to add luxury and surprise, to enhance the public experience — within a family of materials and forms.
Kimmelman: You might say the plan for Rockefeller Center does something similar, fitting itself into the city grid while standing out.
Okrent: If I had to pick one reason for Rockefeller Center’s success, it’s how it was fitted into the street grid. The Channel Gardens lead down to the skating rink, which originally was conceived as a sunken plaza for high-end shops and restaurants. It was a dead end. It turned out customers didn’t want to climb down a flight of stairs then trudge back out. So the stores and restaurants flopped. Things turned around after they brought in a guy from Cleveland who had figured out a way to maintain artificially refrigerated skating rinks. People were only too happy to pay for the privilege of being the entertainment for passersby, who loved to watch them.
Kimmelman: Meaning the former dead-end plaza was integrated with the flow of the city.
Okrent: It’s a miraculous place. Like a moment’s pause. Half a block away from the city’s main thoroughfare, with benches where you can stop and sit, and plantings in front of the RCA Building, you feel you’re in midtown and also apart from it.
Kimmelman: You haven’t talked about 30 Rock or the RCA Building.
Okrent: I still call it the RCA Building. Can’t help myself. Alice B. Toklas, who visited with Stein, said something like, it’s not the way it goes up into the air, it’s how it comes out of the ground. It rises with an almost physical energy. Hood used the tops of elevator banks as setbacks to let as much light into the office spaces as possible and used the tops of the larger setbacks for gardens. Todd figured tenants would pay another dollar per square foot to have garden access, so he was very happy to let Hood design them.
I like to walk west on 49th Street, around the corner, to the south entrance of the RCA Building, which is decorated with Leo Friedlander’s art deco nudes. Junior’s office was on the 56th floor of the RCA building. It was styled like an 18th-century English baronial mansion. His tastes were conservative. He detested the Friedlander nudes here and also the ones on the 50th Street side of the building so much that he refused to enter the building through those doors. But, significantly, he also never ordered the sculptures to be removed. He saw art as a public service. If we continue west on 49th Street, cross Sixth Avenue and then look back up at the third floor of the RCA Building (you don’t really get a clear view otherwise), we can find four bas-reliefs, carved in stone, still hard to see but striking, also by Lachaise. You might well ask, “What are they doing all the way up there?”
The answer is that when Rockefeller Center was built, the elevated train still ran up Sixth Avenue. Hood positioned the Lachaise reliefs so El riders passing through the station could see them.
Kimmelman: The train stopped at Rockefeller Center’s most famous building.
Okrent: A block north on Sixth Avenue, Radio City Music Hall.
Kimmelman: Designed by Edward Durell Stone and Donald Deskey.
Okrent: It was built to outshine the Roxy Theater, which was across Sixth Avenue. The Roxy had 6,200 seats. So Radio City advertised that it had 6,201. To reach that number, they had to include the chairs in front of the mirrors in the ladies’ rooms and the seats in the elevators for the elevator operators.
Kimmelman: I gather Radio City bombed at the start.
Okrent: They put on lavish shows that flopped. Things turned around when they started to focus on movies. But from Day One the building was a work of art. Remember Chambellan, who did the bronzes in the Channel Gardens? He did wonderful bas-reliefs on the Sixth Avenue side of the music hall, near 50th Street, that represent various forms of entertainment. My favorite was called “Jewish Vaudevillians.” I can never decide whether it was a tribute or an insult. I can tell you that there isn’t 1 in 10,000 people today who notices it depicts Jews.
For years I worked across Sixth Avenue in the Time-Life Building, and I never noticed Hildreth Meière’s polychrome roundels on the music hall’s south wall, representing Dance, Drama and Song. And farther east on 50th Street, the wonderful grillwork covering the fire escapes was Stone’s idea. He was eventually let go, having spent too many hours at the bar of the 21 Club. As one of his colleagues said, “Ed could draw anything except a sober breath.”
Kimmelman: Stone went on to team with Philip L. Goodwin and design the Museum of Modern Art’s first purpose-built home on 53rd Street. Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, Junior’s wife, was a founder of MoMA — one of the great patrons and pioneers of American modernism. Her taste was very different from Junior’s.
Okrent: There were, at one time, plans for a triumphal midblock boulevard linking Rockefeller Center with MoMA, which may explain why MoMA is the only major museum that isn’t on a corner or facing a plaza. The boulevard was supposed to extend, northward, the plaza between the RCA Building and the skating rink, culminating in a second plaza that would front the museum. There were also plans for a network of underground concourses beyond the existing ones at Rockefeller Center that would have connected the center to Grand Central Terminal, but the owners of Saks thwarted that.
Which brings us to a significant hole in the wall farther east on 50th Street, a vehicle entrance ramp that leads to an underground delivery network — one of the most crucial elements of Rockefeller Center. Trucks delivering to the center’s offices or commercial operations drive down to a turntable that directs delivery vehicles toward different spots below street level, where they unload their goods. This means, along 49th Street and 50th Street, between Fifth and Sixth avenues, unlike in the rest of midtown, you don’t have double-parked delivery trucks.
It’s part of what makes Rockefeller Center feel like an oasis.
Kimmelman: You realize we haven’t even circled one block yet.
Okrent: So let’s end back at the building on the corner of Fifth Avenue, where “Atlas” lives. They piped the 18th floor for nitrous oxide and compressed air.
Kimmelman: Laughing gas?
Okrent: To entice dentists. Thirty of them signed leases immediately. The developers had a scheme for everything. The south wing of this building was called the Palazzo d’Italia. Like Britain and France, Italy had its own pavilion. This was the 1930s. The original facade of the Italia building had a Pyrex sculpture that included a slogan associated with the Fascists, “Arte e Lavoro, Lavoro e Arte” [“Art and Work, Work and Art”]. It was covered up once the United States entered World War II.
But there’s still a remnant of fascist Italy. If you cross Fifth Avenue and look back at the building’s roofline, you can see four stone bas-reliefs representing different eras in Italian history. Second from the left: Mussolini’s symbol, the fasces.
Kimmelman: I hate to give a dictator the last word, so let me ask, what happened with the triumphal boulevard?
Okrent: The Rockefellers tried for years to make it happen. But the 21 Club was in the way, and its owners wouldn’t budge.
No matter how powerful the Rockefellers were, in the end even they were no match for the speak-easy business.

John Horton Conway, an English-born Princeton mathematician whose body of work ranged from the rigorously highbrow to the frivolously fun, earning him prizes and a reputation as a creative, iconoclastic and even magical genius, died Saturday in New Brunswick, New Jersey. He was 82.
His wife, Diana Conway, said his death, at a nursing home, was caused by COVID-19.
John Conway’s boundless curiosity produced profound contributions to number theory, game theory, coding theory, group theory, knot theory, topology, probability theory, algebra, analysis, combinatorics and more. Foremost, he considered himself a classical geometer.
“His swath was probably broader than anyone who ever lived,” said mathematician Neil Sloane, a collaborator with Conway and the founder of the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. “I’ve worked with a lot of people, and he was the fastest at solving a problem and would pursue a topic as far as it would go.” (The two were co-authors of 50 papers and published the 706-page book “Sphere Packings, Lattices and Groups.”)
During what Conway called his “annus mirabilis,” roughly 1969 to 1970, he discovered what’s known as the Conway group, an entity in the realm of mathematical symmetry that inhabits 24-dimensional space. He discovered a new type of number, “surreal numbers.” And he invented the cellular automaton Game of Life, which is among the most beautiful mathematical models of computation. He described it as a “no-player never-ending” game.
His friend Martin Gardner, the longtime mathematical games columnist for Scientific American, called the Game of Life Conway’s “most famous brainchild.” He reckoned that when it went viral on the internet — with addicts programming it at home and at work — one quarter of the world’s computers were playing it.
“Conway’s LIFE changed mine,” musician Brian Eno said in an email. “I think Conway himself thought it rather trivial, but for a nonmathematician like me, it was a shock to the intuition, a shattering revelation — to watch glorious complexity emerging from staid simplicity.”
Conway was proudest of his discovery of surreal numbers. (The Stanford computer scientist Donald Knuth had come up with the name while writing the novelette “Surreal Numbers: How Two Ex-Students Turned on to Pure Mathematics and Found Total Happiness.”)
Described by Gardner as “an astonishing feat of legerdemain,” the surreals are a super-continuum of numbers, including all the old-fashioned reals ones (integers, fractions and irrationals like pi) as well as those that go above, beyond, below and within, embracing both the infinites and the infinitesimals.
Conway always hoped that surreal numbers might find practical applications, perhaps in helping to illuminate the universe on the cosmic and quantum scales.
One of Conway’s favorite accomplishments was the Free Will Theorem, conceptualized casually over the course of a decade with his friend and fellow Princeton mathematician Simon Kochen and first published in 2006 (and later revised).
The theorem, simply put, is this: If physicists have free will while performing experiments, then elementary particles possess free will as well. And this, Conway and Kochen reckoned, probably explains why and how humans have free will in the first place.
“In mathematics and physics there are two kinds of geniuses,” Kochen said by phone from his home in Princeton, echoing something once said about the physicist Richard Feynman. “There are the ordinary geniuses — they are just like you and me but they are better at it; if we’d worked hard enough, maybe we could get some of the same results.
“But then there are the magical geniuses,” he added. “Richard Feynman was a magical genius. And the same always struck me about John — he was a magical mathematician. He was a magical genius rather than an ordinary genius.”
John Horton Conway was born on Dec. 26, 1937, in Liverpool, England, the third child and only son of Cyril and Agnes (Boyce) Conway. His father, an autodidact, had left school at age 14 and, with his photographic memory, made a living playing cards. Later he was a technician in the chemistry lab at the Liverpool Institute High School for Boys, setting up experiments for students, among them George Harrison and Paul McCartney.
Conway’s mother, a great reader, especially of Dickens, had worked from age 11. Family lore has it that she boasted about finding her son at age of 4 reciting the powers of two. At 18, in 1956, John left home for the University of Cambridge, where he earned his doctorate. His adviser, Harold Davenport, a number theorist, once said that when he would give Conway a problem to solve, “he would return with a very good solution to another problem.”
As a student, Conway cultivated his acknowledged lifelong preference for being lazy, playing games and doing no work. He could be easily distracted by what he called “nerdish delights.” He once went on a flexagon binge, courtesy of Gardner, who described flexagons as “polygons, folded from straight or crooked strips of paper, which have the fascinating property of changing their faces when they are flexed.”
He built a water-powered computer, which he called Winnie (Water Initiated Nonchalantly Numerical Integrating Engine). He read and annotated H.S.M. Coxeter’s edition of W.W. Rouse Ball’s classic work, “Mathematical Recreations and Essays” and wrote Coxeter a lengthy letter that started a lifelong friendship between these two classical geometers.
Hired at Cambridge as an assistant lecturer, Conway gained a reputation for his high jinks (not to mention his disheveled appearance). Lecturing on symmetry and the Platonic solids, he might bring in a turnip as a prop, carving it one slice at a time into, say, an icosahedron, with its 20 triangular faces, eating the scraps as he went. “He was by far the most charismatic lecturer in the faculty,” his Cambridge colleague Peter Swinnerton-Dyer once said.
Conway invented a profusion of games — like Phutball (short for Philosopher’s Football, which is a little like checkers on a Go board) and collected them in the book “Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays,” in collaboration with Elywn Berlekamp and Richard Guy.
All the gaming was supported by a loyal following of graduate students, among them Simon Norton, with whom Conway published the Monstrous Moonshine conjecture, investigating an elusive symmetry group that lives in 196,883 dimensions. (His doctoral student Richard Borcherds received the prestigious Fields Medal in 1998 for his proof of the conjecture.)
At the University of Cambridge Conway rose to become a professor in mathematics as well as a supernumerary fellow at Gonville and Caius College, his alma mater there. He was named a fellow of the Royal Society in 1981.
In 1985, with four co-authors, he published “The ATLAS of Finite Groups,” one of the most important books in group theory.
That same year, he was invited to give a talk at Princeton, and a job offer followed: In 1987, he took up the position of the John von Neumann professor of applied and computational mathematics. In announcing the hire, Princeton’s president called Conway “one of the most eminent mathematicians of the century.”
At Princeton Conway, with his mischievous and seductive aura, drew news media attention. Asked by a reporter for The New York Times about his life of the mind, he replied: “What happens most of the time is nothing. You just can’t have ideas often.”
He became a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1992. A fellow inductee, the mathematician Robert MacPherson, recalled that at the ceremony Conway accepted his honor in what appeared to be green running shorts.
His first two marriages, to Eileen Howe and Larissa Queen, ended in divorce.
In addition to his wife, he is survived by four daughters from his first marriage, Annie, Ellie and Susie Conway and Rosie Wayman; two sons from his second marriage, Oliver and Alex; a son with Diana Conway, Gareth; three grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.
At Princeton he was almost invariably recruited to give the first-year course intended to persuade students to become math majors. And he offered extracurricular content, like a campus tour titled “How to Stare at a Brick Wall.”
He gave over his summers — prime research time — to teaching at math camps. He was a star attraction, despite the fact that his talks were advertised vaguely as “John Conway Hour, NTBA” (Not to Be Announced). He would take topic requests from students and deliver an extemporaneous lecture.
Math, Conway believed, should be fun. “He often thought that the math we were teaching was too serious,” said Mira Bernstein, a mathematician and a former executive director of Canada/USA Mathcamp, an international summer program for high-school students. “And he didn’t mean that we should be teaching them silly math — to him, fun was deep. But he wanted to make sure that the playfulness was always, always there.”
Conway persevered in finding the fun through triple bypass surgery, a suicide attempt and a number of strokes. Sometimes he would regale anyone willing to listen on the science of rainbows or on his Doomsday rule for calculating the day of the week for any given date.
And there were ever more games of Phutball, which Conway was not very good at. Sometimes, when all seemed lost — when he was almost certainly beaten at his own game, though he might yet magically prevail — he’d delight in borrowing from Mark Twain, admonishing his opponents, “Reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated!”

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts endorsed Joe Biden on Wednesday, becoming the most high-profile progressive woman in the party to try to help the former vice president expand his appeal among liberal voters.
Her announcement follows Sen. Bernie Sanders’ on Monday and former President Barack Obama’s on Tuesday. Warren’s support had been a foregone conclusion, but she left the timing of her announcement up to Biden’s team, according to people familiar with the matter. There was no holdup or demand for concessions, these people said.
The process of securing prominent endorsements for Biden has been underway for some time, people close to the campaign said, but some Democrats said it was important to give Sanders space to endorse on his own terms, out of respect for his campaign and his supporters, whom Biden must now win over. Obama’s endorsement made repeated overtures to Sanders and his backers.
The series of endorsements has been a carefully choreographed show of force, reminiscent of the one-two-three punch of support Biden received from Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Beto O’Rourke before Super Tuesday. It is also a show of unity designed to quash any narrative of a fractured Democratic Party.
Democrats are indeed, for once, in array, which was far from an inevitable outcome after a primary in which the party’s ideological fault lines were bitterly clear. The relatively swift arrival of two liberal challengers, Warren and Sanders, into the Biden camp is a striking reminder of the sense of urgency among Democrats to coalesce against President Donald Trump when the public’s attention is so focused on the coronavirus.
During the primary campaign, Biden criticized Warren as having an “elitist attitude” and repeatedly jabbed at Sanders for not being a card-carrying Democrat. Warren and Sanders were also sharply critical and still differ with Biden on many issues — but their endorsement announcements this week were as positive and helpful as one could hope for from ideological opponents.
Two swing-state senators, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Gary Peters of Michigan, also formally backed Biden on Wednesday, as did Valerie Jarrett, a former senior adviser to Obama.
In her endorsement video, Warren said, “In this moment of crisis, it’s more important than ever that the next president restores Americans’ faith in good, effective government.
“Joe Biden has spent nearly his entire life in public service. He knows that a government run with integrity, competence and heart will save lives and save livelihoods. And we can’t afford to let Donald Trump continue to endanger the lives and livelihoods of every American.”
Since Warren ended her own campaign, she and Biden have spoken multiple times about policy issues, including Biden’s plan to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. At the staff level, Warren’s chief campaign strategist, Joe Rospars, and Anita Dunn, a senior adviser to Biden, have been engaged in talks bridging the two camps.
In late March, Biden endorsed forgiving at least $10,000 in federal student loans and credited Warren for the proposal. Over the weekend, he said during his podcast that he supported immediately increasing Social Security payments by $200 a month, another proposal that Warren had championed.
“One thing I appreciate about Joe Biden is that he will always tell you where he stands,” Warren said in her endorsement video. “When you disagree, he’ll listen — not just listen, but really hear you and treat you with respect, no matter where you’re coming from. And he has shown throughout this campaign that when you come up with new facts or a good argument, he’s not too afraid or too proud to be persuaded.”
The Biden campaign has broadly signaled a willingness to hire staff from formal rivals as they gear up for the general election matchup with Trump, and some outreach is already underway, but there have been no promises to hire a specific number of aides, a person familiar with the matter said.
While the daily stream of endorsements this week were unmistakably designed to signal party unity, Biden has also sometimes struggled to drive a consistent message of his own amid the coronavirus outbreak. He has often been overshadowed by Trump and the governors who are on the front lines of the fight. This week, he was back in the spotlight.
“It’s a difficult news environment,” said Jennifer Palmieri, a former senior aide to Hillary Clinton and Obama. “I think it’s smart to do a dramatic show of force and have everyone go in one week, because it just serves to raise the stakes for Democrats. It raises the stakes for November.”
“You sacrifice the longevity of the storyline,” Palmieri added, “but I think you want to have the drama of everyone going in one week rather than the drumbeat.”
Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, said she was not worried about disunity. The primary “just didn’t have the vitriol” of 2016, she said, and Democratic voters are overwhelmingly in favor of a singular goal.
“They just really want Trump to be gone,” Greenberg said.
But even with the party largely united, and the leaders of its progressive and more moderate factions publicly emphasizing unity, a small but vocal segment of Sanders’ supporters have dissented.
David Sirota, a former aide to Sanders who has said he plans to vote for Biden in the general election, responded to Warren’s endorsement by suggesting that Warren should have campaigned differently when she was in the race and that perhaps if she had, she would have done what Sanders himself did not: beat Biden.
“We have to defeat Donald Trump, and these endorsements are all about that goal, so I don’t begrudge it all,” Sirota said. “I’ll never understand why Sen. Warren went silent and never amplified her long-standing criticism of Biden and his bankruptcy bill in the primary, when she was in a position to defeat the vice president. She might be the nominee had she done that.”
Biden’s campaign is hoping to use this week’s endorsements as a means to pump up his fundraising, which people involved in the campaign have said has gotten tougher in the last month as the economy has cratered.
Notably, both Obama and Warren posted a link asking for donations to Biden, and Obama quickly signed an email to the Biden campaign list.
A weaker fundraiser than his top rivals in the primary, Biden now enters the general election at a distinct financial disadvantage. Trump and the Republican National Committee have been stockpiling cash for three years and announced Monday that they had entered April with $240 million cash on hand in the president’s reelection committee and other shared party accounts.
Without traditional in-person events, Biden has had to shift to videoconference fundraisers with top donors, which some contributors have been slow to embrace. He has a virtual fundraiser scheduled for later Wednesday, hosted by Joe Kiani, chairman of Masimo, a medical device company.
Biden and his team have also turned their attention to the search for a running mate, pointing to mid-April as the time frame for assembling a search committee.
“They’ll be announcing it soon, I’m sure,” Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, one of Biden’s national campaign chairs, said in an interview this week. He said details on the committee could come as soon as “early next week.” The Biden campaign had no additional comment.
Richmond has said he expects to be involved in the search process in some capacity and has advocated for appointing a committee that reflects the diversity of the party.
Biden, who committed to choosing a woman to be his running mate, is expected to consider a number of his former presidential rivals. Warren, Klobuchar and Sen. Kamala Harris are often mentioned, along with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and other Democratic leaders.

The Future That Hollywood Feared Is Happening Now [With graphic(s)]

The movie industry was already on a precipice. Did the pandemic just give it a push?
With theaters shuttered all over the world and hundreds of millions of people ordered to stay at home, it’s unclear when the movie industry can resume business as normal, or even whether that “normal” will look anything like Hollywood wants it to. Pivotal pieces of the film calendar — including the summer-blockbuster season and the year-end awards gantlet — have been thrown into disarray, and in their absence the gulf between streaming media and the theatrical experience may only widen further.
How will the movie industry cope with these disruptions, and what will happen to the rest of 2020 if fearful audiences can’t be coaxed back to the theater? Season by season, the outlook is bleak.
Summer: Blockbuster Season Evaporates
If a magic wand could be waved that would eradicate the coronavirus and free people from their homes, the most lucrative summer movie season ever would surely follow.
But there is no magic wand. A potential vaccine for the coronavirus will take at least a year to become available, and in that time, it’s hard to imagine a feasible way for movie theaters to reopen and turn a regular profit. Even if plans were drafted to deep-clean theaters between screenings and limit attendance so moviegoers could still keep a safe distance, will studios still want to screen their would-be blockbusters for such a decimated crowd? These movies often need to make hundreds of millions of dollars simply to break even, an impossible task for a world where only a sliver of the population gets to see them.
Though Universal delayed the Vin Diesel-led “Fast 9” nearly a full year, from May 2020 to April 2021, other studios have been more cautious about making changes to their schedules. Warner Bros. has not yet announced a new release date for Christopher Nolan’s “Tenet,” currently parked on July 17, and though the studio moved “Wonder Woman 1984” off its June 5 berth, that superhero sequel is still set to come out in August. Both films are intended to be billion-dollar grossers, but that hardly seems realistic if people remain discouraged from gathering en masse, especially in hard-hit markets like China.
Still, many in Hollywood are taking a wait-and-see approach to the pandemic. Disney postponed early-summer films like the Marvel entry “Black Widow” and the Pixar title “Soul,” but the studio’s live-action take on “Mulan,” already bumped from its spring slot, is currently scheduled to come out July 24. Is it because the movie is aimed at a young audience, the demographic that has so far proven most resistant to the coronavirus? Or will Disney need every part of its empire projecting confidence in order to get people back into its theme parks and onto its cruise ships by the end of summer?
Some studios have pivoted to digital debuts or shifted smaller and already-released films onto streaming services. Paramount sold its imminent Kumail Nanjiani-Issa Rae comedy, “The Lovebirds,” to Netflix, while Universal just released the pricey animated film “Trolls: World Tour” on demand for $19.99. The studio bragged that “Trolls” set an all-time digital record but declined to release figures, leaving it still unclear how profitable a digital-only release can be for a big-budget tentpole.
And while families will pay less for a “Trolls” rental than they would on several movie tickets, the price still compares unfavorably to a monthly Netflix subscription ($8.99 to $15.99). The streaming behemoth is well-suited to ride out the pandemic, and its summer slate remains unaffected. Audiences’ allegiance to Netflix and other new streaming services will probably grow even more entrenched the longer theaters are closed.
Fall: Film Festivals Are in Doubt
You’ll never hear more coughs than at a film festival screening.
The attendees are typically tired, overscheduled and stressed out — a trade-off for the privilege of seeing great films in advance — and they only grow more worn-down as the festival continues. It is the lucky few who make it to the end without contracting some sort of cold. Now, they’re up against something far worse.
It’s hard to imagine how the finely calibrated calendar of film festivals can continue as planned. South by Southwest was the pandemic’s first major event cancellation in March and the Cannes Film Festival, initially postponed from its usual May slot, looks to be the next, as the French president, Emmanuel Macron, has extended a ban on public events in the country until mid-July.
Films like Wes Anderson’s “The French Dispatch,” which was intended to premiere at Cannes in May before a summer release, have already been pushed to later in the year. Organizers admitted this week that Cannes can’t be held the way it was originally intended: Even if the festival was bumped to a late-summer date, it would face interference from three key film festivals that begin in September and are meant to kick off the prestige movie season.
But will any of those fests still happen? The Venice Film Festival is up first, on Sept. 2, and while a premiere there is usually coveted — last year, “Joker” began its juggernaut run on the Lido — Italy is still reeling from a coronavirus outbreak that has killed more than 20,000 of its citizens so far. Will this devastated country really be ready to throw a glamorous film festival a few months from now? And will Hollywood stars be eager to travel to it?
Subsequent festivals in Telluride, Colorado, and Toronto are considered even more important to launching year-end films. Still, some experts have warned of a potential coronavirus resurgence in the fall, and many may balk at going even if protective measures are taken and capacity is reduced. And if it looks like the 2020 awards season may be compromised, many prestige films could opt to sit out this festival year entirely.
Winter: Will Oscar Season Crumble, Too?
This was supposed to be an afterglow year for the Oscars, a time to bask in the good will generated from Bong Joon Ho’s popular “Parasite” and its triumph in the best-picture category.
Now, just a few months after that history-making moment for a Korean film, the motion picture academy may be pushed into another forward-thinking decision before it’s quite ready: Will the Oscars allow films to be eligible if the pandemic prevents them from receiving a theatrical release?
Some streaming movies have previously earned Oscar attention with only a minimal, obligatory dip into theaters, but the prospect of no theatrical release at all is a bridge the academy has never been willing to cross. After winning recent concessions from Netflix to commit to a longer theatrical release window for the company’s awards titles, the academy may now be especially reluctant to allow mass exceptions. Loosen the rules just this once, and it could prove difficult to put the genie back in the bottle.
Another possibility that’s been floated is extending Oscar eligibility so that the next show will include films released in both 2020 and 2021, something the academy has not done since several double-decker ceremonies in the 1930s. If academy bigwigs embrace that scenario, major Oscar contenders like this December’s “West Side Story” are in danger of becoming old news by the time voters fill out their ballots, and even Netflix might be tempted to push year-end awards films like David Fincher’s “Mank” and Ron Howard’s “Hillbilly Elegy” into 2021.
The academy had planned a board meeting for this week where these issues were almost certain to come up, though it was recently postponed to April 28. In the meantime, some acclaimed films that were set to come out over the next few months are already on hold: Until the academy offers further guidance, these filmmakers and casts don’t want to forsake their Oscar eligibility for a digital release. The only thing that’s certain right now is that many more dominoes have yet to fall.

Media now very thoughtful about #MeToo sexual assault allegations in light of Biden accusation

Texto completo: The latest #MeToo allegation against Joe Biden is flimsy, even if it is a more serious charge than the ridiculous ones he was slapped with last year. (He touched my forehead!)
But it’s really something to see liberals discover a newfound sense of thoughtfulness and wonderment about the complexities of such accusations.
New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg wrote Monday that, as a Democrat, “it would be easier to know what to do” about Tara Reade’s claim that Biden sexually assaulted her nearly 30 years ago, if only her story was “more solid, or if it were less.”
Goldberg’s main hang-up, as she wrote, was that Reade has, on different occasions, varied the account of her experience as a staffer for Biden’s Senate office in the early 1990s. Reade had previously said only that Biden made her uncomfortable, then that she didn’t like the way he treated her professionally. Then, last month, she said that he actually penetrated her vagina with his fingers.
Down the memory hole it went with all those news stories about how sexual assault trauma can force a woman to forget or not fully come to grips with her experience, only to recall it in full later. During the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, I remember hearing a lot about how real victims of sexual assault can’t always be expected to come forward immediately with every sordid detail about their incidents. That must not apply for Democratic politicians.
Goldberg allowed in her piece that, sure, all of that might be the case for Reade. In the end, though, she concluded that she’s not very enthusiastic about Biden’s candidacy anyway, and so, “Personally, I’m just left with doubt: doubt about Biden and doubt about the charges against him.”
Oh, and Goldberg finds it suspect that Reade has said positive things about Russian President Vladimir Putin. (Can’t forget about Russia!)
Let’s go back to October 2018, when Goldberg wrote that Senate Republicans should, at the very least, indefinitely delay the confirmation vote for Kavanaugh because polls showed a majority of women in the United States believed the accusation that he had nearly raped a woman at a time and place she couldn't consistently remember (but it was definitely somewhere in Maryland and sometime during the 1980s). There doesn’t appear to be any poll about whether anyone believes Reade, but even if there were, it would essentially be worthless because almost no one in the media outside of Fox News and a handful of conservative websites is genuinely interested in listening to or covering her claims.
But if a simple poll of women is all that’s needed to bog down a man hoping to work at the highest levels of government, then maybe the New York Times should commission one. Nah! According to the paper’s top editor Dean Baquet, the difference between Kavanaugh and Biden is that Kavanaugh was “a running, hot story.” Biden's candidacy for president is apparently an event of insignificance.
Sounds about right, actually, but if I were Biden, I’d be offended.
When has any sexual assault claim against President Trump been greeted by the news media with such skepticism? To the contrary, the New York Times keeps a running tally of every woman, no matter how credible, who says Trump touched her. E. Jean Carroll sold a lot of books by claiming to have once been raped by Trump in a department store fitting room. CNN, MSNBC, and nearly every newspaper, magazine, and website couldn't get enough of her, even though she specified that she didn't believe she was raped raped — only sort of raped to the point where she couldn't call it "rape."
But it's genuinely amazing to see the national media suddenly develop a new sense of curiosity about whether allegations of sexual misconduct are true or even deserve the benefit of the doubt. It’s suddenly not so black and white. It turns out that maybe we don't have to believe all women.
It’s no different from when liberals found blame on “both sides” when a Democrat carried a loaded gun to a baseball field with the intent of shooting a bunch of Republicans and almost killing Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise.
It’s no different from how liberals were suddenly struck with nuance when it turned out that the Covington Catholic students were not at fault in taunting a Native American, but were, in fact, the victims of shocking verbal harassment themselves. Didn't we all bear some responsibility for the hasty judgments on that one? (No!)
It’s funny how deeply cautious liberals suddenly become when held to their own standards.

Texto completo: After the woman who accused Joe Biden of sexually assaulting her when she worked for him in 1993 filed a criminal complaint with Washington, D.C., police, a flood of legacy news organizations published stories about her allegations — following weeks of silence after her allegations first became public.
The police report, filed on Thursday, opened the way for a swath of stories that added new information to allegations made by the woman in interviews. That includes those published first by the New York Times on Sunday, followed by the Washington Post, the Associated Press, and NBC News, which came after articles and interviews weeks ago by left-wing outlets: the Katie Halper Podcast, the Hill, Democracy Now, and the Intercept.
The former vice president’s presidential campaign has vigorously denied the allegations. “Women have a right to tell their story, and reporters have an obligation to rigorously vet those claims. We encourage them to do so because these accusations are false,” Biden spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield said.
Through three fully public interviews and other reports from those who interviewed the woman, Tara Reade, her description of harassment in Biden’s office and sexual assault by Biden is substantively consistent. Her brother and two unnamed friends say they remember hearing about either the assault or harassment at the time. Two interns confirm that she was abruptly removed from supervising them.
However, those in Biden’s office who Reade says she complained to about harassment, not the assault, say that they have no memory of that. A complaint Reade says she filed with a Senate personnel office could not be located, but she alleges a record might be in Biden’s sealed file at the University of Delaware. And Reade has changing descriptions of why she left Washington and has changed her tone toward Biden.
Here is a more complete view of the allegations based on information from the many reports.
About the accuser, Tara Reade
Alexandra Tara Reade, 56, was born in California and currently lives there. Early in life, she was a model and actress. She worked for Biden’s Senate office as a staff assistant from December 1992 to August 1993, when she was 29 years old and Biden was 50. Biden, first elected to the Senate in 1972, was at the apex of his power in Congress, chairing the Senate Judiciary Committee.
After leaving Washington, she became a mother and left an abusive marriage. She has changed her name multiple times due in part to leaving the marriage. She has a law degree from Seattle University School of Law but has never practiced law. She has worked as a victim’s rights advocate and testified as an expert witness in court. Most recently, Reade worked part-time with families who have special-needs children.
Sexual assault allegation
On a hot day in spring 1993 — she was not sure of the exact date or time — Biden’s scheduler told Reade to bring a gym bag to the then-senator. In a “semiprivate” location somewhere in the basement of a Capitol office building, she handed Biden the athletic bag.
Suddenly, he was kissing her against a cold wall and put his hand under her shirt and up her skirt. She was not wearing tights, and he penetrated her with his fingers.
“Do you want to go somewhere else?” she said he asked. When she pulled away, he said: “Come on, man, I heard you liked me.” Biden then grew angry. “You’re nothing to me. Nothing,” she said he told her.
Reade said that she told her mother, her brother, and a close friend who also worked in the Senate about the assault shortly after it happened.
She did not, however, say that she complained to those in the office about an assault, and a Senate personnel complaint she said she filed at the time was about harassment, not the assault.
Harassment and retaliation allegations
Reade said in numerous interviews that Biden touched her neck and shoulders in ways that made her feel uncomfortable.
But the incident that set off a wave of retaliation against her, she said, did not directly involve Biden. She was called into a meeting in which the staff had been arguing, she said, and learned that Biden thought she was pretty, had nice legs, and that Biden thought Reade should serve cocktails at a fundraising function. Reade said nothing during the argument. A female legislative staffer discouraged her, saying that she did not have to serve the drinks, while her supervisor encouraged her to do so.
Reade complained to supervisors, she said, and they brushed off her concerns by telling her not to look “sexy” and to wear more modest clothing. She was retaliated against by being moved to an office with no windows, had responsibilities like overseeing interns taken away from her, and then was told to find another job, she said. In one of the most striking allegations of retaliation, Reade told Democracy Now that she “was told to call one of my upper-level supervisors even if I went to the restroom.”
These allegations were first published on April 3, 2019, in the Union, a local news outlet, and then by Reade in an April 2019 Medium post.
It was not until 2020 that Reade publicly accused Biden of sexual assault and elaborated on her allegations, including naming those who she said she complained to.
Brother and friends say she told them about the assault or harassment
Reade said that she told her mother, her brother, and a close friend who also worked in the Senate about the assault shortly after it happened.
Nearly every outlet — the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Intercept, the Associated Press, and NBC News — reported that an unnamed friend confirmed that Reade relayed the sexual assault incident soon after it happened. NBC News added that this person also remembered that Reade spoke with superiors about harassment, but not the assault. She remembered Reade had said she filed a formal written complaint with a Senate office at the time.
Reade's brother, Collin Moulton, told the Washington Post that he recalled Reade in 1993 telling him about Biden inappropriately touching her neck shoulders and added that he felt “ashamed now for not being a better advocate” for his sister. A few days later, he sent a text message to the Washington Post, adding that he recalled Reade also telling him that Biden put his hand under her clothes. “I heard that there was a gym bag incident ... and that he was inappropriate,” Moulton told the Washington Post. “I remember her telling me he said she was nothing to him.”
Moulton expressed a similar sentiment to the Intercept, confirming that he heard about the assault from Reade at the time and lamenting that “I wasn’t one of her better advocates. I said, 'Let it go, move on, guys are idiots.'” He did not respond to inquiries from the Associated Press or the New York Times.
Their mother died in 2016, but Moulton said both he and their mother urged Reade to call the police, which she did not do.
Several outlets — the Washington Post, the Associated Press, the New York Times, and NBC News — also reported a second unnamed friend confirmed that around 2007 or 2008, Reade disclosed that Biden had been inappropriate with touching Reade, but the person did not say he or she was told about an assault.
Reade also told the Washington Post that she talked to a therapist about the alleged assault earlier this year. The Washington Post asked for notes from that conversation, but Reade did not provide them.
Former Biden staff members deny hearing complaints
Reade told multiple outlets that she complained to three key senior staff members about harassment from Biden but not the alleged assault: Marianne Baker, former executive assistant in Biden’s Senate office; Dennis Toner, Biden’s then-deputy chief of staff; and Ted Kaufman, Biden’s then-chief of staff.
The Biden campaign provided a statement from Baker, who did not respond to requests for comment from other outlets.
“In all my years working for Sen. Biden, I never once witnessed, or heard of, or received, any reports of inappropriate conduct, period — not from Ms. Reade, not from anyone,” Baker said. “I have absolutely no knowledge or memory of Ms. Reade’s accounting of events, which would have left a searing impression on me as a woman professional, and as a manager. These clearly false allegations are in complete contradiction to both the inner workings of our Senate office and to the man I know and worked so closely with for almost two decades.”
Toner, who is now a consultant based in Delaware, told multiple outlets that he does not remember Reade: “I don’t remember her. I don’t remember this conversation. And I would remember this conversation,” he told the New York Times.
Kaufman, who remains a confidant of Biden but has no role in his presidential campaign, also told multiple outlets he had no memory of a conversation with Reade. “I did not know her. She did not come to me. If she had, I would have remembered her,” he told the New York Times.
The New York Times, Washington Post, and Associated Press reported that they spoke to many former staff members from that time, and they did not recall instances of Biden inappropriately touching Reade or a request that she serve drinks.
Melissa Lefko, who worked as a staff assistant at the same time as Reade but does not remember her, spoke to several outlets. She told the Associated Press: “When you work on the Hill, you know who the good guys are, who the bad guys are, and who you should avoid, and Biden was a good guy, he was never, ever on that list of the bad guys.”
Interns confirm Reade abruptly stopped overseeing them
The Washington Post and the New York Times each reported that two unnamed former interns said that they remembered she abruptly stopped supervising them in April 1993, potentially corroborating Reade’s claim that she was stripped of key responsibilities.
But interns did not know the reason why, and they said that they never saw Biden interact with Reade inappropriately. That makes them unable to verify an allegation mentioned only in the Union that Biden put a finger on her neck while she was in front of a group of interns.
Alleged complaint filed with a congressional office
After the alleged assault, Reade said she filed a complaint on a clipboard in a Senate personnel office — she could not remember the name — about the alleged harassment, not the assault. She never heard back about it. No record of the report has been located.
The office that fielded harassment complaints at that time was called the Senate Office of Fair Employment Practices. It was replaced in 1995 with the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights. In 1993, the law said that harassment allegations would be heard by an independent board.
Reade suspects that Biden’s Senate office might have gotten alerted to a complaint and that it might be in Biden’s official Senate paper archive at the University of Delaware. Those records are sealed from the public “for two years after Biden retires from public life.”
The Biden campaign told the New York Times that it did not have a record of a complaint.
Incident report about the assault
On Thursday, April 9, Reade filed a public incident report with the Washington, D.C., police. The public portion of the report is one page and reads: “Subject-1 disclosed that she was the victim of a sexual assault which was committed by Subject-2 in 1993.”
Reade said that she was Subject-1 and Biden was Subject-2.
Because filing a false report is a crime punishable by up to 30 days in jail, the move could represent an escalation of her allegation and a demonstration that she is putting claims to the test.
Reade said she filed the report “for safety reasons only,” to “give herself an additional degree of safety from potential threats.” Her assault allegation is past the statute of limitations.
Differing tones from Reade
The Associated Press spoke with Reade about harassment allegations in April 2019, but it declined to run a story about her allegations last year “because reporters were unable to corroborate her allegations, and aspects of her story contradicted other reporting,” but did not explain what the contradictions were.
The Washington Post also reported that it interviewed Reade on April 4, 2019, during which she blamed staff for “bullying” her rather than Biden for harassment.
“This is what I want to emphasize: It’s not him. It’s the people around him who keep covering for him,” Reade told the Washington Post. “For instance, he should have known what was happening to me. ... Looking back now, that’s my criticism. Maybe he could have been a little more in touch with his own staff.”
She has offered differing explanations for why she left Washington. In a 2019 blog post, she said she was unable to find another job due to retaliation from complaining about harassment. In 2018, she wrote that she left because her interests revolved around the arts and disliked “xenophobia” toward Russia. In 2009, she wrote that she moved to be with her future husband.
Also in the 2009 blog post, Reade lauded Biden’s work in passing the Violence Against Women Act. She praised him in a 2017 tweet, saying: “My old boss speaks truth. Listen.”
Reade told the Washington Post that despite the assault, Biden “stands for all I believe in.”
Skepticism of Reade’s politics and motivations
Skeptics of Reade’s allegations point to her history of praising Russian President Vladimir Putin in social media posts and essays as evidence that she is not a reliable accuser. In November 2018, Reade wrote an essay on Medium titled “Why a Liberal Democrat Supports Vladimir Putin.” Weeks later, in mid-December, Reade wrote another essay praising Putin.
She told various outlets that she was researching Russia for a novel, is not working for Russia, and said that her then-praise for Putin was “misguided.”
Reade voted for the Obama-Biden ticket in 2008 and 2012 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. In this cycle’s Democratic presidential primaries, she gave $5 to Marianne Williamson in August 2019 and also looked at Andrew Yang and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren before settling on supporting Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.
She faced criticism for revealing her allegations in leftist outlets supportive of Sanders. But Reade says that she decided to come forward in part because of wanting to make a better world for her daughter and told the Washington Post that she does not “have an agenda other than I just wanted my story told.”

'You know you're fake': Trump briefings are a war with the press he knows his base will love

Texto completo: President Trump raised eyebrows in Washington with a contentious White House briefing Monday that allies saw as furthering two goals important to his reelection: defending his administration’s handling of the coronavirus and rallying the base against perceived media bias in favor of his Democratic challenger.
To that end, Trump showed a short video that featured Democratic governors and other officials praising his work with them in managing the pandemic. When reporters incredulously questioned why they had to sit through a production they likened to a campaign video, Trump replied, “Because we're getting fake news, and I like to have it corrected.”
Trump has shown a willingness to mix it up with the press throughout his presidency, and the coronavirus briefings have been no exception. CBS News’s Paula Reid, a lawyer by training, joined a roster of Trump’s media sparring partners that includes CNN’s Jim Acosta, PBS’ Yamiche Alcindor, and NBC’s Peter Alexander. Reid demanded to know what the White House had done to prepare for the outbreak in February. “You know you’re a fake, you know that,” Trump shot back. “That’s why you have a lower approval rating than you've ever had before, times probably three.”
“Americans want to see their president out front and in command in a crisis, and that’s exactly what President Trump is doing,” said Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh. “While the president is leading the nation in a war against the coronavirus, Joe Biden and the media have decided to play the opposition in that war. They would rather score political points against President Trump than reliably inform the American people. It used to be that we would unite as a country in times of crisis, but the media and Biden have thrown that principle out the window.”
CNN displayed no fewer than four chyrons editorializing against the president’s performance: “Trump melts down in angry response to reports he ignored virus warnings”; “Trump refuses to acknowledge any mistakes”; “Angry Trump turns briefing into propaganda session”; and “Trump uses task force briefing to try and rewrite history on coronavirus response.”
Many Republicans had a different reaction to the briefing. “I thought the POTUS defense was perfect,” said Bradley Blakeman, a former aide to President George W. Bush. “He used the best unfiltered and direct evidence to show the American people the truth of what he did, when he did, and why. Then he augmented it with bipartisan testimonials of governors who acknowledged the president’s can-do approach to mitigating and preventing harm.”
This split showed up on social media, with #TrumpMeltdown trending on Twitter at the same time many users were claiming it was the press corps melting down as Trump defended himself.
Trump’s pushback followed a spate of news stories over the weekend that painted an unflattering picture of his response to the coronavirus. The president seemed especially exercised by a long New York Times article headlined, “He Could Have Seen What Was Coming: Behind Trump’s Failure on the Virus.” Trump called the New York Times a “fake newspaper” that writes “fake stories.” Trump had hoped to begin reopening the U.S. economy over Easter weekend but abandoned that goal based on scientific advice.
When Trump began the daily briefings, his poll numbers on coping with the coronavirus went up. His approval ratings on that question have since broken down more on party lines. In a late March Gallup poll, the news media was the institution whose response to the virus pleased the public least, though most approved of the coverage in a more recent Pew survey.
Former White House press secretaries from both parties recently told the Washington Examiner they largely approved of the press corps’ performance but thought there should be more input from science reporters and fewer “gotcha questions” of a political nature. They also recommended shorter briefings. Some analysts have complained that both Trump and the media focus too much on themselves and fighting with each other.
Trump allies argue the president is angrily defending medical experts on his coronavirus team, including Anthony Fauci, Deborah Birx, and task force leader Vice President Mike Pence, as much as himself. “The president has surrounded himself with the best and brightest minds inside and outside of government,” said Blakeman. “He knows he cannot get a fair shake from the press, and thus, he is immune from their attacks, because at the end of the day, it will be the people who decide whether or not he acted in the best interests of the nation.”
Republican complaints about liberal media bias date back to at least the Nixon administration, but observers say the impact can be overstated. “By November this will be about who can get the economy going, not on who said what when about a White House press briefing,” said GOP strategist Brad Todd.

Flashback: WHO's Tedros was accused of covering up cholera outbreaks in Ethiopia

Texto completo: The director-general of the World Health Organization had been accused of covering up three cholera epidemics that occurred in Ethiopia while he was the health minister.
A global health expert first leveled the accusations against Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in 2017 during the election of the WHO’s next director-general, according to a 2017 New York Times story.
Tedros denied the allegations against him, describing them as part of a wider “smear campaign” against his candidacy by the rival campaign of Dr. David Nabarro. He said he was “not surprised at all but quite disappointed” by the allegations.
An adviser to Nabarro, Lawrence Gostin, said he brought attention to Ethiopia’s history of allegedly covering up cholera epidemics and said the WHO “might lose its legitimacy” if it is run by someone who failed to “speak truth to power," according to the New York Times.
“Dr. Tedros is a compassionate and highly competent public health official,” he said. “But he had a duty to speak truth to power and to honestly identify and report verified cholera outbreaks over an extended period.”
Tedros was appointed as Ethiopia’s health minister in 2005 and served until 2012, when he was appointed foreign minister. In that time, Ethiopia didn’t officially record any outbreaks of cholera in 2006, 2009, and 2011. Instead, they were recorded as cases of “acute watery diarrhea,” a symptom of cholera, according to the New York Times.
However, international investigators testing patient samples found the bacteria that causes cholera.
The WHO’s leadership has been criticized by President Trump for being “China-centric” amid the worldwide coronavirus pandemic.
The WHO vocally opposed Trump’s decision to impose limitations on travel to China in late January. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has credited this decision with helping to slow the spread of COVID-19 in the United States.
Tweet
Taiwan claimed that it warned the WHO in December that the disease could be spread through human-to-human transmission. On Jan. 14, the WHO tweeted that it had found “no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.”
Trump said Tuesday that the U.S. will temporarily halt funding to the United Nations agency while a review of the WHO’s "role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus" is conducted.
“We have not been treated properly,” Trump said. “The WHO pushed China’s misinformation about the virus.”
Gostin did not immediately return the Washington Examiner’s request for comment.

Texto completo: President Trump pitched a talk radio show from the White House that would have allowed him to answer people’s questions about the coronavirus crisis directly.
The president proposed the radio show during a Situation Room meeting with the White House coronavirus task force in March, according to the New York Times. He said the show would allow him to calm the public's fears and that the calls would not be screened.
However, Trump later said he would not move ahead with the proposal because he did not want to compete with conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh. Some in the room suggested hosting the show in the mornings or on weekends so it would not overlap with Limbaugh’s show, but the president disagreed, saying he wanted his show to be two hours a day every day.
One official involved in the discussion told the New York Times that Trump had previously mentioned hosting a radio show from the White House, but the thought of competing against Limbaugh swayed him against doing so.
The Rush Limbaugh Show brings in more than 15 million listeners a week, making it the most popular talk radio show in the country. Limbaugh has been a staunch supporter of the president and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom during Trump’s State of the Union address in February.

Texto completo: New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof blamed President Trump for the deaths of thousands of Americans at the hands of the coronavirus.
"Thousands of Americans would be alive today if President Trump had spent more time listening to the World Health Organization instead of trying to destroy it," Kristof wrote in an op-ed. "His likening of Covid-19 to the flu led people to join public gatherings like Mardi Gras and Florida spring break, and that is one reason the United States has had 80 deaths per million inhabitants from Covid-19, compared with four in South Korea and fewer than one in Taiwan."
Trump announced on Tuesday that he was placing a halt on funding to the WHO, claiming that the organization had not scrutinized information it was fed by China about the virus adequately.
Kristof acknowledged this.
"Yes, some of the complaints about the W.H.O. are valid, and I’ve made them myself. It has been too cozy with China, it made some wrong calls on the coronavirus early on," he said. "But it has still managed the coronavirus crisis far better than the Trump administration."
The U.S. provides 22% of the WHO's assessed funding, meaning the absence of those funds would hurt the organization.
"Gutting the W.H.O. will mean more kids dying of malnutrition, more moms dying of cervical cancer, and the coronavirus infecting more people in more countries — impairing the pandemic response, which may well cost even more American lives," Kristof said. "And all because an American president is seeking a scapegoat for his own ineptitude."
More than a half-million Americans have contracted the virus, and thousands, especially in large cities, have died.
Kristof said if the public is looking for someone to blame for one of the worst health crises in the country's history, they can look at the White House.
"Yes, Americans have died unnecessarily from Covid-19, and I’ve been seared by my own reporting in 'hot zones' of New York hospitals," he said. "But if Trump insists on holding people accountable, he needn’t denounce the W.H.O. He can gaze in the mirror."

Jamelle Bouie: Why coronavirus is killing African Americans more than others

Texto completo: html> We know that COVID-19 is killing African Americans at greater rates than any other group. You can see this most clearly in the South. In Louisiana, blacks account for 70% of the deaths but 33% of the population. In Alabama, they account for 44% of the deaths and 26% of the population. South Carolina and Georgia have yet to release information on death disparities, but in both states blacks are more likely to be infected than whites. The pattern exists in the North as well, where African American populations in cities like Chicago and Milwaukee have high infection and death rates.
Federal officials have tied these disparities to individual behavior — the U.S. surgeon general, Jerome Adams, who is African American, urged blacks and other communities of color to “avoid alcohol, tobacco and drugs” as if this was a particular problem for those groups. In truth, black susceptibility to infection and death in the coronavirus pandemic has everything to do with the racial character of inequality in the United States.
To use just a few, relevant examples, black Americans are more likely to work in service sector jobs, least likely to own a car and least likely to own their homes. They are therefore more likely to be in close contact with other people, from the ways they travel to the kinds of work they do to the conditions in which they live.
Today’s disparities of health flow directly from yesterday’s disparities of wealth and opportunity. That African Americans are overrepresented in service-sector jobs reflects a history of racially segmented labor markets that kept them at the bottom of the economic ladder; that they are less likely to own their own homes reflects a history of stark housing discrimination, state-sanctioned and state-sponsored. And if black Americans are more likely to suffer the comorbidities that make COVID-19 more deadly, it’s because those ailments are tied to the segregation and concentrated poverty that still mark their communities.
What’s important to understand is that this racialized inequality isn’t a mistake — it isn’t a flaw in the system. It reflects something in the character of American capitalism itself, a deep logic that produces the same outcomes, again and again.
American capitalism did not emerge ex nihilo into the world. It grew out of existing social, political and economic arrangements, toppling some and incorporating others as it took shape in the second half of the 19th century.
White supremacy was one of those arrangements. The Civil War may have destroyed slave society, but the central relationship of that society — race — survived the carnage and disruption of the conflict to shape the aftermath, especially in the absence of a sustained program to radically restructure the social and economic life of the South.
For the most part, before the war, blackness marked one as a slave. Afterward, it marked one as the lowest of laborers, relegated to sharecropping and domestic work, excluded from the mounting ranks of industrial labor. “With the coming of industry and the factory system, the social code which made manual labor a degrading factor was no longer of binding force,” historian Charles H. Wesley wrote in his 1927 book “Negro Labor in the United States, 1850-1925.” “Work in the factories was honorable and it was to be considered the particular task of white workers.”
Which is to say that, as it developed in the United States, industrial capitalism retained a caste system that marked whites as the dominant social group. This wasn’t just a matter of prejudice. As it did under slavery, race under industrial capitalism structured one’s relationship to both production and personhood. Whiteness, philosopher Charles W. Mills notes, underwrote “the division of labor and the allocation of resources, with correspondingly enhanced socioeconomic life chances for one’s white self and one’s white children.”
It’s not that life was particularly good for white workers but that blacks faced additional challenges, from the denial of formal political rights to social exclusion and widespread, state-sanctioned violence. If they lived in cities, blacks were relegated to the least sanitary neighborhoods with the most substandard housing; if they had a skill or knew a craft, they were excluded from the guilds and unions that would have given them a path to employment; if they possessed a formal education, they were barred from most middle-class professions.
The overrepresentation of blacks in institutions like the Postal Service is a direct legacy of this exclusion. Postal work was, historically, one of the few stable jobs available to blacks. “For years the post office had commonly been considered a ‘safe’ job for blacks because of exclusion by both white capital and white labor in the private sector,” historian Philip F. Rubio explains in “There’s Always Work at the Post Office: African-American Postal Workers and the Fight for Jobs, Justice, and Equality.”
By the time we reach the New Deal era, the racial differentiation of capitalist inequality — divided labor markets, wide racial disparities in employment, income and education — was part of the pattern of American life, even in the midst of the Depression. And as policymakers in Washington worked to address the crisis, they built on that foundation and deepened those disparities, sometimes by accident but often — because of direct pressure from the white South and its lawmakers — by design.
“By not including the occupations in which African Americans worked, and by organizing racist patterns of administration, New Deal policies for Social Security, social welfare, and labor market programs restricted black prospects while providing positive economic reinforcement for the great majority of white citizens,” historian Ira Katznelson writes in “When Affirmative Action Was White: An Untold History of Racial Inequality in Twentieth-Century America.”
Building on existing discrimination, federal policymakers further segregated northern cities and created new geographies of disadvantage that separated black Americans from jobs and opportunity in the postwar boom, at the same time that policies like state-subsidized education, low-interest home loans and the interstate highway system helped turn a working class of ethnic Europeans into a middle class of whites.
Of course, my quick account of the history of racial inequality in America flattens a great deal of nuance. The mass of white workers may have been attached to what W.E.B. DuBois called a “psychological wage” of racial entitlement, but it’s also true that racially divided labor suited the owners of capital, who took advantage of racism when it suited their interests. Despite this, the last decade of the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th saw moments of interracial labor militancy and agrarian rebellion — glimpses of a different, more equal path for American life.
Aspects of the New Deal may have entrenched racial inequality, but African Americans still made real economic and social gains under Franklin Roosevelt. That’s why, on the eve of the 1940 Democratic presidential convention, one black newspaper concluded that “Negroes have been given fairer and more impartial treatment by governmental agencies in recent years than ever before in the history of the Republic.”
There’s more: By midcentury the institutions of the labor movement had taken up the fight against Jim Crow racism, and in the wake of the civil rights movement, a black middle class did begin to take shape.
But if you look at the full picture of American society, it is clear that the structural position of black Americans isn’t so different than it was at the advent of the industrial age. Race still shapes personhood; it still marks the boundaries of who belongs and who doesn’t; of which groups face the brunt of capitalist inequality (in all its forms) and which get some respite. Race, in other words, still answers the question of “who.” Who will live in crowded, segregated neighborhoods? Who will be exposed to lead-poisoned pipes and toxic waste? Who will live with polluted air and suffer disproportionately from maladies like asthma and heart disease? And when disease comes, who will be the first to succumb in large numbers?
If there was anything you could predict about this pandemic — anything you could be certain about once it reached America’s shores — it was that some communities would weather the storm while others would sink under the waves and that the distribution of this suffering would have everything to do with patterns inscribed by the past.
As long as those patterns remain, there is no path to a better society. We have to break them, before they break us.

Texto completo: Thousands of Americans would be alive today if President Donald Trump had spent more time listening to the World Health Organization instead of trying to destroy it.
Trump’s announcement that he will halt U.S. funding for the WHO just as the world is facing a raging pandemic is a dangerous attempt to find a scapegoat for his own failings. It is like taking away a fire department’s trucks in the middle of a blaze.
Many Americans know nothing about the WHO, but its worldwide budget (of which the United States pays about one-fifth) is less than that of some American hospital centers. Yet it is charged with fighting Ebola and polio, saving children’s lives and keeping the world safe from pandemics like this one.
Trump says that he is cutting the funds while his administration reviews the WHO’s handling of the coronavirus. His own pandemic preparedness plan, which he characteristically has failed to implement, called for building support for the WHO — because it’s a critical player to keep Americans safe.
Yes, some of the complaints about the WHO are valid, and I’ve made them myself. It has been too cozy with China, it made some wrong calls on the coronavirus early on (such as doubting Jan. 14 that there was human-to-human transmission), and it should stop blocking participation by Taiwan. But it has still managed the coronavirus crisis far better than the Trump administration.
The WHO tweeted its first warning about the coronavirus as early as Jan. 4 and then rang alarm bells, culminating at the end of that month when it declared a “public health emergency of international concern.” It developed an effective diagnostic test for the coronavirus that is used in dozens of countries worldwide, while the United States still cannot manage adequate testing.
In late January and February, the WHO issued increasingly urgent warnings about the coronavirus. Trump ignored them, instead insisting that it was “totally under control,” predicted the number of infections would drop, declared that “it’s going to disappear” and consistently downplayed the virus while talking up the stock market.
Trump’s passivity — even as the WHO and his own advisers warned him of the risks — squandered the chance to acquire more personal protective equipment for doctors and nurses. His likening of COVID-19 to the flu led people to join public gatherings like Mardi Gras and Florida spring break, and that is one reason the United States has had 80 deaths per 1 million inhabitants from COVID-19, compared with 4 in South Korea and fewer than 1 in Taiwan.
I’ve known the WHO’s director general, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, for almost 20 years and have had disagreements with him, largely over his accommodation of dictators. But I have deeply admired his passion for battling malaria, malnutrition and maternal mortality, and I’ve seen his work save lives. Growing up in Ethiopia, he lost a younger brother, Yemaine, apparently to measles, and that left him with a deep commitment to improve health care access.
The WHO is bureaucratic, frustrating, timid — and indispensable. No other organization can fill its international role overseeing the fight against disease. It has battled an outbreak of Ebola since last year in Congo, and that’s one reason we haven’t had Ebola cases in the United States.
Every day, the WHO saves lives. It has promoted safe childbirth, and the number of women dying in childbirth has been cut almost in half over 25 years. It fights female genital mutilation and helps women with obstetric fistula. It is struggling to eliminate cervical cancer. It is part of the campaign against polio.
Normally, an American president is a leader in global health, and Democrats and Republicans have often cooperated on a humanitarian agenda. President George W. Bush started a program against HIV/AIDS called PEPFAR that has saved 17 million lives. President Barack Obama helped lead the global effort to end the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014-16.
In contrast, Trump has provided zero global leadership against the coronavirus, and he is now trying to crush the one organization providing such leadership.
(Readers have asked how they can contribute to help ease the suffering from COVID-19. Stay tuned: I’ll have a column at the end of next week with five suggestions.)
Trump’s main complaint about the WHO is that it is too close to China, and there’s some truth to that — but Trump himself fawned over China’s response to the pandemic.
“China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus,” Trump tweeted on Jan. 24. “I want to thank President Xi.”
If I seem angry, it’s because I’ve seen too many women dying in childbirth in poor countries, too many children dying of diarrhea, too much leprosy. Gutting the WHO will mean more kids dying of malnutrition, more moms dying of cervical cancer, and the coronavirus infecting more people in more countries — impairing the pandemic response, which may well cost even more American lives. And all because an American president is seeking a scapegoat for his own ineptitude.
Yes, Americans have died unnecessarily from COVID-19, and I’ve been seared by my own reporting in “hot zones” of New York hospitals. But if Trump insists on holding people accountable, he needn’t denounce the WHO. He can gaze in the mirror.

Texto completo: From Corin Frost's house on Gorham Street, it's a straight shot to University Hospital. When she looks out her window, it hits her.
"I think about how many health care providers are driving by on their daily commute while I'm sitting here able to be safe inside," Frost said.
Outside, a pandemic is raging. As of Sunday, the U.S. had 525,704 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, including 3,341 in Wisconsin. Complications due to the disease are confirmed to have killed 20,486 in the U.S., including 144 in Wisconsin. Dane County has had 334 confirmed cases and 12 confirmed COVID-related deaths.
Frost might be staying indoors, but she isn't standing idly by. Instead, she's spent evenings and weekends in her upstairs studio designing and sewing her own version of a powered air purifying respirator hood, used by medical professionals during procedures likely to make a patient cough. This type of hood, often used by hazmat workers, fully covers the head and connects to a battery-powered device blowing air through a filter. It's one of many pieces of medical equipment that health care providers are begging for.
As COVID-19 spreads, hospitals and essential workers need more medical and protective equipment than current supply chains can provide. Those shortages could mean more COVID-19 infections and deaths.
Frost is just one in a small army of local makers and designers - from engineers and inventors to sewists and 3D-printing hobbyists - seeking to fill the gap. Their efforts range from building protective clinic furniture to creating a face shield design now being manufactured across the globe.
They're part of a global movement using the skills and materials on hand to devise solutions to this crisis. It's uncharted territory, and many questions remain about who's qualified to take on which problems. But the enthusiasm and creativity of these makers reveals much about their community and offers hope where help is in short supply.

Dangerous shortages
For weeks, governors have asked the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help them obtain additional supplies and called on the federal government to send reserves from the Strategic National Stockpile, which holds supplies, medicine and devices for disasters. But on March 31, the New York Times reported that the stockpile of protective equipment had been nearly exhausted, leaving states to address remaining shortfalls on their own - just as supply chains are running dry. Gov. Tony Evers has asked all companies and organizations that have large supplies on hand to donate or sell them to the state.
With shortages making headlines, the acronym PPE - personal protective equipment - has become part of the American lexicon. Among the most sought after items is the N95 mask, capable of filtering out viruses and bacteria, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends for all health care providers caring for COVID-19 patients. But the CDC has also offered lower "contingency" and "crisis" standards, advising that health care workers may need to reuse or forgo N95s in some situations.
Meanwhile, shortages of a life-or-death apparatus, the ventilator, led to nightmare scenarios in Italy, with doctors forced to choose which patients to save. In New York, some patients are already sharing ventilators, and a Wisconsin committee is considering how to triage patients if its ventilator supply proves insufficient.
At the hospitals run by the University of Wisconsin, it's Bob Scheuer's job to keep supplies stocked. The director of materials management for UW Health told the Cap Times his job has never been more hectic.
"We are struggling every day to get the items we need," Scheuer said.
His team runs a calculation for each item. "Given our current usage rate and what we have in inventory, how many days can we go without getting any more supply in? Any time we get down into the single digits ... is cause for concern," he said, and some days, "it gets pretty close."
As of Monday, 35% of Wisconsin hospitals had no more than a week's supply of N95s, according to data compiled by the Wisconsin Hospital Association. Without new supplies, 45% percent would run out of gowns and 41% would run out of face shields within a week. The state has 352 patients on ventilators and 1,233 ventilators, including those already in use, as of Monday. According to Wisconsin Department of Health Services predictions, the number of COVID cases will peak between April 23 and May 23.
GE Healthcare has already increased its ventilator production, including at a facility on Madison's east side that has shifted to 24/7 production, pulling in workers from facilities across the country and hiring more. And President Donald Trump has invoked the Defense Production Act, ordering auto manufacturer General Motors to begin producing ventilators and instructing an as-yet-undisclosed set of manufacturers to increase N95 mask production to 39 million over the next three months.
But even the most experienced manufacturers may not be able to increase the supply fast enough. The New York Times reported in March that 3M and Honeywell had increased production of N95 masks, but it could take months to hit ramped-up production goals.
Upping production means hiring more workers, sourcing additional raw materials and extending a factory's production. All that takes time, so hospitals are considering other ways to fill the gap.

Called to duty
Lennon Rodgers directs the Grainger Engineering Design Innovation Lab at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where students learn to use emerging technologies to design solutions to problems.
Often called "makerspaces" or "fab labs" (fabrication laboratories) they have proliferated in the last decade as tools like 3D printers and computerized machining devices have enabled desktop manufacturing.
Before the pandemic, Rodgers spent his days helping students design and build "everything from race car parts to biomedical devices," but with a single email, he was drafted into the PPE-making force. On March 16, Rodgers received a message from UW Health University Hospital asking if he could help make 1,000 face shields. The shields are worn over surgical or N95 masks to protect from respiratory droplets that contagious patients might cough or sneeze out, and, unlike items like N95s or ventilators, they can be built without specialized materials or medical knowledge.
That night, following a trip to Home Depot and an hour of work, Rodgers made a rough version but his wife, an anesthesiologist, told him it needed work ("For a construction worker, it would've been great," Rodgers said). He enlisted the help of Jesse Darley of local product design and engineering firm Delve, and Brian Ellison of Blue Mounds-based 3D printing firm Midwest Prototyping, to fashion a prototype.
With approval from UW Health's infection control department, they settled on a design that used just three materials - clear polyester film for the shield itself, elastic for headband and foam to cushion the user's forehead - and could be built using only scissors, an X-Acto knife and Ziploc bags.
They named the design the Badger Shield and published the drawings and instructions online as an "open source" document, allowing others to use it for free. They also compiled lists of suppliers selling the raw materials and created an online form where workers could request face shields, and companies could register as shield producers.
A few days after that first email, Midwest Prototyping delivered about 1,000 Badger Shields to UW Health. Less than a month later, the design has been picked up by manufacturers around the world, who estimate they can produce more than 2 million shields each day.

Getting under the hood
Within days of finalizing the Badger Shield design, the team was already working on its next COVID-inspired design at the request of UW Health: a powered air purifying respirator, or PAPR hood, designed to protect health care workers during procedures like intubation, which can cause a patient to cough or vomit.
The hood would be sewn, so Darley tapped Corin Frost, director of visual communications at Delve, for her sewing and clothing design expertise.
In her home studio, Frost spent hours reverse-engineering the hoods, trying to create her own simple and functional version. She'd often prepare two versions in a single day, leaving each on her porch beside a container of disinfecting wipes. Darley would come by, stand ing on her porch as he wiped each prototype down and tested it out, offering suggestions to Frost from the other side of her storm door.
"It's almost like I was coming out of the fitting room at the Gap and saying, 'Hey, does this one look okay?'" Darley said.
When a couple prototypes were ready, Darley would drive to University Hospital, where a handful of doctors and nurses would take a break and meet him at a loading dock to try them on. They offered feedback, such as: Tthey wanted the fabric to extend to protect their necks, or noted that the air wasn't blowing over their heads as it should.
The nurses hadn't used PAPR hoods before, Darley said, but the hospital aimed to provide them to all health care workers.
"You can see this kind of fear in their eyes of what the situation is like," Darley said. "So this is hopefully one tiny, tiny piece to make them feel safer and actually be safer."
Designers at Clothier Design Source, a clothing designer and manufacturer in St. Paul, Minnesota, adapted the model for mass production, and it has since received approval from UW Health.
The team is awaiting a purchase order from the hospital but has already lined up local professional sewists to sew a small number of hoods, Darley said. For larger production, they're in talks with a New York sewing company that sews Marc Jacobs designs. UW Health will be their first client, and Darley expects to make the first delivery by next week.

3D printers at the ready
Across town, consultant Keith Fuller was reading international news and anticipating shortages. It wasn't until he read about a hospital in Italy where someone had fixed a broken ventilator by 3D printing a replacement valve that he realized he could help.
"And it occurred to me, 'OK, if it's as simple as that ... I know people with phenomenal expertise in 3D printing,'" Fuller said, and emailed Nick Shepherd, the owner-operator of New Glarus based 3D printing startup GLW Technologies.
For Shepherd, the pandemic's threat was tangible: His wife works at a nursing home and his mother runs a long-term care facility.
"In my immediate family, I have two people who are in very high-risk zones," Shepherd said.
Shepherd set about creating a design for a 3D-printed mask with a detachable N95 filter. He's also working with Green County Economic Development and local banks to secure a warehouse space where they could manufacture COVID-19 PPE in a clean environment.
Projects are also underway at both of Madison's community makerspaces, which closed under Evers' "safer at home" order but continue to allow access to PPE-makers.
At Sector67 in the Atwood neighborhood, volunteers recently worked with a Madison pediatrician to improve a Plexiglas droplet barrier that she and her Group Health Cooperative team had built for safer COVID-19 testing.
Sector67 members are also producing Badger Shields, prototyping a hood to cover patients while health care workers intubate them, and considering options for a fan system to provide filtered air for the PAPR hoods Frost and her team are developing.
About a mile away, at The Bodgery makerspace in the former Oscar Mayer plant, inventor Jesse Ransom is collaborating with other local makers to 3D-print an alternative to an N95 mask, perhaps based on CPAP masks used by people with sleep apnea.
Meanwhile, in his parents' basement in Sun Prairie, UW-Platteville senior Andrew Kaiser is making face shields by 3D-printing visors and attaching overhead transparencies, using a design he found online. So far he's donated shields to senior care facilities and a taxi service for the sick.
He'd like to increase production, but his two printers break down regularly. "It's really just a cheap hobbyist kit sort of thing," Kaiser said, "but we're trying really hard to keep our production going no matter what."

Sewing controversy
Other makers bring a more traditional tool to the PPE push: sewing machines. Some hospitals have posted their approved patterns for cloth masks, including ones that could cover and extend the life of N95s or hold alternative filters.
Many sewists have leapt at the chance to help, but the effort has sparked controversy. Studies show cloth masks don't offer the same protection as disposable surgical masks, and even standard surgical masks are made to protect patients from providers' germs, not the reverse.
Some say such masks are better than nothing if supplies run short, but others worry they'll provide a false sense of security and let hospitals off the hook for sourcing standard PPE.
Jane Schirmer, a sewist and nurse who worked during the SARS and H1N1 outbreaks, said health care workers shouldn't be asked to compromise on PPE.
"Nurses are not screaming, 'Please sew us pretty masks.' They are saying, 'Get us N95s. Protect our lives and our families' lives,''" Schirmer said.
Her husband, Joe Schirmer, a retired occupational safety expert and co-author of the book "Essentials of Modern Hospital Safety," believes hospital administrators and government officials should be doing more.
"These masks in some sense mask the failure of the system to deliver the goods that are needed to protect workers and the public," Joe Schirmer said.
When the couple saw some hospitals calling for cloth masks, they emailed friends and family, imploring them to use their phones instead of their sewing machines to call on the federal government to release millions of masks from the national stockpile and invoke the Defense Production Act.
This isn't like World War I, where volunteers were needed to wind bandages, or World War II, where workers kept the factories running on the homefront, Jane Schirmer said. "Our factories are intact and our infrastructure is intact. We could do the same things that were done in both those wars by ramping up production and really effectively distributing them."
Lorraine Torrence, president of the Madison chapter of the American Sewing Guild, had seen the requests from hospitals and debated whether to mobilize her more than 70 members. But she heeded the Schirmers' advice, calling on members to demand the government increase supplies. Rather than make masks, she set to work sewing several dozen surgical caps and booties following a request from a nurse at Milwaukee's Froedtert Hospital.
But developments in late March changed her stance. Not only is the national stockpile nearly empty and the Defense Protection Act already invoked, but the CDC has now instructed all Americans to cover their faces when they go out in public.
Meanwhile, after initially wavering and then opting not to accept homemade mask donations, Madison area hospitals have announced they'll accept them for nonclinical uses, such as for patients being discharged or for nonmedical staff. And the city of Madison wants them too, for employees in its parks, streets and water departments.
Torrence is now ready to endorse mask-making, whether for health care workers or anyone else. "It's a no brainer for sewers," Torrence said. "We like to sew, we have the skills, and the need is so desperate."

Build with caution
To Kevin Eliceiri, director of the Morgridge Institute for Research FabLab, it's no surprise to see makers mobilizing.
"Helping is ingrained in what we do," Eliceiri said. "This is just a call to arms on a bigger scale, and it's getting attention because of how devastating this pandemic is looking to be. But the reality is these guys do this every day."
While Eliceiri specializes in designing for biomedical contexts, many of these PPE-makers don't. One after another, makers told the Cap Times that each person should know the limits of their own resources and expertise and should choose projects accordingly.
"It would be very difficult to quickly build a ventilator with the reliability of the GE machines," UW's Rodgers said. He suggested that those who want to help make ventilators consider taking a temporary job with GE, in a role he likens to Rosie the Riveter.
Likewise, said GLW Technologies' Shepherd, not everyone should attempt to design and build an N95 mask, which uses electrostatically charged fabric to filter air. Some have tried using vacuum HEPA filters, but Shepherd said they don't allow as much diffusion, making breathing more difficult. Instead, Shepherd plans to use the same filter material used in standard N95s; he's waiting on a shipment that would allow him to make more than 2,000 masks once he receives an order from a health care provider.
He's also waiting for his mask design to be approved by the Veterans Health Administration and added to the National Institutes of Health 3D Print Exchange, a clearinghouse of printer-ready designs. He said he won't print anything that isn't vetted by a "registered medical authority."
"We wouldn't put out a false sense of security ... which is the number one concern," he said.
In addition to vetting, responsible manufacturing requires high-quality materials, production environments set up to prevent contamination, and quality control standards, Shepherd said.
But even with these precautions, makers know they're on shaky legal ground. Several have consulted with lawyers or attached disclaimers to their designs.
"If it comes down to somebody in our backyard needing critical medical care, and they can either get it from someone who has an uncertified product, or they can get nothing, I gotta believe that those people will take that uncertified product,'" said Fuller, the consultant.
Despite all his warnings, Shepherd's not barring anyone from this effort. "Maybe it's not always an N95 mask, but I think everyone is doing an important and essential role, and we'll need everybody, I think, in the coming months," Shepherd said.
Makerspaces can produce some items if they take the right precautions, Shepherd said, and anyone can design. It's not just about PPE, Shepherd said. Products like 3D-printed hands-free door openers could reduce the virus' spread in public places.

Scaling up
Another challenge facing local makers: how to produce enough to fill the enormous gap.
Rodgers knew from the start that maximizing the Badger Shield's impact would require industrial manufacturers. "It doesn't matter how great you can make it, if you don't have a factory to do large scale production with materials, you're very limited," Rodgers said.
Ford, which has halted auto production, is now producing more than 100,000 Badger Shields a week at Michigan factories.
Also on the list: a factory in Rodgers' hometown. His mom asked if the hospital near her home in Sterling, Illinois -- CGH Medical Center -- could get some face shields too. Minutes later, Rodgers saw an email from Wahl Clipper, a global producer of hair clippers, saying they'd tweaked the design and produced 1,000 shields. The company's factory was, by chance, also in Sterling.
"I'm like, 'Sweet. Can you send them to CGH?'" he said. He calls these fortuitous matches "an interesting dynamic I've never seen before."
Back where the Badger Shield began, Midwest Prototyping cranked out 50,000 shields last week and anticipates 75,000 this week, including at a new Mount Horeb facility dedicated exclusively to the project. By the end of the week, Ellison anticipates the company will be producing the powered air purifying "Badger Hood."
But even industrial manufacturers have hit obstacles. Every one of the three materials needed for the Badger Shield has run out at some point, forcing the team to search for alternative suppliers.
"The biggest thing that keeps us up at night is just the supply chain," said Ellison.
Multiple makers told the Cap Times that while mass production requires manufacturers, major players likely wouldn't have filled this gap fast enough on their own.
"Big companies like a 3M or a Ford, it takes time for them to ramp up production and especially to the scale that justifies making that business decision," said Rebecca Alcock, a graduate student in biomedical engineering and assistant manager at the Grainger makerspace.

Algorithm to the rescue
Requests for Badger Shields poured in from as far away as Chile and Australia, while manufacturers from the Philippines to South Africa have put their workers and machines to the task.
As of Monday, more than 308 companies or individuals, located in 14 countries and 39 U.S. states, have registered as Badger Shield manufacturers seeking to be matched with requesters. In total, those manufacturers estimate they can produce more than 2 million shields a day. On the buying side, 272 organizations in five countries and 41 states plus Puerto Rico, have submitted requests to purchase around 5.37 million shields.
To match supply and demand equitably, Alcock worked with operations management experts Justin Boutilier of UW-Madison and Auyon Siddiq of UCLA to create a software program that prioritizes requests by urgency and proximity to manufacturers, in real time.
While standard PPE channels prioritize hospitals, Alcock said the algorithm is designed to also get supplies to smaller medical facilities and less-visible essential workers like nursing home aides and garbage collectors.
That in one week, a team of just three people had managed to create a program that could handle requests for millions of shields, is "inconceivable," Alcock said. They still tune the model daily to be sure they're prioritizing correctly.
"We hold a great responsibility," Alcock said. "So we want to make sure we build the model in a way that is doing the people justice who need it, in making sure we're getting them as fast as we can to the places that need them most."
So far, production has kept up with demand, though they're still trying to find the right large supplier for New York City, which requested five million shields. The challenge now is visibility - trying to reach more workplaces so they can request shields if needed. They've even begun crowdsourcing, asking people to add their local hospitals, nursing homes or police stations to a list so that Alcock and her colleagues can offer to match them with shields.
Soon, the Badger Shield team may add a second item to its list - the Badger Hood.
But already Alcock and her collaborators are looking beyond this pandemic to the next time PPE could be in short supply. They've applied for a grant to continue developing their algorithm for use in "future demand spikes," like when a hurricane hits the Gulf Coast or a volcano erupts in Guatemala.
"Unfortunately, it took this global pandemic to necessitate creating a tool like this," Alcock said. "But now that it's here, how can we make it better? And how can we be ready to use it right away in the future for catastrophic events ... so that PPE shortages are minimal?"

Texto completo: It's the fourth week of the Cap Times Quarantine Cooking Club, and we're digging further into the freezer and pantry to see what we've forgotten. Every week we bring you recipe ideas for weeknight suppers, simple lunches, baking projects and freezer meals.
In this installment, we've got safer-at-home birthday budino, black bean breakfast tostadas, grain bowls with my favorite quarantine protein, salmon on the grill and tortilla soup. Send your own home cooking recommendations to LChristians@madison.com. Tell us why you love it!
WEEK FOUR
The kale salad that started it all from "Six Seasons" by Joshua McFadden - If you roll your eyes every time someone references kale as "trendy," blame Wisconsinite-turned-Portland chef McFadden. His kale salad, rubbed with lemon and garlic and tossed with a generous "glug" of olive oil, got written up by the New York Times in 2007 and we've never looked back. Homemade croutons, a handful of shaved pecorino and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes make it easy to go through an entire bunch of Tuscan kale in a single sitting.

The only marinade you'll ever need from "The Barbecue! Bible" by Steve Raichlen - I've made this marinade so many times I pretty much have it memorized. It's super fresh, with lemon juice and lemon zest, and full of as many fresh herbs as you've got. I often add grainy mustard for an extra punch, or a tiny pinch of sugar. It's fast and fantastic. Most recently I used it on chicken thigh and leg quarters we threw on the grill, but I've used it for everything from firm fish fillets to pressed tofu, flank steak and even lamb.

Lamb blade chops from Food52's "A New Way to Dinner" by Amanda Hesser and Merrill Stubbs - My mom and dad were supposed to come up last weekend for Good Friday and Easter. We were supposed to have a ham. Instead I picked up this recipe for lamb with an herb-backed green sauce, made with parsley, preserved lemon and crushed red pepper. I had my partner finish fingerling potatoes on the grill while I steamed some fat globe artichokes. We drank red wine. Before we sat down, I called my parents to confirm they were not leaving the house either.

Non-recipe recipe: Before I made my meal plan for the week, I dug around in the pantry and came up with a bag of fresh-ish farro. I cooked it off in the Instant Pot and cooled it down for later. At lunchtime, I grabbed kimchi from the door of my fridge (I like Milwaukee-made Jeff's Zimchi), a 6-minute soft-boiled egg (prime quarantine protein!), massaged kale that didn't make it into the salad above and a few other staples, including ginger, soy sauce and sesame oil. This grain bowl is based on a Melissa Clark recipe, but it's infinitely variable. I think I put a roasted beet in mine, and some avocado and cilantro. Riffing encouraged.

What Nicole's cooking
I reached my friend Nicole while she was prepping face masks made from quilting scraps. She held one up, bright red with a paisley-ish pattern. "It's kind of viral-looking, right?" she said.
Nicole's birthday was in late March. By that time most of us were homebound, so she did "extensive internet research" on how to make the butterscotch pudding she loves at the downtown Italian restaurant Osteria Papavero. She settled on a recipe from Bon Appetit's September 2011 issue, but it was a flop - "soupy budino sadness," she said.
"You stick in it a Mason jar and it looks amazing, but it's lies, nothing but Instagram tomfoolery," Nicole said. Her next bid for budino will involve heavy cream and dark rum, a recipe courtesy of Nancy Silverton at Pizzeria Mozza as reprinted in "Food52's Genius Desserts" (also at Saveur).
Nicole has a substantial cookbook collection. She pulled out Tara O'Brady's "Seven Spoons" to make her great, basic chocolate chip cookies, and called on "Thug Kitchen: The Official Cookbook" to make tortilla soup, "a vegan recipe that I promptly decided not to make vegan and used chicken stock instead of vegetable stock," she said.
A recipe for breakfast black bean tostadas with purple cabbage slaw, recommended by Nicole's sister-in-law, came out of "Food52 Vegan," another cookbook from the always-reliable brand. She'd double the spices in it next time, but otherwise "it was really tasty," Nicole said. "It wasn't made (only) with pantry staples, but it was pretty simple."
Another option for breakfast? Cake! Nicole made a thick, comforting cornmeal loaf cake from a recent New York Times feature by Melissa Clark using full-fat Fage Greek yogurt and coconut oil, as well as half portions each of finely ground cornmeal and polenta. This was delicious toasted in the morning. She would add lavender flowers next time. I might do it with olive oil and orange or lemon zest.
The coconut oil, Nicole said, was "not past its prime, but getting there." She figured, "it's just me. Who cares? If I fail, I can rage eat it."
"So far nothing has been so bad that I couldn't eat it," she said. "I might just be developing a strong stomach. Now is the time to clean out the fridge!"
What Ruthie's cooking
With this shift to more cooking at home and near full-time online life, food bloggers are coming into their own. New Cap Times photographer Ruthie Hauge frequently sources from blogs for her family's Paleo-friendly meals (read: more meat and veggies, fewer grains).
Earlier this week, they capitalized on the nice weather by putting salmon right onto the grill. The filets got a familiar marinade/sauce built on honey, soy sauce, rice vinegar, garlic, ginger and sesame oil, with optional Sriracha for a little heat and scallions if you've got them. Find the recipe on damndelicious.net.
If you're anti-gluten and happen to have tapioca flour and coconut flour in the pantry, give crumb-topped coffee cake a shot. The topping includes coconut sugar, coconut flour and coconut oil, so it definitely has a beachy vibe. The recipe comes from asaucykitchen.com.
Finally, once the cool and rainy weather comes back, I'm eyeing preps like this one Ruthie made recently - boneless pork chops, seared and finished with a pan sauce mounted with butter. Serve it with rutabaga truffle fries, rosemary aioli, and microgreens dressed with honey mustard vinaigrette if you want the full experience. Find the pork chop recipe at inspiredtaste.net.

Texto completo: As African-Americans continue to be infected with, and die from, the coronavirus at an alarming rate, Oprah Winfrey is addressing the situation in a special presentation on Apple TV+ and OWN.
In “Oprah Talks COVID-19 — The Deadly Impact on Black America,” the media mogul looks to bring attention to the devastating impact the pandemic is having on African-Americans across the country.
“This coronavirus is shaking up the world,” Winfrey wrote in a Twitter post. “I hope you’ll join me to understand why COVID-19 is having such a deadly impact on black America as I speak to leaders in our community and family members who are having to bury their dead alone.”
The episode is available now, for free, on Apple TV+ (no subscription needed). It will also air tonight (April 14) on OWN at 8 p.m. PT (11 p.m. ET).
In the special, Winfrey speaks with Van Jones, CNN host and CEO of Reform Alliance; Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot; Dr. Aletha Maybank, chief health equity officer at the American Medical Association; and Nikole Hannah-Jones, New York Times staff writer and founder of 1619 Project, a civil rights-themed series as part of the New York Times Magazine.
Additional guests join the conversation from their respective remote locations around the country to share how COVID-19 is impacting certain regions, how citizens can support those most in need and hear personal experiences from those on the frontline fighting this pandemic.
Also featured: A musical performance by Jennifer Hudson.
On Tuesday morning, Winfrey appeared on NBC’s “Today,” where she spoke to Hoda Kotb about how the coronavirus is “ravaging” the black community.
“Not only is it serious, but people that you don’t know, but probably will know, are losing their loved ones,” she said.
Winfrey went on to note that, among the reasons the black community has been so devastated, is the occupational obligations its citizens are facing.
“We as a people, as African-Americans, have jobs that require us to be at work,” she said. “For so many African Americans, there isn’t this ability to telecommute.”
“We certainly understand that the responsibilities and dynamics of some people’s lives, particularly African-American and brown people, do not allow you to be able to stay at home,” she continued. “Therefore, they need masks … For now everybody needs to look out for themselves and for their neighbors.”
Winfrey went on to emphasize the need for more — and faster — testing and stressed that it’s vitally important that African-Americans understand the urgency of the situation.
“It’s taking us out,” she said. “It’s killing your cousins and your friends and your neighbors. And you need to do whatever you can to protect yourself.”
Winfrey is backing up her potentially life-saving message with money. Last week she announced that she is donating $10 million to coronavirus relief efforts.

Texto completo: If there is a silver lining to the ugly #MeToo accusation against Joe Biden, it is that the reluctance of the left and the media to pursue it as vigorously as charges against other men suggests they may have discovered that principles such as due process and the presumption of innocence still matter in America. Or so we can hope.
The accusation against the presumptive Democratic nominee for President comes from Tara Reade, a former Senate staffer for Mr. Biden. In 1993, she says, then-Sen. Biden pinned her to a wall, put his hand under her skirt and digitally penetrated her. On Sunday The New York Times carried a story that cited a friend who said Ms. Reade told her about the incident right after it is alleged to have happened. It also cited her brother and another friend who said she'd told them over the years. The friends were anonymous.
Mr. Biden denies the accusation, unequivocally. But here's the complication. Mr. Biden has long embraced the view that women must be believed on sexual assault. Except, apparently, for Ms. Reade.
Mr. Biden has a long and convoluted history here. When Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexually harassing her, Mr. Biden, as Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, insisted she would have to make her case publicly so Mr. Thomas could answer the charges. In 1994, for their book "Strange Justice," he told Jane Mayer and Jill Abramson that he acted with "fairness to Thomas, which in retrospect he didn't deserve," and he later apologized to Ms. Hill. Now he wants the fairness standard for himself.
Mr. Biden has long painted himself as a champion for victims of abuse and harassment, saying his proudest legislative achievement was the 1994 Violence Against Women Act. As Vice President he appointed the first White House Adviser on Violence Against Women and served as point man for the Obama Administration's effort to change the "culture on campus" toward sexual assault and harassment. This turned out to mean throwing protections for accused students out the window and allowing the minimum standard of evidence to conclude guilt.
After Mr. Biden had left office, Brett Kavanaugh, Donald Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court, was accused by Christine Blasey Ford of sexually assaulting her when the two were in high school. Mr. Biden spoke generally at the time about these kind of he-said, she-said cases involving a public figure.
"For a woman to come forward in the glaring lights of focus, nationally," he told reporters, "you've got to start off with the presumption that at least the essence of what she's talking about is real, whether or not she forgets facts, whether or not it's been made worse or better over time." Again, except for now.
WSJ Opinion: The Coronavirus, America's Response and the 2020 Election
The Covid-19 pandemic will cost thousands of lives and cause a sharp economic recession. WSJ Opinion's Paul Gigot and Kimberley Strassel, with guests Marie Harf and columnist Karl Rove, joined "Opinion Live" on April 14th to discuss how America is mobilizing against this challenge, the social and economic lockdown, the response from business and governments, and the impact on the election. Click here to watch the Q&A Video replay.
The accusation against Mr. Biden has also exposed the double standards of the media. When Mr. Kavanaugh was the target, for example, the New York Times reported Julie Swetnick's charges—including that she'd seen Mr. Kavanaugh at high school parties where women were "gang raped"—the same day she made them. They were smears backed up by no evidence. There's been much less media appetite to report on Ms. Reade's claims.
Times editor Dean Baquet waited 19 days to report her allegation and was asked by his own media columnist why Mr. Kavanaugh was treated differently. His answer: "So I thought in [Ms. Reade's] case, if The New York Times was going to introduce this to readers, we needed to introduce it with some reporting and perspective. Kavanaugh was in a very different situation. It was a live, ongoing story that had become the biggest political story in the country. It was just a different news judgment moment." It sure was.
We said at the time that we didn't know if Ms. Blasey Ford was telling the truth, and we don't know whether Ms. Reade is now. When women make serious charges they deserve to be taken seriously, but that shouldn't mean assuming an accused man must be lying. The right way to proceed is to decline to make a judgment and examine the claims and supporting evidence. In the case of Ms. Blasey Ford, no corroboration was forthcoming.
All of this is called due process and the presumption of innocence. These protections apply to everyone—including those who would deny them to others. Such as Mr. Biden.

Texto completo: A team from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has arrived in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, to help with the Smithfield Foods coronavirus hot spot, which has become the biggest single source of cases in the United States.
Eighty of South Dakota's 180 new COVID-19 cases are employees of the meat-processing company, bringing the total to 518 Smithfield Foods employees who have tested positive. There are also now 126 total cases of non-employees that became infected when they came into contact with a Smithfield employee, according to the South Dakota Department of Health.
The 518 employees and 126 non-employees connected to Smithfield makes it the largest cluster in the country (644), according to tracking by The New York Times. The previous top cluster was 585 cases aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt in Guam.
Fact check: Smithfield Foods is not selling meat that was slaughtered, processed in China
Smithfield announced Sunday that it would be closing its Sioux Falls plant indefinitely Wednesday. The plant has 3,700 employees.
Gov. Kristi Noem said the state is "aggressively testing" Smithfield employees and people who have come into contact with them, as well as getting people into isolation as soon as possible.
The CDC team is scheduled to tour the Smithfield plant on Thursday morning and create a checklist of items to complete before the plant can reopen, Noem said during a press conference on Wednesday. Noem said she's working with federal officials and Smithfield leaders to get the plant back online to provide relief for pork producers and the food chain.
Health Secretary Kim Malsam-Rysdon said they requested the CDC bring in occupational health experts to help the state understand Smithfield's coronavirus situation and what the company can do to protect its workers. Smithfield is cooperating with the state, and they look forward to the mitigation efforts so the plant can reopen, Malsam-Rysdon said.

Comments about coronavirus prompt hate directed at former 'Loveline' host Dr. Drew

Texto completo: On an episode of "The Masked Singer" in October, the judges were stumped. A celebrity disguised as an eagle had just been eliminated after an unremarkable rendition of "These Boots Are Made for Walkin'," and the clues were that it was someone "studious and intelligent" who was the face of their field and spent a lot of time listening to famous people tell their stories. Who could it be? Howard Stern? Adam Carolla? Craig Ferguson? Finally, the eagle was unmasked.
"It's Dr. Drew!" yelled host Nick Cannon as Drew Pinsky took off his elaborate mask to audience cheers. "From 'Loveline!'"
Three decades ago, if you told someone that Dr. Drew - the levelheaded physician who dispensed medical and personal advice on the massively popular radio show starting in 1984 - would go on to become a celebrity, headline a polarizing "Celebrity Rehab" reality-show franchise, and compete on a bizarre singing-competition series, they probably would not have believed you. They probably would have been equally incredulous that Pinsky would become embroiled in a controversy in which he initially downplayed the seriousness of a global pandemic, comparing it to the flu. But Pinksy's evolution over the years from stalwart doctor to reality TV headliner has taken unusual twists and turns.
On April 2, a social media user posted a compilation of comments made by Pinsky from February through mid-March about the novel coronavirus and its subsequent media coverage. In various podcast and television appearances, he called covid-19 "way less serious than influenza"; referred to it as "a press-induced panic"; said "the flu virus in this country is vastly more consequential," and compared the probability of dying from the disease to being "hit by an asteroid." The montage - which has been viewed more than 4 million times - was followed by a long apology from Pinsky, released in Periscope videos.
"My early comments about equating coronavirus with influenza were wrong. They were incorrect. It was part of a chorus that was saying that and we were wrong. And I want to apologize for that. I wish I got it right, but I got it wrong," Pinsky said. He added he didn't fully understand the virus's ferocity, and his comparison of influenza and coronavirus statistics was based on "loserthink," a term coined by "Dilbert" creator Scott Adams referring to "sneaky mental habits trapping victims in their own bubbles of reality."
Pinsky, who said he had received death threats in recent days, emphasized he also always advised people to listen to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and to immunologist Anthony S. Fauci, whom he called his "north star" since the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s: "When Dr. Fauci made it clear that this was not a usual influenza, that it was significantly worse, I adjusted course." His intention, he said, "was to try to lessen the panic that I could see coming."
One reason the backlash against Pinsky hit a nerve is that some on social media were dismayed to see someone they respected from his days as a "Loveline" radio host be so wrong about such a critically important issue. Though Pinsky has made lots of headlines for controversies throughout his years working on reality TV, like Cannon on "Masked Singer," many still associate him with his 30 years as a trusted adviser to young people looking for guidance about deeply personal problems.
"I value and cherish their respect, making the fact that they felt disappointed that much more painful," Pinsky said in an email to The Washington Post. "My goal has always been simply to find ways to use media to do good. Having learned from my error, I humbly hope that I may continue to look for opportunities to do so."

In 2007, VH1 announced the debut of "Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew," an unflinching look at addicts going through detox and rehabilitation at a treatment center in California. With cast members from Daniel Baldwin to Brigitte Nielsen, the series received plenty of attention - and even more skepticism. How could addicts attempt recovery in front of cameras?
But there appeared to be one especially comforting factor for the network: Dr. Drew's involvement. Pinsky, the host and executive producer who pitched the show, had built up credibility from his years offering advice on "Loveline" - adapted in 1996 into a series that aired for five seasons on MTV, which shares a parent company with VH1 - and was the go-to TV commentator on health and addiction. A New York Times profile in 2008 noted his "easygoing, nonjudgmental manner" won over young listeners, and dubbed him the "Gen-X answer to Dr. Ruth Westheimer, with an AIDS-era, pro-safe-sex message."
At the time, tabloids were obsessively covering Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan's trips to rehab, and Pinsky said he was tired of seeing treatment programs portrayed as a celebrity indulgence. His goal was to bring awareness to how brutal addiction could be, he said, and what rehabilitation really entailed. Maybe someone would recognize their own behavior and realize they needed help. "I wasn't clear this was a good idea," he told the Los Angeles Times in 2008. "It sounds exploitive; it certainly could have been, but for the grace of God, I don't think it was. . . . Ultimately, I was responsible for treatment, not a good TV show."
In an email, Pinsky told The Post that cast members were often reluctant to participate but changed course when they saw how seriously the staff took the process. "We insisted that patients be given one year of psychiatric care following the initial treatment," Pinsky said, adding that scenes filmed for the show were separate from priorities of their care. "I do believe we helped increase an understanding and awareness of the struggles of addiction and the challenges of treatment. And as the opiate epidemic has unfolded in the public consciousness, I think people understand now even more vividly how serious this condition is."
Early stories called Pinsky the possible "saving grace" of the series and noted his "articulate compassion." But plenty slammed it as exploitative and unethical. "Pinsky's professional expertise and rational demeanor set him apart from hyperventilating peers in the commentator business," Los Angeles Magazine wrote in 2010. "Others see in his TV programs the shadow of addiction tourism. The man in the tight blue shirt has been called a fame junkie and a manipulator of other people's misery."
As the show became a hit and spawned spinoffs such as "Sober House" and "Sex Rehab," the criticism grew more intense. Season 1 cast member Jessica Sierra was arrested after a confrontation with police before the series aired. Tom Sizemore and Heidi Fleiss were both cast on Season 3, even though he was previously convicted of domestic violence against her. Backlash hit a peak in 2013 when Mindy McCready, who appeared in Season 3 in 2009, committed suicide. She was the fifth former "Celebrity Rehab" contestant to die in the span of two years.
Pinsky sat for multiple interviews to respond to the criticism. "In a weird way, I wish I could claim more responsibility for this. The reality is, though, I haven't seen Mindy, say, in years. I've talked to her occasionally, we've been friendly, but I've not been her doctor in years," he said on "The View" when asked whether her televised treatment had a negative impact. Others spoke up to defend him, given the complicated nature of addiction, but the debate raged. The last season of "Celebrity Rehab" aired in fall 2012, and Pinsky said he had no plans to continue, partly because he felt he was being unfairly blamed for the death of participants well after they left the show.

In late March, about a week before his video apology, Pinsky appeared on the Ora TV show "PoliticKING with Larry King." Pinsky was not happy that a recent New York Times story listed him alongside Sean Hannity and Jerry Falwell Jr. as a "coronavirus doubter"; it quoted a March 16 episode of his online series "Dose of Dr. Drew" with comedian Rob Schneider, who called coronavirus a "mild flu" and railed against the media, and said local mayors were "idiots" for shutting down businesses. While Pinsky was more cautious, saying coronavirus was different from the flu, he agreed healthy people should be able to go "about their business." He also didn't correct Schneider when he said the "19" in "covid-19" meant that there have been 18 previous coronaviruses.
"I'm not doubting anything," Pinsky told King, and said he had always followed the CDC and urged others to do the same; when they updated to stricter guidelines, so did he. He said he was concerned about the panic being worse than the disease with the proliferation of what he called "doomsday" scenarios, such as publications reporting on a study from the Imperial College of London that projected 500,000 deaths in Britain, a number that was later lowered when the models were altered to reflect the effects of social distancing instead of no mitigation efforts. "We don't have to have a press making us panic."
When asked about what he thinks of the media coverage now and whether his views have changed, Pinsky told The Post, "My goal was always to try to get people to regulate their emotional response to this pandemic so as to prevent people from flying into a panic. I have decades of experience in U.S. health care which gives me a profound confidence in our ability to flex, improvise and innovate in the face of enormous challenges. I wish there had been greater emphasis upon the U.S. health-care system, as well as Dr. Fauci and the CDC's ability to meet the demands of the crisis."
Pinsky further slammed the media in his appearance on King's show, after King asked how he had been labeled a denier, saying things were being reported that were "actually factually, grotesquely inaccurate." While Pinsky didn't elaborate, the Times story also mentioned the cancellation of his HLN show in 2016, which was announced several days after he questioned the health of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. While Pinsky's publicist and others insisted the timing was coincidental, saying the network had already made the decision weeks earlier because it was rebranding its entire lineup, some linked the two incidents.
At the time, the Daily Beast speculated the show cancellation could be the final straw in controversies spelling the end for Dr. Drew, but that was not the case: He currently hosts multiple podcasts and online series and remains a frequent TV presence (even though sometimes he's dressed as an eagle). Though now, given the still-growing global and domestic impact of the pandemic, Pinsky's goodwill from some fans may be more difficult to earn back.
"Dr. Drew has made an important positive impact over the years as an MD in the media . . . but he was never on the cutting edge of medicine, and, given his media work, could not possibly have devoted the same amount of his time to his practice and medicine as a full-time MD not on radio and television," said Paul Levinson, a professor of communications and media studies at Fordham University. "The important lesson here is that the public should look for the most accurate medical information and analysis from doctors who spend all of their time practicing medicine or doing medical research."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - A former aide to Joe Biden is accusing the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee of sexually assaulting her during the early 1990s when he was a senator. Biden's campaign denies the charges.
In two recent interviews with The Associated Press, Tara Reade alleged the assault occurred in the basement of a Capitol Hill office building in the spring of 1993. She filed a police report in Washington on Thursday saying she was the victim of a sexual assault by an unnamed person in 1993, a copy of which was obtained by the AP.
It's not the first time Reade has made an accusation against the former vice president. Last year, Reade publicly accused Biden of inappropriate touching, but did not allege sexual assault.
In a statement, Biden deputy campaign manager and communications director Kate Bedingfield said the former vice president has "dedicated his public life to changing the culture and the laws around violence against women," pointing to his work passing the Violence Against Women Act. She said "he firmly believes that women have a right to be heard - and heard respectfully," but added: "Such claims should also be diligently reviewed by an independent press."
"What is clear about this claim: it is untrue. This absolutely did not happen," Bedingfield said.
Reade's charge comes at a pivotal time for Biden. The former vice president is seeking to unify the Democratic Party behind his campaign as the party's presumptive presidential nominee after Sen. Bernie Sanders dropped out of the primary last week. Women are a crucial voting bloc for Democrats and any erosion of support for Biden could sink his candidacy in the fall.
The November contest between Biden and President Donald Trump will be the first presidential race of the #MeToo era, a movement that spurred numerous women to come forward with allegations of sexual assault, including against several prominent men in politics, entertainment and other industries. Trump has also been accused of assault and unwanted touching by numerous women, charges he denies. He was forced to apologize during the 2016 campaign after he was heard on a recording bragging about using his fame to assault women.
Earlier in the Democratic primary, Biden faced accusations of unwanted touching by several women, who said they were uncomfortable with hugs, hand holding and other actions. Reade was among the women who came forward at the time.
In recent weeks, she's given a handful of interviews saying Biden's actions went further that she initially disclosed. In an interview with the AP, she detailed a 1993 encounter that she says occurred when she was asked by a supervisor to bring Biden his gym bag as he was on his way down to the Senate gymnasium. She says Biden pushed her against a wall in the basement of a Capitol Hill office building, groped her and penetrated her with his fingers.
"He was whispering to me and trying to kiss me at the same time, and he was saying, 'Do you want to go somewhere else?"' she said. "I remember wanting to say stop, but I don't know if I said it out loud or if I just thought it. I was kind of frozen up."
Reade said that she pulled away and Biden looked "shocked and surprised," and replied, "Come on, man, I heard you liked me."
Reade, who was a staff assistant in Biden's office at the time, said she wasn't aware of any direct witnesses to the encounter. She told the AP she did raise accusations of sexual harassment, but not assault, against Biden in multiple meetings with her supervisors, including Marianne Baker, Biden's executive assistant; Dennis Toner, Biden's deputy chief of staff; and Ted Kaufman, the senator's chief of staff.
In a statement provided by the campaign, Baker said that in the nearly two decades she worked for Biden, "I never once witnessed, or heard of, or received, any reports of inappropriate conduct, period -• not from Ms. Reade, not from anyone."
The AP spoke to five current or former Biden staffers on Sunday, all of whom worked for him at the time of the alleged incident. None recalled such an incident or a report, and neither Toner nor Kaufman could recall Reade. Both said what she had described was out of character for Biden.
"She did not come to me. I would have remembered her if she had, and I don't remember her at all," Kaufman said.
Reade said she filed a written report with a Senate personnel office. But she didn't receive a copy of it and has been unable to obtain one since because, she says, Biden's Senate files are currently at the University of Delaware, which has not yet made them public.
The AP has been unable to verify whether a report was made.
Reade says after complaining to supervisors, her job responsibilities were scaled back and she was eventually told by Toner that she was not a good fit for the job and encouraged to find a new one. This contradicts her comments to The New York Times, which reported Reade said Kaufman told her she was not a good fit for the job.
Reade told the AP she spoke to at least four people about Biden's conduct before she went public with her experience: two friends, her brother and her mother. Her mother passed away, and her brother did not respond to a request for comment.
One friend, who knew Reade in 1993, said in an interview Sunday that Reade told them about the alleged assault when it happened. The person, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation, didn't mention the assault allegation during an initial interview with the AP last year, but confirmed those details after Reade went forward with them. The person said they had initially advised Reade against sharing details of the assault because of the negative response to her less serious accusations of harassment.
The second friend met Reade more than a decade after the alleged incident and confirmed that Reade had a conversation with them in 2007 or 2008 about experiencing sexual harassment from Biden while working in his Senate office. But the friend, who requested anonymity to protect the privacy of their family, made no mention of assault.
In the course of reporting on Reade's allegations, the AP also contacted 21 former Biden staffers from the time and spoke to several of them. While some remembered Reade, none recalled any instances of inappropriate touching or behavior on Biden's behalf, or any complaints made by Reade.
Melissa Lefko, who worked as a staff assistant for Biden at the same time as Reade, said Biden had very little interaction with staff at their level, and that Reade's recollection of Biden's conduct didn't match her own.
"When you work on the Hill, you know who the good guys are who the bad guys are and who you should avoid and Biden was a good guy, he was never, ever on that list of the bad guys," she said in an interview.
Biden's conduct towards women first came under scrutiny just before he announced his presidential campaign last spring. Eight women, including Reade, came forward with allegations that the former vice president made them feel uncomfortable with inappropriate physical displays of affection.
Biden acknowledged the complaints and promised to "be more mindful about respecting personal space in the future."
The AP spoke with Reade about those complaints in April 2019. During that interview, Reade alleged that Biden rubbed her shoulders and neck, played with her hair, and that she was asked by another aide in Biden's Senate office to dress more conservatively and told "don't be so sexy." The AP declined to publish details of the interview at the time because reporters were unable to corroborate her allegations, and aspects of her story contradicted other reporting.
In recent months, Reade came forward with the additional allegation of assault, speaking first to progressive podcast host Katie Halper, before The New York Times published an extensive review of her claims Sunday.
Reade's story of sexual harassment had circulated for weeks in both conservative and progressive media outlets. While Reade said she supported Sanders or Elizabeth Warren in the Democratic primary, she said that her decision to come forward with new details was not politically motivated.
In her Sunday interview with the AP, Reade said that she was reluctant to share details of the assault during her initial conversations with reporters over a year ago because she was scared of backlash, and was still coming to terms with what happened to her.
"Already I was being threatened and kind of smeared, and I just I wasn't ready," she said. "So I talked about the sexual harassment and what I was comfortable talking about, but I wasn't ready to talk about sexual assault."

Texto completo: With the number of new deaths and rate of hospitalizations falling in New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo said Monday “the worst is over" in the coronavirus pandemic, and he announced an alliance with six other Northeastern governors to explore how to eventually lift restrictions — a move that appeared to be an implicit rebuke to President Trump.
The governors from New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island said they would begin to draw up a plan for when to reopen businesses and schools and how quickly to allow people to return to work safely, although the timeline for such a plan remained unclear.
The joint effort was the first of two announced Monday: The governors of California, Oregon, and Washington, three Western states that were among those that felt the effects of the virus before it spread rapidly in the Northeast, announced a similar pact. All but one of the 10 governors on the two coasts are Democrats.
The focus on reopening the economy came even as the death toll in New York state surpassed 10,000 people, but other indicators continued to plateau or decline slightly, leading Cuomo to declare that the worst of the outbreak may have passed.
Nearly 19,000 people remain hospitalized in New York, the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States, but the rate of hospitalizations has slowed markedly over the last week, and the 671 deaths announced Monday marked the lowest one-day death toll in a week.

CIA warns against unproven treatment touted by Trump
The CIA has privately advised its workforce that taking an antimalarial drug touted by President Trump and some of his supporters as a promising treatment for the coronavirus has potentially dangerous side effects, including sudden death.
The warning, featured on a website for CIA employees with questions related to the spread of the coronavirus, came in late March after public discussion — and promotion by the president — that hydroxychloroquine, administered in concert with the antibiotic azithromycin, might prove effective against COVID-19.
The politically charged debate over hydroxychloroquine — medical specialists say there's still no conclusive evidence that it does what Trump has suggested — underscores a recurring phenomenon in this administration, in which the president stakes out a very public, sometimes controversial position on a subject only to have agencies within the government chart a different, more cautious approach.
A CIA spokesman declined to comment about internal workforce communications. The advice was posted as a response after an employee asked whether the employee should take the drug without a prescription.
Washington Post
The East Coast, always in the spotlight, owes debt to West
LOS ANGELES — California, Oregon, and Washington have more ventilators than they can use. As the nation struggles to scrounge up the lifesaving machines for hospitals overrun with COVID-19 patients, these three Western states recently shipped 1,000 spares to New York and other besieged neighbors to the East.
“All NYC needs is love . . . From CA," a worker scrawled in Magic Marker on a ventilator shipping box, shown in a video posted on Twitter by the governor of California, Gavin Newsom.
The ongoing effort of three West Coast states to come to the aid of more hard-hit parts of the nation has emerged as the most powerful indication to date that the early intervention of West Coast governors and mayors might have mitigated, at least for now, the medical catastrophe that has befallen New York and parts of the Midwest and South.
Their aggressive imposition of stay-at-home orders has stood in contrast to the relatively slower actions in New York and elsewhere, and drawn widespread praise from epidemiologists. As of Saturday afternoon, there had been 8,627 COVID-19 related deaths in New York, compared with 598 in California, 483 in Washington and 48 in Oregon. New York had 44 deaths per 100,000 people. California had two.

ACLU: Feds 'slow walking' inmate release at prison
WASHINGTON — Prisoner rights advocates accused the federal Bureau of Prisons of “slow walking" the release of inmates at a Louisiana lockup where the coronavirus has killed six prisoners and infected dozens of others.
The American Civil Liberties Union urged a federal judge on Monday to release hundreds of vulnerable inmates at FCC Oakdale to home confinement, calling the rural facility a tinderbox “ready to explode."
Jail officials deemed several dozen prisoners “potentially eligible" for release. But the ACLU described the government's plan as “far too little, far too late."
As of Sunday night, 38 inmates and 17 staff members had tested positive for COVID-19 at the Louisiana prison. There have been six deaths there since March 21.
“The prison has apparently succeeded in releasing no one except to hospitals and mortuaries," the nonprofit argued in new court filings.
The Bureau of Prisons did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It previously has said its case managers are “urgently reviewing all inmates to determine which ones" are eligible for home confinement.

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
OAKLAND, Calif. — Google’s and Facebook’s advertising businesses, which have roughly tripled in combined size over the past five years, may be headed for a rare stumble as the coronavirus pushes the global economy into a tailspin.
Once-abundant travel and entertainment ads have all but disappeared from Google search. The prices for Facebook advertisements are at record lows. And Wall Street analysts are estimating that annual revenues will decline for the first time in the history of the two companies.
It’s the type of downturn that traditional media has experienced before but was hard to imagine for the duopoly that accounts for more than half of the spending in online advertising.
And yet, as gloomy as the situation may appear for Google and Facebook, the outlook for the rest of the digital advertising industry is even bleaker. What little digital spending there is will still flow to them, leaving smaller social media platforms and publishers out in the cold.
“To the extent that people are still spending, it will be even more concentrated with Google and Facebook,” said Nicole Perrin, principal analyst at research firm eMarketer. “They are likely going to end up in a stronger position after all this is over.”
A shakeout is starting to take shape. Review site Yelp said Thursday that it was laying off 1,000 employees and furloughing another 1,100. In an email, Jeremy Stoppelman, Yelp’s chief executive, said it needed to cut costs in the face of stay-at-home measures that have hammered restaurants, bars and other local business — the company’s main advertisers.
After projecting revenue to increase between 5% and 11% in the first quarter, Twitter withdrew its quarterly estimate last month and forecast revenue to decline slightly. Pinterest pulled its projection of full-year revenue growth of more than 30% because it said it started to see a sharp decline from mid-March. It did not offer updated guidance.
David Rodnitzky, chief executive of ad agency 3Q Digital, said during lean times advertisers opted for ads that translated most directly into new business. Combining a wealth of information about users with the most visited destinations on the internet, Google and Facebook are safe.
That’s not to say the two companies aren’t heading into a rough patch. In an investor note last month, John Blackledge, an analyst for the investment firm Cowen, trimmed his 2020 revenue forecast for Google and Facebook by nearly 20%. He now predicts a decline in annual revenue for both.
The prices of Facebook ads have declined 35- to 50% on average in recent weeks, said Alex Palmer, an analyst for Gupta Media, a digital marketing agency. Last month, Facebook warned that it was already seeing signs of an early pullback.
“Our business is being adversely affected like so many others,” Alex Schultz and Jay Parikh, two Facebook vice presidents, wrote in a company blog post in March. “We’ve seen a weakening in our ads business in countries taking aggressive actions to reduce the spread of COVID-19.”
Mark Mahaney, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, ran 50 Google searches last month and found no paid ads for travel and restaurants.
“We can’t recall ever NOT seeing a ‘Paid Ad’ under the search term ‘Las Vegas Hotels’,” he wrote. “This is indicative of the broader trends across online advertising.”
Average daily spending on digital ads slumped more than 20% in the latter half of March for sports and entertainment businesses, according to the advertising analytics platform Pathmatics. Cirque du Soleil, for example, went from sometimes spending more than $140,000 a day on digital ads in late February, to spending less than $40,000 a day in late March and then nothing in early April.
Travel companies like Korean Air and Norwegian Cruise Line dropped their digital ad spending to near zero in mid-March, according to Pathmatics. Home-rental company Airbnb suspended all marketing, cutting back from a projected $800 million this year.
Advertisers that are still spending are tiptoeing around coronavirus news. Stories or posts about death, illness and economic turmoil are not exactly advertiser-friendly, and many mainstream marketers are avoiding any pandemic-related content.
“Many brands are being cautious,” said Nancy Smith, chief executive of Analytic Partners, an advertising consulting firm. “People don’t want to see, say, a Pantene ad next to their loved one who is in the hospital.”
Before the coronavirus upended its plans, real estate firm Coldwell Banker was preparing for an advertising blitz online and TV during the NCAA men’s basketball tournament. When the pandemic forced the cancellation of games, Coldwell Banker put a freeze on its plans and halted spending on ads for terms like “vacation homes.”
But after shutting down advertising, Coldwell, like other brands, is edging back to Google and Facebook. The company debuted a revamped version of its ad campaign Monday that will run entirely online on Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.
United Airlines pulled nearly all its advertising for four days before returning with a new message about its waived change fees, according to Pathmatics. Ahead of Easter, chocolatier Godiva said it had placed ads on Google, Instagram and Facebook to direct customers to its online ordering site. Panera Bread said it bought ads alerting customers to pickup and delivery options including a new grocery service.
Many advertisers are avoiding coronavirus content on news sites and Facebook feeds. Google said it had controls to ensure that advertisers were comfortable with the content that their brand appeared alongside. It allows advertisers to opt out of coronavirus content as well as sensitive categories like tragedy or infectious diseases. Facebook has a similar feature.
At the same time, Google and Facebook are struggling to strike the right balance in policing problematic ads.
Google said it had started a “sensitive events” policy last month, which restricts ads on coronavirus content. On March 9, it also placed a temporary ban on ads selling masks, citing a supply shortage for medical professionals.
But mask ads served by Google continue to appear on publisher websites across the internet. There are also ads served by Google for hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes from e-commerce sites offering a wide selection of masks and other items in short supply at significant markups.
Google said that it had taken down 50 million ads as of the end of March, and that up to 80% of the 10 million or so bad ads it flagged daily were coronavirus-related.
Facebook banned the placement of predatory ads for masks, sanitizer and other personal protective equipment, and it eliminated nearly all mask ads across the social network. But its efforts hampered volunteer groups that have banded together in Facebook groups to donate homemade masks to health care professionals.
“This is a continual battle that goes back and forth with sophisticated entities on the other side who are trying to circumvent Google’s detection system,” said Scott Spencer, a vice president with Google’s ads business.

A few months ago, Zachary Golper, the chef and an owner of Bien Cuit bakery in Brooklyn, New York, gave me his recipe for rice flour poundcake. The rice flour, he said, would make the cake light, silky and very tender, while the combination of coconut oil and butter would give it a gentle flavor that was less overtly rich than the usual all-butter versions.
Never one to hesitate when it comes to baking a cake, I made it as soon I could. Back then, when I could just pop into any store anytime I wanted, finding the ingredients was easy. Rice flour was available in Asian markets and in the gluten-free section of large supermarkets, and there was plenty of it.
The cake was every bit as good as Golper promised: with a tight-knit, melt-in-the-mouth crumb and a delicate flavor spiked with a little black pepper and some mezcal.
It was certainly one of the best poundcakes I’d ever made, and it was gluten-free. But I didn’t feel any rush to publish it. I filed it away as one of those evergreen recipes I could call on when I needed it. Maybe in summer, I thought, when people could pair it with berries.
Then, everything changed. Suddenly, all-purpose flour became as scarce as hand sanitizer, and rice flour became an excellent and unusual option.
When Golper developed the recipe, he used white rice flour that was milled in Japan, where, he said, they have a different grinding technology that produces a consistently fine particle size.
When I first made it, I used some of his Japanese flour, and it was divine. But since then, I’ve made it with non-Japanese rice flour, and it was nearly as good, maybe ever so slightly less satiny on the tongue. (Full disclosure: My husband and daughter didn’t notice a difference.)
But perhaps the best part about this cake recipe, in this particular moment, is that if you don’t have rice flour, Golper said, you could use white rice.
“Just throw some into a coffee grinder, and you’ve got rice flour,” he said. “I mean it’s definitely class C rice flour, but it will work,” he said. (Class C refers to a lower-quality flour.)
Which means, even if the supermarket baking aisle shelves continue to offer up slim pickings — cassava flour, anyone? — if you have rice, you can make cake. And a very good cake, indeed.

Recipe: Rice Flour Poundcake
Yield: 1 (8-inch) loaf
Total time: 1 1/2 hours
4 tablespoons/55 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for greasing
4 tablespoons/60 milliliters coconut oil
1 1/2 cups/200 grams white rice flour (not sweet rice flour)
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper (optional)
1 cup plus 1 tablespoon/225 grams sugar
2 large eggs, at room temperature
1/3 cup/80 milliliters sour cream
2/3 cup/160 milliliters unsweetened coconut milk
1 teaspoon mezcal or tequila, or 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly butter an 8-by-4-inch loaf pan. Melt coconut oil in small saucepan over low heat. Bring oil back to room temperature before baking. In a medium mixing bowl, combine rice flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and pepper, if using.
2. Using an electric mixer, whisk together coconut oil, butter and sugar at high speed until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. With the motor still running, add eggs and combine until creamed and very fluffy. Reduce to low speed and whisk in a third of the flour mixture. Once combined, add sour cream. Whisk in another third of the dry ingredients, then half of the coconut milk. Add the remaining flour mixture. At a medium speed, whisk in the rest of the coconut milk, and mezcal, until smooth and completely combined.
3. Scrape batter into pan and smooth the top with the spatula. Bake until the cake is golden and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 to 55 minutes. Let cake cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn on a wire rack to cool completely.

NEW YORK — Joseph Migliucci’s parents wanted more for their young son than the family restaurant business. So they gave him the hardest jobs, like cleaning the floors and washing dishes.
“Finally I put him behind the range and thought, ‘This will kill him. He’s going to hate it,’ ” his father, Mario Migliucci, said in an article by The New York Times food critic Craig Claiborne in 1976. “Not a bit. And now he’s good at everything. Terrific bartender, good host, the works.”
Joseph Migliucci stayed on at the restaurant, Mario’s, for nearly a half century more, maintaining its tradition as a red-sauce cornerstone of the Bronx’s Little Italy on Arthur Avenue in the Belmont section.
Migliucci, the fourth generation of his family to own the restaurant, died April 6 at a hospital in White Plains, New York. He was 81. His daughter, Regina Migliucci-Delfino, said the cause was the novel coronavirus.
The restaurant was opened in 1919 by Joseph’s great-grandmother, Scholastica Migliucci, an Italian immigrant, as a pizzeria with six tables. Joseph’s father, Mario Migliucci, and his uncle Clemente took over management in the 1930s, expanded the menu and renamed it Mario’s.
Joseph took a job in the restaurant at around age 13, according to his daughter. In recent decades he and Migliucci-Delfino ran it. Joseph Migliucci would come to work each day in a button-down shirt and suspenders often adorned with a big yellow pin that read, “I’m the boss.” He would add to customers, “But when I go home, I give the pin to my wife.”
Claiborne described the restaurant’s fare as “first‐rate, unpretentious but adventurous Neapolitan cookery.”
Mario Puzo name-checked the restaurant in his novel “The Godfather.” When producers of the movie version asked about filming a scene there, his father declined. “He didn’t want that stigma,” Migliucci said.
Joseph Migliucci was born in Manhattan in Nov. 18, 1938. His mother, Rose Migliucci, also worked at the restaurant.He attended Samuel Gompers Industrial High School in the Bronx and went on to study engineering at a local college before returning to the family business. “He loved engineering, but he had a love for people,” his daughter said. “And he loved the restaurant business.” Migliucci married Francis Lagamma in 1961. Along with Regina, they had another daughter, Michele. The couple divorced, and Migliucci married Barbara Farino. They had two children, Nicole and Mario.
Along with his wife and children, he is survived by his sister Diane Lentini, 16 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
Migliucci-Delfino said she will continue the family legacy and run the restaurant.

Furloughs and Pay Cuts Hit the Los Angeles Times [With graphic(s)]

The parent company of the Los Angeles Times is furloughing 40 employees and cutting the pay of senior managers in an effort to make up for losses brought on by a pandemic-related decline in advertising revenue.
“Due to the unexpected effects of COVID-19, our advertising revenue has nearly been eliminated,” said a memo to the staff on Tuesday from Chris Argentieri, the president of California Times, the publishing company that includes the Times and The San Diego Union-Tribune.
The Times newsroom cheered in 2018 when Patrick Soon-Shiong, a billionaire doctor and entrepreneur, bought the Times and other California publications from what is now Tribune Publishing for $500 million. While the Times has gotten more robust since then, its digital subscription business has been slow, and now the coronavirus has presented a new challenge.
In a separate letter to some staff members on Monday, Argentieri appeared to be more specific, saying, “The Times has lost more than one-third of its advertising revenue and expects to lose more than half of its advertising revenue in the coming months.”
The furloughed employees do not work in the Times newsroom. They could be out as long as 16 weeks, according to the Monday memo, and it is possible that they will be laid off at the end of the furlough period.
As part of the austerity plan, pay for senior editorial and business managers at the Times and The Union-Tribune will be reduced by as much as 15% for three months, and 401(k) matches will be suspended.
The cuts do not apply to union employees who belong to the NewsGuild. Argentieri said company leaders would meet with union representatives to address “cost-saving initiatives.”
In a statement, the Times union said it was “troubled to learn about” the furloughs.
A New York Times analysis found that more than 28,000 news media employees in the United States have been subject to pay cuts, furloughs or layoffs since the coronavirus started to spread across the country.
The Los Angeles Times is one of the largest papers in the nation, with a Sunday print circulation over 400,000. Argentieri said the furloughs and other measures were necessary for the California Times publications to weather the sudden drop in revenue.
“While we’ve made significant progress in growing our digital subscriber base and developing other sources of revenue,” he wrote in the Tuesday memo, “it is not yet enough to offset the losses.”
Like many news outlets, the Times has seen a spike in its web traffic in recent weeks, as readers have sought updates on the pandemic, according to Comscore.
Norman Pearlstine, the executive editor of the Times, published a note to readers on April 2, saying it was “more important than ever” that they subscribe.

OAKLAND, Calif. — Google’s and Facebook’s advertising businesses, which have roughly tripled in combined size over the past five years, may be headed for a rare stumble as the coronavirus pushes the global economy into a tailspin.
Once-abundant travel and entertainment ads have all but disappeared from Google search. The prices for Facebook advertisements are at record lows. And Wall Street analysts are estimating that annual revenues will decline for the first time in the history of the two companies.
It’s the type of downturn that traditional media has experienced before but was hard to imagine for the duopoly that accounts for more than half of the spending in online advertising.
And yet, as gloomy as the situation may appear for Google and Facebook, the outlook for the rest of the digital advertising industry is even bleaker. What little digital spending there is will still flow to them, leaving smaller social media platforms and publishers out in the cold.
“To the extent that people are still spending, it will be even more concentrated with Google and Facebook,” said Nicole Perrin, principal analyst at research firm eMarketer. “They are likely going to end up in a stronger position after all this is over.”
A shakeout is starting to take shape. Review site Yelp said Thursday that it was laying off 1,000 employees and furloughing another 1,100. In an email, Jeremy Stoppelman, Yelp’s chief executive, said it needed to cut costs in the face of stay-at-home measures that have hammered restaurants, bars and other local business — the company’s main advertisers.
After projecting revenue to increase between 5% and 11% in the first quarter, Twitter withdrew its quarterly estimate last month and forecast revenue to decline slightly. Pinterest pulled its projection of full-year revenue growth of more than 30% because it said it started to see a sharp decline from mid-March. It did not offer updated guidance.
David Rodnitzky, chief executive of ad agency 3Q Digital, said during lean times advertisers opted for ads that translated most directly into new business. Combining a wealth of information about users with the most visited destinations on the internet, Google and Facebook are safe.
That’s not to say the two companies aren’t heading into a rough patch. In an investor note last month, John Blackledge, an analyst for the investment firm Cowen, trimmed his 2020 revenue forecast for Google and Facebook by nearly 20%. He now predicts a decline in annual revenue for both.
The prices of Facebook ads have declined 35- to 50% on average in recent weeks, said Alex Palmer, an analyst for Gupta Media, a digital marketing agency. Last month, Facebook warned that it was already seeing signs of an early pullback.
“Our business is being adversely affected like so many others,” Alex Schultz and Jay Parikh, two Facebook vice presidents, wrote in a company blog post in March. “We’ve seen a weakening in our ads business in countries taking aggressive actions to reduce the spread of COVID-19.”
Mark Mahaney, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, ran 50 Google searches last month and found no paid ads for travel and restaurants.
“We can’t recall ever NOT seeing a ‘Paid Ad’ under the search term ‘Las Vegas Hotels’,” he wrote. “This is indicative of the broader trends across online advertising.”
Average daily spending on digital ads slumped more than 20% in the latter half of March for sports and entertainment businesses, according to the advertising analytics platform Pathmatics. Cirque du Soleil, for example, went from sometimes spending more than $140,000 a day on digital ads in late February, to spending less than $40,000 a day in late March and then nothing in early April.
Travel companies like Korean Air and Norwegian Cruise Line dropped their digital ad spending to near zero in mid-March, according to Pathmatics. Home-rental company Airbnb suspended all marketing, cutting back from a projected $800 million this year.
Advertisers that are still spending are tiptoeing around coronavirus news. Stories or posts about death, illness and economic turmoil are not exactly advertiser-friendly, and many mainstream marketers are avoiding any pandemic-related content.
“Many brands are being cautious,” said Nancy Smith, chief executive of Analytic Partners, an advertising consulting firm. “People don’t want to see, say, a Pantene ad next to their loved one who is in the hospital.”
Before the coronavirus upended its plans, real estate firm Coldwell Banker was preparing for an advertising blitz online and TV during the NCAA men’s basketball tournament. When the pandemic forced the cancellation of games, Coldwell Banker put a freeze on its plans and halted spending on ads for terms like “vacation homes.”
But after shutting down advertising, Coldwell, like other brands, is edging back to Google and Facebook. The company debuted a revamped version of its ad campaign Monday that will run entirely online on Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.
United Airlines pulled nearly all its advertising for four days before returning with a new message about its waived change fees, according to Pathmatics. Ahead of Easter, chocolatier Godiva said it had placed ads on Google, Instagram and Facebook to direct customers to its online ordering site. Panera Bread said it bought ads alerting customers to pickup and delivery options including a new grocery service.
Many advertisers are avoiding coronavirus content on news sites and Facebook feeds. Google said it had controls to ensure that advertisers were comfortable with the content that their brand appeared alongside. It allows advertisers to opt out of coronavirus content as well as sensitive categories like tragedy or infectious diseases. Facebook has a similar feature.
At the same time, Google and Facebook are struggling to strike the right balance in policing problematic ads.
Google said it had started a “sensitive events” policy last month, which restricts ads on coronavirus content. On March 9, it also placed a temporary ban on ads selling masks, citing a supply shortage for medical professionals.
But mask ads served by Google continue to appear on publisher websites across the internet. There are also ads served by Google for hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes from e-commerce sites offering a wide selection of masks and other items in short supply at significant markups.
Google said that it had taken down 50 million ads as of the end of March, and that up to 80% of the 10 million or so bad ads it flagged daily were coronavirus-related.
Facebook banned the placement of predatory ads for masks, sanitizer and other personal protective equipment, and it eliminated nearly all mask ads across the social network. But its efforts hampered volunteer groups that have banded together in Facebook groups to donate homemade masks to health care professionals.
“This is a continual battle that goes back and forth with sophisticated entities on the other side who are trying to circumvent Google’s detection system,” said Scott Spencer, a vice president with Google’s ads business.

You Don’t Need All-Purpose Flour for This Poundcake [With graphic(s)]

A few months ago, Zachary Golper, the chef and an owner of Bien Cuit bakery in Brooklyn, New York, gave me his recipe for rice flour poundcake. The rice flour, he said, would make the cake light, silky and very tender, while the combination of coconut oil and butter would give it a gentle flavor that was less overtly rich than the usual all-butter versions.
Never one to hesitate when it comes to baking a cake, I made it as soon I could. Back then, when I could just pop into any store anytime I wanted, finding the ingredients was easy. Rice flour was available in Asian markets and in the gluten-free section of large supermarkets, and there was plenty of it.
The cake was every bit as good as Golper promised: with a tight-knit, melt-in-the-mouth crumb and a delicate flavor spiked with a little black pepper and some mezcal.
It was certainly one of the best poundcakes I’d ever made, and it was gluten-free. But I didn’t feel any rush to publish it. I filed it away as one of those evergreen recipes I could call on when I needed it. Maybe in summer, I thought, when people could pair it with berries.
Then, everything changed. Suddenly, all-purpose flour became as scarce as hand sanitizer, and rice flour became an excellent and unusual option.
When Golper developed the recipe, he used white rice flour that was milled in Japan, where, he said, they have a different grinding technology that produces a consistently fine particle size.
When I first made it, I used some of his Japanese flour, and it was divine. But since then, I’ve made it with non-Japanese rice flour, and it was nearly as good, maybe ever so slightly less satiny on the tongue. (Full disclosure: My husband and daughter didn’t notice a difference.)
But perhaps the best part about this cake recipe, in this particular moment, is that if you don’t have rice flour, Golper said, you could use white rice.
“Just throw some into a coffee grinder, and you’ve got rice flour,” he said. “I mean it’s definitely class C rice flour, but it will work,” he said. (Class C refers to a lower-quality flour.)
Which means, even if the supermarket baking aisle shelves continue to offer up slim pickings — cassava flour, anyone? — if you have rice, you can make cake. And a very good cake, indeed.
—
Recipe: Rice Flour Poundcake
Yield: 1 (8-inch) loaf
Total time: 1 1/2 hours
4 tablespoons/55 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for greasing
4 tablespoons/60 milliliters coconut oil
1 1/2 cups/200 grams white rice flour (not sweet rice flour)
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper (optional)
1 cup plus 1 tablespoon/225 grams sugar
2 large eggs, at room temperature
1/3 cup/80 milliliters sour cream
2/3 cup/160 milliliters unsweetened coconut milk
1 teaspoon mezcal or tequila, or 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly butter an 8-by-4-inch loaf pan. Melt coconut oil in small saucepan over low heat. Bring oil back to room temperature before baking. In a medium mixing bowl, combine rice flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and pepper, if using.
2. Using an electric mixer, whisk together coconut oil, butter and sugar at high speed until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. With the motor still running, add eggs and combine until creamed and very fluffy. Reduce to low speed and whisk in a third of the flour mixture. Once combined, add sour cream. Whisk in another third of the dry ingredients, then half of the coconut milk. Add the remaining flour mixture. At a medium speed, whisk in the rest of the coconut milk, and mezcal, until smooth and completely combined.
3. Scrape batter into pan and smooth the top with the spatula. Bake until the cake is golden and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 to 55 minutes. Let cake cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn on a wire rack to cool completely.

The parent company of the Los Angeles Times is furloughing 40 employees and cutting the pay of senior managers in an effort to make up for losses brought on by a pandemic-related decline in advertising revenue.
“Due to the unexpected effects of COVID-19, our advertising revenue has nearly been eliminated,” said a memo to the staff on Tuesday from Chris Argentieri, the president of California Times, the publishing company that includes the Times and The San Diego Union-Tribune.
The Times newsroom cheered in 2018 when Patrick Soon-Shiong, a billionaire doctor and entrepreneur, bought the Times and other California publications from what is now Tribune Publishing for $500 million. While the Times has gotten more robust since then, its digital subscription business has been slow, and now the coronavirus has presented a new challenge.
In a separate letter to some staff members on Monday, Argentieri appeared to be more specific, saying, “The Times has lost more than one-third of its advertising revenue and expects to lose more than half of its advertising revenue in the coming months.”
The furloughed employees do not work in the Times newsroom. They could be out as long as 16 weeks, according to the Monday memo, and it is possible that they will be laid off at the end of the furlough period.
As part of the austerity plan, pay for senior editorial and business managers at the Times and The Union-Tribune will be reduced by as much as 15% for three months, and 401(k) matches will be suspended.
The cuts do not apply to union employees who belong to the NewsGuild. Argentieri said company leaders would meet with union representatives to address “cost-saving initiatives.”
In a statement, the Times union said it was “troubled to learn about” the furloughs.
A New York Times analysis found that more than 28,000 news media employees in the United States have been subject to pay cuts, furloughs or layoffs since the coronavirus started to spread across the country.
The Los Angeles Times is one of the largest papers in the nation, with a Sunday print circulation over 400,000. Argentieri said the furloughs and other measures were necessary for the California Times publications to weather the sudden drop in revenue.
“While we’ve made significant progress in growing our digital subscriber base and developing other sources of revenue,” he wrote in the Tuesday memo, “it is not yet enough to offset the losses.”
Like many news outlets, the Times has seen a spike in its web traffic in recent weeks, as readers have sought updates on the pandemic, according to Comscore.
Norman Pearlstine, the executive editor of the Times, published a note to readers on April 2, saying it was “more important than ever” that they subscribe.

NEW YORK — Joseph Migliucci’s parents wanted more for their young son than the family restaurant business. So they gave him the hardest jobs, like cleaning the floors and washing dishes.
“Finally I put him behind the range and thought, ‘This will kill him. He’s going to hate it,’ ” his father, Mario Migliucci, said in an article by The New York Times food critic Craig Claiborne in 1976. “Not a bit. And now he’s good at everything. Terrific bartender, good host, the works.”
Joseph Migliucci stayed on at the restaurant, Mario’s, for nearly a half century more, maintaining its tradition as a red-sauce cornerstone of the Bronx’s Little Italy on Arthur Avenue in the Belmont section.
Migliucci, the fourth generation of his family to own the restaurant, died April 6 at a hospital in White Plains, New York. He was 81. His daughter, Regina Migliucci-Delfino, said the cause was the novel coronavirus.
The restaurant was opened in 1919 by Joseph’s great-grandmother, Scholastica Migliucci, an Italian immigrant, as a pizzeria with six tables. Joseph’s father, Mario Migliucci, and his uncle Clemente took over management in the 1930s, expanded the menu and renamed it Mario’s.
Joseph took a job in the restaurant at around age 13, according to his daughter. In recent decades he and Migliucci-Delfino ran it. Joseph Migliucci would come to work each day in a button-down shirt and suspenders often adorned with a big yellow pin that read, “I’m the boss.” He would add to customers, “But when I go home, I give the pin to my wife.”
Claiborne described the restaurant’s fare as “first‐rate, unpretentious but adventurous Neapolitan cookery.”
Mario Puzo name-checked the restaurant in his novel “The Godfather.” When producers of the movie version asked about filming a scene there, his father declined. “He didn’t want that stigma,” Migliucci said.
Joseph Migliucci was born in Manhattan in Nov. 18, 1938. His mother, Rose Migliucci, also worked at the restaurant.He attended Samuel Gompers Industrial High School in the Bronx and went on to study engineering at a local college before returning to the family business. “He loved engineering, but he had a love for people,” his daughter said. “And he loved the restaurant business.” Migliucci married Francis Lagamma in 1961. Along with Regina, they had another daughter, Michele. The couple divorced, and Migliucci married Barbara Farino. They had two children, Nicole and Mario.
Along with his wife and children, he is survived by his sister Diane Lentini, 16 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
Migliucci-Delfino said she will continue the family legacy and run the restaurant.

COVID-19 is a huge story for newspapers across Minnesota. For some, it could also be their undoing.

The economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic is crippling the newspaper business. Star Tribune subscribers can see the alarming evidence every Sunday, when their paper hits the doorstep with a lot less of a thud than it did a month earlier.
Retail advertising, a critical source of newspaper revenue, collapsed as the virus spread across the U.S., devastating newspaper and media companies coast to coast. Preprints — those popular supermarket and department store circulars — vanished overnight. That led to swift, dramatic cost-cutting.
In early March, the Poynter Institute website began compiling a list of layoffs, buyouts, furloughs and pay cuts, a tally that now runs multiple pages. The New York Times estimated 28,000 news media company employees have been laid off, furloughed or taken pay cuts because of the coronavirus. (There are some outlets choosing a different approach. The Hearst Corp., which owns the San Francisco Chronicle and 23 other dailies, is maintaining current staffing and salaries and even offering small bonuses.)
Here in Minnesota, Star Tribune employees and management are taking pay cuts, the already slashed-to-the-bone Pioneer Press is offering buyouts, and weekly papers in Hastings and Woodbury/Cottage Grove will cease publication in May. Adams Publishing Group, which owns more than 60 daily and weekly papers in Minnesota, reduced workforce hours by 25 percent and laid off many of its part-timers. Forum News Service, with papers in Minnesota, the Dakotas and Wisconsin, announced the end of its Monday and Friday print editions in some locations, along with layoffs.
FTI Consulting, a Washington, D.C.,-based business advisory firm, forecasts a 37 percent to 41 percent decline in newspaper advertising revenue this year compared to 2019, a direct result of COVID-19. Even more ominous: Based on what happened after the 2008-09 recession, FTI predicts between 20 percent and 30 percent of lost advertising is never coming back.
“It’s an amazing number,” said media analyst Ken Doctor of the Nieman Journalism Lab and a former Pioneer Press managing editor. “That is a death knell for some, and it is forcing all the major changes we’re seeing.”
Worst case, it’s the end of local print journalism, at least in markets without a robust daily. But even the best case is still pretty bad: fewer journalists, fewer publications, and fewer entities holding elected officials and nefarious folks accountable. At a time of public health fear, conflicting “truths” and rampant disinformation, that’s exceptionally not good. “It’s going to separate the haves and the have-nots, I think, pretty effectively,” said Star Tribune Publisher Michael J. Klingensmith.
To understand how we got here, it helps to know how newspapers make their money.
Back in pre-internet days, when there were many more department stores, airlines and car dealerships splurging on full-page ads, newspapers relied on advertising for 80 percent or more of their revenue. That’s why newspapers were such a bargain for so long, only charging a nickel or a dime or a quarter for single copies and a relative pittance for home delivery subscriptions.
In the internet age, business mergers and the loss of classified advertising stripped newspapers of valuable revenue. That’s why you pay more at the newsstand and for subscriptions, though ad revenue continues to decline at a rate subscription revenue can’t make up for.
Doctor believes uncertainty over when, or if, distressed newspapers might qualify for federal small business loan programs forced the hand of many companies. “With Forum and others in the Midwest, their answer is, ‘We can’t afford to wait,’” Doctor said.
Klingensmith said the Star Tribune draws about 45 percent of revenue from ads, 50 percent from circulation (print and digital subscriptions plus single-copy sales) and five percent from its printing business. (The Strib prints the Pioneer Press and regional editions of the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times.)
“The newspaper’s advertising base is almost 100 percent retailers,” Klingensmith said. “The fact that almost all retailers are shut down is a devastating blow to advertising.
“I know we’re going to lose 40 percent of our ad revenue for April, May and June. There’s just no avoiding it. But I don’t know what to expect about the third quarter. There are still a wide range of outcomes possible. The best case is something like only 20 percent of our ad revenue being gone. I think it will be a little better now that we’re in this total nonessential business shutdown.”
So Strib management and Newspaper Guild representatives met to negotiate cost reductions. The rank and file agreed to delay scheduled raises and take eight unpaid furlough days, four in each quarter, between now and Sept. 30. That represents a 6.15 percent reduction in annual salary. (The last four furlough days will be canceled if the Strib gets within 10 percent of its third quarter budget, something Klingensmith considers unlikely.) Meanwhile, Klingensmith, editor Rene Sanchez and the Strib leadership team will take 12.5 percent salary cuts. Guild members overwhelmingly approved the deal. (Disclosure: My wife, Rachel Blount, writes for the Star Tribune and belongs to the Guild.)
“They wanted to make sure this was company-wide and not just targeted for Guild members, who had taken the brunt of the cuts over the years,” said Guild co-chair Kelly Smith. “We talked to them about how this is a shared sacrifice among the entire company to preserve jobs and hopefully ensure that this company is able to survive the next six months. Personally I’d much rather take a pay cut than lose jobs.”
Over in St. Paul, Guild unit officer Dave Orrick said Alden Global Capital LLC, its vulture hedge fund owner, asked for a yet-to-be-determined number of buyouts to save money. Already, the PiPress runs with a skeleton crew; the newsroom is down to 44 people from a pre-Alden of 276 in 2010. “The Guild is discussing the matter with management,” Orrick wrote in an email.
No one knows how long the current stay-at-home orders will last, or how fast the economy will recover. Either way, Doctor believes more papers will cut back on print days, while other small dailies and many alt-weekly papers will not survive. (Klingensmith expects the Strib-owned City Pages to make it through, though its entertainment-driven advertising revenue took a big hit.) And, Doctor said, many more small communities will become “news deserts,” without a local newspaper or website.
That continues a grim trend from the Great Recession which saw newspaper newsroom employment decline 47 percent between 2008 and 2018. In 2019 alone, newsrooms lost more than 3,000 jobs. And according to University of North Carolina professor Penny Muse Abernathy, since 2004 about 2,100 newspapers have gone out of business, 70 of them dailies.
“This was true in January before hell broke loose globally: There are no solutions being proposed, or anywhere close to becoming reality, that deal with the tremendous loss of growth in newspapers,” Doctor said. “Now the problem has been advanced four years.”
Klingensmith noted one silver lining in the COVID-19 crisis: an uptick in digital subscriptions. Klingensmith said the Strib has been selling 200 digital subscriptions a day, four times the usual rate, though the heavily discounted introductory rate means it hasn’t significantly affected the bottom line. Klingensmith said the paper began the year with 92,000 digital subscribers and hoped to hit 100,000 by Dec. 31; now they’ve upgraded the target to 110,000. Web traffic doubled through early April, and last week remained up by 50 percent.
“On the haves side of things, I’m sure the New York Times is selling vastly more digital subscriptions — as if they didn’t have enough already — and the Washington Post the same thing,” Klingensmith said. “They got the Trump Bump. Now they’re getting the COVID bump. Those papers are going to come through in great shape.
“The stronger independent newspapers, like Seattle, ours, the Boston Globe — another one with massive subscription numbers at very high rates — they’re going to come out fine. When you get to the medium newspapers that are struggling …I ’m sure you’ll see an acceleration of print days being canceled and newsrooms reduced, and so on and so forth.”
The Star Tribune has also consolidated some sections, and Klingensmith said “the full robust paper” will be back once arts, entertainment, sports and travel return to normal. But don’t expect the Strib to cut print days. “Newspapers are a habitual and continually served product,” Klingensmith said. “To interrupt that … I’m still looking for the data point where that has been put in place and been successful. I’ve seen plenty of data points where it’s been put in place and been unsuccessful.”

New York Times defends taking Biden campaign edits for report on sexual misconduct allegation against him

Texto completo: The New York Times made questionable edits this weekend to an investigative report on a sexual misconduct allegation against Joe Biden after the former vice president’s 2020 campaign complained.

The newspaper is standing by those edits, telling the Washington Examiner Tuesday that it is not unprecedented for it to amend its news coverage depending on the type of pushback it receives from the targets of its reporting.

"After our initial publication, we edited one clause that was imprecise and deleted a tweet that used the same imprecise wording,” a spokeswoman for the paper told the Washington Examiner. “In order to be fair and accurate, our editors are always open to critical feedback from readers, sources, subjects, or others on any story. Editors and the standards desk decide if any edits or corrections are warranted. In this case, the decision to edit the story was made solely by our Politics editor.”

She added, “For context, when the Biden campaign publicly criticized multiple lines of coverage last October, editors reviewed their concerns and decided no changes were warranted."

The New York Times’s since-amended March 12 story represents its first attempt to report on a woman’s claim that she was sexually abused by Biden when she worked for him as a Senate aide in the early 1990s. The former aide, Tara Reade, reiterated her allegations most recently on March 25 during a podcast interview.

The New York Times’s investigative report ended originally with a line that read: "The Times found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Biden, beyond the hugs, kisses and touching that women previously said made them uncomfortable." However, the second part of that line was removed soon after publication. The paper said immediately in a public statement that the clause was deleted from the report because it contained “imprecise” language.

New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet also revealed later that the line was stricken from the story following complaints from the Biden campaign.

“Even though a lot of us, including me, had looked at it before the story went into the paper,” he told the New York Times’s Ben Smith.

Baquet added: “I think that the [Biden] campaign thought that the phrasing was awkward and made it look like there were other instances in which he had been accused of sexual misconduct. And that’s not what the sentence was intended to say.”

The paper’s report covers not just Reade’s very specific allegation of sexual assault but also a lesser charge from a former Nevada state assemblywoman, Lucy Flores, who claims the former vice president made her uncomfortable when he kissed and pawed at her during a 2014 campaign event. The New York Times report also includes commentary from additional women who say the former vice president similarly made them feel uncomfortable with unwanted contact.

Though these examples do not establish a pattern of outright sexual assault, they do establish a pattern of inappropriate contact, the same type of sexual misconduct that ended Al Franken's career as a senator.

As for what the New York Times's editors mean when they say the since-removed clause in the Biden report was “imprecise," a spokeswoman for the paper explains:

“Our story documents unwanted behavior cited by other women that we covered last year; we have not described that behavior as ‘sexual misconduct’ in part because some women said such behavior with them was not misconduct,” she told the Washington Examiner. “Our intention was to focus on what our new reporting found, rather than conflate the new reporting and the complaints made about Biden's behavior last year.”

For the record, the New York Times has used the term “sexual misconduct” several times in the past to refer to the allegations against Franken, which include unwanted hugs, kisses, and touching.

Texto completo: Three law firms filed a multimillion-dollar class-action lawsuit against Liberty University over its response to the coronavirus pandemic.
The firms argued the university in Lynchburg, Virginia, should be forced to repay student fees to each student because the university closed dining halls, canceled activities, and moved classes online. The university's president, Jerry Falwell Jr., has argued that fees should not be refunded because the university is open to students who chose not to leave the dorms.
Student fees range from $9,000 to $16,000, but Liberty University only offered a credit of $1,000 to students who are returning in the fall.
Adam Levitt, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said, "Liberty’s attempt to profit from the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic is reprehensible and incredibly hypocritical in light of the values upon which the university says that it’s based."
He added, "This pandemic has already placed tremendous financial strain on many of Liberty’s students and their families, and the fact that Mr. Falwell would disingenuously keep the campus open as a pretext for holding onto student fees while putting their finances and health at risk is a stark illustration of where his true priorities lie."
The class-action lawsuit argued that students should be repaid because the university is mostly closed. The attorneys also argued Fallwell put the health of students at risk by not acting fast enough.
The attorneys argued the university and Falwell "placed their students at severe physical risk." They specifically singled out remarks from Falwell claiming that students were "overreacting" to the virus and comparing COVID-19 to the seasonal flu. They also highlighted Falwell's claim that the virus and resulting shutdown were products of the media attempting to ruin President Trump's reelection bid.
"Profiteering off a pandemic is wrong. Putting people in harm’s way is wrong," attorney Matt Miller said.
The lawsuit was filed with the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia by MichieHamlett Attorneys at Law, Matthew S. Miller LLC, and DiCello Levitt Gutzler.
Falwell has maintained that students did not get sick while at the university after the New York Times reported that dozens had fallen ill. He trashed the report, writing, "So despite the Times’ sensational headline and story lead, Liberty is only aware of three off campus student[s] who were sufficiently symptomatic to qualify for COVID-19 testing, two of which did not leave Lynchburg for Spring Break and one of which tested negative during Spring Break."
Falwell threatened to sue the New York Times for its coverage of the campus.
In a statement to the Washington Examiner about the lawsuit, a Liberty University representative said: "Liberty University has tirelessly attempted to balance the needs of students, employees, and the community as it has navigated through the unprecedented health challenges presented by COVID-19. We have also taken into account the economic impact and legal rights of all the parties involved. While it’s not surprising that plaintiff class action attorneys would seek to profit from a public health crisis, we don’t believe this law firm or its single client speaks for the vast majority of our students."
The representative continued: "Similar class-action suits are pending against other schools, and such claims will no doubt be made against other higher education institutions that changed how they operate and deliver services to students in the face of COVID-19. Liberty’s attorneys will defend against this lawsuit, which is without legal merit. Each of Liberty’s changes in operations and modes of delivery has been required by governmental officials, a fact the complaint omits. That fact legally excuses Liberty’s adjustments and leaves the plaintiffs without a legal case."
Liberty University plans to uphold its promise to credit students with $1,000 for next semester. The representative stressed the school had continued to use aggressive sanitation practices and no student at Liberty had tested positive for the coronavirus. The university will file an official response to the allegations in court, but the representative noted that it will not be shared with the media in advance.

Texto completo: A few weeks ago, Hannah Sparks of The New York Post reported on “a morbid — and chillingly astute — new slang term for the coronavirus pandemic: boomer remover,” because the virus has proved particularly deadly for the elderly.
But, because it is also disproportionately deadly for men and for African Americans, I worry about how it will affect black men in particular, and have come to use another chilling term to characterize it: a “brother killer.”
And I fear that the worst may be yet to come, at least until treatments are developed and a vaccine discovered. There are silent populations of black men, largely removed from public view and public consciousness, who will remain vulnerable long after we “open the country back up,” whatever that looks like, and return to some semblance of normalcy.
For these men, the devastating effects of this virus may be as much about preexisting social conditions as preexisting medical ones.
[Read complete coronavirus coverage here .]
These are the people living on the edge of society, existing in the shadows, our own iteration of untouchables, exempt from America’s sympathies — the homeless, the incarcerated, those living with HIV/AIDS.
According to the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty, “people living on the streets, in shelters or in their cars are more vulnerable to an outbreak of highly communicable diseases like COVID-19.” The group attributes that vulnerability in part to “close quarters, compromised immune systems and an aging population” as well as the fact that “without adequate, permanent and stable housing, people lack a restroom for frequent hand washing, laundry facilities, and personal hygiene.”
According to the National Alliance to End Homelessness, a total of 552,830 people were experiencing homelessness on a single night in 2018. And while black people were only 13% of the population, they made up 40% of the homeless population.
Furthermore, men are 70% of the homeless among individual adults.
Who will even test this population for the virus? People with homes and jobs are finding it hard to get tests, and some are being outright refused.
As the Pew Research Center pointed out last year, at the end of 2017 there were nearly a half a million people in federal and state prisons, and a plurality of those prisoners were black.
Nine out of 10 inmates are male.
There were nearly three-quarters of a million Americans held in local jails in 2018, and about a third of them were black, according to the Bureau of Prison Statistics. In fact, the rate at which black people were jailed was nearly three times the rate at which white people and Hispanics were jailed.
The Cook County Jail in Chicago has emerged as a hot spot for the coronavirus and COVID-19, with more than 300 inmates and more than 200 employees testing positive for the virus. Seventy-three percent of the people in that jail are black and 93% are men.
And, to add insult to injury, national data show that 70% of the people in local jails are not yet convicted of any crime. Many simply can’t afford to post bail, so they wait in jail on a trial for the charge or until they enter a plea to it.
People living with compromised immune systems are also at risk. HIV/AIDS can lead to such a compromised system, particularly among those not in treatments and whose virus hasn’t been suppressed. Black men have the highest rate of new diagnoses of HIV.
The HIV prevalence rate for black people is eight times the rate for white people and nearly three times the rate for Hispanics.
There are over 1 million Americans living with HIV. Nearly half a million of those are black. Only 61% of those black people received treatment for the virus in 2016 and only about half were able to suppress the virus.
And HIV is now heavily linked to poverty. In 2013, there were 282,100 Medicaid beneficiaries with HIV, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, and they were “more likely to be male (56% vs. 42%), or black (50% vs. 22%)” than the Medicaid population overall.
Add to this the fact that poverty rates are highest among black people and blacks have the highest prevalence of disabilities, and you have a very real problem brewing.
History has shown that we are callously comfortable averting our gaze away from men like these. We construct racialized rationales that allow us not to care, to say that they courted their fate, that pathology is at play, that one reaps what one sows.
But, that can’t stand. These are human beings, with stories and souls, who love and are loved, who deserve, like all others, a fair chance to survive and prosper.
Were it not for your accident of birth, these brothers could be your brothers.

Michelle Goldberg: What to do with Tara Reade’s allegation against Joe Biden?

Texto completo: It would be easier to know what to do with Tara Reade’s accusation that Joe Biden sexually assaulted her if her tale were more solid, or if it were less.
In the past few days, The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Associated Press all reported on a story that’s been circulating through the left- and right-wing media for the last few weeks. Reade, a staff assistant in Biden’s Senate office in the early 1990s, is one of the women who last year spoke out about Biden’s handsiness. When the AP interviewed Reade last April, she said that Biden “rubbed her shoulders and neck” and “played with her hair.”
She also told The Union, a California newspaper, last year that she didn’t feel sexualized. “She instead compared her experience to being a lamp,” the paper reported. She told the reporter, Alan Riquelmy: “‘It’s pretty. Set it over there.’ Then when it’s too bright, you throw it away.”
But last month, in an interview with left-wing podcast host Katie Halper, Reade added new, more serious details to her story, claiming that Biden pushed her against a wall and penetrated her with his fingers. (The Biden campaign has said, “This absolutely did not happen.”)
Since Reade made her latest accusation, people on both the left and the right have been demanding, with a mix of genuine outrage and gotcha glee, that the Democratic Party live up to its #MeToo commitments and #BelieveTaraReade. “For Elite Democrats, Joe Biden’s Candidacy Means Ditching #MeToo,” said a headline in socialist magazine Jacobin. “Joe Biden, Brett Kavanaugh and the #MeToo hypocrites,” said one in The New York Post.
So must Democrats, for the sake of consistency, regard their presumptive presidential nominee as a sexual predator?
As I’ve written repeatedly, I think Biden is a weak candidate, and I wouldn’t be unhappy if the Democratic Party were forced, by some last-minute emergency, to replace him, maybe with one of the Democratic governors who has shined in response to the coronavirus crisis.
But, absent other accusations, that is not going to happen. Reade seems almost engineered in a lab to inspire skepticism in mainstream Democrats, both because her story keeps changing and because of her bizarre public worship of President Vladimir Putin of Russia. “President Putin has an alluring combination of strength with gentleness,” she wrote in a since-deleted 2018 Medium post. “His sensuous image projects his love for life, the embodiment of grace while facing adversity.” (Reade has since said her comments about Russia stemmed from a novel she was writing, though the Medium article is written as an op-ed essay.) In December she tweeted, with worrying grandiosity, “I worked for the Senate, I know the plan to bring Russia to its knees.”
Reade’s account of giving up a career in politics, like her stories about Biden, has shifted over time. In 2018 she wrote that she left politics both because she wanted to pursue a life in the arts and because “I love Russia with all my heart” and could no longer abide American imperialism. Less than a year later she claimed she was forced out of Biden’s office after complaining about sexual harassment and was so scarred by the experience that she abandoned political work altogether.
Let’s be clear: Reade could well be telling the truth now. It’s not implausible that she was afraid to admit what happened to her before, and so came up with an alternative narrative about her history. Plenty of people with wacky political views are victims of sexual assault. Indeed, I’d imagine that being sexually assaulted by a widely beloved mainstream politician would shatter one’s faith in the system and increase the appeal of fringe political ideas.
A friend of Reade’s, who has remained anonymous, has told reporters that Reade confided in her about the assault at the time. That’s a meaningful piece of evidence. A confirmation by Reade’s brother is more complicated. According to The Washington Post, in a recent interview he told a reporter that Reade told him at the time “that Biden had behaved inappropriately by touching her neck and shoulders.” A few days later, he texted the reporter to say he now recalled Reade telling him that Biden had put his hands “under her clothes.”
No one, looking at what’s been reported about Reade and Biden, can claim to have more than a hunch about what happened, which is why, I suspect, a lot of mainstream feminists haven’t said much about it. Writers on the left and the right purport to find their silence damning: So liberal feminists don’t “believe women” after all!
There have been a number of sneering columns accusing liberal feminists of hypocrisy for not championing Reade as fervently as they did Christine Blasey Ford, who claimed, during Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination fight, that he’d sexually assaulted her when they were both in high school. It’s a sly rhetorical move that dares feminists to violate their own ideals by publicly weighing one woman’s credibility against another.
The truth is, if Ford had been so inconsistent in telling her story, feminists might still have believed her, but they likely wouldn’t have made her a cause célèbre, and Democrats on Capitol Hill never would have invited her to testify publicly. Advocates for victims of sexual harassment and assault would worry that using such an ambiguous case as a political weapon would undermine their cause.
Personally, I’m just left with doubt: doubt about Biden and doubt about the charges against him. But the one thing I have little doubt about is the bad faith of those using this strange, sad story to hector feminists into pretending to a certainty they have no reason to feel.

Viet Thanh Nguyen: The ideas that won’t survive the coronavirus

Texto completo: Sometimes people ask me what it takes to be a writer. The only things you have to do, I tell them, are read constantly; write for thousands of hours; and have the masochistic ability to absorb a great deal of rejection and isolation. As it turns out, these qualities have prepared me well to deal with life in the time of the coronavirus.
The fact that I am almost enjoying this period of isolation — except for bouts of paranoia about imminent death and rage at the incompetence of our nation’s leadership — makes me sharply aware of my privilege. It is only through my social media feeds that I can see the devastation wreaked on people who have lost their jobs and are worried about paying the rent. Horror stories are surfacing from doctors and nurses, people afflicted with COVID-19, and those who have lost loved ones to the disease.
Many of us are getting a glimpse of dystopia. Others are living it.
If anything good emerges out of this period, it might be an awakening to the pre-existing conditions of our body politic. We were not as healthy as we thought we were. The biological virus afflicting individuals is also a social virus. Its symptoms — inequality, callousness, selfishness and a profit motive that undervalues human life and overvalues commodities — were for too long masked by the hearty good cheer of American exceptionalism, the ruddiness of someone a few steps away from a heart attack.
Even if America as we know it survives the coronavirus, it can hardly emerge unscathed. If the illusion of invincibility is shredded for any patient who survives a near-fatal experience, then what might die after COVID-19 is the myth that we are the best country on earth, a belief common even among the poor, the marginal, the precariat, who must believe in their own Americanness if in nothing else.
Perhaps the sensation of imprisonment during quarantine might make us imagine what real imprisonment feels like. There are, of course, actual prisons where we have warehoused human beings who have no relief from the threat of the coronavirus. There are refugee camps and detention centers that are de facto prisons. There is the economic imprisonment of poverty and precariousness, where a missing paycheck can mean homelessness, where illness without health insurance can mean death.
But at the same time, prisons and camps have often served as places where new consciousnesses are born, where prisoners become radicalized, become activists and even revolutionaries. Is it too much to hope that the forced isolation of many Americans, and the forced labor of others, might compel radical acts of self-reflection, self-assessment and, eventually, solidarity?
A crisis often induces fear and hatred. Already we are seeing a racist blowback against Asians and Asian-Americans for the “Chinese virus.” But we have a choice: Will we accept a world of division and scarcity, where we must fight over insufficient resources and opportunities, or imagine a future when our society is measured by how well it takes care of the ill, the poor, the aged and the different?
As a writer, I know that such a choice exists in the middle of a story. It is the turning point. A hero — in this case, the American body politic, not to mention the president — is faced with a crucial decision that will reveal who he or she fundamentally is.
We are not yet at the halfway point of our drama. We have barely made it to the end of the first act, when we slowly awaken to the threat coming our way and realize we must take some kind of action. That action, for now, is simply doing what we must to fight off COVID-19 and survive as a country, weakened but alive.
The halfway point comes only when the hero meets a worthy opponent — not one who is weak or marginal or different, but someone or something that is truly monstrous. COVID-19, however terrible, is only a movie villain. Our real enemy does not come from the outside, but from within. Our real enemy is not the virus but our response to the virus — a response that has been degraded and deformed by the structural inequalities of our society.
America has a history of settler colonization and capitalism that ruthlessly exploited natural resources and people, typically the poor, the migratory, the black and the brown. That history manifests today in our impulse to hoard, knowing that we live in an economy of self-reliance and scarcity; in our dependence on the cheap labor of women and racial minorities; and in our lack of sufficient systems of health care, welfare, universal basic income and education to take care of the neediest among us.
What this crisis has revealed is that, while almost all of us can become vulnerable — even corporations and the wealthy — our government prioritizes the protection of the least vulnerable.
If this was a classic Hollywood narrative, the exceptionally American superhero, reluctant and wavering in the first act, would make the right choice at this turning point. The evil COVID-19 would be conquered, and order would be restored to a society that would look just as it did before the villain emerged.
But if our society looks the same after the defeat of COVID-19, it will be a Pyrrhic victory. We can expect a sequel, and not just one sequel, but many, until we reach the finale: climate catastrophe. If our fumbling of the coronavirus is a preview of how the United States will handle that disaster, then we are doomed.
But amid the bumbling, there are signs of hope and courage: laborers striking over their exploitation; people donating masks, money and time; medical workers and patients expressing outrage over our gutted health care system; a Navy captain sacrificing his career to protect his sailors; even strangers saying hello to other strangers on the street, which in my city, Los Angeles, constitutes a nearly radical act of solidarity.
I know I am not the only one thinking these thoughts. Perhaps this isolation will finally give people the chance to do what writers do: imagine, empathize, dream. To have the time and luxury to do these things is already to live on the edge of utopia, even if what writers often do from there is to imagine the dystopic. I write not only because it brings me pleasure, but also out of fear — fear that if I do not tell a new story, I cannot truly live.
Americans will eventually emerge from isolation and take stock of the fallen, both the people and the ideas that did not make it through the crisis. And then we will have to decide which story will let the survivors truly live.

Texto completo: Last week, within the space of just 24 hours, two friends of mine — one an ICU nurse, the other an ER doctor — told me that they’d each watched a 50-year-old woman die of COVID-19.
I, too, am a 50-year-old woman. As I listened to their stories, I had to stifle the same unlovely impulse. “But did your patients have a preexisting condition?” I wanted to ask. “Were they fighting cancer, were they smokers, were they already floridly unwell?”
Which is ridiculous, honestly. Even if their patients had a history of heart disease or were partial to Camels, they no more deserved to die a frightening and solitary death than anyone else.
But my reaction, I think, was fairly typical of this exceptional moment, when reminders of our own mortality are never more than a few paces from our conscious, clattering minds: We are silently building moats that separate ourselves from the dead.
[Read complete coronavirus coverage here .]
It’s the other culturewide distancing campaign.
The first, we know about: to socially distance, which is deliberate and altruistic. But this one, to psychologically distance from the suffering and the deceased, is more furtive and fraught. It is certainly understandable, and probably even adaptive. But we’d do well to guard against it.
For Exhibit A, look no further than the Twitter account of David Lat, the 44-year-old lawyer, legal recruiter and founding editor of Above The Law, an immensely popular blog. Lat was diagnosed with COVID-19 in mid-March, and he’s tweeted about it ever since, save for the chilling stretch during which he was on a ventilator. When he returned, he posted a thread exploring the reasons some people die from COVID-19 while others suffer not at all.
He was suddenly pelted with queries about his own health. People were subtly probing to see whether there was a hidden reason he’d fallen ill.
I emailed Lat to ask him about this. (We would have spoken, but his voice is still ragged from intubation.) “Maybe I’m reading too much into things,” he replied, “but I received a number of responses that seemed to latch on excitedly to the mention of my exercise-induced asthma.”
That he ran two New York City Marathons with this asthma in his 30s — and did high-intensity interval training three times a week until he fell ill — didn’t move a number of his followers. (The bluntest response: “Asthma is still asthma, waiting to knock you out, and any severe respiratory illness reveals the fundamental weakness of your lungs.”) Nor did the fact that Lat was healthy in every respect: normal blood pressure, normal weight, didn’t smoke, barely drank.
“I have definitely had people trying to psychologically distance themselves from me and my case,” he said, “but I haven’t been surprised by these reactions — partly because, truth be told, I used to engage in them too.”
In a way, this bias is a modified, pandemic-ready version of the just-world fallacy, the bias that makes us believe that good things ultimately happen to good people and bad things ultimately happen to bad ones. We’d all like to believe there’s a reason for a person’s ill luck. That bad luck might be insolently random, working its way through the world with pitiless indifference to who or what we are, is simply too upsetting.
It is, of course, a natural instinct to fear our own mortality. In “The Denial of Death,” published in 1973, the cultural anthropologist Ernest Becker went so far as to argue that our dread of dying is what motivates all of human behavior, that it’s responsible for the whole of culture, of civilization; how else to create meaning for ourselves?
But it’s irresponsible when this denial affects our political rhetoric, especially during a historic pandemic. “The risk to the average American is low” went the Trump administration mantra for weeks on end — meaning that older Americans weren’t average, and neither were smokers, or people with heart disease or diabetes or compromised immune systems.
Now we see that African-Americans and Latinos are disproportionately dying, because they’re more apt to work high-exposure jobs and less apt to have access to high-quality health care. Are they not average either?
And what of all the Americans who are dying of COVID-19 for reasons doctors can’t discern at all?
How you speak about a disease matters, as Susan Sontag pointed out so long ago in “Illness as Metaphor.” It informs the very way that you treat it. When the president described COVID-19 as “the Chinese virus,” he wasn’t just deflecting blame for his slow response; he was explaining it. He thought of the novel coronavirus as something that happened only to Americans who went to China, or those who were in contact with people who had been to China. This was our testing policy for weeks.
It was, once again, Donald Trump’s own form of psychological distancing, and it had lethal consequences. It’s little different from the mentality that led young people to go tra-la-la-ing on the beaches of Florida over spring break, oblivious to the notion that they might silently spread the disease to the busboys who cleared their food, the cashier who handed them their beer, or their parents who waited for them back home. (It was also foolish for them to believe they were completely immune: Statistics say otherwise.)
The only way to fight this pandemic is through identification with its victims, not deliberate estrangement from them. As we spend weeks — months — in isolation, it’s our connectedness we ought to keep in mind. This virus affects us all. Je suis Covid.

Texto completo: BY ALEXANDRA JAFFE
The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - A former aide to Joe Biden is accusing the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee of sexually assaulting her during the early 1990s when he was a senator. Biden's campaign denies the charges.
In two recent interviews with The Associated Press, Tara Reade alleged the assault occurred in the basement of a Capitol Hill office building in the spring of 1993. She filed a police report in Washington on Thursday saying she was the victim of a sexual assault by an unnamed person in 1993, a copy of which was obtained by the AP.
It's not the first time Reade has made an accusation against the former vice president. Last year, Reade publicly accused Biden of inappropriate touching, but did not allege sexual assault.
In a statement, Biden deputy campaign manager and communications director Kate Bedingfield said the former vice president has "dedicated his public life to changing the culture and the laws around violence against women," pointing to his work passing the Violence Against Women Act. She said "he firmly believes that women have a right to be heard - and heard respectfully," but added: "Such claims should also be diligently reviewed by an independent press."
"What is clear about this claim: it is untrue. This absolutely did not happen," Bedingfield said.
Reade's charge comes at a pivotal time for Biden. The former vice president is seeking to unify the Democratic Party behind his campaign as the party's presumptive presidential nominee after Sen. Bernie Sanders dropped out of the primary last week. Women are a crucial voting bloc for Democrats and any erosion of support for Biden could sink his candidacy in the fall.
Earlier in the Democratic primary, Biden faced accusations of unwanted touching by several women, who said they were uncomfortable with hugs, hand holding and other actions. Reade was among the women who came forward at the time.
In recent weeks, she's given a handful of interviews saying Biden's actions went further than she initially disclosed. In an interview with the AP, she detailed a 1993 encounter that she says occurred when she was asked by a supervisor to bring Biden his gym bag as he was on his way down to the Senate gymnasium. She says Biden pushed her against a wall in the basement of a Capitol Hill office building, groped her and penetrated her with his fingers.
"He was whispering to me and trying to kiss me at the same time, and he was saying, 'Do you want to go somewhere else?''' she said. "I remember wanting to say stop, but I don't know if I said it out loud or if I just thought it. I was kind of frozen up."
Reade said that she pulled away and Biden looked "shocked and surprised," and replied, "Come on, man, I heard you liked me."
Reade, who was a staff assistant in Biden's office at the time, said she wasn't aware of any direct witnesses to the encounter. She told the AP she did raise accusations of sexual harassment, but not assault, against Biden in multiple meetings with her supervisors, including Marianne Baker, Biden's executive assistant; Dennis Toner, Biden's deputy chief of staff; and Ted Kaufman, the senator's chief of staff.
In a statement provided by the campaign, Baker said that in the nearly two decades she worked for Biden, "I never once witnessed, or heard of, or received, any reports of inappropriate conduct, period - not from Ms. Reade, not from anyone."
The AP spoke to five current or former Biden staffers on Sunday, all of whom worked for him at the time of the alleged incident. None recalled such an incident or a report, and neither Toner nor Kaufman could recall Reade. Both said what she had described was out of character for Biden.
"She did not come to me. I would have remembered her if she had, and I don't remember her at all," Kaufman said.
Reade said she filed a written report with a Senate personnel office. But she didn't receive a copy of it and has been unable to obtain one since because, she says, Biden's Senate files are currently at the University of Delaware, which has not yet made them public.
The AP has been unable to verify whether a report was made.
Reade says after complaining to supervisors, her job responsibilities were scaled back and she was eventually told by Toner that she was not a good fit for the job and encouraged to find a new one. This contradicts her comments to The New York Times, which reported Reade said Kaufman told her she was not a good fit for the job.
Reade told the AP she spoke to at least four people about Biden's conduct before she went public with her experience: two friends, her brother and her mother. Her mother passed away, and her brother did not respond to a request for comment.
One friend, who knew Reade in 1993, said in an interview Sunday that Reade told them about the alleged assault when it happened. The person, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation, didn't mention the assault allegation during an initial interview with the AP last year, but confirmed those details after Reade went forward with them. The person said they had initially advised Reade against sharing details of the assault because of the negative response to her less serious accusations of harassment.
The second friend met Reade more than a decade after the alleged incident and confirmed that Reade had a conversation with them in 2007 or 2008 about experiencing sexual harassment from Biden while working in his Senate office. But the friend, who requested anonymity to protect the privacy of their family, made no mention of assault.
In the course of reporting on Reade's allegations, the AP also contacted 21 former Biden staffers from the time and spoke to several of them. While some remembered Reade, none recalled any instances of inappropriate touching or behavior on Biden's behalf, or any complaints made by Reade.
Melissa Lefko, who worked as a staff assistant for Biden at the same time as Reade, said Biden had very little interaction with staff at their level, and that Reade's recollection of Biden's conduct didn't match her own.
"When you work on the Hill, you know who the good guys are who the bad guys are and who you should avoid and Biden was a good guy, he was never, ever on that list of the bad guys," she said in an interview.
Biden's conduct towards women first came under scrutiny just before he announced his presidential campaign last spring. Eight women, including Reade, came forward with allegations that the former vice president made them feel uncomfortable with inappropriate physical displays of affection.
Biden acknowledged the complaints and promised to "be more mindful about respecting personal space in the future."
The AP spoke with Reade about those complaints in April 2019. During that interview, Reade alleged that Biden rubbed her shoulders and neck, played with her hair, and that she was asked by another aide in Biden's Senate office to dress more conservatively and told "don't be so sexy." The AP declined to publish details of the interview at the time because reporters were unable to corroborate her allegations, and aspects of her story contradicted other reporting.
In recent months, Reade came forward with the additional allegation of assault, speaking first to progressive podcast host Katie Halper, before The New York Times published an extensive review of her claims Sunday.
Reade's story of sexual harassment had circulated for weeks in both conservative and progressive media outlets. While Reade said she supported Sanders or Elizabeth Warren in the Democratic primary, she said that her decision to come forward with new details was not politically motivated.
In her Sunday interview with the AP, Reade said that she was reluctant to share details of the assault during her initial conversations with reporters over a year ago because she was scared of backlash, and was still coming to terms with what happened to her.
"Already I was being threatened and kind of smeared, and I just I wasn't ready," she said. "So I talked about the sexual harassment and what I was comfortable talking about, but I wasn't ready to talk about sexual assault."

Trying to boost your immune system?

Texto completo: Healthy immune systems can help ward off infections, health experts say.

As the coronavirus spreads across the United States, people may think about giving their bodies an extra boost.

Though no single measure is guaranteed to protect against COVID-19, some practices can help immune systems be strong, The New York Times reported.

Here are some to try at home.

Building a strong immune system can start at the dinner table, health experts say.

That's because a healthy gut is key in the fight against infections, according to Orlando Health.

Adults should eat about five daily servings of produce, each one being roughly the size of a piece of fruit, the hospital system wrote on its website.

Doctors recommend eating spinach, mushrooms, strawberries and other foods packed with nutrients, such as vitamins A, C and D, according to CNBC.

The coronavirus has left some store shelves bare and restaurants with limited service.

But eating a healthy diet is important for people in self-quarantine, meaning they are away from others after possible exposure to the disease, according to the World Health Organization.

"Limited access to fresh foods may lead to an increased consumption of highly processed foods, which tend to be high in fats, sugars and salt," WHO said. "Such changes in eating behavior could have a negative effect on the immune system."

Other tips to help your immune system

Getting enough sleep is another step toward a bolstered immune system, according to AARP.

"Your immune system is like your computer -- it needs moments of rest so it doesn't become overheated," Dr. Mark Moyad of the University of Michigan Medical Center told the organization. "Sleep reboots the system."

Adults should sleep at least seven hours each night, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

While awake, limiting stress is also an important way to boost the immune system, The New York Times and other websites reported.

During the coronavirus pandemic, the CDC recommends people who are stressed take breaks from news about the virus, make healthy choices and talk to others they trust.

Another immune system boost can come from exercising, according to AARP. Health experts recommend working out in 30-minute sessions for five days a week.

Though gyms have closed to help slow the spread of the coronavirus, stay-at-home orders have allowed people to stay fit in outdoor spaces.

People with conditions that compromise their immune systems are at higher risk of getting seriously sick from the disease. Some of those conditions include receiving cancer treatments or getting organ transplants, according to the CDC.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - A former Senate aide who last year accused Joe Biden of inappropriate touching has made an allegation of sexual assault against the former vice president, the Democratic Party's presumptive presidential nominee this fall.
Tara Reade, who briefly worked as a staff assistant in Biden's Senate office, told The New York Times that in 1993, Biden pinned her to a wall in a Senate building, reached under her clothing and penetrated her with his fingers. A friend said Reade told her the details of the allegation at the time. Another friend and a brother of Reade's said she told them over the years about a traumatic sexual incident involving Biden.
A spokeswoman for Biden said the allegation was false. In interviews, several people who worked in the Senate office with Reade said they did not recall any talk of such an incident or similar behavior by Biden toward her or any women. Two office interns who worked directly with Reade said they were unaware of the allegation or any treatment that troubled her.
Last year, Reade and seven other women came forward to accuse Biden of kissing, hugging or touching them in ways that made them feel uncomfortable. Reade told The Times then that Biden had publicly stroked her neck, wrapped his fingers in her hair and touched her in ways that made her uncomfortable.
Soon after Reade made the new allegation, in a podcast interview released March 25, The Times began reporting on her account and seeking corroboration through interviews, documents and other sources. The Times interviewed Reade on multiple days over hours, as well as those she told about Biden's behavior and other friends. The Times has also interviewed lawyers who spoke to Reade about her allegation; nearly two dozen people who worked with Biden during the early 1990s, including many who worked with Reade; and the other seven women who criticized Biden last year, to discuss their experiences with him.
No other allegation about sexual assault surfaced in the course of reporting, nor did any former Biden staff members corroborate any details of Reade's allegation. The Times found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Biden.
On Thursday, Reade filed a report with the Washington, D.C., police, saying she was the victim of a sexual assault in 1993; the public incident report, provided to The Times by Reade and the police, does not mention Biden by name, but she said the complaint was about him. Reade said she filed the report to give herself an additional degree of safety from potential threats. Filing a false police report may be punishable by a fine and imprisonment.
Reade, who worked as a staff assistant helping manage office interns, said she also filed a complaint with the Senate in 1993 about Biden; she said she did not have a copy of it, and such paperwork has not been located. The Biden campaign said it did not have a complaint.
The Times reviewed an official copy of her employment history from the Senate that she provided showing she was hired in December 1992 and paid by Biden's office until August 1993.
The seven other women who had complained about Biden told The Times this month that they did not have any new information about their experiences to add, but several said they believed Reade's account.
Last year, Biden, 77, acknowledged the women's complaints about his conduct, saying his intentions were benign and promising to be "more mindful and respectful of people's personal space."
In response to Reade's allegation, Kate Bedingfield, a deputy Biden campaign manager, said in a statement, "Vice President Biden has dedicated his public life to changing the culture and the laws around violence against women. He authored and fought for the passage and reauthorization of the landmark Violence Against Women Act.
"He firmly believes that women have a right to be heard - and heard respectfully. Such claims should also be diligently reviewed by an independent press. What is clear about this claim: It is untrue. This absolutely did not happen."
Reade made her new allegation public as Biden was closing in on the Democratic presidential nomination after winning a string of primaries against his chief rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Reade, who describes herself as a "third-generation Democrat," said she originally favored Marianne Williamson and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., in the race but voted for Sanders in the California primary last month. She said her decision to come forward had nothing to do with politics or helping Sanders and added that neither his campaign nor the Trump campaign had encouraged her to make her allegation.
President Donald Trump has been accused of sexual assault and misconduct by more than a dozen women, who have described a pattern of behavior that went far beyond the accusations against Biden. The president also directed illegal payments - including $130,000 to a pornographic film actress, Stormy Daniels - before the 2016 election to silence women about alleged affairs with Trump, according to federal prosecutors.
Caption: Tara Reade, who worked as a staff assistant in Joe Biden's Senate office in 1993, has accused him of assaulting her nearly three decades ago and says she told others about it. A Biden spokeswoman said the allegation is false.
In 2019, Reade and seven other women came forward to accuse Biden, the former vice president, of kissing, hugging or touching them in ways that made them uncomfortable.
After the alleged assault, Reade said she filed a written complaint with a Senate personnel office. She said office staff responded by taking away most of her duties.

Texto completo: The number of confirmed coronavirus cases increased by 138 on Monday, the highest daily rate so far.
Cases in Minnehaha County increased by 127 to 654 and four in Lincoln County to 50. South Dakota's total increased to 868 cases.
The state's death toll remains at six as no new deaths have been reported in more than a week.
Recoveries increased by 10 to 207, and one more person has been hospitalized. The state says 44 people have been hospitalized at certain times since the state first reported cases.
Monday's case increase was the largest reported by the state so far.
The state hasn't released the racial breakdown of the COVID-19 cases because the data could identify a patient, Health Secretary Kim Malsam-Rysdon said on Monday, but they're not seeing a large racial disparity in the cases. As the number of cases increases, the state will release the information it can.
Of the 654 cases in Minnehaha County, 350 are individuals who work at Smithfield Foods, the Department of Health said.
Ten Smithfield workers have been hospitalized.
Cases at Smithfield third most in country Smithfield Foods has the third largest outbreak of coronavirus at a facility in the United States, according to tracking by the New York Times.
The New York Times says 586 cases have been reported aboard the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt in Guam and 524 cases at the Cook County Jail in Chicago.
Smithfield Foods announced it was closing indefinitely starting Wednesday.
As a result, Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken is asking Gov. Kristi Noem to declare a shelter-in-place order for all of Minnehaha and Lincoln County for three weeks.
Noem did not declare a shelter-in-place on Monday, but she did say she expects Sioux Falls to see a peak in coronavirus cases a couple weeks earlier than the rest of the state's peak in mid-June.
Malsam-Rysdon said they can't determine exactly how COVID-19 got into the Smithfield employee population, but Sioux Falls had significant community spread at that point.

Texto completo: Experts inside and outside the government identified the threat early on and sought to raise alarms even as President Trump was moving slowly. Read some of what they had to say among themselves at critical moments.
WASHINGTON -- As the coronavirus emerged and headed toward the United States, an extraordinary conversation was hatched among an elite group of infectious disease doctors and medical experts in the federal government and academic institutions around the nation.
Red Dawn -- a nod to the 1984 film with Patrick Swayze and Charlie Sheen -- was the nickname for the email chain they built. Different threads in the chain were named Red Dawn Breaking, Red Dawn Rising, Red Dawn Breaking Bad and, as the situation grew more dire, Red Dawn Raging. It was hosted by the chief medical officer at the Department of Homeland Security, Dr. Duane C. Caneva, starting in January with a small core of medical experts and friends that gradually grew to dozens.
The "Red Dawn String," Dr. Caneva said, was intended "to provide thoughts, concerns, raise issues, share information across various colleagues responding to Covid-19," including medical experts and doctors from the Health and Human Services Department, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Homeland Security Department, the Veterans Affairs Department, the Pentagon and other federal agencies tracking the historic health emergency.
Here are key exchanges from the emails, with context and analysis, that show the experts' rising sense of frustration and then anger as their advice seemingly failed to break through to the administration, raising the odds that more people would likely die.
A Veterans Affairs official worried in January that the W.H.O. and C.D.C. were slow to address the spread of the virus.
One of the most active participants in the group was Dr. Carter E. Mecher, a senior medical adviser at the Veterans Affairs Department who helped write a key Bush-era pandemic plan. That document focused in particular on what to do if the government was unable to contain a contagious disease and there was no available vaccine, like with the coronavirus.
The next step is called mitigation, and it relies on unsophisticated steps such as closing schools, businesses, shutting down sporting events or large public gatherings, to try to slow the spread by keeping people away from one another. As of late January, Dr. Mecher was already discussing the likelihood that the United States would soon need to turn to mitigation efforts, including perhaps to "close the colleges and universities."
A former Bush and Obama adviser compared the outbreak to major disasters in world history.
Dr. James Lawler, an infectious disease doctor at the University of Nebraska who served in the White House under President George W. Bush and as an adviser to President Barack Obama, was also a regular participant in the email chain. He stayed in regular communication with federal officials as the United States attempted to figure out how to respond to the virus. From the beginning he predicted this would be a major public health event.
Experts worried that it would be hard to convince society to order restrictions like school and business closures to slow the spread.
Convincing governors and mayors to intentionally cause economic harm by ordering or promoting mitigation efforts -- such as closing businesses -- is always a difficult task. That is why it is so important, these medical experts said, for the federal government to take the lead, providing cover for the local officials to kick off the so-called Nonpharmaceutical Interventions, such as school and business closures. Again, this group of doctors and medical experts recognized from early on that this step was all but inevitable, even if the administration was slow to recognize the need.
The Diamond Princess was an early case study of how quickly the virus could spread.
Strong evidence was emerging as of mid-February -- with the first cases of Covid-19 already in the United States -- that the nation was about to be hit hard. These doctors and medical experts researched how quickly the virus spread on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was quarantined in the port of Yokohama, Japan, on Feb. 3 before hundreds of United States citizens on the ship returned home.
Dr. Eva Lee, a researcher at Georgia Institute of Technology who has frequently worked with the federal government to create infectious disease projections, helped the Red Dawn group do modeling, based on the virus spread on the cruise ship. (Dr. Lee is facing sentencing on federal charges that she falsified the membership certificate behind a $ 40,000 National Science Foundation grant for unrelated research.)
February was a tipping point for some experts.
The concern these medical experts had been raising in late January and early February turned to alarm by the third week in February. That was when they effectively concluded that the United States had already lost the fight to contain the virus, and that it needed to switch to mitigation. One critical element in that shift was the realization that many people in the country were likely already infected and capable of spreading the virus, but not showing any symptoms. Here Dr. Lee discusses this conclusion with Dr. Robert Kadlec, the head of the virus response effort at the Department of Health and Human Services and a key White House adviser.
Dr. Kadlec and other administration officials decided the next day to recommend to Mr. Trump that he publicly support the start of these mitigation efforts, such as school closings. But before they could discuss it with the president, who was returning from India, another official went public with a warning, sending the stock market down sharply and angering Mr. Trump. The meeting to brief him on the recommendation was canceled and it was three weeks before Mr. Trump would reluctantly come around to the need for mitigation.
This slow pace of action was confusing to the medical experts on the Red Dawn email chain, who were increasingly alarmed that cities and states that were getting hit hard by the virus needed to move faster to take aggressive steps.
A former high-ranking Trump official weighed in with criticisms.
When Mr. Trump gave a speech to the nation on March 11 in which he announced limits on flights from Europe to the United States -- but still no move to curb gatherings in cities where the virus had spread -- the experts on the email chain grew angry and fearful. Among those questioning Mr. Trump's decision was Tom Bossert, who had previously served as Mr. Trump's homeland security adviser.
Participants were angry the C.D.C. did not push for school closures.
The Red Dawn participants were even more upset when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in mid-March, questioned the value of closing schools, at least for short periods of time. Soon enough, governors ignored this advice, and most schools in the United States were shut. But it happened largely without federal leadership.
See all of the email exchanges.
The New York Times has collected more than 80 pages of these emails, from January through March, based in part on Freedom of Information Act requests to local government officials. Some of the emails were reported on last month by Kaiser Health News. Here is a fuller collection, arranged by The Times in chronological order. This file includes a list of many of the medical experts on the email chains. It also contains related emails from certain state government medical experts who were reaching out to the federal government during the same time period.

Texto completo: Also at the briefing on Monday, Dr. Anthony Fauci said a comment he made that was seen as critical of the president was taken out of context, and Mr. Trump said he did not intend to fire him.
WASHINGTON -- President Trump turned Monday's daily coronavirus task force briefing into an aggressive defense of his own halting response to the pandemic and used a campaign-style video to denounce criticism that he moved too slowly to limit the deadly spread of the virus.
For nearly an hour, Mr. Trump vented his frustration after weekend news reports that his own public health officials were prepared by late February to recommend aggressive social distancing measures, but that the president did not announce them until several weeks later -- a crucial delay that allowed the virus to spread.
Mr. Trump broadly mischaracterized an article on his response to the coronavirus, published over the weekend in The New York Times, repeatedly insisting that the United States had very few cases of the virus in early January -- six weeks earlier -- and angrily mocking a suggestion that was never made: that he should have ordered all schools and businesses shut that month.
"I am supposed to close down the greatest economy in the history of the world and we don't have one case confirmed in the United States?" he said, his voice laced with sarcasm.
Mr. Trump began the briefing by inviting Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert and a member of the coronavirus task force, to the lectern so he could "clarify" comments he made Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union." On the news program, he said that more lives could have been saved from the coronavirus if the country had been shut down earlier.
With the president towering over him, Dr. Fauci said his answer to a hypothetical question got him "into some difficulty" and insisted that Mr. Trump had approved aggressive social distancing measures as soon as he and Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the White House's coronavirus coordinator, urged him to do so.
"The first and only time that Dr. Birx and I went in and formally made a recommendation to the president" to put in place strong mitigation measures, Dr. Fauci said, "the president listened to the recommendation and went to the mitigation."
Mr. Trump -- who on Sunday reposted a message on Twitter saying, "Time to #FireFauci" -- insisted that he had no plans to remove Dr. Fauci from his team and was merely elevating someone else's opinion that he did not share.
"I retweeted somebody. I don't know, they said, 'Fire.' Doesn't matter," Mr. Trump told reporters.
"I like him. I think he is terrific," the president said. "Not everybody is happy with Anthony. Not everybody is happy with everybody."
Begun as a regular update on the virus by Vice President Mike Pence and the nation's top public health officials, the daily evening briefing has largely been turned into a lengthy infomercial starring Mr. Trump, who brags about his administration's efforts, mocks his critics and berates reporters.
But even by those standards, Monday's briefing stood out. Instead of beginning with his daily recitation of facts about the virus response, the president first introduced Dr. Fauci and then delivered a prepared defense of his actions, and an attack on the news reports about them.
Lashing out at what he called "a fake newspaper" that writes "fake stories," Mr. Trump lowered the lights in the White House briefing room to play a video showing a number of Fox News hosts playing down the threat from the virus and governors lauding his actions to help them deal with the crush of hospitalizations.
The video -- which the president said was produced by a social media team in "a period of less than two hours" -- included video clips of Mr. Trump taking action to confront the virus, and did not include any of the many instances when the president said the virus was "under control" and would "miraculously disappear" with little effort.
Set to music, the video largely skipped over February and early March, when public health experts say the administration failed to provide enough testing for the virus and did not act quickly enough to promote social distancing and prevent its spread.
At one point in the video, Maggie Haberman, a Times White House correspondent, is heard commenting on the president's decision on Jan. 31 to halt some flights from China in an interview with The Times's podcast "The Daily."
"At the end of the day, it was probably effective, because it did actually take a pretty aggressive measure against the spread of the virus," Ms. Haberman said in the interview. "The problem is, it was one of the last things that he did for several weeks."
In the video, Ms. Haberman's last sentence was edited out, as was her description of the decision as Mr. Trump's "mission accomplished" moment.
Ms. Haberman was one of six writers of the Times article that Mr. Trump said was "fake."
"We are confident in the accuracy of our reporting, which was based on verified documents and numerous on-the-record interviews," said Danielle Rhoades Ha, a spokeswoman for The Times. "The facts in our story are not in dispute."
Before the briefing ended, the Democratic National Committee issued a statement saying that the president "commandeered the briefing to run campaign propaganda to soothe his small ego and pathetically try to cover up for his own failed response."
Mr. Trump's presentation was the continuation of a weekend-long effort to rebut criticism of his slow initial response to the pandemic.
The president tweeted repeatedly on Saturday after the Times article was first published online, and he continued on Sunday, after Dr. Fauci's interview on "State of the Union," which angered many of Mr. Trump's allies and supporters.
Asked by Jake Tapper, the show's host, whether "lives could have been saved" if social distancing had been started in late February rather than in mid-March, Dr. Fauci said they could have.
"I mean, obviously, you could logically say that if you had a process that was ongoing and you started mitigation earlier, you could have saved lives," Dr. Fauci said.
The president's failure to announce aggressive mitigation efforts until mid-March even though top health officials, including Dr. Fauci, had concluded several weeks earlier that it would soon be time to embrace such measures is considered a critical mistake in the effort to contain the coronavirus.
But at Monday's briefing, Dr. Fauci said his response was taken out of context as confirmation of the Times investigation that reported that the president was warned about the potential for a pandemic but that lack of planning led to a halting response.
"As happens all the time, there were interpretations of that response to a hypothetical question," Dr. Fauci said. "I thought it would be nice for me to clarify because I did not have a chance to clarify."
Dr. Fauci bristled when a reporter asked if he was making the clarifying statement voluntarily, implying that he was put up to it under pressure from Mr. Trump.
"Everything I do is voluntary, please," he said. "Don't even imply that."

Texto completo: "The case can be made that, among industrialized countries, the United States has had the worst overall response," a reader writes.
To the Editor:
Re "Despite Timely Alerts, Trump Was Slow to Act" (front page, April 12):
The case can be made that, among industrialized countries, the United States has had the worst overall response. We were late in taking the threat seriously, our testing capacity is chaotic, hospitals are undersupplied, health care across the board is overwhelmed and behavioral efforts to "flatten the curve" have been piecemeal.
Oxford University has been ranking the stringency of government actions in response to Covid-19, comparing the efforts of six countries hard hit by the virus (China, South Korea, Italy, France, the United Kingdom and the United States). Its timeline shows that the United States was one of the slowest countries to respond and was late in ramping up its efforts. Its most recent data (as of April 5) puts the U.S. response in last place among the six nations. As a result, we are now first place in the number of Covid-19 deaths.
The United States may well have the best and most experienced cadre of pandemic expertise in the world, and we certainly have the resources to launch a robust effort in preventing the spread of novel diseases. Our poor response to Covid-19 reflects weaknesses in long-term preparation and planning as well as a failure of current leadership.
As additional waves of the virus work their way through the population, and as future diseases present themselves, we must either do a much better job of containment or be prepared to face even greater social disruption and an unprecedented loss of life.

To the Editor:
In documenting President Trump's failure to heed early warnings of the pandemic, the article refers to "six long weeks before President Trump finally took aggressive action to confront the danger the nation was facing."
Yet the president still has not taken "aggressive action" to confront the danger. He has neither required shelter-in-place nor leveraged federal power to implement a Manhattan Project for acquiring and allocating test kits, protective personal equipment and ventilators. The stimulus bill bears his signature, but Mr. Trump played no role in ensuring that it would provide relief to everyday Americans. House Democrats did that crucial work.
Mr. Trump's only aggressive actions to date have been downplaying the risk, peddling unproven cures, blaming the Chinese, spreading false hope of quickly reopening the economy and giving himself high marks despite his own negligence.

To the Editor:
Again? Really?
How frequently is The Times going to publish articles critical of President Trump's erratic and impotent response to the coronavirus outbreak? There have been numerous articles, columns, editorials and Op-Eds on this topic over the past two months. Yes, people have died and will die because of Mr. Trump's inability to lead. But this is no longer news. And it hasn't been news for weeks now.
The New York Times is obsessed with President Trump. You publish the same stories critical of him over and over again. I beg you to broaden your coverage and stop giving this man pointless additional attention, which he so clearly enjoys.
Jonathan Carey
Hoboken, N.J.
To the Editor:
The Times's thorough and persuasive account of the slowness of the Trump administration to act on pandemic warnings lacks one further important perspective: Surely congressional leaders in their oversight capacity were aware, or should have been aware, of much of the information. Their polarization and extended attention to impeachment proceedings (with a predictable outcome) may well prove to have diverted them from this, as well as much of the nation's other urgent business.
An examination of congressional leadership in both parties by The Times -- what they knew and when, and what they did or did not do -- during this period also seems warranted if a complete account of culpability is to be reported.

Texto completo: With the number of new deaths and rate of hospitalizations falling in New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo said Monday “the worst is over" in the coronavirus pandemic, and he announced an alliance with six other Northeastern governors to explore how to eventually lift restrictions — a move that appeared to be an implicit rebuke to President Trump.
The governors from New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island said they would begin to draw up a plan for when to reopen businesses and schools and how quickly to allow people to return to work safely, although the timeline for such a plan remained unclear.
The joint effort was the first of two announced Monday: The governors of California, Oregon, and Washington, three Western states that were among those that felt the effects of the virus before it spread rapidly in the Northeast, announced a similar pact. All but one of the 10 governors on the two coasts are Democrats.
The focus on reopening the economy came even as the death toll in New York state surpassed 10,000 people, but other indicators continued to plateau or decline slightly, leading Cuomo to declare that the worst of the outbreak may have passed.
Nearly 19,000 people remain hospitalized in New York, the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States, but the rate of hospitalizations has slowed markedly over the last week, and the 671 deaths announced Monday marked the lowest one-day death toll in a week.

CIA warns against unproven treatment touted by Trump
The CIA has privately advised its workforce that taking an antimalarial drug touted by President Trump and some of his supporters as a promising treatment for the coronavirus has potentially dangerous side effects, including sudden death.
The warning, featured on a website for CIA employees with questions related to the spread of the coronavirus, came in late March after public discussion — and promotion by the president — that hydroxychloroquine, administered in concert with the antibiotic azithromycin, might prove effective against COVID-19.
The politically charged debate over hydroxychloroquine — medical specialists say there's still no conclusive evidence that it does what Trump has suggested — underscores a recurring phenomenon in this administration, in which the president stakes out a very public, sometimes controversial position on a subject only to have agencies within the government chart a different, more cautious approach.
A CIA spokesman declined to comment about internal workforce communications. The advice was posted as a response after an employee asked whether the employee should take the drug without a prescription.

The East Coast, always in the spotlight, owes debt to West
LOS ANGELES — California, Oregon, and Washington have more ventilators than they can use. As the nation struggles to scrounge up the lifesaving machines for hospitals overrun with COVID-19 patients, these three Western states recently shipped 1,000 spares to New York and other besieged neighbors to the East.
“All NYC needs is love . . . From CA," a worker scrawled in Magic Marker on a ventilator shipping box, shown in a video posted on Twitter by the governor of California, Gavin Newsom.
The ongoing effort of three West Coast states to come to the aid of more hard-hit parts of the nation has emerged as the most powerful indication to date that the early intervention of West Coast governors and mayors might have mitigated, at least for now, the medical catastrophe that has befallen New York and parts of the Midwest and South.
Their aggressive imposition of stay-at-home orders has stood in contrast to the relatively slower actions in New York and elsewhere, and drawn widespread praise from epidemiologists. As of Saturday afternoon, there had been 8,627 COVID-19 related deaths in New York, compared with 598 in California, 483 in Washington and 48 in Oregon. New York had 44 deaths per 100,000 people. California had two.

ACLU: Feds 'slow walking' inmate release at prison
WASHINGTON — Prisoner rights advocates accused the federal Bureau of Prisons of “slow walking" the release of inmates at a Louisiana lockup where the coronavirus has killed six prisoners and infected dozens of others.
The American Civil Liberties Union urged a federal judge on Monday to release hundreds of vulnerable inmates at FCC Oakdale to home confinement, calling the rural facility a tinderbox “ready to explode."
Jail officials deemed several dozen prisoners “potentially eligible" for release. But the ACLU described the government's plan as “far too little, far too late."
As of Sunday night, 38 inmates and 17 staff members had tested positive for COVID-19 at the Louisiana prison. There have been six deaths there since March 21.
“The prison has apparently succeeded in releasing no one except to hospitals and mortuaries," the nonprofit argued in new court filings.
The Bureau of Prisons did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It previously has said its case managers are “urgently reviewing all inmates to determine which ones" are eligible for home confinement.

Coronavirus infections spread among crew of USS Theodore Roosevelt as results of Navy investigation expected this week

Texto completo: INFECTIONS AMONG ROOSEVELT CREW STILL RISING: Between Saturday and Sunday, the number of sailors assigned to the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt who have tested positive for COVID-19 rose by 35, up from 550 to 585.
The Navy reported that as of Sunday, 92% of the 4,865 crew members have been tested, with 3,724 showing no signs of infection. Almost 4,000 sailors from the ship are now ashore in Guam, where they are under quarantine.
INVESTIGATION WRAPPING UP: A Navy investigation into the actions of the former commanding officer of the carrier, Capt. Brett Crozier, and the response of his superior officers is expected to be released this week.
The investigation looked into whether Crozier acted improperly by sending an email to 20 other Navy officials urging the evacuation of the carrier after crew members began getting sick following a port call in Vietnam. The emailed letter warned that sailors could die if quick action wasn't taken to isolate the crew and thoroughly disinfect the massive ship.
The letter so angered acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly that he fired Crozier for going outside the chain of command even before the investigation determined the facts. That, followed by intemperate remarks delivered to the crew in Guam denigrating Crozier as “too naive or too stupid” to command an aircraft carrier, led to Modly’s resignation.
A KEY QUESTION: Modly insisted that the letter, which found its way to the San Francisco Chronicle, was a “betrayal” because at the time it was sent, the Navy was already doing everything possible to help the ship.
Modly accused Crozier of blindsiding his immediate boss, Rear Adm. Stuart Baker, commander of the carrier strike group, who was embarked on the Roosevelt “right down the passageway” from Crozier’s stateroom.
But a New York Times report based on what the newspaper says are two dozen current and former Navy and Defense Department civilian and uniformed personnel, including Roosevelt crew members, said Baker overruled Crozier, favoring “less drastic measures” that “would still protect the crew and leave the Roosevelt in operation.”
On April 1, the day before Crozier was fired, Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Michael Gilday, the Navy’s highest officer, acknowledged that there are times a commander going outside the chain of command might be justified.
“They should not be inhibited from telling us and being transparent about the issues that they see, but they need to do it through their chains of command,” Gilday said at a Pentagon press briefing. “And if they're not getting the proper responses from the chains of command, then they need to maybe go outside of it.”
REINSTATING THE COMMANDER: The findings of the investigation could pave the way for Crozier to be reinstated as commanding officer of the Roosevelt — something Gilday, Defense Secretary Mark Esper, and President Trump have not ruled out.
Speaking on CBS This Morning on Friday, Esper said he will rely heavily on Navy leadership. “We've taken nothing off the table. What I look to do is hear from the chain of command. My inclination is always to support the chain of command and to take their recommendations seriously.”
“When I replaced the acting Navy secretary three days ago, I called him and the chief of naval operations into my office,” Esper said. “I gave them some guidance. One of the things I told them is this: No further action will be taken against Capt. Crozier until the investigation is completed. And once that's completed, we'll see where that takes us.”

HAPPENING TODAY: Army Maj. Gen. Jeffrey Milhorn, commander of the Army Corps of Engineers North Atlantic Division, takes part in a conference call briefing, "COVID-19 Update: Latest Developments in the Fight Against Coronavirus,” sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations.
MILLER MEETS TALIBAN: With the U.S. withdrawal agreement with the Taliban foundering, Gen. Scott Miller, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, met with Taliban leadership Friday in Doha, Qatar. The meeting came as the Taliban accused U.S. forces of breaching an agreement signed between the two sides in February.
“Gen. Miller met with Taliban leadership last night as part of the military channel established in the agreement,” a spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan told Reuters. “The meeting was about the need to reduce the violence,” he said.
Last week, the Taliban accused U.S. forces of continuing to fight in support of Afghan security operations in some parts of the country. The spokesman for the U.S. forces described the actions as defense of Afghan forces.
Peace talks between the Taliban and Afghan government have broken down over the issue of prisoner exchanges. The Taliban announced Sunday it will be releasing 20 Afghan government prisoners the group has been holding, according to the Associated Press.
LINDSEY GRAHAM ON YEMEN WAR CEASE-FIRE: Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, praised the decision by the Saudi-led coalition to declare a cease-fire in the Yemen war.
“I hope and expect that all parties will take advantage of this moment to end this conflict and to give relief to the long-suffering people of Yemen,” Graham said in a statement. ““Iran needs to step up to the plate and push their Houthi proxies to the negotiating table to reach a comprehensive solution to stop the suffering.”
“The Yemen conflict has created great instability throughout the region and untold suffering for the citizens of Yemen. I know both Congress and the Trump administration will be supportive of any reasonable effort to end this conflict,” he said.
INDUSTRY WATCH: The Pentagon is moving ahead with its first project under the authority of the Defense Protection Act after receiving approval from the White House.
“The $133 million project will use these authorities to increase domestic production capacity of N95 masks to over 39 million in the next 90 days,” said Lt. Col. Mike Andrews, a Pentagon spokesman. “The increased production will ensure the U.S. government gets dedicated, long-term industrial capacity to meet the needs of the nation.”
Additional details, including the names of the companies, will be provided in the coming days when the contract is awarded.

Examining the New York Times's new sense of fairness for sexual assault allegations

Texto completo: Every man in America should get on his knees right now and pray that the New York Times treats him the same way the paper treated Joe Biden should they ever be accused of a sexual assault from nearly 30 years ago.
Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was two years too early to be able to make that prayer, but better later than never, I guess.
The New York Times finally published a story on Sunday related to Tara Reade, the 56-year-old woman who claims that in 1993, when she worked for Biden’s Senate office, the former vice president pushed her up against a wall, forced her legs apart, and put his hand up her skirt.
Reade says she rejected the advances and then complained to Biden’s executive assistant and two other top aides about general harassment she experienced from the senator. Reade said she also filed a formal complaint with the Senate personnel office.
Biden’s campaign has denied the allegation.
New York Times reporters Lisa Lerer and Sydney Ember said they were unable to locate any record of the formal complaint and that after multiple interviews with former Biden staff and associates for Reade, they were only able to secure some corroboration from two friends who were granted anonymity.
All of this was wrapped up under the headline “Examining a sexual assault allegation against Biden” and put to bed. There must not have been any high school yearbooks for Lerer and Ember to dig through for embarrassing teenage slang that Biden might have used as a child.
We don’t have to decide whether we believe Reade or Biden in this scenario. She says one thing, and he says another. Reade’s friends say one thing, those close to Biden say another.
There have been other claims made about Biden, but none of them could be taken as serious examples of sexual impropriety — he hugged some women in public, and it made them uncomfortable. Cuff him!
Before the social justice mob figured out how to weaponize the #MeToo movement, we evaluated similar allegations of misconduct by surveying the evidence and considering the credibility of all parties involved. That’s still the best way to do it, and in this episode, we are, as is often the case, at an impasse.
The national media, including the New York Times, lost its way in the #MeToo hysteria for a time, buying into the idea that every accusation in and of itself carries the full weight of truth behind it. It’s good to see that Biden’s circumstances have brought them back to the light.

Texto completo: The New York Times revealed that Joe Biden's campaign influenced the newspaper's decision to edit out allegations of sexual misconduct from a story published over the weekend.
On Sunday, the New York Times was criticized for editing a sentence and deleting a tweet noting that Biden has been accused of sexual misconduct by women who found that his hugging and hair sniffing crossed the line. The sentence and the tweet were part of a larger story on the sexual assault allegation from Tara Reade, a former Biden staffer, who accused him of placing his hand under her skirt and penetrating her with his fingers.
The newsroom claimed at the time that it made the edits because the original language was confusing, tweeting, "We've deleted a tweet in this thread that had some imprecise language that has been changed in the story."
On Monday, however, Executive Editor Dean Baquet admitted that the Biden campaign's reaction to the piece played a role in making the changes. He explained the situation as part of a longer story that detailed why the New York Times waited 14 days to cover Reade's allegations.
"Even though a lot of us, including me, had looked at it before the story went into the paper, I think that the campaign thought that the phrasing was awkward and made it look like there were other instances in which he had been accused of sexual misconduct," he explained. "And that’s not what the sentence was intended to say."
He added, "We didn’t think it was a factual mistake. I thought it was an awkward phrasing issue that could be read different ways and that it wasn’t something factual we were correcting. So I didn’t think that was necessary [to explain]."
The original sentence from the story read, "The Times found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Biden, beyond the hugs, kisses and touching that women previously said made them uncomfortable." It was later changed to: "The Times found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Biden."
Baquet did not elaborate on what the campaign found "awkward" about the phrasing used in the original piece.
In explaining the editorial decisions that were put into the New York Times' coverage of Reade's allegations, the outlet also addressed comparisons to the newspaper's treatment of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's accusers. Baquet said the paper published allegations against Kavanaugh the day they were made because the larger story of sexual assault was already present with previous accusations from Christine Blasey Ford.
"Kavanaugh was already in a public forum in a large way. Kavanaugh’s status as a Supreme Court justice was in question because of a very serious allegation. And when I say in a public way, I don’t mean in the public way of Tara Reade’s. If you ask the average person in America, they didn’t know about the Tara Reade case," Baquet explained.
He continued, "So I thought in that case, if the New York Times was going to introduce this to readers, we needed to introduce it with some reporting and perspective. Kavanaugh was in a very different situation. It was a live, ongoing story that had become the biggest political story in the country. It was just a different news judgment moment."
Biden has denied all of the allegations made by Reade. His spokeswoman, Kate Bedingfield, responded to the allegations, saying, "Women have a right to tell their story, and reporters have an obligation to rigorously vet those claims. We encourage them to do so because these accusations are false."

Texto completo: MÉXICO – Ante el hacinamiento en albergue de migrantes en Matamoros , el diario estadounidense The New York Times alertó del peligro que corren los indocumentados en Tamaulipas , estado fronterizo con Estados Unidos.
The New York Times advirtió que el campamento donde están hacinadas 2,500 personas es una inminente “fosa común” ante la pandemia de COVID-19.
En su artículo “La fosa común inminente en la frontera”, publicado en la sección de Opinión del NYT, K arla Cornejo Villavicencio narra las condiciones de hacinamiento, insalubres y de desnutrición de los migrantes que esperan asilo bajo la política de “Permanezcan en México” del presidente Donald Trump .
“Viven en espacios hacinados e insalubres -algunos en tiendas de campaña, otros en albergues improvisados- sin energía eléctrica o agua corriente”, afirmó Cornejo Villavicencio .
“Viven bajo la amenaza constante del virus, todo por ejercer su derecho humano a reclamar asilo”, destaca la autora del artículo.
Cornejo Villavicencio, quien fue una de las “dreamers” del gobierno de Barack Obama , que benefició a indocumentados que llegaron a Estados Unidos en su niñez, comentó que la Unicef y prácticamente todos los voluntarios han desaparecido del campamento.
A excepción de Médicos Sin Fronteras, que ofrece algunos servicios, y Global Response Management (GRM), la única presencia constante en el albergue para indocumentados en Matamoros.
Aunque los doctores, enfermeras y paramédicos voluntarios de GRM, en algunos casos migrantes buscadores de asilo, han estado haciendo su mejor esfuerzo, pero es poco lo que pueden hacer ante la falta de recursos, precisa Cornejo Villavicencio en su artículo.
“El director ejecutivo de GRM, quien es enfermero, reporta que al interior del campamento había cinco pacientes con síntomas de COVID-19. La agencia los reportó a autoridades locales, pero se les negaron pruebas (de COVID-19)”, destacó.
La autora detalla que GRM pidió que los indocumentados fueran sacados del albergue para instalarlos en hoteles cercanos para evitar un brote mayor del coronavirus en el lugar, pero hasta el momento las autoridades migratorias no han autorizado el traslado.
Los cinco hospitales que hay en Matamoros solo cuentan con 10 ventiladores y 40 camas de cuidados intensivos, lo que sería insuficiente para atender a los pacientes cuando se registren más casos de coronavirus en el campamento y en la ciudad.
“Un brote (del virus) sería catastrófico”, aseguró la autora, quien consideró que México ha sido lento para reaccionar ante la amenaza.
Cornejo Villavicencio aprovechó la oportunidad para recordar que el presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador minimizó los alcances de la pandemia , al grado que siguió con sus giras de trabajo donde se registraron aglomeraciones y no solo eso, sino que el mandatario mexicano siguió repartiendo besos y abrazos a sus seguidores, cuando el país las autoridades de Salud lo habían prohibido .
La escritora además cuestionó la cobertura de medios de países occidentales.
“La dura situación de los migrantes no es nada más que interés lleno de morbo”, señaló.
“A pesar de la preocupación por los buscadores de asilo en Matamoros, nadie se está apresurando a ayudarlos”, agregó. “La gente simplemente llega a raudales para leer sobre esta fosa común inminente”.
Destacó que no solo en Matamoros, sino también en Nueva York y en todo el mundo, los migrantes figuran entre los más vulnerables del coronavirus .
“No tienen la libertad ni se pueden dar el lujo de distanciarse de otros”, narró.
“Los hombres y mujeres indocumentados en nuestras comunidades están en las líneas del frente -a menudo sin equipo de protección o red de seguridad- arriesgando la vida para desempeñar empleos que la mayoría de los estadounidenses se niega a hacer”, escribió Cornejo Villavicencio .
“Están desinfectando hospitales y consultorios médicos, repartiendo nuestra comida y cuidando de nuestros familiares de edad avanzada”, precisó.
Ante la falta de interés de Trump y López Obrador , Cornejo hizo un llamado a evitar el genocidio migrante .
“Como una de las profecías cumplidas del sueño americano, me he ganado el derecho a profetizar”, advirtió.
“Si los Gobiernos de Estados Unidos y México nos dejan morir en masa, acecharemos a sus hijos, y a los hijos de sus hijos, y a sus hijos también. Nunca dormirán en paz y llegarán a saber nuestros nombres”, sentenció Cornejo Villavicencio.
Y es que México es uno de los países donde menos se respetan las medidas sanitarias para frenar los contagios de conornavirus.
En algunas ciudades la población hace caso omiso a las medidas sanitarias para frenar los contagios de coronavirus.
México registra hasta el momento 296 muertos y 4,661 casos confirmados de coronavirus.
* Volkswagen México producirá hasta 90 respiradores médicos al día para paliar crisis por coronavirus
* Agreden en la Ciudad de México a personal médico para llevarse a familiar con coronavirus
* “A todos los extraterrestres que andan en las calles”, el llamado de la policía mexicana por coronavirus

'Seriously. Enough:' Chris Wallace's Fox News colleagues defend him after Trump attack

Resumen: "He’s the best Sunday show host of his time, and perhaps of all time," Brit Hume tweeted after the president called Chris Wallace a "wannabe."

Texto completo: Brit Hume, a senior political analyst at Fox News, defended his colleague Chris Wallace on social media Monday after President Donald Trump attacked the "Fox News Sunday" host in a scathing tweet.
"Just watched Mike Wallace wannabe, Chris Wallace, on @FoxNews," Trump said Sunday, referring to Wallace's late father, the former "60 Minutes" correspondent for CBS News and journalistic icon who died in 2012.
"I am now convinced that he is even worse than Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd of Meet the Press(please!), or the people over at Deface the Nation," Trump tweeted as he compared Wallace to the other Sunday morning hosts he frequently derides. "What the hell is happening to @FoxNews. It’s a whole new ballgame over there!"
In response to Trump's tweet, ProPublica reporter Jessica Huseman predicted that "not a single soul at Fox News will defend Chris Wallace, which says a lot. "
"I will," Hume fired back. "He’s the best Sunday show host of his time, and perhaps of all time. "
Huseman said Hume's defense would have been "more convincing if it were a condemnation of what Trump said rather than a compliment" to Wallace.
"Excuse me, but this was in response to your claim that no one at Fox would defend Chris Wallace. So I did, to which you replied that I should have condemned Trump. Please," Hume replied.
Trump vs. Fox: Donald Trump again hits Fox News – and Chris Wallace – this time over impeachment coverage
Hume was not the only Fox News personality to defend Wallace after Trump's attack.
"Chris is the best Sunday show interviewer hands down – he’s equally tough on left and right- and he’s a great talent to have on your team for election coverage or any debate – a true pro," Fox News Chief Political Anchor Bret Baier wrote in response to Huseman's tweet.
"Chris Wallace is tough and fair. He’s a very skilled, informed, determined questioner," tweeted contributor Guy Benson.
"Enough with the 3rd grade name-calling. Chris is doing his job," tweeted Jedediah Bila, who co-hosts "Fox & Friends" on the weekends. "The news should not be any president’s friend, ally, or buddy. If it bothered you when Obama complained about Fox News, but you’re silent on this complete nonsense, then just stop. Seriously. Enough. "
It was not clear what portion of "Fox News Sunday" this week caused the president to become unhappy with Wallace. His guests included Washington, D. C. , Mayor Muriel Bowser, Dr. Tom Inglesby, the director of Johns Hopkins University's Center for Health Security and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban.
Cuban expressed doubts about Trump's certainty that the economy would recover quickly from the shutdown caused by the virus. And Wallace asked Inglesby about a New York Times report that said Trump waited more than a month to act after being warned about the potential pandemic by health officials.
"If we had imposed social distancing, stay-at-home, at the end of January, and early February, would there be a dramatically . . . smaller number of cases and deaths?" Wallace asked.
It is also possible Trump was reacting to Wallace's comment during a Friday podcast that the president doesn't have "any chance to win" reelection if voters think he bungled the coronavirus outbreak response.
Trump has attacked Wallace on several other occasions on social media, calling the veteran journalist "nasty & obnoxious" in November, and he has negatively compared him to his deceased father as far back as 2015.
In October, Trump said Wallace "will never be his father. "
"He often likes to say about me, 'You know, I was covered by Mike Wallace, I liked him much more,'" Wallace said at a panel discussion in September, according to The New York Times. "To which my reaction is always: One of us has a daddy problem, and it’s not me. "
Hume has sometimes defended Trump since he took office and was a vocal critic of the news media's coverage of the allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian election interference. But he has also been critical of the president on several occasions.
Recently, he slammed Trump for posting "a ridiculous tweet" that boasted about the TV ratings for his White House Coronavirus Task Force briefings in response to a Wall Street Journal editorial that suggested he should take a less prominent role at the daily updates.
"He could get his views across without bragging, endlessly repeating himself, and getting into petty squabbles with the junior varsity players in the WH press corps," Hume tweeted. "And he could stop talking much sooner to give Pence, Fauci, Birx and Giroir more time. "
'Loser shows': Fox News personalities come to Neil Cavuto's defense after Trump's jabs
Though the president often praises Fox News – which features fiercely pro-Trump voices such as Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham, Jeanine Pirro, Maria Bartiromo and the hosts of "Fox & Friends" – he has frequently lashed out the network when it has aired anything critical of him or even just for granting his Democratic opponents airtime.
Dating back to the 2016 election, Trump has reacted to negative coverage of him on Fox News as a sort of betrayal by a network he assumed had his back.
Following an August interview with Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa on Fox News, Trump railed against anchor Sandra Smith for offering "zero pushback" and said the cable news network was "HOPELESS & CLUELESS!"
"The New @FoxNews is letting millions of GREAT people down! We have to start looking for a new News Outlet. Fox isn’t working for us anymore!" Trump tweeted.
"Fox News isn't supposed to work for you," Hume shot back.

Texto completo: Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is facing allegations of sexual assault from a former Senate aide, Tara Reade, The New York Times reported Sunday.
In a detailed report, The Times wrote that Reade has accused Biden of assaulting her in 1993 — an allegation that a Biden spokeswoman says is false.
Reade, 56, says she told others about it, The Times reported. During the course of reporting on this allegation, The Times said it found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Biden.
"No other allegation about sexual assault surfaced in the course of reporting, nor did any former Biden staff members corroborate any details of Ms. Reade's allegation," The Times wrote.
Reade told The Times that, in 1993, Biden "pinned her to a wall in a Senate building, reached under her clothing and penetrated her with his fingers."
Last year, Reade reportedly said publicly that Biden touched her inappropriately, but did not disclose these latest allegations of sexual assault. She was joined by a group of several women who came forward last year saying Biden touched them in ways that made them feel uncomfortable, like with hugs, kisses, or touching noses.
A little more than a year ago, Biden promised in a video to be more "mindful and respectful" while facing multiple allegations from women of unwanted and inappropriate behavior. He said at the time that his touching was about making a "human connection."
At the time of that video, Biden was about three weeks away from announcing his candidacy for president of the United States. Also around that time, The Union, a local California newspaper in Nevada County, reported Reade's initial complaints, which did not include the sexual assault allegation.
On Thursday, Reade filed a report with Washington, D.C., police saying she was the victim of a sexual assault in 1993, The Times reported. The report doesn't mention Biden by name, but Reade said the complaint was about him, according to The Times.
Biden is all but guaranteed the Democratic presidential nomination after Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Democratic socialist, announced on Wednesday that he was dropping out of the race.

Texto completo: In the 1957 Dr. Seuss book “How the Grinch Stole Christmas!,” the green anthropomorphic creature tries to steal a sacred holiday from the Whos living in Whoville. Taking their gifts and trees and decorations — even the roast beast! — the Grinch attempts to prevent Christmas from arriving.
The result? The Whos gather anyway to sing carols and remember the blessings they share rather than lamenting what they have lost. The Grinch's heart grows three sizes because of the Whos' unshakable faith, and he returns what he has stolen.
All of which seems relevant today as Christians celebrate Easter 2020 — a holiday unlike any we have previously experienced.
Arriving in the midst of a coronavirus pandemic that for weeks has shuttered businesses and gathering spots — including churches — this year's Easter is unprecedented. Families accustomed to a religious service followed by a celebratory meal are stuck at home to honor the occasion with only household members — or with virtual gatherings. Those for whom church attendance is a social outing are unable to partake in the typical camaraderie and communal experience.
Throughout Clark County — and throughout the world, for that matter — many churches are streaming their services on the internet. But there is a dichotomy that by being isolated we are sharing the same experience. Such are these unusual times.
As Esau McCaulley, a professor of New Testament at Wheaton College in Illinois, wrote in an opinion piece for The New York Times: “The church's absence, its literal emptying, can function as a symbol of its trust in God's ability to meet us regardless of the location. The church remains the church whether gathered or scattered. It might also indirectly remind us of the gift of gathering that we too often take for granted.”
While COVID-19 has attempted to steal Easter, for believers throughout the world the meaning of the holiday remains unaltered. It still is a celebration of hope driven by the belief that Jesus rose from the dead and provided the promise of everlasting life. It is the oldest and most meaningful holiday for Christians, dating in the Catholic Church to the year 326. It will take place again today — whether or not people are able to gather.
According to Pew Research Center, 61 percent of adults in the state of Washington self-identify as Christian. While we wish them an enjoyable and meaningful Easter celebration, we hope that all Clark County residents — regardless of their personal beliefs — can embrace the message of peace and hope that arrives during difficult times.
For Jewish people, that message is represented by the eight-day Passover celebration, which continues through Thursday. The celebration commemorates the liberation of the Israelites from Egyptian slavery and is believed to have evolved from a festival that predates the Exodus.
While the celebrations over the past week have been unusual, their meaning remains inviolate. Writes religion reporter Elizabeth Dias of The New York Times, “Religious ritual holds power not only because it connects people gathered in one space — it also connects people across time.”
That, perhaps, is the most meaningful aspect of this year's Easter celebration. It is a continuation of traditions that have lasted for millennia, through pandemic and pestilence and plague. And it shall take place again today.
The coronavirus has tried to steal Easter. Believers will

Texto completo: Alan A. Finder was a "masterful" reporter and editor, yet he "never felt he was better than anyone else," remembers colleague Martin Gottlieb, an editor at Newsday.
Finder was���a reporter for Newsday before he went on to work 28 years at The New York Times. He died March 24 at 72 after testing positive for COVID-19.
Times executive editor Dean Baquet called Finder,���who retired in December 2011, "a generous and patient colleague."
"He was one of Metro's stars in the 1980s and 1990s, a big writer in a big, hugely competitive era for New York City news,"���Baquet said.
Finder, who was living in Ridgewood, New Jersey, was born in Brooklyn���but grew up in Nassau County.
He received a bachelor's degree in history from the University of Rochester in 1969 and a master's���in American studies from Yale University in 1972.
He worked for The Record in Hackensack, New Jersey, from 1974 to 1979, then jopined Newsday. He worked as a reporter, covering local news, politics, energy and projects between 1979 and 1983 before heading to The Times.
There���he reported on a wide range of topics from City Hall to labor and education.���He also served as a sports enterprise editor and assistant editor on the foreign desk.
Gottlieb, who���worked with Finder at The Record, brought him back to Newsday as a freelance editor���on 2018's "Pathway to Power,"���which became an award-winning���investigation of the rise of Oheka Castle owner Gary Melius through "Long Island's cozy political system." Gottlieb called Finder "unflappable" and "masterful."
"He had a tremendous amount of humility, too, and he never felt he was better than anyone else," Gottlieb said.���"He was just a good soul."
Gottlieb and Newsday reporter Sandra Peddie said Finder played a key role���on the Melius project. Finder was initially slated to just be an extra set of eyes on the complex project���but ended up as the main editor when Gottlieb was sidelined by a medical emergency.
"We all came to appreciate his intelligence, his journalistic smarts and his sense of humor, Peddie recalled. "He really didn't let much rattle him, even the long commute he made from New Jersey to get to Long Island."���
"He was so down to earth ..."���she said. "The world is a much sadder place without him."
Finder left behind his wife, Elaine Isaacson, as well as daughter Lauren Elizabeth Drucker and son Jason Finder.

'Cannot repeat those mistakes': Biden knocks Trump administration for 'failure to plan' for pandemic

Texto completo: Joe Biden criticized the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus pandemic in an opinion piece for the New York Times.
In the Sunday piece, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee detailed how he would start to reopen the United States as cases of the COVID-19 virus begin to level off. In his closing remarks, he knocked the Trump administration for its "failure to plan" for the pandemic.
"As we prepare to reopen America, we have to remember what this crisis has taught us: The administration’s failure to plan, to prepare, to honestly assess and communicate the threat to the nation led to catastrophic results," Biden wrote. "We cannot repeat those mistakes."
He continued, "We know what we have to do. We have the tools, expertise and, now, hard-won experience. The American people have already paid too high a price in illness, death and economic loss. This time, the White House has to get it right."
Several others have criticized President Trump's handling of the pandemic. The New York Times recently outlined the president's response based on warnings he received in January from some members of his administration, who along with other public health officials felt he should have pushed for social distancing much earlier rather than downplaying the severity of the virus with optimistic goals, such as reopening by Easter.
While Biden claimed the Trump administration didn't prepare for a pandemic, the president has continued to make the same argument about the Obama-Biden administration. Trump has repeatedly blamed his predecessor for leaving national stockpiles of ventilators below capacity. He also blamed previous administrations for implementing regulations that slowed the ability to roll out testing kits from private companies that could be confirmed by the states, rather than federal authorities.
After originally criticizing the decision as xenophobic, Biden did agree with Trump that it was a good decision to close travel from China to the U.S. when the outbreak started. The two also shared a phone call to discuss the pandemic last week, which both reported was a friendly exchange.
In his opinion piece, the former vice president noted that Trump has yet to release a plan for reopening after the pandemic. He wrote, "Millions are performing essential services at great personal risk, and millions more are staying at home, away from friends and extended family. In return, they want the answer to a simple question: What is the plan to safely reopen America? So far, the Trump administration hasn’t supplied an answer."
The finger-pointing between the two administrations, however, doesn't change the current reality of the pandemic. As of Sunday, the U.S. had more than 542,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 21,489 related deaths. More than 17 million U.S. citizens are newly jobless because of the coronavirus shutdown.

New York Times criticized for editing out Biden sexual misconduct allegations over 'imprecise language'

Texto completo: The New York Times issued a tweet explaining why it removed a line from an article highlighting accusations of sexual misconduct against Joe Biden.
In the Sunday article, the New York Times examined the sexual assault allegations against Biden from his former staffer Tara Reade. Reade accused Biden of placing his hand up her skirt and penetrating her with his fingers in 1992 while she worked in his senate office. The report noted that Reade was the only woman to accuse Biden of sexual assault.
"No other allegation about sexual assault surfaced in the course of reporting, nor did any former Biden staff members corroborate any details of Ms. Reade’s allegation," the authors, Lisa Lerer and Sydney Ember, wrote, adding, "The Times found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Biden."
However, that paragraph had been changed from a previous version of the story, in which the second sentence read, "The Times found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Biden, beyond the hugs, kisses and touching that women previously said made them uncomfortable."
Without an editor's note explaining the situation, the New York Times edited the paragraph to exclude multiple allegations of sexual misconduct against Biden, including the accusation from former Nevada state Assemblywoman Lucy Flores, who was one of several women to speak out against Biden for making them feel uncomfortable by sniffing their hair, hugging them from behind, or otherwise touching them in an unwelcome manner.
A quote from Flores was included in the original story. The New York Times also noted that it had spoken with women who came forward with stories similar to Flores and who said that they believed Reade's accusations against Biden.
Several people condemned the New York Times for both its original language and for editing out a part of the story that could benefit Biden. In response, the newspaper released a statement on Twitter, writing, "We've deleted a tweet in this thread that had some imprecise language that has been changed in the story."
Tweet
An editor's note has not yet been added to the piece, however, and many found the outlet's clarification to be insufficient. Several took to Twitter to criticize the outlet for its decisions.
TweetTweetTweet
The Biden campaign has denied Reade's accusations of sexual assault. Kate Bedingfield, a spokeswoman for the campaign, said, "Women have a right to tell their story, and reporters have an obligation to rigorously vet those claims. We encourage them to do so because these accusations are false."

Bret Stephens: COVID-19 and the Big Government problem

Texto completo: Katie Wilson, a deputy undersecretary at the Department of Agriculture in the Obama administration, is the executive director of the Urban School Food Alliance, a nonprofit that works with the country’s largest school districts to improve the quality of student nutrition. Her topmost concern is with the millions of poorer children and their families for whom school meals are essential to diets and budgets alike.
In this pandemic, she has a message for government bureaucrats in Washington and every state capital: Stop getting in the way.
I spoke with Wilson on Thursday as the districts she works with were dealing with a crisis that in weeks has cascaded from lockdowns and school closures to mass unemployment and massive food insecurity. Adaptability, responsiveness, improvisation and foresight are of the essence.
It’s a big ask of big government.
The USDA didn’t have any trouble responding to school closures by switching to summer feeding programs. And Congress knew enough to give the department authority to waive some of the regulatory requirements. But, says Wilson, “Every waiver has layers and layers and layers on it.
“To get a waiver each district has to apply to the state,” she notes. “The state has to decide whether to accept it. If they agree, then they have to apply to the USDA. If the USDA says yes, the state can get the waiver, the district can get the waiver, but then the state has to interpret how you do it.”
Example: Oregon applied to the USDA for an area-eligibility waiver so it could provide food for needy families living in non-poor areas. The department allowed the waiver, with the requirement, Wilson says, that each school district would have to work with a state agency “to develop a plan as to how they are going to target the most-needy students.”
But as the economy collapses, the need keeps growing, and nobody can be sure who the “most needy” students will be. Desperate school districts have their right arm chained to bureaucratic dead weight — and their left to a horseman of the apocalypse.
It’s not just USDA. From 2007 to 2019, the total number of employees in the Food and Drug Administration increased by nearly 80% to more than 17,000 employees, according to a Cato Institute report. That includes nearly 500 additional workers to review the safety of medical devices.
Has it helped? In March, Julia Ioffe wrote a must-read account in GQ of the FDA’s almost-comical mishandling of an effort to roll out coronavirus test kits. First the FDA approved a flawed test. Then it stymied an effective test by requiring its developer to submit his request not only electronically but also mailed in paper and via thumb drive. Then the FDA demanded that the developer see if his test worked against other coronaviruses. Then the FDA shut down a testing regime developed by the Seattle Flu Study because it lacked the correct licensing requirements.
Congress also had to overturn FDA regulations in order to permit hospitals to purchase N95 masks previously approved only for industrial use. The country may need billions of such masks now. But as Reason magazine reported last month, federal regulators have told one would-be manufacturer that certification and approval might take between 45 and 90 days.
And this is government operating in an emergency . On Tuesday, New York City’s Health Department sent a stern letter to health providers, warning that there are no approved blood tests for use at point-of-care facilities to check for coronavirus antibodies and that use of such tests “may result in regulatory action.” Everyone knows tests are far from perfect. But they are urgently needed to track the disease and could have been widely available in the U.S. weeks ago. Approval is now expected in a few days, which should at least raise a question about the point of delay.
Does all of this mean that we would have been better off without any government regulation at all? Obviously not. But it says something that among the most important steps taken in recent months to advance public safety has been to waive regulations enacted in the name of public safety. The effectiveness of government is rarely correlated to its size. In this crisis, the correlation has often been inverse.
Philip K. Howard, author of “Try Common Sense,” has the right idea for turning this around, both for the pandemic and the arduous economic recovery that will follow. In City Journal, he proposes a Recovery Authority at both the federal and state levels. The aim is to reduce paperwork burdens, enable one-stop permit shopping, pare uneconomical work rules, provide permanent legal approval to crisis measures that work and otherwise lift the burdens of “thousand-page rulebooks dictating precisely how to achieve public goals.”
Cutting back on big government is not an end in itself. The goals are to give individuals the chance to take responsibility, local initiatives the chance to flourish, and common sense the chance to reign. In the fight against COVID-19 and its aftermath, we also have a chance to get government to work better — starting by getting it out of the way.

Texto completo: Special to the Star Tribune
The mystique surrounding Minneapolis native David Carr has grown since his death, at 58, in 2015. He now bears the complex aura of devoted friend and mentor, tough editor, redeemed junkie, author of the bestselling memoir "The Night of the Gun" and celebrated "face" of the New York Times, where his intelligence, compassion and humor won the admiration of peers. We have sorely needed the grounding provided by "Final Draft," in which his widow gathers more than 50 features and other pieces written throughout Carr's 25-year career.
David Carr was a quintessential journalist, with an endless curiosity about life.
In sentences "as clear and straight as spring water," to borrow a phrase from Rudyard Kipling, he wrote about media, politics, popular culture and other topics with an honest, often blunt, sometimes biting style that eviscerated phoniness, especially when it besmirched the craft he loved. He lambasted TV talk shows for welcoming the "pirate sensibilities" of Ann Coulter because "seeing hate speech pop out of a blonde who knows her way around a black cocktail dress makes for compelling viewing." He called the New Republic in its plagiarism-plagued years a "hotbed of adolescently malevolent con artists with notepads."
But in lengthy profiles, he could embrace gifted celebrities, often addicts, with understanding: "serial relapser" Robert Downey Jr. and his "romance with mind-altering chemicals," Neil Young, whose "brokenness has annealed rather than slowed him" at age 66, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, who "got in the ring with his addiction and battled it for two decades successfully."
The articles, arranged chronologically, trace Carr's work from his days as a writer and editor in Minnesota in the 1980s, at the Twin Cities Reader, Family Times and elsewhere, including personal accounts of a fishing trip with addicts from Eden House, his battles with cancer and his friendship with comedian Tom Arnold. Twin Cities journalism fills one-third of the book.
In 1995, Carr moved on to editing Washington City Paper, where he mentored Ta-Nehisi Coates (who provides a warm foreword) and demonstrated his versatility by profiling singer Lucinda Williams and parsing a badly reported account of suburban preteen oral sex.
As media columnist for the New York Times beginning in 2000, Carr wrote about Bill Cosby's enablers (including Carr himself) who ignored the comic's harassment of women, Fox News, the Chicago Tribune, Julian Assange and the rise of digital publishing. There are also deeply reported stories from the Atlantic (on the dubious value of homeland security) and New York Magazine as well as lighter outings on cats and commuting.
In an unexpected gift to young journalists, the book contains the engaging syllabus for a communications class Carr taught at Boston University in 2014. Filled with knockout reading lists, the 12-page outline offers Carr's credo: "Who you are and what you have been through should give you a prism on life that belongs to you only."
His own hard-won prism illuminates much of this gratifying book.

Texto completo: Mort Drucker, a longtime contributor to Mad magazine known for his caricatures of actors, politicians and other celebrities, died Wednesday at his home in Woodbury, New York. He was 91.
His longtime friend, John Reiner, confirmed the death.
Drucker, who specialized in illustrating Mad's movie and television satires, inspired several generations of cartoonists. "To me, he's the guy," caricaturist Drew Friedman said. "I used to imitate his work in Mad when I was a kid. I wanted to be Mort Drucker; I even loved his name."
Drucker's facility was best expressed in multi-caricature crowd scenes. His parody of the 1986 Woody Allen film, "Hannah and Her Sisters," opened with a panel depicting a Thanksgiving dinner that, in addition to most of the movie's ensemble cast, included caricatures of Allen's first wife, Louise Lasser; film critics Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel; Mayor Ed Koch of New York; and Mad's mascot, Alfred E. Neuman.
His drawing for a 1970 Time magazine cover, "Battle for the Senate," now in the National Portrait Gallery, featured a pileup of 15 individually characterized political figures, including President Richard Nixon and Vice President Spiro Agnew.
Mad's takeoff on the MGM retrospective feature "That's Entertainment," published in 1975, required Drucker to caricature more than two dozen stars.
"I think I've drawn almost everyone in Hollywood," he told The New York Times in 2000.
Some of Drucker's most inventive works were double satires. The 1963 Mad piece "East Side Story" is a parody of "West Side Story" as played out by prominent international figures. Nikita Khrushchev, Fidel Castro and Charles de Gaulle are among the many world leaders drawn cavorting against photographed backdrops of New York City streets. "It's a Blunderful Life," published in 1996, updated "It's a Wonderful Life" to star Nixon as Bill Clinton's guardian angel.
A self-taught freelance cartoonist who had worked on war, western, science fiction and romance comic books as well as personality-driven titles like The Adventures of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis and The Adventures of Bob Hope, Drucker came to Mad in late 1956, soon after Al Feldstein succeeded Harvey Kurtzman, the magazine's founder, as editor. Mad had run only occasional TV and movie satires, but Drucker's arrival "changed everything," pop-culture critic Grady Hendrix wrote in a 2013 Film Comment appreciation of Mad's movie parodies.
"No one saw Drucker's talent," Hendrix wrote, until he illustrated "The Night That Perry Masonmint Lost a Case," a takeoff on the television courtroom drama "Perry Mason," in 1959. It was then, Hendrix maintained, that "the basic movie parody format for the next 44 years was born."
From the early 1960s on, nearly every issue of Mad included a movie parody, and before Drucker retired he had illustrated 238, more than half of them. The last one, "The Chronic-Ills of Yawnia: Prince Thespian," appeared in 2008.
Drucker compared his method to creating a movie storyboard: "I become the 'camera,' " he once said, "and look for angles, lighting, close-ups, wide angles, long shots -- just as a director does to tell the story in the most visually interesting way he can."
Hendrix called Drucker "the cartoonist's equivalent of an actor's director" and "a master of drawing hands, faces and body language." Friedman praised Drucker's restraint: "He wasn't really hung up on exaggerating. He was far more subtle and nuanced -- interested in how people stood and so on."
Drucker was modest about his gifts. "When I started working for Mad, they assigned me TV satires and asked me to draw famous people," he recalled. "It took me a long time to learn the skills I have, and it was time-consuming. With me, everything is trial and error."
Morris Drucker was born on March 22, 1929, in Brooklyn. His father, Edward, was a businessman who repaired jukeboxes and ran a bar, among other things. His mother, Sarah (Spielvogel) Drucker, was a homemaker. He attended Erasmus Hall High School, where he met his future wife, Barbara Hellerman.
His survivors include his wife; two daughters, Laurie Bachner and Melanie Amsterdam; and three grandchildren.
Drucker began his professional career at 18 when, recommended by cartoonist Will Eisner, a family friend, he got a job assisting on the comic book Debbie Dean, Career Girl. He also worked on a syndicated single-panel strip, "The Mountain Boys," before finding steady work with National Periodical Publications, now known as DC Comics. He continued to freelance for DC even after joining Mad's "usual gang of idiots."
Working in a studio at his home in Woodbury, on Long Island, he also drew magazine illustrations, album covers, movie posters and advertisements.

Texto completo: Recently, during C2E2 at McCormick Place, the Random House imprint Del Rey, which publishes Lucasfilm-licensed "Star Wars" books, made an unusual choice and offered the novelization of "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker" three weeks early. And so, visitors to the Chicago comic con bought up hundreds of copies, within a few hours.
Then, hours after that, though the movie version of "Rise of Skywalker" was months old, it began trending again across social media: Excerpts from the book were posted, and though everyone had seen the film and knew the story and long ago decided if they loved or hated it, there was a shock of revelation -- as if they didn't know the story at all.
Wait, Emperor Palpatine was a ... what?
Hold on, Lando Calrissian's daughter was ... who?
None of those details were explained clearly by the movie, just the novelization. And now a very roil-ready fandom was roiled again: Did this mean the novelization was better then the film? Or that the movie was actually even worse than they had thought?
A better question would have been: They still make movie novelizations?
Yup, they do. Bunches of them.
Novelizations are, in essence, book-length descriptions of movies, typically written not by the author of the screenplay. They are the complete opposite of the more familiar practice of turning a book into a movie. They probably sound counterintuitive. But the recent "Sonic the Hedgehog" movie adaptation of the "Sonic" video game received a novelization. Pixar's animated "Onward" got one, too. So did the new Vin Diesel action flick "Bloodshot," and the Will Smith dud "Gemini Man." Even the quickie horror film "Happy Death Day," and its sequel, have novelizations. That new "Rise of Skywalker" novelization? It debuted last week on The New York Times hardcover bestseller list at No. 5.
It's a quirk of publishing.
A genre that largely consists of 250-page descriptions of movies the authors had not actually seen yet. A marketing niche that once found its spiritual home in spinning wire racks at drugstores. An alternate universe where E.T. appears romantically attracted to Elliott's mother, books are adapted from films that are adapted themselves from Charles Dickens' classics and the storylines of "Transformers" movies actually seem coherent.
It's a place of oddball contortions, where a serious author like Evanston's Daniel Kraus can dream up the story of the Oscar-winning movie "The Shape of Water" with that film's director, Guillermo del Toro, but the filmmaker writes the screenplay while the author pieces together the novelization, using the screenplay as his primary road map.
(Kraus describes the book as "beyond a novelization," and more akin to the way Arthur C. Clarke collaborated with Stanley Kubrick on the novel for "2001: A Space Odyssey.")
See, movies are adaptations of screenplays.
But novelizations are adaptations of movies, and therefore not the most loved form of literature. Albeit, one that often allows some tinkering by the author, who may deliver a version of a movie where interior thoughts of even the most fleeting role are given fresh weight. You might be surprised to know that, somewhere out there, probably gathering dust in an attic, or sitting waterlogged in a summer cottage, there are novelizations of everything from "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" to "Friday the 13th" movies to the Arnold Schwarzenegger comedy "Jingle All the Way." There exists in the world (and this is no joke) a 128-page novelization of the Mike Myers movie adapting Dr. Seuss' "Cat in the Hat."
It probably goes without saying that the novelization is an ancient marketing practice that somehow managed, like Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster, to sidestep progress.
Its heyday was before the age of streaming and DVDs. "There was a time the only way to take home a favorite film or television series was through a novel adaptation," said Steve Saffel, senior acquisitions editor at Titan Books, the leading publisher of novelizations. Even as home video took off in the '80s, the genre made some sense.
At C2E2, Rae Carson, author of the "Rise of Skywalker" novelization, recalled her love for the 1983 novelization of "Return of the Jedi": "I was 10 years old and read it at a time in my life when I lived in pretty abject poverty. I could not afford to go to movies and the book came out a little before the movie. Since I knew we couldn't afford to go to the movie, I begged my mother to get a copy at the library." She said "the writing was smooth, the pacing great." She read it three times, before eventually seeing the movie.
That author was James Kahn, then a 36-year-old emergency room doctor from Chicago. He was also, like many writers of novelizations, already an established writer of science fiction. He had grown up in Hyde Park and Des Plaines, attended the University of Chicago and was working at a Los Angeles hospital when he got an unusual phone call:
"It was this woman named Kathleen Kennedy. She wanted to know how to resuscitate an alien. Of course, we found out this Kathleen Kennedy (now president of Lucasfilm) was producing 'E.T.' with Steven Spielberg. She invited a bunch of doctors to the set and dressed us in hazmat suits. I already had a novel published by Del Rey so I gave Spielberg a copy and asked him to make the movie. He said he'd get to it, then the next day he told me my book was already in his office and he wouldn't make a movie but he needed someone to novelize 'Poltergeist' -- the catch was I had one month. I found people to cover my shifts for a solid month and then I sat in a conference room at Spielberg's MGM offices with a copy of the script and production stills. He ended up loving the work so much I got to do 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' and 'The Goonies.' When George Lucas needed someone for 'Jedi,' Spielberg suggested me."
Kahn has written 12 books. That "Return of the Jedi" novelization from 37 years ago remains his high-water mark, reaching No. 1 on The New York Times bestseller list.
But it's not his galaxy.
Authors, particularly of sci-fi and fantasy, revel in world building, constructing universes from scratch. But a novelization is a sandbox already occupied by someone else's toys.
Matthew Stover, who lives in Danville, wrote the novelization for the 2005 "Star Wars" prequel "Revenge of the Sith." Like Kahn, though he's written more than a dozen books, all sci-fi and fantasy, his "Star Wars" novelization is his sales peak. "The truth is, I didn't really want to do any media tie-ins. I wanted to do my own stuff. And what I discovered was, if you take it seriously, you are doing your own stuff. I see it like this: You go to a friend's house, he has a Lego set, you see what you could do with it. And so you do, but ultimately, those are his blocks, he can take it apart however he wants. It's not so bad."
Novelizations have lousy reputations.
They are often seen as derivative, sub-literate promotional material, a genre pounded out by hack writers being paid to somehow pad a 20,000-word script into a 60,000 word paperback. So whatever endurance the novelization has, Stover said, "is thanks to one guy, Alan Dean Foster, the godfather of novelizations. His book for 'Alien' alone is a lesson, it adds so much to the movie without feeling like a retelling of the same story."
Foster, now 73, living in Arizona, wrote the novelization for the first "Star Wars" movie, and "Alien," and the "Transformer" movies, and a "Terminator" film, and "The Thing," and the original "Clash of the Titans" -- and many, many others. Later this year he has a memoir about his life as a novelizer, "The Director Should've Shot You," which takes its title from his time on the set of the Vin Diesel film, gathering information for the novel.
He likes to point out that people win Oscars for adapting screenplays into films (or for adapting books into screenplays that are adapted into films), but somehow the author who transforms a skeletal screenplay into a novel is seen as a hack. He said he never thought of the novelization as trash. He said he's only read good books and bad books.
"I'm sure Rembrandt didn't want to spend his life painting fat businessmen. Brahms wrote an overture based on a German drinking song. Artists have done great work on commission, because a source is one thing, but what you do with it is something else."
That novelization of "Alien," for instance, was written without his ever having seen, well, the Alien. The studio 20th Century Fox would not provide him one image of its monster.
Likewise, Greg Cox, who had an unlikely 2014 New York Times bestseller with his novelization of "Godzilla," didn't actually see what the latest Godzilla looked like until he saw the movie in his neighborhood multiplex. "Which is often the main struggle of this line of work. Just getting the visuals. You have to pry this stuff out of (studios), even as you're working for them. I did the novelization for 'Man of Steel,' the Superman movie. I know what a farm in Kansas looks like, and I know what the Daily Planet newsroom looks like. But a 'Kryptonian birthing chamber'? So I get on the phone with Warner Bros., begging them to explain a Kryptonian birthing chamber. Scripts never describe enough."
The genre comes out of a time when movie theaters hadn't reached every city yet -- but actually, according to Grady Hendrix, a film historian and author who has reviewed novelizations ("Book Reviews of the Damned") online, believes the novelization dates back even further, to the 17th century practice of novelizing stage plays. "Then throughout the 19th century, because theater was limited by geography, perhaps people in Chicago wanted to know the latest hit. There were novelizations of shows with photo inserts. Even after cinema was invented, movies didn't play everywhere, and what if you missed one?" So silent films occasionally had novelizations; later, the novelization of "King Kong" became part of Random House's venerable Modern Library line of classics.
Though not until novelizations of episodic TV series like "Star Trek" and "Dark Shadows" did the genre become routine. By the late '70s, Foster's novelizations of "Star Wars" and "Alien" were blockbusters; novelizations of "E.T." and "Gladiator" had similar sales.
These days the novelization more closely resembles a step on an evolutionary ladder that includes marketing, fan fiction, recaps of TV shows and the sort of "expanded universes" that allowed room for new James Bond novels long after creator Ian Fleming died in 1964. "Growing up in Chicago," Kahn said, "I didn't even know novelizations existed. On the other hand, I was writing since I was nine and you know what I was writing? I loved comic books, I would imagine the twists that they didn't include, and so I would rewrite them into my notebooks. I had a creative impulse to transform the story."
This June, for instance, Evanston's Kraus has "The Living Dead," a new novel, co-authored with filmmaker George Romero, creator of the original "Night of the Living Dead." Romero, who died in 2017 and virtually invented the modern zombie, had written about a third of the 600-page book and left notes for more, which Kraus then fleshed out through research and interviews. "There was this great feeling of responsibility towards George. The man himself isn't here to bounce ideas off. But limitations are wonderful. Everything I write I try to install limitations, they force you to work creatively."
Carson said that, after she read the script to "Rise of Skywalker," she drew up a list of ways that she wanted to expand on the story; Stover said that after he interviewed Lucas for three hours about the "Sith" screenplay, he asked how much of Lucas' dialogue should be used verbatim.
Turns out, even within a franchise as large as "Star Wars," there's often room for invention. Partly, several of the novelizers said, there's no time for writer's block. Many regard it as a creative challenge -- indeed, playwright David Rabe, who wrote the novelization for Sean Penn's 1995 film "The Crossing Guard," has said he thought of movie novelizing as similar to the creative-writing prompts that MFA programs use. He's also far from the only celebrated writer to punch above his weight here: Paul Monette, known for his memoirs about coming out and AIDS, wrote the novelization for Werner Herzog's "Nosferatu," Brian DePalma and Oliver Stone's "Scarface" and the Schwarzenegger movie "Predator." Sylvester Stallone, despite having won an Oscar for his "Rocky" screenplay, followed it a couple of years later by writing both the screenplay and novelization for "Rocky II."
The drawbacks, of course, are not minor.
Saffel at Titan said they try to give writers a year to prepare, but three months is common. A few weeks is even more common. "We're part of merchandising a film," Foster said, "like beach towels and McDonald's cups, and we're treated as such." There is an International Association of Media Tie-In Writers, to promote the profession, cofounded by Max Allan Collins, author of the Nathan Heller thrillers and the graphic novel "The Road to Perdition," which Collins novelized himself when it was adapted into a Tom Hanks film. But Carson described writing "Rise of Skywalker" as daily 15- to 20-page bursts. Typically, the work is fast, tough -- and prone to disconnected filmmakers.
Cox said, "A friend of mine who edits these books once said that the more confusing the movie seemed to audiences, the better the novelizations of that movie tend to sell."
Foster said the greatest compliment a movie novelizer can hear is "I wish they had filmed your book." The first movie he adapted into a novel was an Italian Tarzan rip-off. Ballantine Books owned the rights and asked him to do it. He was young, he pounced. And they screened the movie for him, without subtitles. Then he went home and worried about what to do, until he saw the posters for the marketing campaign and he started.
"Essentially what happened was, I novelized a poster. Best part, a week after the book comes out, someone at Disney calls the publisher and asks to buy the movie rights."

Texto completo: A rare show that retooled and flourished after its New York debut, the musical, a decade later, has endured in schools and through international productions.
The Broadway reviews for "The Addams Family" were gruesome -- the kind of notices that, in theory, could kill a show.
Panning it in The New York Times, Ben Brantley described it as a "tepid goulash of vaudeville song-and-dance routines, Borscht Belt jokes, stingless sitcom zingers and homey romantic plotlines that were mossy in the age of 'Father Knows Best."' The musical, he persevered, was "most distinctive for its wholesale inability to hold on to a consistent tone or an internal logic."
Yet "The Addams Family," which opened on Broadway 10 years ago this month with Nathan Lane as Gomez Addams and Bebe Neuwirth as his beloved Morticia, refused to succumb. Cushioned by a bountiful box-office advance, it ran for 20 months -- shorter than hoped for a starry show based on beloved characters, but hardly a flameout.
Then things got interesting. Becoming one of the rare shows that retool and flourish after their New York debut, the musical has proved an enduring hit in youth and community theater productions and has played in more than three dozen countries.
"It's our best seller by volume of production," said Steve Spiegel, the president and C.E.O. of Theatrical Rights Worldwide, which licenses the show in several formats, including a 30-minute version for elementary school performers, and is eyeing the possibility of a sequel by the same authors. "In the last five years, 'Addams Family' was the No. 1-produced high school show four of those years, and the other year it was No. 2."
What "The Addams Family" became isn't what the producer Stuart Oken had in mind when he tapped Phelim McDermott and Julian Crouch, the British creators of the artfully macabre "Shockheaded Peter," to direct and design, teaming them with the Broadway veterans Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice ("Jersey Boys") and the composer-lyricist Andrew Lippa ("Big Fish").
Oken, who called the project "the biggest missed opportunity of my professional life," blames himself for that ill-advised creative marriage and the rocky path that followed.
A former executive vice president at Disney Theatrical, Oken said he had hoped that a "nonprofit artist attack on a piece of mainstream, well-known material" would ignite "The Addams Family" the way that Julie Taymor did "The Lion King." Instead, he found himself calling for emergency show-doctoring by the director Jerry Zaks -- a four-time Tony Award winner and longtime Lane collaborator -- to get the production to New York.
Signs of trouble emerged at the musical's out-of-town tryout in Chicago. When it opened there, to great anticipation in December 2009, the Chicago Tribune critic Chris Jones judged it "overly weighty," lacking humor, spontaneity and narrative focus. To fix it, the creative team had only four months -- not enough time.
Two years later, though, Jones proclaimed the much-revised touring production "infinitely better than the Broadway version" -- "enjoyable if visually simplified," "less ambitious" yet charming, built for old-fashioned fun.
Oken, who lead-produced "The Addams Family" with Roy Furman, said he is proud of the shape that the musical -- based on the drolly dark single-panel cartoons of Charles Addams rather than on their campily mainstream TV and film spinoffs -- eventually found.
"But it's a different show than what we set out to do," Oken said. "A very different show."
Oken, the writers and two others from that original production -- Jackie Hoffman, who played Grandma, and the producer Eva Price ("Tina"; "Jagged Little Pill"), who a decade ago was a novice co-producer -- spoke in separate phone interviews about their experiences of the show. These excerpts have been edited and condensed.
The First Try
STUART OKEN (lead producer) I thought we were going to do something dangerous.
ANDREW LIPPA (composer and lyricist) We were given access to all of the original drawings, and that's where we drew all our inspiration from.
OKEN I thought this was the kind of property where I should take a risk, and that the property was muscular enough to stand up to it.
EVA PRICE (co-producer) It felt like it was stacked with that wonderful combination of broad commercial appeal and creative artfulness. It smelled right in all of its ways.
MARSHALL BRICKMAN (book writer) We had to have the song with the clicks in it, the snaps. There was a lot of metaphysical discussion of whether that should come at the beginning of the show or whether it should be saved for the end. You don't want to violate too much audience expectation with a brand name.
RICK ELICE (book writer) What we discovered, rather too late (laughs), was that even by 2010, the idea of going out of town so that you could be under the radar was impossible. Anything with Nathan Lane in it is going to be high-profile. Anything with Bebe Neuwirth. Everybody was there at the first preview. I think before the overture was over, there were already chat rooms. Everybody's thumbs were exhausted by the intermission.
PRICE It got pretty tough reviews in Chicago and really disappointed industry people, so that was very worrisome.
OKEN There were problems in the company, there were relationship issues that we were struggling with and the material needed a lot more work. I didn't think we could achieve it without making a change. By making a change, I was basically giving up the thing that I kind of thought I was trying to do. I put it in the hands of an experienced showman who could help get me out of trouble. And that's when Jerry came in. Julian Crouch, the designer, stayed with the production. Phelim departed.
JACKIE HOFFMAN (actress) It's a shame, because if we kept that director, what would the vision have been? It was great that I got to meet and have a relationship with Jerry. But it certainly was emotionally difficult, and it was very awkward. But, you know, it's show business, not "show love."
OKEN I thought the joy of it would be in the cleverness of the way it was done. But it turned out it wasn't enough. It became a star-driven vehicle. It just morphed differently.
The Broadway Run
ELICE It was the spring that "Spider-Man" was supposed to open, which was the great big event of the season. Then we were going to come in after that and just be a musical comedy. "Spider-Man" postponed, and so there we were. Because it was a big show, and it was the only one suddenly, it received a certain kind of attention that it was never meant to shoulder.
LIPPA It's a very public forum, writing a Broadway musical. If you're going to play in the big leagues, as it were, you have to learn how to tune out the voices that you don't necessarily want to listen to.
HOFFMAN Nothing really prepared us for the unleashing of absolute cruelty and vitriol when the New York press got wind of it.
PRICE One of the most enlightening moments of my producing career was the day after opening night in New York, where Stuart Oken and Roy Furman laid out the disastrous New York Times review that we all read the night before. That team started that ad meeting reading the terrible first paragraph, and then the terrible first paragraph of the "Mamma Mia!" review and of the "Les Miz" review and of the "Wicked" review and of the "Cats" review -- all these hit shows. It was very encouraging, because we were like, "You're right, it's not over."
HOFFMAN It only really affects you as a performer if the audiences are affected. There were a couple of nights where you felt from the audience, "Well, I kind of like it, but I'm not supposed to." I mean, people are very, very affected by reviews. They shouldn't be, but unfortunately they are.
ELICE I was in the elevator in my building with some neighbors who live on a lower floor. The woman said, "Well, we just came from 'The Addams Family.' What a disaster." Fortunately for me, the elevator opened and they got out. The next morning, under my door was a note: "Oh my God, I'm so embarrassed. When we got out of the elevator, my husband said, 'You idiot. He wrote it.' So I just want you to know I'm really sorry for being so rude. But we would like our money back." My husband, who was a wonderful actor and a great human being, said, "I want you to write her a check right now."
OKEN Even though the show ran 20 months and recouped a big chunk of its money on Broadway, it was hard. It was a hard experience.
HOFFMAN It gave me a lot of material for a Joe's Pub show. I just stood there and read excerpts from reviews, especially the one that called me hunched over, shrill and irritating.
BRICKMAN We did like 700 performances, which is not chopped liver. It wasn't a total embarrassment. I think that's a triumph in this business.
The Afterlife
BRICKMAN We learned a lot on Broadway. A piece, in a sense, tells you what it wants to be. And the audience tells you what it would be willing to accept.
LIPPA By 2011, we were still running on Broadway and planning our national tour, and Stuart said, "We have the resources to help if you guys want to make changes. What would you like to do?"
ELICE This never happens.
OKEN I said I didn't want to do the tour if we were just going to leave it incomplete.
LIPPA We ripped apart our show. We looked at the central conflict, and we looked at the score, and where we could make improvements.
ELICE We rewrote it to make the show more about the characters, not just the family characters but the new characters that we introduced to make it less bizarre and more human. Broadly, that was the trick.
OKEN We made three song changes, I think, between Chicago and New York, and then made four more between New York and the tour.
ELICE In the summer of '11, we all moved down to New Orleans and spent five weeks down there, as though it were a brand-new show. By the time we started playing in New Orleans, we felt like we had finally something akin to what we had originally started thinking about way back in 2007, 2008.
OKEN The DNA was still the DNA that was captured at the very beginning, and that made the first tryout and made the New York production. We had the hindsight of a deep breath and the ability to kind of be ruthless with our own work.
LIPPA The version of the show that is seen all over the world and has played to millions of people is the version that we made for the national tour.
OKEN We were so comfortable together as a creative team doing the last version of the show. Maybe it's because Broadway had passed, a little of the craving had passed, the hurt had passed. I thought the Australian production was unbelievable. Then we did the same thing in Buenos Aires. It was just a wonderful feeling to know that could happen.
LIPPA I only hoped that I would make something I was proud of. And ultimately I did.
BRICKMAN I have no regrets about it. The thing is still alive. That's ridiculous.
LIPPA The singular joy of "The Addams Family" is that in the 10 years since we've made it, the world has echoed back that they like what we've done.

Texto completo: In this week's column, Sarah Firshein investigates the ever-changing refund policies offered by travel companies.
Travel and travel planning are being disrupted by the worldwide spread of the coronavirus. For the latest updates, read The New York Times's Covid-19 coverage here .
Dear Tripped Up,
Last September I booked a Japan tour with Abercrombie & Kent, scheduled to leave at the end of March. Three tickets came to more than $ 46,000, without airfare. What happens when you book your dream trip, only to confront travel restrictions and an exploding global pandemic? Nancy
Dear Nancy,
Last September, around the time you must have been booking your Japan trip, I took my first-ever surfing lesson in Barbados. Bobbing in the gentle, beginner-friendly bay, I learned the sport is all about timing: If you can't get ahead of the wave, you'll end up watching it thunder ashore without you.
The same goes for writing about travel amid the daily-changing coronavirus pandemic.
My original response to your question, which had been scheduled for the third week of March, included a detailed run-down about how tour operators work. I spoke to Abercrombie & Kent and even got you a credit -- yes, the full $ 46,000.
The day the column was set to go to print, Abercrombie & Kent announced it was suspending all of its tours until (at least) the end of April. Its new, more flexible policies would have given you a $ 46,000 credit anyway. Much of what I wrote no longer applied, and to run it wouldn't have been fair. I've never been so happy to see one of my own pieces get "killed."
Since the end of January, when the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency (six weeks before the term pandemic was applied), scores of Times readers have come forward with questions like yours. Then came three tectonic shifts in rapid succession: President Trump suspending travel from Europe for a month, the State Department issuing its highest travel advisory (Level 4, or "Do Not Travel"), and countries all around the world closing their borders.
The travel industry scrambled to keep up. Caveats and exclusions disappeared from cancellation and change policies -- even for airlines, which can be notoriously difficult. The cruise industry, after stammering with a full range of responses, finally threw in the towel and outright suspended sailings for a month. Tour operators like Abercrombie & Kent fell in line, too.
In turn, I was barraged by readers requesting tips and advice about one thing: refunds.
Take the two emails I received about flying on Norwegian Air. One reader asked how to get a refund for tickets on a flight that was still headed to Rome, despite the then-burgeoning coronavirus outbreak in Italy. The other questioned the airline's $ 110 change fee on a flight that happened to be departing New York City for Oslo the very day the Norwegian government closed the border.
By the time I traded emails with a Norwegian Air spokesman, the airline was no longer flying from the United States to Rome or Oslo, and it had eliminated its change fees altogether.
Looking for a Refund? Here are 4 Takeaways.
Be patient; the travel industry is scrambling to keep up with the tectonic shifts in travel restrictions.
As a result, customer service centers are also scrambling. Expect long wait and response times.
If your trip isn't right around the corner, it's best to wait to cancel it -- especially if you don't need to immediately access the funds.
It's in everyone's best interest to be flexible right now.
Another reader emailed to tell me about a denied refund on two Airbnbs in Spain: "This experience is making me question whether it's a good idea to use them in the future," she wrote.
Airbnb announced a sweeping extenuating-circumstances cancellation policy five days later. I had only cursorily reached out to the company when a followup from the reader landed in my inbox: "Airbnb emailed me today and promised a refund would be coming in the next 15 days."
But it was the exchange I had with Priceline that best illustrated the travel industry's high-speed reaction of the evolving pandemic.
A reader named Bonnie emailed to say that Priceline had charged her a $ 518 fee when she canceled her April stay at a hotel in San Francisco. Meanwhile, the hotel itself was waiving cancellation fees.
When I reached out to Priceline, I learned that on March 16 -- the day Bonnie canceled her reservation online -- the hotel's cancellation waiver had been communicated to all of Priceline's phone agents but had yet to be uploaded into the database that processes online cancellations. In other words, Bonnie had beaten Priceline to its own rush.
That technical lag has since been fixed, and Bonnie's cancellation fee was refunded. A Priceline spokesman emailed, "Please know that this was NOT her mistake -- this was ours entirely. We're also very sorry that it took several days for her to get the right answers. It's obviously a very busy time in travel, but when we learn about errors like these, we'll fix them immediately."
The situation also drives home a point that Jack Ezon, the founder of the luxury travel agency Embark, stressed when I called him a few weeks ago to get his perspective about the coronavirus's general effect on the industry: "It's in everyone's best interest to be flexible right now."
Flexible cancellation and change policies foster goodwill and are an overall boon for their images. But they're also good for cash flow and long-term brand loyalty: the famous "bird in the hand" adage, said Mr. Ezon. "If you want to entice people to buy, you need to make it easy for them to cancel," he said.
But combine panicked consumers seeking refunds en masse, all-but-guaranteed customer-service logjams, and cancellation and change policies that have changed -- often drastically -- in a matter of weeks, and we're back in that water, attempting to time those waves just right.
My reporting on the coronavirus so far has pointed to one key lesson: if your trip isn't right around the corner, it's best to wait to cancel it, especially if you don't need to immediately access the funds. Look no further than my parents' planned trip to Japan. In late February, when they lobbied All Nippon Airways for a refund on two round-trip business class tickets from New York City to Tokyo, they got a paltry offer: a $ 463 credit (total). Instead they held off, refreshing the airline's website a few times a week until their late-April departure date was finally covered by the airline's ballooning cancellation policy.
Not only does the wait-and-see strategy save you from having to spend hours on hold, but, as the experiences above indicate, jumping in prematurely -- say, before policies are officially hammered out -- almost always guarantees a headache. There's a philosophical upside to this, as well, especially for those of us who are used to having trips on the calendar. It's unlikely I'll get to Menorca in September, but my not-yet-canceled hotel reservation is a small token of normalcy -- my own tiny show of optimism.

Wildfires in Chernobyl lead to elevated radiation levels

Texto completo: A wildfire burning in the Chernobyl region of Ukraine has led to increased levels of radiation nearly 35 years after the 1986 nuclear accident.
The fires have burned through more than 8,600 acres over the past week, according to the Exclusion Zone Management Agency, the government office that manages the area.
Radiation readings near the wildfires have been elevated in recent days, although they remain considerably lower than what they were at the time of the nuclear accident, according to the New York Times. The wind has been blowing toward rural areas of Russia and Belarus for most of the past week, but it recently shifted directions going toward Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine.
Saturday's winds directed the blaze toward the remnants of the nuclear plant. Should the fire spread to the Zone of Alienation, a rough circle with a nearly 18-mile radius around the old facility, it would force responders to enter the area that has been mostly deserted.
“We have been working all night digging firebreaks around the plant to protect it from fire,” Kateryna Pavlova, the acting head of the agency that oversees the area, told the New York Times.

SUELLEN ROCCA: 1943-2020

Texto completo: Suellen Rocca, a founding member of the short-lived but influential 1960s Chicago art group the Hairy Who and a fiercely original artist whose hieroglyphic, phantasmagoric work poked a finger in the eye of late-20th-century modernist purities, died March 26 at a hospice in Naperville. She was 76.
Matthew Marks Gallery in New York, which represents her, said the cause was pancreatic cancer.
At a time when the deadpan consumer imagery of pop art was giving way to the restraint of minimalism and conceptualism, Rocca and five former classmates from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago came together under the sway of influences as disparate as Dubuffet, Native American art, hand-painted store signs, the Sears catalog and the natural-history displays at the Field Museum to create a rambunctious form of painting and sculpture that tacked hard against prevailing orthodoxies.
"There is about many of these works a relentlessly gabby, arm-twisting, eyeball-contacting quality that comes as a great surprise in a gallery that we associate with the spare statements of Agnes Martin and Brice Marden," John Russell wrote in The New York Times in a review of a 1982 Pace Gallery show. He added: "Why are they so repulsive? Are they all equally repulsive? Are we wrong not to like them? These are fair questions, and they deserve an answer."
Eventually the answer was that their unorthodox ethos, ignored by many East and West coast critics as a regionalist aberration, came to be embraced by younger generations who saw themselves reflected in its exuberance, irreverence and vernacular American overload.
Rocca and her compatriots, whose work helped foment a wider movement known as Chicago Imagism, "weren't interested in binary oppositions or the modernist arrow of progress," the curator Dan Nadel wrote in the catalog for a show of Rocca's work at Matthew Marks Gallery in 2016. "Art was art. This stoic, rather Midwestern philosophy would prove to be foundational."
In 2016, Rocca listed some of the imagery that formed the lexicon of her early work, often rendered in flat, quivery, cartoonlike lines.
"Palm trees, diamond rings, bra styles in the Sears Roebuck catalog, dancing couples from Arthur Murray ads and pictures of fancy hairdos tucked into the back pages of magazines were the cultural icons of beauty and romance expressed by the media that promised happiness to young women of that generation," she said. "This was the culture that surrounded me."
In a 2018 interview with Garage magazine, she said that much of her work was a form of picture-writing, analogous to hieroglyphics, taking in the same consumer flotsam that pop art used but deploying it more subjectively.
Asked in that interview about her approach, she said the short answer she liked to give was that "while New York was cool, Chicago was hot."
Suellen Krupp was born on Oct. 2, 1943, the only child in a middle-class Jewish family. Her father, Phillip, whose family had immigrated from Russia, worked as a salesman for a lighting-equipment company, and her mother, Mildred, a talented amateur pianist who performed throughout her life, worked as a legal secretary and accountant.
Suellen's art talent emerged early and had propelled her by age 16 to the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where one of her teachers was Ray Yoshida, a hugely important mentor to the Chicago Imagists who emphasized nondoctrinaire thinking and eclectic sources of inspiration.
In 1962, she married Dennis Rocca, a third-generation jeweler; they divorced in 1975. She is survived by her son, Paul; her daughter, Lia Plonka; and three grandchildren.
The first Hairy Who exhibition, featuring the work of Rocca, Gladys Nilsson, Jim Nutt, Jim Falconer, Art Green and Karl Wirsum, was held at the Hyde Park Art Center in 1966. (The group's memorable name is said to have been inspired by a riff on the name of a local radio personality and art critic, Harry Bouras, whom the artists did not hold in high esteem.) Between 1966 and 1969, the group -- which did not consider itself a movement or school, but simply an informal collection of like-minded artists -- staged five more exhibitions, in Chicago, San Francisco, New York and Washington.
Rocca's work was included in several other shows before she moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in the early 1970s, at which time she stopped making art for a decade.
Upon returning to Chicago in 1981, she took up teaching and began to work again, making drawings and paintings that were emotionally darker, with titles like "Beware of My Mouth," "Don't" and "It's a Secret." A motif of purses and bags that runs through her work took on more unsettling implications. As she told an interviewer for the Archives of American Art in 2015: "Bags can hold things that you don't want to get out. Sort of like Pandora's box." She added, "I've always felt that my work is autobiographical."
She was featured in "What Nerve! Alternative Figures in American Art, 1960 to Present," an exhibition curated by Nadel at the Rhode Island School of Design Museum in Providence in 2014 and 2015 and Matthew Marks Gallery in 2015 that has been credited with igniting wider institutional interest in Chicago Imagist work.
A survey of Rocca's work -- which is held in the collections of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Art Institute and several other important museums -- is scheduled to open this year at the Secession museum in Vienna.

Texto completo: Under heavy criticism for pressing for food stamp cuts during an economic meltdown, the Trump administration now says it will hold off during the national emergency.
WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration, under fire for pushing food stamp cuts in the middle of a pandemic, has decided to hold off on stricter work requirements for adults without children during the national emergency.
"People need food and that's what U.S.D.A. does," Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said this week in a statement to The New York Times.
Initially, the Trump administration planned to appeal a court decision from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, which issued a temporary court injunction on its work requirements rule, which were to go into effect on April 1. But it has since changed its tone. By the Agriculture Department's own estimates, the change would have led to nearly 700,000 people losing their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, formerly known as food stamps.
"Especially now, as a global pandemic poses widespread health risks, guaranteeing that government officials at both the federal and state levels have flexibility to address the nutritional needs of residents and ensure their well-being through programs like SNAP is essential," Chief Judge Beryl Howell wrote in the decision that came the same day President Trump declared the coronavirus outbreak a national emergency.
Congress then stepped in, and in one of its economic stabilization packages, waived the work requirement for the duration of the national emergency, in addition to another month. Now the administration has reached agreement with the states that had sued it on a schedule for the remaining events in the case. The agreement is contingent on the department not appealing the temporary injunction, and a final ruling is likely to be issued in the fall.
Asked about the department's plan to appeal the court ruling, Mr. Perdue said the department would "comply with the legislation which really pauses that during this public health emergency."
"While we, in a normal situation, were moving in a way to enforce what the common thinking was regarding food supply, we are going to be as flexible as we can," he said.
The food stamps program stimulates the economy when it needs it most, by expanding when people need help the most, said Lauren Bauer, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and contributor to a new report that looks at the Trump administration's food stamp rule.
The one thing many Americans are leaving their houses to do right now is buy groceries, she said. The money is put directly back into the economy. And because Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits can be used for food, people can use their cash for something else such as rent or medical expenses.
"In the Great Recession, SNAP was the best stimulator of the economy," Ms. Bauer said, adding that work requirements hamper the program's ability to do that.
Ms. Bauer said that Americans were in a better place than during the recession of 2007 and 2008. At that time, only 40 percent of all American households lived in places that were eligible to have work requirements waived, Ms. Bauer said. This was because the criteria for waivers were based on economic indicators that lagged behind what was actually happening in people's lives.
For instance, even though unemployment was high across the country, the majority of nondisabled adults without children were still initially subject to a work requirement. State and local governments hoping for work-rule waivers had to secure both executive and congressional action. For the coming recession, Ms. Bauer said, Americans are better positioned because Congress and the courts have already secured those waivers.
This fall, if the Agriculture Department decides to appeal and wins, states will find themselves subject to a stricter set of criteria for determining where they can waive requirements. Those requirements mandate that nondisabled adults without children can only receive food stamps for three months in a three-year period before they must work or participate in a work program for 80 hours in order to receive food assistance.
That requirement might hit as the United States is trying to lift itself from a deep and sudden recession.
"We don't want to punish people, particularly low-income people, for not working when there are no jobs," Ms. Bauer said.
That sentiment may prove to be bipartisan. Robert Rector, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation and a conservative welfare expert, said work requirements are needed, but they should not return for awhile.
"I don't want to have unreasonable requirements, but I do want this requirement to come back once this economy recovers because I believe it is a good thing," he said.
He said that even if the work requirements were put back as soon as the crisis was over, they "wouldn't be binding in most areas because the unemployment rate is going to remain quite high, even if we have a robust recovery."
Liberal advocacy groups have long said that tying the waivers to unemployment rates is unfair because the rates do not account for the obstacles to employment that face women, people of color, those with minimal education or who lack transportation.
Food banks, where demand has increased because of the pandemic, are worried that the final rule going into effect will mean more people coming to their doors.
In April, the Greater Cleveland Food Bank had a drive-through distribution in which 2,700 cars passed through in four hours; a third of them had never been to an emergency food program before. In one week, the bank received 2,000 calls. In a typical day, it usually receives 100 calls.
"We always stress that SNAP provides nine meals for every one meal provided by food banks, and I suspect SNAP will play a critical role during the pandemic and the recovery," said Kimberly LoVano, the director of advocacy and public education at the Greater Cleveland Food Bank.

Fauci says don't count on summer to halt viral spread

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert, says don't assume the coronavirus will fade during warm weather.
Fauci told ABC's “Good Morning America" there's precedent with other infections such as influenza that “when the virus gets warmer that the virus goes down in its ability to replicate, to spread."
But Fauci added “having said that, one should not assume that we are going to be rescued by a change in the weather. You must assume that the virus will continue to do its thing. If we get some help from the weather, so be it, fine. But I don't think we need to assume that."
He was asked about a New York Times story that research indicates the coronavirus that began circulating in New York in mid-February came mainly from Europe, not Asia.
“I think that's probably correct," Fauci said. He notes that “Europe became the epicenter pretty quickly after China really exploded with their cases."
Associated Press
In New York, numbers reflect loss — and hope
As it has for several days, the story of the coronavirus in New York had two strands Thursday: encouraging progress and devastating loss, Governor Andrew M. Cuomo said.
In the past two weeks, the number of virus patients hospitalized has grown more and more slowly, from more than 20 percent a day at one point to single-digit percent increases this week.
From Wednesday to Thursday, the number increased by 200, to 18,279, or just 1 percent.
If the trend were to continue, the number of people in hospitals would soon start to decline — a sign that the virus had passed its apex.
But the number of people dying of the virus continues to grow. The state recorded 799 deaths from Wednesday to Thursday, another one-day high.
For the second straight day, Cuomo compared the toll of the virus to the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, calling the virus a “silent explosion that ripples through society with the same randomness, the same evil that we saw on 9/11."
As he has done repeatedly in recent days, Cuomo stressed that social distancing and other restrictions would continue to be enforced, because they were necessary to maintain the progress the state has made.
He also cautioned that New York might only be in the first wave of the pandemic. The state would probably have enough hospital beds and ventilators to treat virus patients if current trends hold, he said, but its resources would be insufficient if the most drastic projections about the outbreak were realized.
“Everybody is assuming, well, once we get through this, we're done," Cuomo said. “I wouldn't be so quick to assume that. This virus has been ahead of us from day one."
The governor again emphasized that New York's Black and Hispanic communities were being hit the hardest by the virus, and he said that additional testing sites would be opened in predominantly Black and Latino neighborhoods.

Unclaimed bodies will be buried sooner
NEW YORK — As New York City deals with a mounting coronavirus death toll and dwindling morgue space, the city has shortened the amount of time it will hold unclaimed remains before they are buried in the city's public cemetery.
Under the new policy, the medical examiner's office will keep bodies in storage for just 14 days before they're buried in the city's potter's field on Hart Island.
Normally, about 25 bodies a week are interred on the island, mostly for people whose families can't afford a funeral, or who go unclaimed by relatives.
In recent days, though, burial operations have increased from one day a week to five days a week, with around 24 burials each day, said Department of Correction spokesman Jason Kersten.
Aerial images taken Thursday by the Associated Press captured workers digging graves on the island, a one-mile, limited-access strip off the Bronx that's the final resting place for more than a million mostly indigent New Yorkers.
About 40 caskets were lined up for burial on the island on Thursday, and two fresh trenches have been dug in recent days.
Interments are typically done by inmates from the city's Rikers Island jail complex, but during the coronavirus pandemic the job has been taken over by contractors.

Nursing home evacuated when staff stays home
A California nursing home where dozens have tested positive for the novel coronavirus was forced to evacuate Wednesday after a majority of its staff failed to show up to work for the second consecutive day, according to public health officials.
People wearing masks, gloves, and protective gowns could be seen wheeling residents of the Magnolia Rehabilitation and Nursing Center in Riverside, Calif., one by one on stretchers to waiting ambulances that would take them to other care facilities in the area.
At the time of the evacuation, the center was looking after more than 80 patients, 34 of whom have tested positive for coronavirus, Riverside County Public Health Officer Cameron Kaiser said at a news conference. Five employees have also contracted the virus, Kaiser said.
Riverside County officials say they do not yet know why many of Magnolia's staff members stopped reporting for duty.
As of Wednesday, Kaiser said his office had not received any complaints from the staff about working conditions at the 90-bed center, which bills itself as "one of the finest skilled nursing facilities in Riverside, California."
But no matter how justified the reasoning may be, Kaiser said he is concerned that the employees' actions "could rise to the level of abandonment."
"Nationwide, all of our health care workers are considered heroes and they rightly are," he said. "But implicit in that heroism is that people stay at their posts."

All five national parks are closed in Utah
SALT LAKE CITY — All five of Utah's national parks are closed after Capitol Reef officials said Thursday they are shutting their gates to prevent further spread of the new coronavirus.
The park known for its sandstone cliffs was the last national park still open in Utah after Zion, Bryce Canyon, Arches, and Canyonlands had previously closed under pressure from local government and health officials.
Capitol Reef's decision comes after Utah Governor Gary Herbert on Tuesday urged people to stay close to home even though it is Easter week and spring break for many state residents.
Park officials referenced Herbert's motto of “stay home, stay safe" in a posting on the Capitol Reef website explaining the decision.

Texto completo: NEW YORK — For millions of baby boomers, Mad Magazine was a comically anarchic trip from reality, with caricaturist Mort Drucker often the conductor.
A New York City native, he joined Mad in its early days, the mid-1950s, and remained well into the 21st century. Few major events or public figures during that time escaped his satire, whether “Star Trek" and “The Godfather" or Steve Martin and Jerry Seinfeld. In large strokes, Mr. Drucker took in every crease, crevice, and bold feature. The jaws of Kirk Douglas and Jay Leno bulged; the ears of Barack Obama looked like wings about to take flight. Being drawn by Mr. Drucker became a kind of show business rite of passage, with Michael J. Fox once telling Johnny Carson that he knew he had made it when he appeared in a Drucker cartoon.
Mr. Drucker, who for decades lovingly spoofed politicians, celebrities, movies, and popular culture, died Thursday at 91.
His daughter, Laurie Bachner, told the Associated Press that he fell ill last week, having difficulty walking and developing breathing problems. She did not give a specific cause of death and said that he was not tested for the coronavirus. He died at his home in Woodbury, N.Y., with his wife of more than 70 years, Barbara, by his side.
“I think my father had the best life anyone could hope for," Bachner said. “He was married to the only women he ever loved and got to make a living out of what he loved to do."
Mr. Drucker inspired a generation of illustrators and cartoonists.
“To me, he's the guy," caricaturist Drew Friedman said. “I used to imitate his work in Mad when I was a kid. I wanted to be Mort Drucker; I even loved his name."
Mr. Drucker's facility was best expressed in multicaricature crowd scenes. His parody of the 1986 Woody Allen film, “Hannah and Her Sisters," opened with a panel depicting a Thanksgiving dinner that, in addition to most of the movie's ensemble cast, included caricatures of Allen's first wife, Louise Lasser; film critics Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel; Mayor Ed Koch of New York; and Mad's mascot, Alfred E. Neuman. Mad's takeoff on the MGM retrospective feature “That's Entertainment," published in 1975, required Mr. Drucker to caricature more than two dozen stars.
“I think I've drawn almost everyone in Hollywood," he told The New York Times in 2000.
Besides Mad, Mr. Drucker drew for Time magazine, DC Comics, for an ad campaign for fruit and vegetables, and for the heavy metal band Anthrax, which commissioned him to design art for its “State of Euphoria" album.
Some of his illustrations, including a Time cover drawing of Richard Nixon and Mao Zedong playing table tennis, ended up in the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. In 2014, he was the first winner of the National Society of Cartoonists' Medal of Honor for lifetime achievement.
Morris Drucker was born on March 22, 1929, in Brooklyn. His father, Edward, was a businessman who repaired jukeboxes and ran a bar, among other things. His mother, Sarah (Spielvogel) Drucker, was a homemaker. He attended Erasmus Hall High School, where he met his future wife, Barbara Hellerman.
In addition to his wife and daughter, he leaves another daughter, Melanie Amsterdam, and three grandchildren.
Self-taught, Mr. Drucker began his professional career at 18 when, recommended by cartoonist Will Eisner, a family friend, he got a job assisting on the comic book Debbie Dean, Career Girl.
He came to Mad in late 1956, soon after Al Feldstein succeeded Harvey Kurtzman, the magazine's founder, as editor. Mad had run only occasional TV and movie satires, but Mr. Drucker's arrival “changed everything," pop culture critic Grady Hendrix wrote in a 2013 Film Comment appreciation of Mad's movie parodies.
“No one saw Drucker's talent," Hendrix wrote, until he illustrated “The Night That Perry Masonmint Lost a Case," a takeoff on the television courtroom drama “Perry Mason," in 1959. It was then, Hendrix maintained, that “the basic movie parody format for the next 44 years was born."
From the early 1960s on, nearly every issue of Mad included a movie parody, and before Mr. Ducker retired he had illustrated 238, more than half of them. The last one, “The Chronic-Ills of Yawnia: Prince Thespian," appeared in 2008.
Some of his most inventive works were double satires. The 1963 Mad piece “East Side Story," written by Frank Jacobs, is a parody of “West Side Story" as played out by prominent international figures. Nikita Khrushchev, Fidel Castro, and Charles de Gaulle are among the many world leaders drawn cavorting against photographed backdrops of New York City streets. “It's a Blunderful Life," written by Stan Hart and published in 1996, updated “It's a Wonderful Life" to star Richard Nixon as Bill Clinton's guardian angel.
Mr. Drucker compared his method to creating a movie storyboard: “I become the 'camera,' " he once said, “and look for angles, lighting, close-ups, wide angles, long shots — just as a director does to tell the story in the most visually interesting way he can."
Friedman praised his restraint: “He wasn't really hung up on exaggerating. He was far more subtle and nuanced — interested in how people stood and so on."
Mr. Drucker was modest about his gifts. “It took me a long time to learn the skills I have, and it was time-consuming," he said.
He also illustrated children's books and contributed to the vogue for adult coloring books, collaborating with comedy writer Paul Laikin on “The JFK Coloring Book," which sold hundreds of thousands of copies in 1962. Between 1984 and 1987, he collaborated on the syndicated newspaper strip “Benchley," which revolved around a fictional assistant to President Reagan.
Reagan, whom Mr. Drucker had caricatured as the Godfather, Moses, Scrooge, and a slavering Hyde in a 1982 Mad story, “Ronald Reagan — Now Starring at the White House," written by Stan Hart, was evidently a fan of the strip and treated Mr. Drucker and his wife to a private tour of the White House.
Not everyone was so pleased. According to Hendrix, Mad's 1981 parody of “The Empire Strikes Back," “The Empire Strikes Out," prompted the Lucasfilm legal department to send a cease-and-desist letter demanding that the issue be recalled. “Mad replied by sending a copy of another letter they had received the previous month — from George Lucas, offering to buy the original artwork for the 'Empire' parody and comparing Mort Drucker to Leonardo da Vinci."
Lucas knew Mr. Drucker's work well. He had commissioned one of his classic multicharacter pileups as the poster for his first hit, “American Graffiti" — a nostalgic movie set in the same summer “The JFK Coloring Book" was a bestseller. And, of course, Mr. Drucker had illustrated Mad's sendup, “American Confetti."

Texto completo: BERLIN — As the Easter holiday approaches, world leaders and health officials are fervently warning that hard-won gains in the fight against the coronavirus must not be jeopardized by relaxing social distancing.
Chancellor Angela Merkel emphasized that “even short trips inside Germany, to the seaside or the mountains or relatives, can't happen over Easter this year."
New Zealand police warned people not to drive to holiday homes over Easter or risk arrest, while Lithuania was imposing a lockdown on major cities over the holiday.
Portugal halted commercial flights at the country's five international airports and set up checkpoints on major roads and junctions to stop Easter visits. Additional restrictions came into force Thursday for the next four days, including a ban on people leaving their local areas and on gatherings of more than five people.
Greece also tightened restrictions ahead of next week's Orthodox Easter, increasing police roadblocks along highways, doubling fines for lockdown violations, and banning travel between islands.
Swiss police were setting roadblocks at the Gotthard tunnel, seeking to dissuade drivers from heading to the Italian-speaking Ticino region, one of the worst-hit by the pandemic.
Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei suggested mass gatherings may be barred through the holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, which runs from late April through most of May. He urged Shiite faithful to pray at home instead.
Indonesia's president banned civil servants, police officers, military personnel, and employees of state-owned companies from returning to their hometowns to celebrate the end of Ramadan. The annual mass exodus usually involves tens of millions of Indonesians crisscrossing the archipelago of 17,000 islands.

Johnson leaves ICU, but UK faces longer lockdown
LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain was moved out of intensive care on Thursday, a ray of hope for a country that faces several more weeks under lockdown as its death toll from the coronavirus approached 8,000.
Johnson was hospitalized on Sunday evening after a 10-day bout with the virus and transferred to the intensive care unit on Monday after his condition deteriorated. On Thursday, Downing Street said the prime minister, 55, had been moved back to a ward at St. Thomas' Hospital in London and was in “extremely good spirits."
Dominic Raab, Britain's caretaker leader, said that Johnson had made “positive steps" in his recovery. He also signaled that the government would extend the country's lockdown beyond next week.

Spain and Italy to extend lockdowns amid resurgence
Spain is poised to extend a nationwide lockdown, and Italy is moving toward doing the same as Europe's rising infection rate complicates plans to begin reversing stringent restrictions on public life.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez planned to ask parliament for an extension to a state of emergency through April 25. His Italian counterpart, Giuseppe Conte, is preparing to prolong the national lockdown from a current expiration date of April 13 for another two weeks.
The continent has suffered more than 65 percent of worldwide deaths, and Spain, Italy, France, and Germany trail only the United States in infections.

Mask-wearing, common in Asia, spreads in the West
PARIS — Until a few weeks ago, Asian tourists were the only mask wearers in Paris, eliciting puzzlement or suspicion from locals or even hostility.
This taboo is falling fast, not only in France but across Western countries, after mounting cries from specialists who say the practice is effective in curbing the pandemic.
The shift for Western nations is profound and has had to overcome not merely the logistical challenges of securing enough masks, but also a deep cultural resistance and even stigma associated with mask-wearing, which some Western leaders described as “alien."
Seemingly, it won't be for much longer. After discouraging people from wearing face masks, France, like the United States, has begun urging its citizens to wear basic or homemade ones outside. And some parts of Europe are moving faster than the United States by requiring masks instead of simply recommending their use.
This week, Austria moved to become the fourth European nation to require masks in public, after the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Turkey.

Thousands in dorms pose new challenge to Singapore
Tightly packed dormitories housing thousands of foreign workers have emerged as one of Singapore's biggest challenges in its fight to contain the spread of the coronavirus.
The city state reported a record 142 new infections Wednesday, and at least 40 of those were linked to clusters at foreign worker dormitories that house mainly low-wage workers in construction and other sectors. Those groups now account for 253 infections across nine facilities, more than 15 percent of the country's 1,623 cases, according to Ministry of Health data.
Authorities have moved swiftly to isolate the clusters.
For Singapore, a country that has been championed by health officials for its methodical virus response, the move to quarantine potentially exposed workers living in close proximity has raised questions about whether the conditions will allow for social distancing — one of the key strategies utilized around the world.

Ship at center of outbreak raided by Australian police
BRISBANE, Australia — Police wearing protective gear boarded a cruise ship to seize evidence and question the crew of the vessel linked to hundreds of coronavirus infections and 15 deaths across Australia.
About 2,700 passengers disembarked from the ship on March 19 in Sydney, and it has since become the largest source of infections in Australia. More than 600 cases of COVID-19 and 15 deaths are linked the to the ship, the Ruby Princess.
New South Wales police, which boarded the ship Wednesday night south of Sydney, said it's expected to remain in port for 10 days with its 1,040 crew undergoing medical assessments. About 200 crew have shown symptoms of COVID-19, while 18 have tested positive for the virus. The workers remaining on the ship are from 50 countries.

Thai alcohol ban to curb virus now spans 16 million
Bangkok became the latest province in Thailand to temporarily ban alcohol sales in an effort to prevent social gatherings that can spread the virus.
The restriction from April 10 to April 20 is the metropolitan region's latest effort to contain a surge in infections since early March. Alcohol is now proscribed for about 16 million people, as several others among the nation's 77 provinces have already imposed curbs. Thailand as a whole is under a state of emergency and partial lockdown through April.
Officials are trying to entrench social distancing, with roughly a quarter of Thailand's 69 million people under alcohol prohibitions.

'Lazily repeating phony hearsay': Cotton slams New York Times reporter for linking him to unproven coronavirus theory

Texto completo: Sen. Tom Cotton castigated a New York Times reporter on Twitter for claiming that the Arkansas Republican believes the coronavirus was “produced by a Chinese weapons lab.”
“@Max_Fisher claims — without evidence — that I believe the China virus was “produced by a Chinese weapons lab,” Cotton wrote on Twitter Wednesday along with a New York Times article written by Max Fisher. “He should have done his homework.”
Tweet
“Since the start of this outbreak, I’ve maintained that animal-to-human transmission or a 'good science, bad safety' accidental breach in a lab studying coronavirus — like the one in Wuhan — are the most likely origin scenarios," Cotton added in a thread, along with a screenshot of his comments from February. “Too bad he couldn’t be bothered to ask.”
Tweet
Cotton then urged Fisher to do his own research and look into the “hazy origins of the virus” himself, which he claimed are ambiguous because of China’s “coverups and lies.”
Tweet
In Fisher’s article, he links to a different New York Times article that cites an interview Cotton did with Fox News’s Maria Bartiromo, during which she points out that Cotton warned in early February that the coronavirus was “worse than Chernobyl.”
In the interview, Cotton states that he believes the virus did not come from a Chinese wet market in Wuhan and simply pointed out that the country’s only biosafety level 4 laboratory that studies infectious diseases is located in Wuhan.
“We don’t have evidence that this disease originated there,” Cotton said. “But because of China’s duplicity and dishonesty from the beginning, we need to at least ask the question to see what the evidence says, and China right now is not giving evidence on that question at all.”
At no point in the interview did Cotton say that he believes the virus came from a bioweapons lab.

Liberty University's Jerry Falwell Jr. launches assault on press freedom

Texto completo: Apparently, "Liberty" is just a name for the small, conservative college run by Jerry Falwell Jr. in Lynchburg, Virginia — not any kind of statement of its values. At least, that’s what the school’s latest stunt suggests.
Falwell is actively seeking to throw two reporters in jail: The university’s police department issued arrest warrants for trespassing against two journalists whose coverage Falwell disliked. Specifically, he didn’t like how they reported on his decision to endanger students by partially reopening Liberty’s campus amid a pandemic. This is an apparent attack on press freedom and just the latest addition to Falwell’s long record of hypocrisy.
Falwell claims the pair of journalists criminally “trespassed” on “private property.” While Liberty’s campus is indeed private property, this is an extremely thin excuse. People frequently walk, jog, or visit open private university campuses without explicit permission. Trespassing charges are usually reserved for those who have already been asked to leave and refuse or who are barred from campus for specific reasons and then sneak on anyway. The New York Times journalist in question was invited to campus by students whom she interviewed and quoted in her story.
This is a transparent act of selective retribution — clearly using the law with the intent to punish journalists with whom Falwell disagrees. When I contacted the Liberty University Police Department, they refused to answer any questions. In the absence of any valid explanation and in light of Falwell’s ongoing self-victimization crusade against the media, this seems like a blatant attack on the free press.
Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press Legal Director Katie Townsend said the arrest warrants “appear to be intended to harass journalists who were simply, and rightly, doing their jobs — and to intimidate other reporters from doing the same type of reporting.”
I spoke with several law enforcement experts and lawyers who share this concern.
"While campus police officers at Liberty University enjoy the same arrest powers afforded any recognized police agency in the Commonwealth of Virginia, if they were specifically instructed to target journalists, that is problematic,” CNN law enforcement analyst and former FBI agent James Gagliano told me. “Standardization of enforcement, unbiased and impartial, is a hallmark of justice. If there exists selective targeting on the grounds that journalists were ‘trespassing,’ the university better be able to show equal application of the campus policy."
“In the middle of a public health crisis, we need the access to information that both freedom of speech and press ensure,” Charles Koch Institute Senior Fellow for Free Speech Casey Mattox told the Washington Examiner. “Though the First Amendment only applies to public universities, private schools who value open inquiry should think hard about whether they can long preserve the rights they enjoy while sending the police after journalists they dislike.”
Falwell has also threatened the New York Times and other outlets that reported on his dubious coronavirus decision-making with defamation lawsuits. In order to sue for defamation successfully, he would have to prove not only that reporters got the story wrong (not the case here, it seems) but that they knowingly published falsehoods with malice.
“Seeking the arrest of journalists for merely taking pictures of the subject of an article would be transparent by itself,” Ari Cohn, a First Amendment attorney and the former director of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, told me. “But the accompanying threat of a defamation lawsuit makes it especially clear that Falwell is less concerned with trespassing than he is with exacting retribution upon journalists that write unfavorable coverage.”

David Brooks: People learn what their pain is teaching them, and become wiser and softer as a result

Texto completo: Dear Friends,
Last week I asked you to tell me about your mental health — how you are faring in this hard time. I don’t know what I expected; maybe some jaunty stories about families pulling together in a crisis. What you sent gutted me. There have been over 5,000 replies so far, and while many people are hanging in there, there is also a river of woe running through the world — a significant portion of our friends and neighbors are in agony.
A college student in State College, Pennsylvania, wrote that at first the lockdown seemed like a lark — a chance to get out of certain obligations. But “now almost a month into staying here, I’ve been gripped by a deep depression. My appetite is very low. I’m sleeping far too much to feel as lethargic as I do.
“My future, which seemed so bright a few months ago as I anticipated graduating in May, now seems bleak and hopeless: How will I find a job with the economy tanking? How will I pay hundreds of dollars per month when my loan bills kick in during August?”
A college junior from Vienna, Virginia, is going through the same thing. His career hopes now seem dashed. “I’ve spent days crying alone and feeling helpless as I’ve been stuck at my parent’s house and I find myself difficult to be around even as I don’t want to be.”
Senior citizens are especially hard hit, particularly the widows and widowers. For many, it’s the painful sense of missing their grandkids, the precarity of living with a disease that could kill them at any time. For others, it’s the wrenching loneliness.
“The combination of isolation and stress is having compounded impact. I am 65, and a single woman with no nearby family. My surviving sibling lives several hours away. Six months ago, my older brother died (I am the youngest). My neighbors are not very friendly, and not once has anyone asked if I needed anything. ... I cry a lot, which is my new norm. ... So to sum it up, I’m feeling totally alone in this crisis and hopeless.”
A woman from Fresno, California, wrote, “I am normally a very positive person, outgoing, happy, energetic. Definitely a glass half-full. However, lately I cannot get through a day without tears, often sobs. I am terrified for myself and my family and everyone in the world. All the things I love to do, I’m now afraid to do. ...
“The anxiety is also very challenging. I have not been able to eat much. I have experienced anorexia previously during times of stress — divorce, death, etc. I’ve lost 8.5 pounds in the past month. That might not sound like much, but I’m tiny and it’s 8 percent of my body weight.”
Then there are those already suffering with mental health issues. People with anxiety disorders wrote in to say that they were paralyzed by the possibility that they hadn’t washed their hands well enough, that they hadn’t disinfected enough and that they would cause their own death.
“I’m struggling. I returned to my family’s home earliest this year,” one woman explained. “I’ve placed myself back at the center of a highly dysfunctional household — generations of trauma, sexual abuse, alcoholism, depression and anxiety.”
Another person wrote that there was no way to distract yourself from your unhappiness now. Indeed, you are hogtied to your unhappiness.
One reader said this pandemic was causing “invisible stress” — a pervasive, ever-shifting, hard-to-define anxiety. Many people are experiencing shortness of breath, tightness in the chest, exhaustion.
One man from Placitas, New Mexico, said he used to have five things he wanted to accomplish in a day, but now it’s down to two — maybe baking bread or planting a small garden. A woman from Pennsylvania said the anxiety leaves her mentally drained, more irritable, unable to focus. “I think of it like having a few large apps on my phone that are running and draining the battery, even when I’m not using them,” she said.
Some people are active for days, frantically cleaning the house, and then one day they just shut down and cry. A person from Denver is worn down by being so suspicious of others and asked, “Why am I suddenly afraid of the mail carrier or the food delivery?”
There’s a heroism in the vulnerability you display in these letters, a courageous willingness to share your fears. Spiritual growth pulses through the paragraphs. An atheist wrote that he prays daily, though he doesn’t know to whom. Many people are reading Viktor Frankl. “I am looking at this as a type of monastic retreat. I am hoping that we come out of this crisis as a nation with a renewed sense of perspective, a new sense of our dependence on each other.”
I’m reminded that this is a time to practice aggressive friendship with each other — to be the one who seeks out the lonely and the troubled. It’s also true that character is formed in times like this. People see deeper into themselves, bravely learn what their pain is teaching them, and become wiser and softer as a result.
So much respect,
David

Texto completo: So. It’s all settled. Joe Biden versus Donald Trump. We’ve got the candidates for the 2020 presidential race, people. Now all we have to do is make sure we have an election.
Aren’t you a little worried about this? The huge mess in Wisconsin this week showed what can happen if you mix a pandemic, an already-confusing voting system and partisan politics.
Everybody’s seen those pictures of people in Milwaukee, wearing face masks, standing in lines to the polls that stretched on for blocks and blocks and blocks. It looked like one of those stories about determined citizens in a young democracy. (“It took Mongolian nomad Pagvajaviin Shatarbaatar seven days to get to his polling station to vote in Wednesday’s general election. …”)
Those of you who are desperately seeking a sense of continuity in these tumultuous times will be relieved to hear Trump said the human logjam was all about him.
“In Wisconsin what happened is I through social media put out a very strong endorsement of a Republican conservative judge who’s an excellent brilliant judge,” he said, “… and I hear what happened is his poll numbers went through the roof.” In terror, Trump concluded, the Democrats “delayed the election.”
Except for the part where he had actually endorsed said judge in January. “And there were no polls,” added Barry Burden, the director of the University of Wisconsin Elections Research Center.
Details, details. Every day Trump comes out for a press conference and tells us … new things. This week he once again claimed he’d compared coronavirus to the flu only because he was trying to be “a cheerleader for this country.” But this time he added, with a perfect lack of irony: “The flu is nothing to sneeze at.”
On Wednesday, after Bernie Sanders dropped out of the race, he had nice things to say about the democratic socialist. (“Bernie and I agree on trade.”) And dark hints about Biden. “It does amaze me that President Obama hasn’t supported Sleepy Joe,” Trump mused. Maybe, he told reporters, Obama “knows something that you don’t know. That I think I know but you don’t know.”
This is just day one. By the time we get to the summer, Trump’s Biden is going to stop being sleepy and turn into — oh, something way more actively evil.
Meanwhile, that’s it, Democrats. No more primary predictions. People who are desperately trying to come up with a new non-virus conversation topic while dining with the person they’ve been alone with for a month are just going to have to talk about vice-presidential nominees. Or that TV show about the guy with tigers.
Or — what’s going to happen when everybody tries to vote. Even a post-coronavirus election could be very messy. But experts who dangle hope that we’ll be out of this ungodly situation by the summer also tend to add that it might return when things get cold around, um, November.
How do we avoid becoming a national Wisconsin? The answer, most people who seriously study the issue agree, is voting by mail. “Republican and Democratic state officials are asking for this,” said Michael Waldman, president of the Brennan Center for Justice. “The further you get from the Fox News green room, the less partisan it is.”
Three guesses how Donald Trump feels about mail voting:
A) Fine — just voted absentee myself in the Florida primary.
B) Neutral — plan to ask my election law expert more about it once I find out who he is.
C) Against! I only win if nobody votes.
Well, I know you know that it’s a variation on C. Although Trump did admit he voted by mail in Florida’s primary. (“There’s a big difference between somebody that’s out of state and does a ballot, and everything’s sealed, certified and everything else.”)
It seems when he’s not battling the pandemic, he is waging war on voting reform. “They have to be very careful because you know the things with bundling and all of the things that are happening with votes by mail where thousands of votes are gathered and I’m not going to say which party does it, but thousands of votes are gathered and they come in and they’re dumped in a location and then all of a sudden you lose elections that you think you’re going to win. I won’t stand for it,” Trump said. As only Trump can.
But he was a lot clearer when confiding to his Twitter muse: Mail voting “doesn’t work out well for Republicans.”
Wow, that guy does blurt out almost anything, even when he’s writing. Actually, mail-in ballots work fine for Republicans in many states — Utah has nothing but. This sounds more like the moan of a man who came up about 3 million short in the popular vote. Who knows what might happen if more people joined in?
To mail or not to mail is pretty much up to the states. But whatever their system, most need much better equipment, like computers and printers. The Brennan Center estimates getting the entire nation up to speed would cost about $2 billion.
If Congress wants to avoid a whole crop of Wisconsins this fall, it needs to put a lot of money in the next stimulus. But call it voting infrastructure. Trump loves infrastructure. The bill could fix our voting system in the nick of time. Just nobody tell him what’s in it.

Texto completo: If you aren’t terrified both by COVID-19 and by its economic consequences, you haven’t been paying attention.
Even though social distancing may be slowing the disease’s spread, tens of thousands more Americans will surely die in the months ahead (and official accounts surely understate the true death toll). And the economic lockdown necessary to achieve social distancing — as I’ve been saying, the economy is in the equivalent of a medically induced coma — has led to almost 17 million new claims for unemployment insurance over the past three weeks, again almost surely an understatement of true job losses.
Yet the scariest news of the past week didn’t involve either epidemiology or economics; it was the travesty of an election in Wisconsin, where the Supreme Court required that in-person voting proceed despite the health risks and the fact that many who requested absentee ballots never got them.
Why was this so scary? Because it shows that America as we know it may not survive much longer. The pandemic will eventually end; the economy will eventually recover. But democracy, once lost, may never come back. And we’re much closer to losing our democracy than many people realize.
To see how a modern democracy can die, look at events in Europe, especially Hungary, over the past decade.
What happened in Hungary, beginning in 2011, was that Fidesz, the nation’s white nationalist ruling party, took advantage of its position to rig the electoral system, effectively making its rule permanent. Then it further consolidated its control, using political power to reward friendly businesses while punishing critics, and moved to suppress independent news media.
Until recently, it seemed as if Viktor Orban, Hungary’s de facto dictator, might stop with soft authoritarianism, presiding over a regime that preserved some of the outward forms of democracy, neutralizing and punishing opposition without actually making criticism illegal. But now his government has used the coronavirus as an excuse to abandon even the pretense of constitutional government, giving Orban the power to rule by decree.
If you say that something similar can’t happen here, you’re hopelessly naive. In fact, it’s already happening here, especially at the state level. Wisconsin, in particular, is well on its way toward becoming Hungary on Lake Michigan, as Republicans seek a permanent lock on power.
The story so far: Back in 2018, Wisconsin’s electorate voted strongly for Democratic control. Voters chose a Democratic governor, and gave 53% of their support to Democratic candidates for the state Assembly. But the state is so heavily gerrymandered that despite this popular-vote majority, Democrats got only 36% of the Assembly’s seats.
And far from trying to reach some accommodation with the governor-elect, Republicans moved to effectively emasculate him, drastically reducing the powers of his office.
Then came Tuesday’s election. In normal times most attention would have been focused on the Democratic primary — although that became a moot point when Bernie Sanders suspended his campaign. But a seat on the state Supreme Court was also at stake.
Yet Wisconsin, like most of the country, is under a stay-at-home order. So why did Republican legislators, eventually backed by the Republican appointees to the U.S. Supreme Court, insist on holding an election as if the situation were normal?
The answer is that the state shutdown had a much more severe impact on voting in Democratic-leaning urban areas, where a great majority of polling places were closed, than in rural or suburban areas. So the state GOP was nakedly exploiting a pandemic to disenfranchise those likely to vote against it.
What we saw in Wisconsin, in short, was a state party doing whatever it takes to cling to power even if a majority of voters wants it out — and a partisan bloc on the U.S. Supreme Court backing its efforts. Donald Trump, as usual, said the quiet part out loud: If we expand early voting and voting by mail, “you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again.”
Does anyone seriously doubt that something similar could happen, very soon, at a national level?
This November, it’s all too possible that Trump will eke out an Electoral College win thanks to widespread voter suppression. If he does — or even if he wins cleanly — everything we’ve seen suggests that he will use a second term to punish everyone he sees as a domestic enemy, and that his party will back him all the way. That is, America will do a full Hungary.
What if Trump loses? You know what he’ll do: He’ll claim that Joe Biden’s victory was based on voter fraud, that millions of unauthorized immigrants cast ballots or something like that. Would the Republican Party, and perhaps more important, Fox News, support his refusal to accept reality? What do you think?
So that’s why what just happened in Wisconsin scares me more than either disease or depression. For it shows that one of our two major parties simply doesn’t believe in democracy. Authoritarian rule may be just around the corner.

Sen.McSally quarantines in Trump's back pocket

Texto completo: The world has changed but it's comforting to know that some things never do.
Sen. Martha McSally, for example, is still reprising her role as chief cheerleader to President Donald Trump. In fact, she seems to have quarantined smack inside the president's pocket.
On Tuesday, McSally went on FOX Business to blame China and the World Health Organization for the dire situation in which we find ourselves.
This, as she repeatedly dodged questions about the New York Times report that Trump's top trade representative was warning the White House in late January that the coronavirus could cost the U.S. trillions of dollars and imperil the lives of millions of Americans.
"We're learning more about the virus every day and, unfortunately, because of China's communist coverup of it, we could have learned all of this back in January," McSally told host Neil Cavuto.
"So as our experts understand the virus more and more we'll be able to make more targeted decisions moving forward. Unfortunately, again, it could have been earlier but China put us in this position because of their lies and the coverups and the complicit World Health Organization."
Cue Cavuto: "But it might not have been just the World Health Organization. Now we have reports that Peter Navarro was warning the President of a danger, of a virus, that could have a huge impact on the economy to say nothing of the health of Americans. What do you think of those developments, if true? We don't know, senator, to be fair if this got up to the level of the President's attention, but does it trouble you?
McSally: "This is what I know: I learned the day I entered the military, never trust a communist. China is to blame for this pandemic and the death of thousands of Americans..."
Cavuto called her on the dodge.
"But we apparently knew enough or were suspicious enough, at least Peter Navarro was, that he did send out alarms and they were ignored...," he said. "There's a possibility here within the White House itself they knew about this as well and didn't do anything."
"Yeah, I haven't seen that report," McSally replied, before launching back into China.
Again, Cavuto called her on it.
"You seem to be ignoring the possibility that those who were concerned about China and what it might be hiding – Peter Navarro comes to mind – were ignored for whatever reason."
Cue Dodge No. 3: "Again, I can't speak to that report," McSally said. "I can say that over time, in January, February, March, there were a lot of people having different opinions about this in America but we didn't have the facts."
At least one guy high up in the Trump administration, though, did have suspicions about what was headed our way and he alerted the White House — even if that is an inconvenient fact for McSally to acknowledge.
The Times reports that Navarro's first warning came in a memo dated Jan. 29, in which he said the "risk of a worst-case pandemic scenario should not be overlooked" given the information coming from China. In that memo, The Times reports he said that more than 500,000 Americans could die.
Navarro's second memo, dated Feb. 23, warned of an "increasing probability of a full-blown COVID-19 pandemic that could infect as many as 100 million Americans, with a loss of life of as many as 1.2 million souls."
Trump, meanwhile, was still downplaying the threat.
Now, nearly seven horrible weeks later, McSally is downplaying — or downright ignoring — Trump's slow reaction as, day by day, the threat to us all was increasing exponentially.
"Make no mistake," McSally tweeted on Tuesday, "China is to blame for this pandemic and the death of thousands of Americans."
McSally is, no doubt, right that China hid the extent of the devastation from this disease and the WHO was late in sounding the alarm. But not as late as Trump, whose only early action was to bar entry to most foreigners who had traveled to China within the previous 14 days. It would be precious weeks before he took more aggressive action.
And McSally can't even bring herself to say The New York Times report — that a top Trump adviser sounded an early alarm at the White House — is troubling?
In McSallyland, there is, apparently, not even a slim possibility that Trump got caught with his pants down.
Then again, it's difficult to really see when you're residing in the pocket of those pants.

Texto completo: Millions of Americans, sheltering in their homes from the coronavirus, have turned to communications platforms like Zoom, Google Hangouts and Facebook Messenger to work or stay connected to friends and family. Free and easy to use, the services are seeing record numbers of new users.
But there's a saying in Silicon Valley: If the product is free, you are the product.
This is not business as usual, though. Americans aren't willingly surrendering their online identities during this pandemic – many are being compelled to do so by their schools, family or work.
For those fortunate enough to have laptops and reliable broadband internet at home, it is not sufficient to simply update privacy policies or customer agreements. Americans need a guarantee that conversations held over video chat won't be data collection events.
The videoconferencing company Zoom has been a standout brand of the pandemic, in part because its daily user numbers ballooned to 200 million in March from 10 million last year, making it one of the few buoyant stocks amid the recent sell-off.
New York State's attorney general started an investigation into Zoom, calling on it to proactively beef up security measures, rather than just in response to negative media reports about lapses in privacy protection. And the F.B.I. warned that Zoom was susceptible to a form of digital hijacking known as "Zoombombing" following incidents where hackers joined online meetings to harass participants with racist or graphic taunts, raising the specter that personal user data might be vulnerable, too.
The New York Times also found that Zoom displayed some data from people's LinkedIn profiles without their permission, a flaw Zoom says it has fixed.
Zoom's chief executive, Eric Yuan, apologized for the lax security practices, including the transfer of customer data en masse to Facebook, reported by Motherboard.
The company said it was halting new feature releases for three months to focus on security.
Video-chat tools like Zoom and Microsoft Teams are stirring concerns that they may be using data vacuuming technologies on the most vulnerable. Schools and businesses that now rely on such services often give people no choice but to accept their terms of service.
In January, millions of Americans got the opportunity for the first time to request a detailed readout of the personal dossiers that multinational companies collect and to compel those businesses to no longer sell their data, thanks to the landmark California Consumer Privacy Act.
Yet, as the pandemic bore down on the United States, a coalition of trade groups petitioned California's attorney general, Xavier Becerra, to delay enforcement of the privacy law until next year. The attorney general's office has taken no action.
Americans have lost control over a lot as a result of the coronavirus. At least they should be able to control what happens to their personal data.

Americans Are Feeling Mad and Sad, A Study Finds

Texto completo: A presentation obtained by The New York Times shows that the Department of Health and Human Services' emergency response office is monitoring public sentiment around the coronavirus.
WASHINGTON -- The Department of Health and Human Services' preparedness and response division is confronting the deadliest pandemic in a century, and its leaders want to know how America is feeling.
In a series of slides dated Monday and obtained by The New York Times, the department's assistant secretary for preparedness and response presented a "public sentiment analysis" that summarized how Americans on social media were reacting emotionally to major news about the coronavirus over the past month.
Bottom line: Not well.
"The public continued to express sadness and fear as more people talked about being infected or having a loved one infected with or die from the virus," the analysis by the technology company Brandwatch found.
The document is remarkably granular, examining fluctuations in emotions based on news events large and small: California's mandatory stay-at-home order, the president signing the $ 2 trillion economic stabilization package, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggesting the public wear masks, Queen Elizabeth II addressing Britain.
"It is typical for H.H.S. to look at public sentiment during a public health response to help guide us in the development of public health messaging to ensure that impacted communities have the right information to protect themselves and their families," said Gretchen B. Michael, a spokeswoman for the department's preparedness office.
A former department official who is familiar with the program said the agency had done similar social media assessments of the public mood during previous disasters. The goal, the former official said, is often to gauge the effectiveness of the federal response by understanding how people are feeling.
Not surprisingly, emotions, driven by disgust, soared on March 12 when the stock market hit its lowest point since 1987. And there was a similar reaction when President Trump announced guidelines about avoiding large crowds in an effort to slow the spread of the virus.
Given the gravity of the pandemic that has taken more than 16,000 American lives, a pulse on the nation's feelings did not appear to yield any great revelations. People on social media are angry about the federal response to the coronavirus and about people in their communities not following public health guidelines, the analysis found. And in the past week, as the death toll continued to rise, fewer people were speaking positively about the coronavirus.
More remarkable is that the office of the assistant secretary for preparedness and response is bothering to compile such sentiments.
The company that collected and analyzed the data, Brandwatch, tracks discussions on social networks and, according to its website, offers a "new kind of intelligence."
For the health and human services analysis, Brandwatch tracked emotions in six categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, surprise and sadness. And it reviewed online discussion data from what was described as "top news sites," with a majority coming from the website spotcrime.com, which tracks crimes by locations. Destinations more widely considered to be top news sites were not included in the analysis.
Brandwatch did not respond to questions about the findings.
Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported that a Brandwatch company, Crimson Hexagon, had a $ 30,000 contract with the C.D.C. dating back to last year. The contract covered topics related to injury prevention.
Health and human services officials beefed up the department's social media team several years ago, the former official said. During disasters, members of that team monitor Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms since people often communicate their needs in that way when more official communication systems are down. In the immediate aftermath of a hurricane or an earthquake, social media posts can often direct resources to the areas that are hardest hit.
But the communications teams have also examined broader social media trends to evaluate whether the level of the aid is adequate, based on the degree of satisfaction or frustration expressed online, the former official said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert, says don't assume the coronavirus will fade during warm weather.
Fauci told ABC's “Good Morning America" there's precedent with other infections like influenza that “when the virus gets warmer that the virus goes down in its ability to replicate, to spread."
But Fauci added “having said that, one should not assume that we are going to be rescued by a change in the weather. You must assume that the virus will continue to do its thing. If we get some help from the weather, so be it, fine. But I don't think we need to assume that."
He was asked about a New York Times story that research indicates the coronavirus that began circulating in New York in mid-February came mainly from Europe, not Asia.
“I think that's probably correct," Fauci said. He notes that “Europe became the epicenter pretty quickly after China really exploded with their cases."
Associated Press
In New York, numbers reflect loss — and hope
As it has for several days, the story of the coronavirus in New York had two strands Thursday: encouraging progress and devastating loss, Governor Andrew M. Cuomo said.
In the past two weeks, the number of virus patients hospitalized has grown more and more slowly, from more than 20 percent a day at one point to single-digit percent increases this week.
From Wednesday to Thursday, the number increased by 200, to 18,279, or just 1 percent.
If the trend were to continue, the number of people in hospitals would soon start to decline — a sign that the virus had passed its apex.
But the number of people dying of the virus continues to grow. The state recorded 799 deaths from Wednesday to Thursday, another one-day high.
For the second straight day, Cuomo compared the toll of the virus to the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, calling the virus a “silent explosion that ripples through society with the same randomness, the same evil that we saw on 9/11."
As he has done repeatedly in recent days, Cuomo stressed that social distancing and other restrictions would continue to be enforced, because they were necessary to maintain the progress the state has made.
He also cautioned that New York might only be in the first wave of the pandemic. The state would probably have enough hospital beds and ventilators to treat virus patients if current trends hold, he said, but its resources would be insufficient if the most drastic projections about the outbreak were realized.
“Everybody is assuming, well, once we get through this, we're done," Cuomo said. “I wouldn't be so quick to assume that. This virus has been ahead of us from day one.
The governor again emphasized that New York's Black and Hispanic communities were being hit the hardest by the virus, and he said that additional testing sites would be opened in predominantly Black and Latino neighborhoods.

Unclaimed bodies will be buried sooner
NEW YORK — As New York City deals with a mounting coronavirus death toll and dwindling morgue space, the city has shortened the amount of time it will hold unclaimed remains before they are buried in the city's public cemetery.
Under the new policy, the medical examiner's office will keep bodies in storage for just 14 days before they're buried in the city's potter's field on Hart Island.
Normally, about 25 bodies a week are interred on the island, mostly for people whose families can't afford a funeral, or who go unclaimed by relatives.
In recent days, though, burial operations have increased from one day a week to five days a week, with around 24 burials each day, said Department of Correction spokesman Jason Kersten.
Aerial images taken Thursday by the Associated Press captured workers digging graves on the island, a one-mile, limited-access strip off the Bronx that's the final resting place for more than a million mostly indigent New Yorkers.
About 40 caskets were lined up for burial on the island on Thursday, and two fresh trenches have been dug in recent days.
Interments are typically done by inmates from the city's Rikers Island jail complex, but during the coronavirus pandemic the job has been taken over by contractors.

Nursing home evacuated when staff stays home
A California nursing home where dozens have tested positive for the novel coronavirus was forced to evacuate Wednesday after a majority of its staff failed to show up to work for the second consecutive day, according to public health officials.
People wearing masks, gloves, and protective gowns could be seen wheeling residents of the Magnolia Rehabilitation and Nursing Center in Riverside, Calif., one by one on stretchers to waiting ambulances that would take them to other care facilities in the area.
At the time of the evacuation, the center was looking after more than 80 patients, 34 of whom have tested positive for coronavirus, Riverside County Public Health Officer Cameron Kaiser said at a news conference. Five employees have also contracted the virus, Kaiser said.
Riverside County officials say they do not yet know why many of Magnolia's staff members stopped reporting for duty.
As of Wednesday, Kaiser said his office had not received any complaints from the staff about working conditions at the 90-bed center, which bills itself as "one of the finest skilled nursing facilities in Riverside, California."
But no matter how justified the reasoning may be, Kaiser said he is concerned that the employees' actions "could rise to the level of abandonment."
"Nationwide, all of our health care workers are considered heroes and they rightly are," he said. "But implicit in that heroism is that people stay at their posts."

All five national parks are closed in Utah
SALT LAKE CITY — All five of Utah's national parks are closed after Capitol Reef officials said Thursday they are shutting their gates to prevent further spread of the new coronavirus.
The park known for its sandstone cliffs was the last national park still open in Utah after Zion, Bryce Canyon, Arches, and Canyonlands had previously closed under pressure from local government and health officials.
Capitol Reef's decision comes after Utah Governor Gary Herbert on Tuesday urged people to stay close to home even though it is Easter week and spring break for many state residents.
Park officials referenced Herbert's motto of “stay home, stay safe" in a posting on the Capitol Reef website explaining the decision.

Mort Drucker, Master of the Mad Caricature, Is Dead at 91

Texto completo: NEW YORK — For millions of baby boomers, Mad Magazine was a comically anarchic trip from reality, with caricaturist Mort Drucker often the conductor.
A New York City native, he joined Mad in its early days, the mid-1950s, and remained well into the 21st century. Few major events or public figures during that time escaped his satire, whether “Star Trek" and “The Godfather" or Steve Martin and Jerry Seinfeld. In large strokes, Mr. Drucker took in every crease, crevice, and bold feature. The jaws of Kirk Douglas and Jay Leno bulged; the ears of Barack Obama looked like wings about to take flight. Being drawn by Mr. Drucker became a kind of show business rite of passage, with Michael J. Fox once telling Johnny Carson that he knew he had made it when he appeared in a Drucker cartoon.
Mr. Drucker, who for decades lovingly spoofed politicians, celebrities, movies, and popular culture, died Thursday at 91.
His daughter, Laurie Bachner, told the Associated Press that he fell ill last week, having difficulty walking and developing breathing problems. She did not give a specific cause of death and said that he was not tested for the coronavirus. He died at his home in Woodbury, N.Y., with his wife of more than 70 years, Barbara, by his side.
“I think my father had the best life anyone could hope for," Bachner said. “He was married to the only women he ever loved and got to make a living out of what he loved to do."
Mr. Drucker inspired a generation of illustrators and cartoonists.
“To me, he's the guy," caricaturist Drew Friedman said. “I used to imitate his work in Mad when I was a kid. I wanted to be Mort Drucker; I even loved his name."
Mr. Drucker's facility was best expressed in multicaricature crowd scenes. His parody of the 1986 Woody Allen film, “Hannah and Her Sisters," opened with a panel depicting a Thanksgiving dinner that, in addition to most of the movie's ensemble cast, included caricatures of Allen's first wife, Louise Lasser; film critics Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel; Mayor Ed Koch of New York; and Mad's mascot, Alfred E. Neuman. Mad's takeoff on the MGM retrospective feature “That's Entertainment," published in 1975, required Mr. Drucker to caricature more than two dozen stars.
“I think I've drawn almost everyone in Hollywood," he told The New York Times in 2000.
Besides Mad, Mr. Drucker drew for Time magazine, DC Comics, for an ad campaign for fruit and vegetables, and for the heavy metal band Anthrax, which commissioned him to design art for its “State of Euphoria" album.
Some of his illustrations, including a Time cover drawing of Richard Nixon and Mao Zedong playing table tennis, ended up in the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. In 2014, he was the first winner of the National Society of Cartoonists' Medal of Honor for lifetime achievement.
Morris Drucker was born on March 22, 1929, in Brooklyn. His father, Edward, was a businessman who repaired jukeboxes and ran a bar, among other things. His mother, Sarah (Spielvogel) Drucker, was a homemaker. He attended Erasmus Hall High School, where he met his future wife, Barbara Hellerman.
In addition to his wife and daughter, he leaves another daughter, Melanie Amsterdam, and three grandchildren.
Self-taught, Mr. Drucker began his professional career at 18 when, recommended by cartoonist Will Eisner, a family friend, he got a job assisting on the comic book Debbie Dean, Career Girl.
He came to Mad in late 1956, soon after Al Feldstein succeeded Harvey Kurtzman, the magazine's founder, as editor. Mad had run only occasional TV and movie satires, but Mr. Drucker's arrival “changed everything," pop culture critic Grady Hendrix wrote in a 2013 Film Comment appreciation of Mad's movie parodies.
“No one saw Drucker's talent," Hendrix wrote, until he illustrated “The Night That Perry Masonmint Lost a Case," a takeoff on the television courtroom drama “Perry Mason," in 1959. It was then, Hendrix maintained, that “the basic movie parody format for the next 44 years was born."
From the early 1960s on, nearly every issue of Mad included a movie parody, and before Mr. Ducker retired he had illustrated 238, more than half of them. The last one, “The Chronic-Ills of Yawnia: Prince Thespian," appeared in 2008.
Some of his most inventive works were double satires. The 1963 Mad piece “East Side Story," written by Frank Jacobs, is a parody of “West Side Story" as played out by prominent international figures. Nikita Khrushchev, Fidel Castro, and Charles de Gaulle are among the many world leaders drawn cavorting against photographed backdrops of New York City streets. “It's a Blunderful Life," written by Stan Hart and published in 1996, updated “It's a Wonderful Life" to star Richard Nixon as Bill Clinton's guardian angel.
Mr. Drucker compared his method to creating a movie storyboard: “I become the 'camera,' " he once said, “and look for angles, lighting, close-ups, wide angles, long shots — just as a director does to tell the story in the most visually interesting way he can."
Friedman praised his restraint: “He wasn't really hung up on exaggerating. He was far more subtle and nuanced — interested in how people stood and so on."
Mr. Drucker was modest about his gifts. “It took me a long time to learn the skills I have, and it was time-consuming," he said.
He also illustrated children's books and contributed to the vogue for adult coloring books, collaborating with comedy writer Paul Laikin on “The JFK Coloring Book," which sold hundreds of thousands of copies in 1962. Between 1984 and 1987, he collaborated on the syndicated newspaper strip “Benchley," which revolved around a fictional assistant to President Reagan.
Reagan, whom Mr. Drucker had caricatured as the Godfather, Moses, Scrooge, and a slavering Hyde in a 1982 Mad story, “Ronald Reagan — Now Starring at the White House," written by Stan Hart, was evidently a fan of the strip and treated Mr. Drucker and his wife to a private tour of the White House.
Not everyone was so pleased. According to Hendrix, Mad's 1981 parody of “The Empire Strikes Back," “The Empire Strikes Out," prompted the Lucasfilm legal department to send a cease-and-desist letter demanding that the issue be recalled. “Mad replied by sending a copy of another letter they had received the previous month — from George Lucas, offering to buy the original artwork for the 'Empire' parody and comparing Mort Drucker to Leonardo da Vinci."
Lucas knew Mr. Drucker's work well. He had commissioned one of his classic multicharacter pileups as the poster for his first hit, “American Graffiti" — a nostalgic movie set in the same summer “The JFK Coloring Book" was a bestseller. And, of course, Mr. Drucker had illustrated Mad's sendup, “American Confetti."

Texto completo: BERLIN — As the Easter holiday approaches, world leaders and health officials are fervently warning that hard-won gains in the fight against the coronavirus must not be jeopardized by relaxing social distancing.
Chancellor Angela Merkel emphasized that “even short trips inside Germany, to the seaside or the mountains or relatives, can't happen over Easter this year."
New Zealand police warned people not to drive to holiday homes over Easter or risk arrest, while Lithuania was imposing a lockdown on major cities over the holiday.
Portugal halted commercial flights at the country's five international airports and set up checkpoints on major roads and junctions to stop Easter visits. Additional restrictions came into force Thursday for the next four days, including a ban on people leaving their local areas and on gatherings of more than five people.
Greece also tightened restrictions ahead of next week's Orthodox Easter, increasing police roadblocks along highways, doubling fines for lockdown violations, and banning travel between islands.
Swiss police were setting roadblocks at the Gotthard tunnel, seeking to dissuade drivers from heading to the Italian-speaking Ticino region, one of the worst-hit by the pandemic.
Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei suggested mass gatherings may be barred through the holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, which runs from late April through most of May. He urged Shiite faithful to pray at home instead.
Indonesia's president banned civil servants, police officers, military personnel, and employees of state-owned companies from returning to their hometowns to celebrate the end of Ramadan. The annual mass exodus usually involves tens of millions of Indonesians crisscrossing the archipelago of 17,000 islands.

Johnson leaves ICU, but UK faces longer lockdown
LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain was moved out of intensive care on Thursday, a ray of hope for a country that faces several more weeks under lockdown as its death toll from the coronavirus approached 8,000.
Johnson was hospitalized on Sunday evening after a 10-day bout with the virus and transferred to the intensive care unit on Monday after his condition deteriorated. On Thursday, Downing Street said the prime minister, 55, had been moved back to a ward at St. Thomas' Hospital in London and was in “extremely good spirits."
Dominic Raab, Britain's caretaker leader, said that Johnson had made “positive steps" in his recovery. He also signaled that the government would extend the country's lockdown beyond next week.

Spain and Italy to extend lockdowns amid resurgence
Spain is poised to extend a nationwide lockdown, and Italy is moving toward doing the same as Europe's rising infection rate complicates plans to begin reversing stringent restrictions on public life.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez planned to ask parliament for an extension to a state of emergency through April 25. His Italian counterpart, Giuseppe Conte, is preparing to prolong the national lockdown from a current expiration date of April 13 for another two weeks.
The continent has suffered more than 65 percent of worldwide deaths, and Spain, Italy, France, and Germany trail only the United States in infections.

Mask-wearing, common in Asia, spreads in the West
PARIS — Until a few weeks ago, Asian tourists were the only mask wearers in Paris, eliciting puzzlement or suspicion from locals or even hostility.
This taboo is falling fast, not only in France but across Western countries, after mounting cries from specialists who say the practice is effective in curbing the pandemic.
The shift for Western nations is profound and has had to overcome not merely the logistical challenges of securing enough masks, but also a deep cultural resistance and even stigma associated with mask-wearing, which some Western leaders described as “alien."
Seemingly, it won't be for much longer. After discouraging people from wearing face masks, France, like the United States, has begun urging its citizens to wear basic or homemade ones outside. And some parts of Europe are moving faster than the United States by requiring masks instead of simply recommending their use.
This week, Austria moved to become the fourth European nation to require masks in public, after the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Turkey.

Thousands in dorms pose new challenge to Singapore
Tightly packed dormitories housing thousands of foreign workers have emerged as one of Singapore's biggest challenges in its fight to contain the spread of the coronavirus.
The city state reported a record 142 new infections Wednesday, and at least 40 of those were linked to clusters at foreign worker dormitories that house mainly low-wage workers in construction and other sectors. Those groups now account for 253 infections across nine facilities, more than 15 percent of the country's 1,623 cases, according to Ministry of Health data.
Authorities have moved swiftly to isolate the clusters.
For Singapore, a country that has been championed by health officials for its methodical virus response, the move to quarantine potentially exposed workers living in close proximity has raised questions about whether the conditions will allow for social distancing — one of the key strategies utilized around the world.

Ship at center of outbreak raided by Australian police
BRISBANE, Australia — Police wearing protective gear boarded a cruise ship to seize evidence and question the crew of the vessel linked to hundreds of coronavirus infections and 15 deaths across Australia.
About 2,700 passengers disembarked from the ship on March 19 in Sydney, and it has since become the largest source of infections in Australia. More than 600 cases of COVID-19 and 15 deaths are linked the to the ship, the Ruby Princess.
New South Wales police, which boarded the ship Wednesday night south of Sydney, said it's expected to remain in port for 10 days with its 1,040 crew undergoing medical assessments. About 200 crew have shown symptoms of COVID-19, while 18 have tested positive for the virus. The workers remaining on the ship are from 50 countries.

Thai alcohol ban to curb virus now spans 16 million
Bangkok became the latest province in Thailand to temporarily ban alcohol sales in an effort to prevent social gatherings that can spread the virus.
The restriction from April 10 to April 20 is the metropolitan region's latest effort to contain a surge in infections since early March. Alcohol is now proscribed for about 16 million people, as several others among the nation's 77 provinces have already imposed curbs. Thailand as a whole is under a state of emergency and partial lockdown through April.
Officials are trying to entrench social distancing, with roughly a quarter of Thailand's 69 million people under alcohol prohibitions.

Virus invades Saudi inner sanctum, as royals go into seclusion

Texto completo: More than six weeks after Saudi Arabia reported its first case, the coronavirus is striking terror into the heart of the kingdom's royal family.
As many as 150 royals in the kingdom are now believed to have contracted the virus, including members of its lesser branches, according to a person close to the family.
King Salman, 84, has secluded himself for his safety in an island palace near the city of Jiddah on the Red Sea, while Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, his son and the 34-year-old de facto ruler, has retreated with many of his ministers to the remote site on the same coast where he has promised to build a futuristic city known as Neom.
The sickness in the family may also shed new light on the motivation behind the speed and scale of the kingdom's response to the pandemic.
Its rulers began restricting travel to Saudi Arabia and shut down pilgrimages to the Muslim holy sites of Mecca and Medina even before the kingdom had reported its first case, on March 2. Authorities have now cut off all air and land travel into or out of its borders and between internal provinces.
They have placed all of its biggest cities under a 24-hour lockdown, and they have indicated they are likely to cancel the annual hajj pilgrimage this summer that draws 2.5 million Muslims to Mecca and has taken place every year since 1798, when Napoleon invaded Egypt.
State media reported Wednesday that the king suspended final rulings and judicial orders on visitation rights of children of separated parents, and ordered a number of prisoners released.
Saudi officials also announced the kingdom and its allies would observe a unilateral cease-fire in the war in Yemen starting at noon Thursday, a move motivated by fears of the virus spreading and that could pave the way for ending the brutal five-year-old conflict.
New York Times
Some of Europe, 'walking a tightrope,' will loosen rules
BERLIN — Austria is allowing small shops to resume business after Easter. Denmark is reopening nurseries and primary schools. The Czech Republic is planning to lift a travel ban.
Gingerly, and with plenty of caveats, some corners of Europe are tiptoeing toward a loosening of the strict lockdown measures that have been in place for close to a month to slow the spread of the coronavirus, idling economies and leaving citizens in an uneasy limbo of social isolation.
But even as the number of new infections appears to be plateauing in several European countries, the message from leaders is clear: The next phase is not a return to normality. It is learning how to live with the pandemic — possibly for quite a long time.
Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen of Denmark was explicit: “It's like walking a tightrope," she said. “If we stand still, we may fall. If we go too fast, it may soon go wrong. We don't know when we'll be on firm ground again."
European governments are eager to give their citizens a sense of hope and to reboot economic activity, too. But overshadowing that desire is the risk of unleashing a second wave of mass infections.
How soon is too soon to allow the resumption of some activities — and which activities — is the overriding question.

Chaos, joy at Wuhan airport as doctors take flights out
The crowd outside Wuhan's Tianhe International Airport on Wednesday morning pushed forward as anxiety grew over catching their flights out of town -- the first to depart since Jan. 23.
Many were people who had come to the central Chinese city for a Lunar New Year vacation in January and found themselves stuck in a protracted, nightmarish stay as the coronavirus outbreak spread and Hubei province was sealed off to curb it.
The lifting of Wuhan's lockdown will be a crucial test for China, which is driving a narrative of triumph over the pandemic amid accusations it manipulated virus data and concern the highly contagious illness isn't fully stamped out.
Still, Wuhan's emergence from an outbreak that overwhelmed its hospital system and left over 2,500 dead provides a blueprint — and a sense of hope — for other cities currently under lockdown and grappling with still peaking infection rates.
Among those catching flights out were a group of doctors and nurses from northeastern Jilin province, who had traveled to the embattled city to shore up the local health-care system, part of the tens of thousands of medical workers from around the country that were sent in to help.

UK's Johnson still in ICU, with condition improving
LONDON — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson remains in intensive care with the coronavirus but is improving and sitting up in bed, a senior government minister said Wednesday, as the UK recorded its biggest spike in COVID-19 deaths to date.
Johnson, the first world leader diagnosed with the disease, has spent two nights in the ICU at St. Thomas' Hospital in London.
That glimmer of good news came as the number of COVID-19-related deaths in Britain approached the peaks seen in Italy and Spain, the two countries with the greatest number of fatalities.
Britain's confirmed death toll reached 7,097 Wednesday, an increase of 938 from a day earlier. Italy recorded a high of 969 deaths on March 27 and Spain 950 deaths on April 2.
The toll in the UK included the first eight doctors or doctors-to-be publicly reported to have died after catching the virus in Britain's National Health Service, according to a New York Times report.
All eight are immigrants — from Egypt, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Sudan — attesting to the extraordinary dependence of Britain's treasured health service on workers from abroad.

Ecuador gives glimpse into impact on Latin America
QUITO, Ecuador — Bodies left out on sidewalks. Authorities struggling to keep track of deaths. Funeral parlors, out of coffins, using cardboard boxes made by companies that package bananas and shrimp.
The calamity unfolding in Ecuador's business capital, Guayaquil, offers an ominous look at how officials' ability to respond to the pandemic in Latin America can be dangerously hamstrung by the inequality, weak public services, and fragile economies that mark much of the region.
A country of 17 million, ­Ecuador has one of the highest official rates of infections, and deaths, per capita in Latin America. It is still unclear why it has been affected so deeply. Some specialists believe that the virus may have traveled along the country's deep migratory links with hard-hit Spain and Italy, then spread as Ecuador lagged in adopting social distancing.
Ecuador's death count rose to 220 on Tuesday, with 182 other cases listed as “probable" but unconfirmed — higher than its larger and more populous neighbors Peru and Colombia.
Ecuador's president, Lenín Moreno, has warned that the real figure is much higher but that because testing is limited the true extent of infections is impossible to determine.

Texto completo: LAKE WORTH BEACH — City commission meetings are normally uneventful affairs holding interest only to those within a town’s boundaries.
But an emergency meeting of the Lake Worth Beach city commission on March 19 was far different, turning into a verbal free-for-all that drew national attention, including from The Washington Post and The New York Times.
A two-minute video clip of a high-volume argument between Mayor Pam Triolo and Commissioner Omari Hardy went viral and has been viewed more than 6 million times.
At 6 p.m. today, the five-member commission will meet for the first time since March 19.
The session will be held at City Hall but not from the commission chambers. Instead, each member of the board will participate remotely from their respective offices and the meeting will be broadcast live on YouTube.
The commission is expected to hear from City Manager Michael Bornstein, who has been running day-to-day operations since state of emergencies were declared by the county and state as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.
It was Bornstein’s refusal to schedule an emergency meeting on March 13 to discuss the city’s response to the pandemic that set off the vitriol between Hardy and Triolo.
During the confrontation, Hardy questioned Triolo’s leadership and said her failure to push for the March 13 meeting resulted in the city shutting off utilities to residents “in the middle of a global health crisis.”
Triolo has not commented publicly since the video aired except for an interview with The New York Times in which she spoke of receiving death threats. Attempts to reach Triolo have been unsuccessful.
Hardy said he’s communicated with Triolo a couple of times since March 19. After one of those conversations, Hardy posted a message on Twitter asking that her critics act with “compassion and empathy” toward the mayor.
Hardy said he’s “interested in moving forward” as difficult as that might be.
“It’s not unreasonable to expect that what happened at the last meeting is going to affect the relationship that I have with my colleagues and our ability to work with each other,” Hardy said. “I’m not naive. But I can tell you I’m going to show up to our meeting ready and willing to get things done that will help folks in the city.”
Hardy said he wants the commission to discuss two issues related to personal protection equipment. One would require businesses in the city to outfit their employees with protective equipment like masks and gloves. The second proposal would require customers of “essential” businesses also to use protective equipment or not receive service.
Commissioner Scott Maxwell declined to respond to a question regarding fallout from the March 19 meeting, but said he felt the city was being led in a responsible manner.
“I think we need to get back to talking about the city and the residents and making sure they’re safe and healthy,” Maxwell said.

Media get cold feet after reporting Democrats torpedoed COVID-19 bill, change headlines to spread bipartisan blame

Texto completo: This is fast becoming my favorite genre of journalism: A major news outlet will at first report accurately on a breaking news event, but then amend its own headline later in such a way as to make sure it does not a) reflect well on Republicans or b) reflect poorly on Democrats.

On Thursday, for example, after Senate Democrats killed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s small-business COVID-19 relief package, CNN published a breaking news headline that read, “Democrats block GOP-led funding boost for small business aid program.”

There is nothing wrong with that headline. It is entirely accurate!

But CNN changed it anyway to remove all negative implications for Democratic lawmakers. The headline now reads, “Senate at stalemate over more COVID-19 aid after Republicans and Democrats block competing proposals.” Well, shucks, wouldn’t you know it? There is blame to go around for everyone!

Politico did the same thing. Its initial headline claimed Thursday afternoon, “Senate Dems to block new coronavirus relief in bid for more money.” Its revised headline, however, now suggests there is blame to go around. It now reads, “Senate brawl derails fast push for new coronavirus relief.”

Then, of course, there is the New York Times, which reported originally on its live updates blog, “Democrats block G.O.P. proposal for aid to businesses, request more fund.” That has since been amended to read “As Economy Hemorrhages Jobs, Aid Stalls in Senate.”

The really funny thing about this is: These are not even the first examples in this media trend.

In late March, immediately after Senate Democrats scuttled a trillion-dollar-plus coronavirus relief package, the New York Times declared in its initial breaking news headline, "Democrats Block Action on $1.8 Trillion Stimulus."

That headline did not last long.

It was soon changed to, “Democrats Block Action on Stimulus Plan, Seeking Worker Protections.” Amazingly, it was changed a third time and a fourth time, to “Partisan Divide Threatens Deal on Rescue Bill,” and then to “Emergency Economic Rescue Plan in Limbo as Democrats Block Action.”

All this to avoid stating simply that Senate Democrats torpedoed a coronavirus relief package that Congress’ upper chamber was ready to pass until House Speaker Nancy Pelosi decided to upend negotiations with a ludicrous counterproposal chockablock with irrelevant and politically charged kickbacks. The bill eventually passed, by the way, with few, if any, of Pelosi’s wish list of garbage items.
In all these examples, the headlines have been amended in a way that spares Democratic lawmakers the bad press. It would be one thing if the headlines were amended merely for clarity or brevity’s sake. But it is impossible to ignore that the edits all serve one specific political party’s interests.

Anyway, three cheers for CNBC, which broke the news of the torpedoed deal Thursday with an accurate headline, and then stuck to its guns even after it updated its reporting with new details.

“Democrats block McConnell's effort to get unanimous support for $250 billion in additional small business aid,” reads CNBC’s breaking news alert.

Its updated story headline current reads “Senate adjourns until Monday after Democrats block McConnell’s bid to add $250 billion in small business aid.”

See? That was not so hard, was it?

Liberty's Falwell threatens to sue New York Times for 'fake' COVID on campus report

Texto completo: Claiming “enough is enough,” Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. is taking legal action against several media outlets for “fake news” reports that he irresponsibly reopened the school amid the coronavirus outbreak, sickening students.
In aggressive actions, the school pushed for and won two arrest warrants against a New York Times freelance photographer and a ProPublica reporter and threatened to sue the New York Times if it doesn’t retract its March 29 story that the school brought students back after spring break, “then students started getting sick.”
Falwell ripped the reports as "fake news" and told Secrets, “The bottom line is that we have no students with COVID-19, no symptoms. And it’s so sad that they want to try to turn this into something political.”

He added, “We’re an easy target, we’re conservative. But it’s sad that they would use something as grave as the virus that’s killing people to push their political agenda, and we decided that enough is enough.”
In late March, the New York Times and ProPublica reported that the school in Lynchburg, Virginia, reopened while other schools had closed as the virus exploded nationally and as Virginia instituted several shutdowns to stop its spread.
The New York Times headlined the article as “Then students started getting sick,” and it cited one student that tested positive and several were required to self-quarantine.
The stories spread through the nation like wildfire, prompting condemnations and criticism of Falwell, who has been in the media’s sights for his embrace of President Trump.
Screen Shot 2020-04-09 at 8.00.31 AM.png
But Falwell said that the school never reopened and only invited students with “no place else to go or no place safe to go” to return, requiring them to follow the state’s safe-distance rules, similar to those in place at Virginia Tech, UCLA, and other big campuses. About 1,000 of the school’s 16,000 students are on campus today and are taking online-only classes like others at home.
Those in self-quarantine did so because they returned from virus hot spots such as New York, as national health officials have demanded, and did not test positive. The one student who did was an online student and had not recently visited the campus.
The state health department conducted two surprise inspections and found everything in order and in compliance with Gov. Ralph Northam’s rules. “All operations appeared to be in compliance with the governor’s emergency order,” said Jim Bowles, a state health manager before the New York Times and ProPublica stories appeared.
Falwell has requested retractions, but they haven’t come.
Screen Shot 2020-04-09 at 8.01.59 AM.png
As a result, this week the school won arrest warrants against Julia Rendleman, a New York Times freelance photographer, and Alec MacGillis, a ProPublica reporter, for allegedly trespassing on campus. Falwell told us that each entrance has a no trespassing notice. Liberty shared copies of the warrants with Secrets.
He also raised concerns that the reporter and photographer may have come from hot spots, potentially endangering those on campus.
Liberty’s lawyer, Michael Bowe, also sent a letter (shown below) to the New York Times demanding a retraction.
“This libelous story has inflicted substantial harm on Liberty University’s reputation and caused it to expend substantial time and resources addressing. LU hereby demands that this story be retracted in its entirety, and that the New York Times and those who worked on this story immediately implement a litigation hold as potential litigation is imminent,” it added.
The school is considering legal action against other media outlets that went with the “fake news” narrative, said Falwell.
The New York Times and ProPublica said their journalists were doing their jobs. “We are disappointed that Liberty University would decide to make that into a criminal case and go after a freelance journalist because its officials were unhappy with press coverage of the university's decision to convene classes in the midst of the pandemic,” New York Times spokesperson Eileen Murphy said of the warrants.
Falwell said that he is ready to fight further against what he sees as a liberal media assault on his conservative and religious school started by his father.
“We decided that we can’t let them get away with this,” he said.

Texto completo: The claim: Coronavirus patients are dying alone in hospitals
As the number of globally confirmed cases of the coronavirus climbs, hospitals scramble to accommodate patients while ensuring the health and safety of staff.
One Facebook post urged people to think before they leave the house about the patients who are dying alone in hospitals. The post was shared about 7,900 times since March 31.
Hospital accommodations for coronavirus patients range from designating specific units for COVID-19 treatment, asking retired staff to return to work and limiting visitor interaction.
Though regulations vary by hospital and by state, to prevent more community spread, hospitals in all 50 states, and across the world, bar visitors.
There is no sweeping regulation that prohibits visitors, but many hospitals implemented a no-visitor policy.
For example, MedStar Health, in the Washington area, released guidelines for all of its hospitals that went into effect April 3, stating no visitors are permitted at any hospital location. Any exceptions are subject to high-level approval. The University of Chicago Medical Center implemented a visitor restriction policy that gives a one-visitor exception for labor and delivery.
Most hospitals that implemented these restrictions make exceptions only for patients receiving end-of-life care, hospitalized children and women in labor.
It is unknown what factors are taken into consideration when determining visitor allowance, especially if the patient has been infected with the coronavirus. Hospitals evaluate each visitation request on a case-by-case basis.
Northwell Health in New York required its hospitals to suspend all visitation unless there is an extraordinary circumstance. The hospital system provided for some exceptions that require a visitor has not been exposed to COVID-19.
Under such policies across the country, implementation of visitor restrictions falls typically to individual hospitals, but those decisions could be overruled if state or federal government steps in.
The New York-Presbyterian hospital system barred all visitors after discovering multiple patients in its labor and delivery units had the coronavirus, despite showing minimal or no symptoms. After this move, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed an executive order requiring all medical facilities licensed by the state to allow one visitor for patients in labor.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a hospital preparedness checklist to help prepare hospitals for the event of a community outbreak. It includes several suggestions on visitation and communicating hospital policies on visitation rules.
Limits on visitors have taken an emotional toll on health care workers as well as the families of patients who have died alone. These deaths in isolation prompted health care workers and officials to question when patients can have visitors or whether it should be allowed at all.
Our ruling: True
The post claiming coronavirus patients are dying alone is generally TRUE because it is supported by our research. Though there is not a sweeping, national regulation barring all visitors from all facilities across the country, many hospitals have implemented no-visitor policies or minimal visitor interaction policies, and some states, including New York, have imposed limits on visitation as well.
Exceptions to these policies and limitations generally have been made for patients receiving end-of-life care, hospitalized children and women in labor. Sincerequests for visitation are generally evaluated on a case-by-case basis by each hospital, the factors taken into consideration are inconsistent and unknown.

Texto completo: Why Some COVID-19 Patients Crash: The Body’s Immune System Might Be To Blame Doctors have seen a tragic pattern in some of the worst COVID-19 cases where the patient struggles through the first week of symptoms, seems to be getting better, and then suddenly crashes. Now researchers think the cause of this crash could be the body’s own immune system overreacting to the virus in what is called a "cytokine storm." Listen to the story from NPR.
Is My Takeout Risking Lives or Saving Restaurants?
We want to support local restaurants. But does ordering takeout support the restaurant or put the workers at risk? New York Times restaurant critic Tejal Rao explores the dilemma.
Coronavirus State-By-State Projections: When Will Each State Peak?
This interactive graphic from NPR uses numbers from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation’s COVID-19 projections — the same numbers cited in a recent White House briefing. For each state, you can see the projected peak date, deaths on peak date, hospital bed shortages and cumulative deaths. See the graphic here.
A Nurse Bought Protective Supplies for Her Colleagues Using GoFundMe. The Hospital Suspended Her.
Nurses at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center in New Jersey turned to GoFundMe after being told they needed to reuse personal protective equipment such as masks and gowns. Olga Matievskaya’s campaign raised more than $12,000 and allowed her to purchase PPE on eBay. Then she was disciplined for "inappropriately distributing unauthorized medical supplies." ProPublica looks into brewing confrontations between hospital administrators and health care workers across the country.
How to Look Good on Camera, According to Tom Ford The New York Times calls this "a master class in lighting for your next video conference." In this set of illustrations by Tracy Ma, fashion designer and filmmaker Tom Ford gives columnist Maureen Dowd tips we can all use to look better during the now-ubiquitous video meeting.

Texto completo: In Louisiana, people can analyze how COVID-19 deaths correspond with race and underlying health conditions using publicly reported state data.
In Connecticut and Massachusetts, details on long-term care facility cases are included in state data.
Several states provide heat maps by ZIP code or city, showing where identified cases of the virus are most prevalent.
But in Arizona, the state health data about coronavirus cases that is publicly provided seems to be just above the bare minimum, based on an analysis by The Arizona Republic of COVID-19 data released daily by state health departments in each state and Washington, D.C.
That should improve in the coming week, because Gov. Doug Ducey issued an executive order on Tuesday that requires more data reporting to the state related to COVID-19. The move came after The Republic reported on growing frustration and confusion about the limited information.
Hospitals now must report daily to the state several new statistics related to positive or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Those include the:
Number of inpatients.
Number of ventilators in use.
Number of intensive care beds in use.
Number discharged from the facility per day.
Number seen in the emergency department per day.
Number of intubations performed per day for respiratory distress.
Estimated number of N95 masks, surgical masks, face shields and surgical gowns used per day.
Publicly reported data inform people's understanding of the virus, how it is playing out and how they can make the best decisions for themselves, their families and their communities.
The new coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, has spread quickly. It's a new virus, meaning the manner of its spread is being tracked in real time. That presents challenges for health officials, who are responsible for managing how the state responds to the virus, and for everyday people, who are trying to figure out how to stay safe.
What other states disclose The Arizona Department of Health Services each morning releases statistics, including total cases, deaths and tests, as well as cases and tests by county, age and gender. This basic portfolio is provided by most other states.
But a number of other states disclose additional information Arizona does not. This includes hospitalization and intensive care unit numbers, deaths by county, cases by ZIP code or city, cases by race and ethnicity, recovered cases and breakdowns of how people got infected.
There are two data points in particular the majority of states provide but Arizona does not: hospitalization numbers and deaths by county. Instead, some counties are individually reporting the number of deaths and hospitalization numbers, while most are releasing little information.
Thirty-five states show hospitalization data on their COVID-19 dashboards and 33 states provide the number of deaths in each county. Arizona's state dashboard has neither of those points of information.
Trying to compile the information county-by-county proves difficult. The Republic requested hospitalization rates from all 15 counties last week. Eleven counties provided the information, three said they didn't have the information, and one, Yuma County, declined to provide it.
Even counties are having trouble figuring out these numbers. Pinal County spokesman James Daniels told The Republic last week that 11% of positive cases were hospitalized, 30% were not hospitalized and the county was unsure about the other 59% because of communication gaps between the state-reported information and cases counties are tracking.
In terms of county death numbers, larger counties such as Maricopa, Pima and Coconino report daily death updates. But most other counties do not, making it difficult to understand in which counties the state's deaths — counted at 73 on Tuesday — happened.
Nine states provide daily case breakdowns by race and ethnicity. Arizona does not do this, either. The New York Times reported that the coronavirus is disproportionately killing African Americans due to disparities in health resources and access to care. The statistics are preliminary but based on state and city data. Arizona's data on race and ethnicity remains unknown.
Several states provide downloadable raw data spreadsheets with day-by-day case information. Many have interactive ArcGIS dashboards showing cases across the state. Washington, D.C., provides information on case numbers for public safety and human services personnel. Louisiana, Oregon and North Carolina show numbers on ventilator use.
New Hampshire lists the number of people being monitored for COVID-19 as well as specific places people visited while infected. Ohio and South Carolina present forecast models and projections for how the virus may continue to spread in the states. And North Carolina shows how many outbreaks there are in nursing homes, residential care facilities and correctional facilities.
Other states have struggled to compile comprehensive, statewide data. In California, for instance, individual counties are providing more detailed information while the state dashboard has minimal information. The New York Times described a lengthy process to compile an adequate picture of California's cases using city and county data, which varied widely in terms of breadth and format.
In Kentucky, little information is provided beyond the overall numbers of cases, tests and deaths. The only other readily available data on the state health department's coronavirus webpage is a map of cases by county.
Arizona to expand data disclosure Dr. Cara Christ, the Arizona Department of Health Services director, announced Tuesday the state's case dashboard on Sunday will expand with more data.
"This data will allow us to better prepare for our peak in cases and it will help us identify a better recovery rate for Arizonans affected by this disease," Christ said.
The state's dashboard should include more information than it has so far, Christ said, such as enhanced location data for confirmed cases, more information on deaths and more information on supply distribution. It's not immediately clear what additional data from the executive order will be added Sunday to the dashboard.
The state doesn't have the number of those who have recovered from COVID-19 because if the person was tested at a commercial lab and didn't require follow-up care, their outcome isn't known, Christ said. Later, the state will match cases against data on deaths, which could assess how many recovered from the illness, she said.
"There's not a great way to look at what a definition of recovered is," Christ said.
Eleven states report the number of "recovered" cases or people not required to be isolated on their data dashboards.
Will Humble, executive director of the Arizona Public Health Association, said Ducey's new executive order should help with data collection and, ideally, public reporting. Behind the scenes, the data can help health officials understand where support is needed and which hospitals could be reaching capacity. Now that it's clear the state will have this information, there's probably more benefit than risk in reporting it publicly in a non-identifiable way, he said.
Publicly reporting aggregate information, such as hospitalizations and recoveries, helps people make decisions on how to live their lives, but it also contributes more broadly to a sense of public trust, said Humble, who previously served as director of the state health department. If the public trusts their officials and the information they're receiving, they're more likely to listen when officials ask for behavior changes such as social distancing, he said.
"I think it's valuable in the sense that the public appreciates and deserves transparency from the people that they elect and the appointees that work for them," Humble said.chri
Balancing disclosure with privacy While the public is hungry for as much information as possible about cases and outcomes in Arizona, there are privacy and confidentiality concerns to weigh when disclosing health information, said Leila Barraza, a professor at the University of Arizona's Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health.
"There are definitely considerations to releasing certain information if there's any way it could be traced back to somebody as identifiable," Barraza said.
Laws such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, state confidentiality laws and internal policies may apply to what information can be released and by whom, she said.
Eight states provide numbers drilled down by ZIP code or city. In Arizona, several city, county and state officials filed a lawsuit Friday asking the state to release general coronavirus data to local authorities and the public. The lawsuit asked that "all prior general and non-personally identifiable information" be released, such as the number of positive COVID-19 cases and deaths by ZIP code and date.
Even with ZIP codes, there are different contexts to consider: Releasing information by ZIP code in an urban area may not be identifiable, but in areas with lower populations with fewer cases, it may be, Barraza said.
"Individual ZIP codes might not be advantageous to the public because it's already widespread," Barraza said.

Texto completo: When the American Bicentennial came around in 1976, art museums across the country scrambled to acknowledge the event.
One of the most enduring exhibitions -- "Two Centuries of Black American Art: 1750-1950" -- was organized for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The guest curator was David C. Driskell, who died last week in Maryland from COVID-19 at the age of 88. His passing in this terrible moment prompts reflection.
His show sought to fill a huge gap in traditional American art history, which barely mentioned the work of African American artists -- especially those working before the Black Arts Movement of the civil rights era and the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s. What it did was harness a major platform during a historic moment to insist: Black art matters.

Driskell's was a landmark show, but it almost didn't happen -- for exactly the reason it needed to be done. A matching curatorial gap yawned wide.
In established art museums that claimed significant commitments to American painting and sculpture, curatorial scholarship on the subject of black art remained scant -- too scant for such a high-profile moment as the bicentennial of the nation's founding. Compared to other mostly schmaltzy or unimaginative bicentennial museum offerings around the country, such a show would stand out.
In Washington, D.C., the old National Collection of Fine Arts (now the Smithsonian American Art Museum) chose to organize the first survey of Emanuel Leutze, the German immigrant whose famous "Washington Crossing the Delaware" is the hoariest chestnut in all of American history painting. Its companion National Portrait Gallery did "Abroad in America: Visitors to the New Nation 1776-1914," a show featuring pictures of 34 tourists from Europe, South America, Asia and Africa.
Across the street from the White House, the Corcoran Gallery of Art, now defunct, hosted a rather bizarre event that then toured the country. For "America 76," organized at the behest of the U.S. Department of the Interior, 45 living artists received commissions. They were asked to choose subjects related to department programs -- implicit promotional material for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Bureau of Mines, the Bonneville Power Administration in the Pacific Northwest and more.
There were others, including "A Bicentennial Treasury: Masterpieces From the Metropolitan Museum," a lazy reshuffling of greatest hits from the permanent collection, and the Museum of Modern Art's blinkered "American Art Since 1945," composed almost entirely of paintings by local New York artists. (The only work made in L.A. was, ironically, by African American artist Daniel LaRue Johnson.) Almost all are long since forgotten, and deservedly so.
One exception was the Whitney Museum of American Art's "200 Years of American Sculpture." (The founder of the museum, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, was herself a sculptor.) It was partly memorable because -- like African American art -- museum sculpture shows have historically gotten short shrift. They're unwieldy and expensive to mount.
Of all the bicentennial exhibitions that proliferated that year, however, only one has come down to us four decades later as a milestone -- a turning point in scholarship and a template for curatorial shrewdness.
Driskell's "Two Centuries of Black American Art: 1750-1950" was the first exhibition I saw at LACMA, having moved from New York to Southern California a few months before its Sept. 30 opening. On view were 205 paintings, sculptures, prints, drawings and crafts by 57 men and 9 women -- plus some who were anonymous -- and whose creative lives were established between the 18th and the mid-20th century. It wasn't a perfect show. It didn't always feature the finest examples. Sometimes a viewer was left wanting more.
But those were quibbles. What it accomplished in raising the profile of black art was more important.
Driskell, the guest curator, was a young painter and historian at Fisk University in Nashville. The historically black school had been established for the education of freedmen at the end of the Civil War.
After the LACMA show, the curator went on to a long career at the University of Maryland, where the David C. Driskell Center for the Study of the Visual Arts and Culture of African Americans and the African Diaspora was established in 2001. His LACMA exhibition inspired a CBS television documentary, "Hidden Heritage: Two Centuries of Black American Art," whose popularity with viewers in turn inspired a program for the Arts Council of Great Britain. Driskell's raised profile got him a gig advising Bill Cosby on art collecting.
One surprise in his black art exhibition was "Virginian Partridge," a dramatic 1830 John James Audubon graphic showing a fierce red hawk going after a covey of fluttering quail. Audubon's ethnicity was news to me, as it doubtless was -- and probably still is -- to many. The son of a French slave-owner and merchant sailor in Haiti and his mistress, a Creole chambermaid believed to have been a slave, the artist was raised in France. As a teenager, Audubon immigrated to the United States using a false passport.
If he showed up today, some would seek to deport the nation's greatest, universally beloved wildlife artist -- a French African American undocumented immigrant. Driskell subtly underscored Audubon's tangled yet all-American biography, long since submerged beneath the brilliance of "The Birds of America," his famous compendium of naturalist renderings. The show included an 1860 lithographic portrait of the artist by Jules Lion, a popular New Orleans printmaker and daguerreotypist. The print, based on an earlier work by British portrait miniaturist Frederick Cruickshank, does not divulge Audubon's ethnicity through any visual cues.
Point taken.
To complicate things further, Lion himself may or may not have been black. Born in Paris, he was recorded in one Louisiana city directory with the letters "f.m.c." -- free man of color -- attached to his name. It's the only known reference to the successful artist's racial identity.
The Audubon work was lent to the show by LACMA trustee Sidney Brody, a real estate investor and art collector who helped choose black art history as the museum's bicentennial topic in conversations with two fellow trustees: Franklin D. Murphy, former UCLA chancellor and then chairman and chief executive officer of Times Mirror Co., then-parent of the Los Angeles Times; and Robert Wilson, a stock broker and the board's only African American member.
They, in turn, were no doubt responding to the entreaties of the Black Arts Council. Claude Booker and Cecil Fergerson, art preparators at the museum, had formed the group in the aftermath of the 1965 Watts rebellion to agitate for diversified programming.
One deep, permanent stain on America's founding is its fraught acceptance of white ownership of black human beings. An art exhibition held during a frothy bicentennial celebration that would nonetheless confront the awful fact was bold and brave.
When the idea for the show was presented to LACMA's curatorial staff, however, it said no. The refusal, Driskell later observed, did not spring from racial animus. Curators instead realized they were unequipped to tackle the subject. Trustees turned to L.A. artist Charles White for advice, and he led them to Driskell.
As an artist himself, the curator had a special sensitivity. (A Driskell painting retrospective is currently being jointly organized by the Portland Museum of Art in Maine and Atlanta's High Museum.) The vagaries of ancestry are especially acute for many African Americans, largely because the slave trade severed familial links both within American life and to African origins. One of the show's undercurrents was a tension between personal memory and the cultural associations artists made with African history and art.
The show made a point of stopping short of including postwar artists, skirting the issue of what might or might not be fashionable. Its critical reception reflected some dissatisfaction with that position. Past artists got the bigger critical nod, while limiting inclusion of living artists to those who emerged before 1950 was seen as problematic.
Writing in this newspaper, critics Henry J. Seldis and William Wilson each applauded the show. Seldis registered discomfort with what he perceived to be "separatism" in a show built around the artists' ethnicity. Needless to say, exhibitions composed of all-white artists virtually never caused similar critical distress. When "Two Centuries of Black American Art" got to the Brooklyn Museum (it also traveled to Atlanta and Dallas), Hilton Kramer, the New York Times' lead art critic, was horrified, as expected, by what the reliably conservative reviewer claimed was "more interesting as social history than for its aesthetic revelations."
Driskell was wryly amused. In an oral history for the Archives of American Art a quarter-century later, he credited the inflammatory Kramer review with securing the show's significance.
"Hilton Kramer?" he replied to Tom Brokaw when asked about the negative review on NBC's July 4, 1977, "Today" show. "What does he know about black art?"
Unmentioned, however, was a second New York Times story -- this one a perceptive preview by the paper's art reporter Grace Glueck, published the day before the show's Brooklyn opening. She got straight to the point, praising the way it "forced the examination of work that might otherwise be bypassed," while "documenting the way [artists] have functioned in often daunting circumstances."
Four weeks after Driskell's "Two Centuries of Black American Art" closed at LACMA, the museum opened "Women Artists: 1550-1950" -- the first major international survey of its subject. It traveled to Brooklyn too.
"Women Artists" was a second landmark exhibition, and the second show I saw at the museum. Driskell had landed the first of a one-two punch that changed how we see the world.

Texto completo: Despite guidelines urging telemedicine to slow the spread of coronavirus infections, a number of dermatology offices are promoting in-person visits, including with special senior hours.
Though public health officials are urging medical practices to use virtual patient visits to help slow the spread of the coronavirus, a surprising number of dermatology offices, many of them owned by private equity investment firms, remain open for in-person skin checks and other nonurgent services.
Many dermatologists have closed their offices, instead examining rashes and skin growths via Zoom, FaceTime and photos. But in a study to be published by the Journal of Dermatological Treatment, a group of researchers at the University of Cincinnati called 60 dermatology practices on March 23, when California, Illinois, New Jersey and New York already had stay-at-home restrictions in place, to see if they were open. Of the 55 dermatology practices they reached in six states, 29 said they were open to all patients. Seventeen said they were open only to urgent visits, and nine said they were closed to all patients.
This week, with most of the country under shelter-in-place orders, The New York Times found practices large and small still scheduling in-person visits.
Decisions to keep dermatology offices open for all but the most urgent visits ignore guidelines issued last month by the American Academy of Dermatology, which recommended rescheduling visits for all nonessential medical or surgical visits or, alternatively, offering telemedicine services.
Pinnacle Dermatology, based in Lombard, Ill., with 52 locations in five states, states on its website that it is an "essential business' and its "offices remain open."
Chicago Pacific Founders, a private investment firm, holds a substantial stake in Pinnacle, which is offering telemedicine visits and, for in-person appointments, gives patients the option of waiting in their car. The site says that Pinnacle will continue to do full-body skin checks, and to see patients for rashes, eczema and psoriasis.
Pinnacle is also offering senior hours at 15 of its locations, for patients over age 60.
The multibillion-dollar dermatology services market thrives on large volumes of small procedures like skin biopsies, patch tests, freezing of precancerous lesions, excisions and layered "Mohs" surgery to treat skin cancer, many of them performed on Medicare patients.
A Facebook group of dermatologists has been debating the ethics of keeping practices open. One member of the group reported that her older relatives had received an unsolicited text from Pinnacle, alerting them to the senior hours.
"How unethical to try to get patients let alone seniors out of their homes for an appointment at this time," the dermatologist wrote to the group.
Multiple attempts to reach Pinnacle's chief executive, Chad A. Eckes, were unsuccessful.
"The Covid crisis is bringing out a real tension between what's good for practices versus what's best for our patients, staff and community at large," said Dr. Justin Ko, chief of medical dermatology at Stanford University.
A spate of private-equity acquisitions of dermatology practices in recent years has prompted concern from within the specialty that many of those practices are under increased pressure to generate revenue.
California Skin Institute, a practice with 44 locations throughout California, is not owned by a private equity firm, but Goldman Sachs has a minority investment in it. The practice says on its website that it "is considered an essential business." Callers to the practice get a recorded message stating that it "remains open and fully operational, providing a full range of services."
Dr. Greg S. Morganroth, California Skin Institute's founder and chief executive officer, did not respond to requests for comment, but Jonathan Lindeke, general counsel for the practice, said the company has stopped all cosmetic dermatology, and has furloughed all its aestheticians, laser nurses and cosmetic consultants.
Mr. Lindeke added that the company's "overall business is down substantially." Several office locations have closed, he said, and the majority of offices that remain open are on a reduced schedule.
California Skin Institute is keeping as many offices as possible open, Mr. Lindeke said, for patients who need medical dermatology. This, he said, "keeps the patients out of urgent care centers or the emergency room, reducing the burden on those facilities."
Dr. Carrie Kovarik, a dermatologist at the University of Pennsylvania who is on the American Academy of Dermatology's ad hoc task force on Covid-19, said the decision to remain open is up to individual practices. "The best we can do is offer our guidance and advice," she said.
Dr. Kovarik said her university's dermatology clinics have closed to all but the most urgent cases and is offering virtual visits. Similarly, Stanford Health Care in Northern California, which set up virtual dermatology appointments in early March for patients at its 13 clinics throughout the San Francisco Bay Area, now conducts 98 percent of its patient visits digitally.
Dr. Ko said the only people seen in person at the Stanford clinics are the most urgent cases, such as patients with a suspected melanoma -- the most dangerous form of skin cancer -- who need a biopsy.
"Unfortunately, we can't do a biopsy digitally," he said.
Adults over 65 are at highest risk of severe illness from the coronavirus. At the same time, most people in need of medical dermatology are older adults.
They are more likely to develop nonurgent, slow-growing basal and squamous cell skin cancers than melanoma. Basal and squamous cell skin cancers, which often develop after years of unprotected skin exposure, are 18 to 20 times more common than melanoma. Such cancers are rarely life-threatening, but accurate diagnosis requires a biopsy.
In a 2017 article, The New York Times found a pattern of unnecessary biopsies and other procedures for older adults among dermatologists in the U.S.
Dr. Ko at Stanford said that office visits for slow-growing cancers and other nonurgent problems can pose a danger not only to older patients, but also to office staff and clinicians.
"They're stuck in the middle," he said. "And that's a really stressful, really difficult place to be."

Layoffs and Pay Cuts at Tesla
Tesla plans to cut salaries and furlough some employees starting on Monday, according to an internal memo viewed by The New York Times.
"This is a shared sacrifice across the company that will allow us to progress during these challenging times," Valerie Workman, Tesla's head of human resources for North America, said in the memo. The electric carmaker expects to resume normal operations at its American facilities on May 4, she said.
Salaries will be cut by up to 30 percent for vice presidents and more senior executives and by 20 percent for employees at the director level and above. Pay will be reduced by 10 percent for the rest of Tesla's salaried work force. Tesla employees who cannot work from home and have not been reassigned to other on-site work would be furloughed.
RETAIL
Amazon to Halt Pilot Program
Amazon said it planned to pause a pilot program that shipped products for sellers on its marketplace in a bid to ease the pressures on its logistics operations, which are stretched thin by the surge in online shopping.
The program, called Amazon Shipping, picked up packages that were already packed and labeled from a seller's warehouse and then delivered them using Amazon's delivery network.
HEALTH CARE
Insurance Companies Are Speeding Up Payments
In a sign of just how desperate hospitals and doctors are for cash during the coronavirus pandemic, insurance companies, notorious for slow-walking their payments to health care providers, are now speeding up how quickly they pay.
"There was a universal cry for cash," said Paul Markovich, the chief executive of Blue Shield of California, which said it would advance up to $ 200 million in payments to hospitals and doctors.
With revenue down for operations and other care not viewed as essential, providers are scrambling to pay for protective equipment and other supplies.
UnitedHealth said it would also take a series of steps, like waiving the need for pre-authorization when patients see a new doctor or go to a skilled nursing facility, that should result in nearly $ 2 billion in payments getting in the hands of providers more quickly. Providers could be paid in a matter of days rather than several weeks.
Highmark, a Blue Cross plan in Pittsburgh, said it was advancing more than $ 30 million to primary care doctors, who have been particularly hard hit as many patients have decided to forgo face-to-face doctors' visits.

Texto completo: Mr. Lewis, who is also the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, said he was leaving the company in "strong financial shape."
William Lewis, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal and chief executive of its parent company, Dow Jones, said that he would leave the roles he had held since 2014.
"I am so grateful to all my colleagues at Dow Jones for having made me so welcome, and I am delighted to be leaving the company in such strong financial shape," he said in an email to The New York Times on Wednesday. "Most of all, I am really proud of how we have been able to advance the careers of so many female colleagues at our company."
The Journal published an article on Wednesday saying that his contract had not been renewed. In an email, Mr. Lewis said that was not the case.
"It is all entirely amicable and I was not informed that my contract would not be renewed," he told The Times. "Frankly, it's time for me to get home to London."
In a statement, News Corp., which owns Dow Jones, said Mr. Lewis would continue through the month and his successor would be named shortly.
"Will Lewis has overseen a remarkable period of growth and digital transformation at Dow Jones, making it the finest news and professional information business in the world," said Robert Thomson, the chief executive of News Corp., in the statement.
The announcement comes at a fraught moment for media companies as advertising revenue plummets.
But The Journal has emerged in recent years as one of several nationally oriented newspapers with broad name recognition, deep newsrooms and well-financed backers -- others include The New York Times and The Washington Post. These media companies are seen as being able to weather and even thrive in an environment that has devalued local journalism and placed an imperative on circulation revenue, particularly digital subscriptions.
In the latest earnings release from News Corp., which bought Dow Jones for $ 5 billion in 2007, Mr. Thomson promoted Dow Jones's progress on these fronts, noting double-digit growth in digital subscriptions and a proportion of circulation revenue coming from digital that was greater than The New York Times Company reported, as well as promising digital advertising trends.
In the last several weeks, as the coronavirus pandemic has dominated the news cycle, The Journal removed its paywall for virus-related coverage and had seen sharply higher web traffic and higher rates of new subscribers.
Before he became the chief executive of Dow Jones, Mr. Lewis was an executive at News Corp., which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch. He was previously a reporter and newspaper editor in his native Britain. Mr. Murdoch, 89, the conservative billionaire, remains executive chairman of News Corp. but has ceded much power in recent years to his son, Lachlan, who is co-chairman.
Mr. Lewis and Mr. Thomson presided over a changing of the guard at the top of The Journal newsroom two years ago, appointing Matthew J. Murray to succeed Gerard Baker as editor in chief. Mr. Baker had held the job for more than five years, which were marked by increased readership and award-winning investigations but also strife among some journalists who felt that his past as an outspoken critic of President Barack Obama made him ill-suited to the President Trump era.
In February, Mr. Lewis also had to manage an unusual crisis when three Journal reporters were expelled from China -- the first time China had done so since at least 1998 -- over a headline in The Journal's opinion section. The headline, which referred to China as "the Real Sick Man of Asia," prompted an extraordinary letter signed by more than 50 Journal reporters and editors urging Mr. Lewis and Mr. Thomson to apologize for and change the headline. Neither action was taken.
That crisis has since spiraled into a series of counter expulsions between China and the United States. Last month, the Chinese government, which has also harassed many foreign journalists, expelled more than a dozen foreign journalists from The Journal, The Times and The Post, prompting Mr. Lewis and his counterparts at those two papers to release a rare joint statement pushing for the journalists' reinstatements.

Jail in Chicago Is Top U.S. Hot Spot With More Than 350 Confirmed Cases

Texto completo: At least 1,324 confirmed coronavirus cases are tied to prisons and jails across the United States, according to data tracked by The Times, including at least 32 deaths.
It started small. On March 23, two inmates in the sprawling Cook County jail, one of the nation's largest, were placed in isolation cells after testing positive for the coronavirus. In a little over two weeks, the virus exploded behind bars, infecting more than 350 people.
The jail in Chicago is now the nation's largest-known source of coronavirus infections, according to data compiled by The New York Times, with more confirmed cases than the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt, a nursing home in Kirkland, Wash., or the cluster centered on New Rochelle, N.Y.
The Cook County Sheriff's Office, which operates the jail, said Wednesday that 238 inmates and 115 staff members had tested positive for the virus. But those figures most likely downplay the actual problem, the jail acknowledged, because the vast majority of the jail's 4,500 inmates have not been tested.
"This has been a difficult time for everyone," said Thomas J. Dart, the county sheriff, who has decided to stay away from his wife and children because he fears spreading the virus to them.
Sheriff Dart has established a quarantine area for inmates who have tested positive, and another to monitor those showing symptoms. The most serious cases -- about 17 on Wednesday -- have been admitted to hospitals. One jail inmate has died of what officials believe is complications from the coronavirus, although the medical examiner's office has not yet determined an official cause of death.
"I'm confident we're going to get through this," Sheriff Dart said, "but I could really use some more definition about how long the virus can last in an environment like this."
The ballooning outbreak at the jail, southwest of downtown Chicago, appears to confirm the fears of many health officials, who warned that America's overcrowded and unsanitary prisons and jails would likely be a significant source of the virus's spread.
The New York Times has identified at least 1,324 confirmed coronavirus cases tied to U.S. prisons and jails, including at least 32 deaths. Those numbers are most likely a vast undercount, because some state and local agencies have not released information, and others, including the federal Bureau of Prisons, which has had 337 positive cases and eight deaths, are not testing everyone who falls ill.
Concerns about the virus's spread have prompted authorities across the country to release thousands of inmates, many of whom were awaiting trial or serving time for nonviolent crimes. But those measures have not prevented a dizzying pace of infection among a population in which social distancing is virtually impossible and access to soap and water is not guaranteed.
The rapid transmission has left prisons across the nation in a heightened state of fear, tension and mistrust. Some facilities have placed inmates with fevers in solitary confinement, while some federal prisons and certain state facilities have kept prisoners locked inside their cells for more than 22 hours a day to restrict movement and possible transmission. Still others are shipping prisoners who test positive to hastily established microprisons.
But the greatest concern might be in facilities where little has been done to stop the virus's spread.
"I'm worried sick. If I get this, I'm dead," said Thomas Balsiger, 67, an inmate at the La Tuna federal prison in Texas who has a history of coronary heart disease. He said there are too few protections in place for inmates, and that guards do not always wear masks.
"This is outright reckless endangerment," he said.
The Times has identified at least 41 clusters of two or more coronavirus cases centered on prisons or jails. In addition to Cook County, other large clusters include the Parnall Correctional Facility in Jackson, Mich., which is tied to more than 100 cases; the Stateville Correctional Center in Crest Hill, Ill., linked to more than 90 cases; and the Federal Medical Center in Butner, N.C., where at least 58 inmates and staff have tested positive.
In New York City, which has borne the brunt of the U.S. outbreak, more than half of the jail population had been quarantined by Wednesday as the virus continued to spread through the jails on Rikers Island and in neighboring boroughs. The Department of Correction said 287 inmates, 441 correction staff and 75 health care workers had tested positive, and nearly 1,600 inmates had been released to try to reduce the toll.
The disease has killed seven correction employees and one detainee in New York. More than 10 percent of correction officers have had to quarantine themselves.
In Chicago, Sheriff Dart acknowledged that his attempts to halt the proliferation of the virus, including the release of several hundred inmates charged with or convicted of nonviolent crimes, had failed.
About 86 percent of the jail's remaining inmates are being held on charges related to violent crimes, he said. "We have very little wiggle room."
Sheriff Dart said he had also overridden longstanding rules forbidding hand sanitizer, which has a high alcohol content, among inmates and had ensured that there was sufficient soap and bleach for cleaning.
Some inmates and family members say the sheriff's efforts have not been enough. On Tuesday, in the midst of a ban on gatherings in Chicago, protesters drove around the jail, honking horns and demanding the release of their loved ones.
Advocates and family members have filed a federal lawsuit seeking the early release of older Cook County inmates and those who have chronic medical conditions like respiratory illnesses and diabetes, which may make them particularly vulnerable to the virus.
Similar suits are being filed across the country. On Monday, the A.C.L.U. sought the release of inmates at the Oakdale federal prison in Louisiana who are at a higher risk of serious illness or death from the virus. The Oregon Justice Resource Center filed a federal class-action lawsuit accusing the state's Department of Corrections of ignoring the public health threat. And on Wednesday, the A.C.L.U. announced that it was seeking an emergency order to force a sheriff in Colorado to comply with social distancing for all high-risk people in the Weld County jail.
Jodi Zils Gagne, an inmate at the federal prison camp in Danbury, Conn., said she had not had symptoms of the virus, but was concerned she may be vulnerable because she has multiple sclerosis. Danbury's prison complex currently has at least 46 cases among inmates and employees.
Ms. Zils Gagne, who was convicted in a fraud case, has asked for release from the prison facility, based on her medical condition. She recently wrote in an email, "I have a motion before my judge, and I am hoping she will see that I do not deserve a death sentence."
Last week, the judge denied her request.

Texto completo: The Limelight and Tunnel are long gone. But the story of their vilified owner is still being written.
"Thoughts flash in your mind of incredible nights here, whether it was Jay-Z, or Junior Vasquez, or the thousands of people inside and outside, waiting in line," said Peter Gatien, the nightclub impresario who lorded over the 1990s club scene in New York City.
It was a brisk Wednesday in early March, a few days before the city shut down because of the new coronavirus, and Mr. Gatien was at La Colombe, a cafe inside the brick warehouse that once housed the Tunnel, the massive nightclub on West 27th Street that is now celebrated as a crucible of hip-hop.
"Just the raw energy, the exuberance," he said, sipping an iced tea. "You don't see it anymore."
Times change. The Tunnel, a former warehouse where Biggie Smalls and Busta Rhymes once barked out raps to frenzied throngs, is converting to offices and luxury retail, blending seamlessly with the gleaming Hudson Yards to the north.
And Mr. Gatien, with his icy demeanor and swashbuckler eye patch, is no longer the "King of Clubs," as he was hailed by The New York Post in his '90s heyday. His spectacle megaclubs in the city -- Limelight, Palladium, Club USA and the Tunnel -- were raking in more than $ 1 million a week at the time, he said, before a drug trial, which he ultimately won, cost him, well, basically, everything.
With his memoir, "The Club King," published on April 1, he hopes for a degree of catharsis after an epic rise and fall, but also to celebrate a lost New York, when clubs felt mysterious and transgressive, luring the misfits and outcasts from the city's creative underground, and every night felt like a Mardi Gras on Mars.
"It was the last of an era: predigital, pre-social media," he said. "People didn't even have cellphones. You really had to go out to find out what was happening."
End of the Party
Mr. Gatien, too, no longer looks quite so swashbuckling, his razor cheekbones now softer, his eye patch (worn since childhood, after he lost an eye in a baseball game in which a broomstick was being used as a bat) now replaced by dark glasses. Wearing a vintage Gaultier spring coat over a black hoodie, with oversize white headphones cradling his neck, he seemed at ease just to blend in.
"I like being anonymous," he said.
Over the past two decades, he has certainly accomplished that.
Mr. Gatien was acquitted of his drug-racketeering and conspiracy charge in 1998 but was deported to Canada after pleading guilty to subsequent state tax-evasion charges. He now lives a quiet life in a three-bedroom apartment in Toronto with his third wife, Alessandra, and has spent the bulk of the last two decades trying to put his life back together.
Over the years, there were attempts to break into boutique hotels, and write an "Entourage"-esque series about a 1990s club kingpin. His splashy 2007 return to the nightclub business -- a four-story club in Toronto called Circa, with a campy space-age theme -- lasted only a year.
But his cultural imprint remains.
The actor Dylan McDermott played Mr. Gatien in the 2003 film "Party Monster," about the gruesome murder of a club kid by a Limelight promoter, Michael Alig (played by Macaulay Culkin). The Tunnel was lionized as rap's lost city of Atlantis in the 2016 documentary "The Hip-Hop Nucleus."
And a 2011 documentary, "Limelight," offered a kaleidoscopic look back to that sordid netherworld, but Mr. Gatien was not exactly effusive in the film. "Perched palely on a tall stool, rocking dark sunglasses or his signature eye patch," the New York Times review read, the gangly club kingpin "remains largely an enigma."
Even so, the memoir provides Mr. Gatien a chance to set the record straight. Portrayed over the years as a genius and a hustler, a megalomaniac and a Sphinx, he is looking forward to the chance to control the narrative for a change.
"If you only read The New York Post from 1996 to 2000, then I'm a villain," he said. "It hurts. I was a hard-working guy who spent nearly 20 years in nightlife in the city."
But, he added, "I was an easy target. I was the guy in the eye patch."
An Empire of Excess
Whatever else you may say about Mr. Gatien, who is 68, he never aimed small. He opened his first club in the mill town of Cornwall, Ontario, when he was in his early 20s and managed to lure a young band from Toronto band by the name of Rush for its opening week, he says in the book.
He later moved to Miami, where he converted a nightclub called Rum Bottoms into a discothèque called Limelight, and booked rising acts like Grace Jones and the Village People.
In following years, he opened Limelights in Chicago, London and Atlanta, where, he writes in his book, a live panther briefly roamed beneath a tempered glass dance floor. The stunt prompted the ire of a local animal rights organization, but the buzz also lured the likes of Rod Stewart and Andy Warhol, he writes.
The New York Limelight, of course, had to go even bigger. When Mr. Gatien first glimpsed the former Church of the Holy Communion in Chelsea, the empty church seemed beyond resurrection. Plaster was peeling off the walls, and dusty mahogany pews were scattered on warped floorboards.
It was, in other words, perfect. "I fell in love with that building," he said. The Gothic Revival church also provided a bump in publicity when a handful of picketers showed up on opening night carrying placards with messages like "Don't Dance on My Religion," alongside clubgoers hauling a life-size cross carrying a Jesus figure in a loincloth.
Along with goths, drag queens, rockers, leather boys and slumming socialites, the Limelight became the home to the '90s club kid moment. Arty outsiders and fashion iconoclasts favoring lip piercings and pancake makeup reframed dance-floor revelry as an art movement of sorts -- a swirling blend of techno music, Carnival-level costumery and, yes, drugs (particularly Ecstasy).
"I'm a good shepherd," Mr. Gatien said. "I was a shepherd of talent. I always got a lot of gratification standing in the back of the balcony, seeing 3,000 below waving their hands in the air."
At Limelight, he added, "we had people in sequins showing up alongside people in tuxedos coming from a dinner at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. If everybody is dressed in Armani, it's boring. If everybody is super-sequins, it's boring. The most important thing you can do in a club is to draw an eclectic crowd. In the end, they entertain each other."
Mr. Gatien found success in his adopted city, but he did not find universal love. The Village Voice called him "a bit of a cold fish." New York magazine described him as "a provincial money man who didn't make the scene, but made a fortune off it." Even his staff nicknamed him "the Ghost."
"I don't know if it's because I'm a small-town Canadian kid," he said, "but I'm much more comfortable in the shadows."
The Tunnel, too, served as a clubhouse for a marginalized population in need of one, he said. Located in a neighborhood that was then an industrial backwater, the club provided a safe space in downtown Manhattan for large groups of young African-Americans.
As Datwon Thomas, the editor of Vibe, wrote in 2018: "You couldn't go to the notoriously badass function that took place on Sunday nights if you were faint of heart. Meanwhile, you weren't a top-tier rapper if you didn't perform at the perpetually packed venue."
With Funkmaster Flex wrangling talent, big names including Dr. Dre, Lil' Kim, 50 Cent, Missy Elliott, Jay-Z, Nas and Snoop Dogg all played Sunday night at the Tunnel. And they played for free, Mr. Gatien said, because, well, it was Sunday night at the Tunnel.
It was the days before bottle service, and the Tunnel was also a place for the elites of rap to scale the heights of conspicuous consumption. Leaning over the massive bar at the center of the room, Sean Combs and Jermaine Dupri used to compete to see who could line up more empty Cristal bottles, Mr. Gatien writes in the book.
"Everybody was dancing," Mr. Gatien said. "Even the security girls, once the rush was over. And when everybody was leaving the place, there were so many smiles." He remembers thinking, he said, that everyone who had been at the club was going to have sex that night.
It would not last, however. None of it would.
Losing It All
"The owner of three of Manhattan's largest nightclubs was accused yesterday of turning two of them -- the Limelight and the Tunnel -- into virtual drug supermarkets," The New York Times reported on May 16, 1996, "peddling the drug known as Ecstasy to a clientele made up largely of college students and teen-agers."
Mr. Gatien does not deny the Ecstasy use in his clubs; the drug was everywhere in the '90s nightlife, he said. "Was it looser than it should have been?" Mr. Gatien said. "Truthfully, yeah. Was it looser than anywhere else in town? No, absolutely not."
"My mind-set was, the drug wasn't good for business, in that people don't drink on Ecstasy," he said. "But people don't fight on Ecstasy, either, so it's not like you're having blood baths like with people drinking too much tequila."
Nonetheless, his own drug use was starting to spiral.
Mr. Gatien, who was then living with Alessandra and his two daughters in a handsome townhouse on East 63rd Street, off Fifth Avenue, made a point of staying clean during work hours. But he eventually succumbed to the temptation and business pressures.
At times he would book a $ 1,000-a-night Manhattan hotel suite and spend a weekend freebasing cocaine naked with a group of "party girls."
"It was total selfishness," he said. "I'm not justifying it, but the way I looked at it then, I was in an industry where I didn't have time to take 10 days to go off to California to unwind. In my mind, I'd just bang it out for two days, then go back to work."
When police raided the Limelight in the fall of 1995, his empire was living on borrowed time. As the investigation widened, undercover agents were soon swarming Limelight, some, he writes in the book, dressed in highly unconvincing drag, or wearing dog collars.
After his arrest, the legal odyssey lasted two and a half years until he was acquitted of all drug charges in 1998. Jurors "clearly rejected the testimony of a drug-dealing former club director and five other dealers who pleaded guilty to drug-conspiracy charges and agreed to testify against Mr. Gatien in return for leniency," The Times reported.
Even so, the government found a way to get rid of him, deporting him to Toronto in 2003 after his guilty plea to state tax evasion charges. (He paid some club employees in cash.)
On visits to New York in the ensuing years, he has made a point of avoiding the former Limelight church, which over the years has housed boutiques, restaurants and a gym.
"It's very emotional for me," he said. "I had it for almost 20 years. That's like an eternity in the nightclub business. Most clubs -- a year and a half, two years, and that's it."
While he has entertained the idea of getting an investment group together and creating a boutique hotel, with the Limelight building as the lobby, he will never return to the nightclub business, he said.
"I've been approached by Vegas," he said. "I don't even respond to the calls. It's a young man's game."

With Johnson ailing, UK faces a leadership quandary

Texto completo: LONDON — The British government hurtled into uncharted territory Tuesday, with its foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, taking up the day-to-day duties of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was being treated in an intensive care unit as he battled a worsening case of the coronavirus.
Britain, with no written constitution, does not have a codified order of succession. That legal lacuna has prompted questions during prior episodes where prime ministers fell ill or underwent surgery, and now looms large at a time when Britain faces its greatest crisis since World War II.
Raab, 46, as first secretary of state, would become the government's de facto leader if the prime minister could not carry out his duties. He was “deputized" by Johnson on Monday, led the government's daily meetings about the pandemic, and will probably take on additional duties, with Johnson's prognosis so uncertain.
The government said Johnson, who has suffered symptoms of the virus for 11 days, was moved into intensive care Monday evening after his condition deteriorated sharply. He has received “standard oxygen treatment" but is breathing on his own and has not been put on a ventilator, officials said Tuesday. Nor has he been diagnosed with pneumonia, they said.
Still, how the government will function if the prime minister is out for a prolonged period, or dies, is not yet clear.
The government will face momentous decisions, including when and how to lift the lockdown on Britain. Johnson, 55, had been leading that process and communicated the government's measures to the public in daily briefings, where his familiar shambling style gave way to a graver mien.
Raab, by contrast, has been a peripheral figure in the government's response, mostly focusing on organizing evacuation flights to bring back Britons stranded overseas. He is best known for his hard-line views on Brexit, which helped him get his post in Johnson's pro-Brexit Cabinet.
No other Western government has been so ravaged by the virus, and it comes after 3½ years of political upheaval. Even before this crisis, analysts said Johnson's Cabinet was weak, in part because he purged several senior party members during last fall's bitter debate over Brexit.

Japan finally declared an emergency, but is it too late?
TOKYO — For months, Japan has confounded the world by reporting a relatively low rate of coronavirus infections without imposing the kind of stringent measures used by other nations.
As the country now declares a state of emergency in the face of a worrisome rise in cases, medical specialists are wondering whether the move Tuesday has come just in time to avoid calamity, or is too little, too late.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, in announcing that the declaration would apply to Japan's biggest population centers for the next month, painted an optimistic picture. By asking citizens to significantly reduce human-to-human contact, he said, “the expansion of infections can be turned to a decline in two weeks."
But some specialists said the state of emergency amounted to a tacit admission that the approach the country had stood by for months was no longer working, as Japan reached 3,906 confirmed cases Tuesday, exactly double the number a week earlier.

Turkey orders people to wear masks, as infections climb
ISTANBUL — Turkey has ordered all citizens to wear masks when shopping or visiting crowded public places and announced that it will deliver masks to every family, free of charge, as infections increase in the country of 80 million.
The order is the latest in a gradual tightening of antivirus measures by a government that has insisted the virus was under control and has resisted a complete lockdown.
Turkey has more than 34,000 confirmed cases of the virus and has registered 725 deaths. More than 1,400 patients are in intensive care units and at least 600 medical workers have been infected, according to figures released Tuesday by the Health Ministry.
The number of confirmed cases places Turkey among the top 10 currently worst-affected countries and reflects a steep rise since its first confirmed death from the disease on March 17.

Europe's nursing homes in spotlight for uncounted dead
ROME — Italian authorities said Tuesday they were investigating the country's biggest nursing home where 70 residents died last month, in a stark reminder of the difficulties Europe faces in accurately counting its pandemic victims, particularly among the elderly
Lombardy regional Governor Attilio Fontana said he had opened a commission of inquiry into the deaths at Milan's Pio Albergo Trivulzio home, given published assertions by a doctor and a union leader that management downplayed the risk of infection and wrongly attributed the causes of death. La Repubblica newspaper said Milan prosecutors had opened a criminal investigation.
The Trivulzio home, which has 1,000 residents, disputed the Repubblica report, saying it had abided by all health care precautions, that COVID-19 tests simply weren't available for its sick residents, and that the number of dead was in line with its 2019 toll.
Nursing home deaths have come to represent a significant hidden toll from the pandemic in Europe, since many elderly were never tested for the coronavirus, were never hospitalized, and their deaths were never counted in official virus tolls.

Most people on Antarctica cruise ship have coronavirus
MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay — Nearly 60 percent of 217 people — many from Australia, Europe, and the United States — on board a cruise ship off the coast of Uruguay have tested positive for the coronavirus, the ship's operator said Tuesday.
“There are currently no fevers on board, and all are asymptomatic," said Aurora Expeditions, the Australian operator of the Greg Mortimer ship that is working to disembark the crew and passengers and arrange flights to their home countries.
The Greg Mortimer departed March 15 on a voyage to Antarctica and South Georgia that was titled “In Shackleton's Footsteps," a reference to the polar explorer who led British expeditions to the region and died there in 1922.
Of 217 people tested on the vessel, 128 were positive for the virus that causes COVID-19 and 89 tested negative, Aurora Expeditions said.
Another six people who were evacuated from the ship are in stable condition and being treated in Montevideo.
In a separate case, a cruise ship anchored in Santos, on the coast of Brazil's Sao Paulo state, had its quarantine extended until at least April 19 after doctors found new suspected cases of the coronavirus, according to Brazilian officials. There are now 40 suspected cases aboard the Costa Fascinosa vessel, which is owned by Costa Cruises. Hundreds of people are on the ship.

US sees lower death toll possible

Texto completo: US authorities on Tuesday reported 29,000 more people infected with the novel coronavirus and more than 1,800 more deaths — the highest daily death toll so far.
But amid the grim data, some officials said they saw grounds for hope that the pandemic's devastation would at least not be as bad as the direst projections.
New York, the state hit hardest by the virus, reported its highest-ever daily death toll: 731. But Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo said the number of new patients admitted to hospitals appeared to be trending downward.
"Right now we're projecting that we are reaching a plateau in the total number of hospitalizations, and you can see the growth and you see it starting to flatten," Cuomo told reporters Tuesday.
Nationwide, one computer model of the disease's future spread — relied upon by governors and the White House — shifted its estimate of COVID-19's US death toll downward this week. Instead of roughly 94,000 deaths as estimated a week ago, the University of Washington model now predicts about 82,000 by late summer.
"Even during this painful week, we see glimmers of very, very strong hope," President Trump told reporters Tuesday. Vice President Mike Pence added that "we continue to see evidence of stabilization" in hard-hit areas.
Still, what is passing for good news still means about 70,000 Americans alive today may die by August. The models predict the worst day for deaths will be around April 16, meaning daily death tolls will grow higher until then.
Yet the tone of some of the nation's top experts has changed in the past 48 hours.
"You're starting to see that we may be actually — in a series of communities outside of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut — creating a much flatter graph, a much flatter curve," said Deborah Birx, director of the White House coronavirus response.
That echoed Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a day earlier.
"Everybody who knows me knows I'm very conservative about making projections, but those are the kind of good signs that you look for," Fauci said of the New York figures.
But some experts urged caution.
"From all the data we have, it suggests we're just beginning to approach the peak for several regions of the country," said Marynia Kolak, assistant director of health informatics at the University of Chicago's Center for Spatial Data Science. She said she is worried about future surges in tribal areas in the Southwest, and in areas of the South where social distancing measures were implemented just recently.
Washington Post
States, courts move to put limits on abortion
Texas struck a blow against abortion rights when a federal appeals court ruled the state can ban most procedures as long as the governor's emergency health decree to save medical supplies for fighting the pandemic is in effect.
A three-judge panel in New Orleans said in a 2-1 ruling that a woman's constitutional right to abortion can be temporarily set aside during a national health emergency.
US Supreme Court precedent says “all constitutional rights may be reasonably restricted to combat a public health emergency," Circuit Judge Kyle Duncan, who was appointed by President Trump, wrote in the majority opinion.
The ruling came after clinics, impatient for guidance, threatened to escalate the issue to the Supreme Court on Wednesday morning.
A March 22 order by Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, banned all nonessential medical procedures in order to preserve hospital beds and personal protective equipment for treating COVID-19 patients. The order applies to even nonsurgical abortions that don't require masks and gloves, and violators face steep fines and jail time, according to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, also a Republican.

Crew member on hospital ship tests positive
A crew member aboard the Navy hospital ship USNS Comfort tested positive for the coronavirus, and several others have gone into isolation, the Navy said Tuesday, the latest setback in the ship's troubled mission to New York to assist in the pandemic response.
News of the infection came a day after President Trump relented to pressure from New York hospitals and allowed the Comfort to begin accepting patients who had the virus.
The ship arrived last week with great fanfare and was supposed to relieve pressure on New York's overburdened hospitals by taking patients suffering from other ailments.
But bureaucratic hurdles, as well as a sharp decline in hospitalizations unrelated to the virus, resulted in few patients being transferred to the ship.
By Thursday, the 1,000-bed ship had only 20 patients. The empty beds angered hospital leaders, whose facilities have been overwhelmed with people sick with COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus.
New York Times
Governor looks at 'new options' after criticism
SAVANNAH, Ga. — Georgia Governor Brian Kemp is “considering new options" amid criticism from local officials for his order that reversed beach closures and other restrictions imposed by cities and counties to battle the coronavirus, the governor's spokeswoman said Tuesday.
Kemp's executive order last week requiring Georgia residents to shelter at home, except under prescribed exceptions, drew an outcry from some city and county leaders for a provision that rolled back any tougher restrictions already imposed by local governments. Those nullified restrictions included local decisions to close public beaches on the 100-mile Georgia coast.

Nurses from Philippines await visas to help US
As the coronavirus pandemic threatens to strain nursing staffs at hospitals across the United States, Melanie N. Beckham knows where to find reinforcements. But first, the Trump administration needs to give its approval.
Beckham, president of Vintage Health Resources Inc. in Germantown, Tenn., specializes in helping hospitals throughout the southeastern US hire nurses from the Philippines, a country with a large population of English speakers and a long history of sending health care workers abroad.
Of the several hundred Philippine recruits now in Vintage's application process, more than 100 nurses have passed the licensing and language exams. They've completed background checks and are ready to head to the United States. Yet they are stuck because they can't get their visas processed.
"They could come tomorrow," Beckham said. "The demand is overwhelming right now."
Since President Trump took office on a promise to crack down on immigration, nurses from the Philippines have faced more red tape. Officials return about 50 percent of Vintage's applications and demand additional paperwork, up from just 5 percent of applications during the Obama administration, Beckham said.
Bloomberg News
No statewide shutdown orders from nine governors
DES MOINES — Even as most Americans are under orders from their governor to stay at home to slow the spread of the coronavirus, leaders in a handful of states have steadfastly refused to take that action, arguing it's unneeded and could be harmful.
Nine governors have refused to issue statewide mandates that people stay at home, but local leaders have taken action in some of those states. North Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, and Arkansas are the only states where no one is under a stay-at-home order.
The lack of action from those governors — even as they take other steps such as closing schools and limiting the size of gatherings — has frustrated health experts and left some residents puzzled.
“If social distancing maneuvers are going to work, they're most likely going to work if you do them early," said Arthur L. Reingold, a professor and infectious disease expert at the University of California Berkeley. “The longer you wait, the harder it is for them to have a substantial impact on transmission of the virus."
That also has been the message of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, who has said all states should have statewide orders that people remain at home.
Fauci on Monday credited the governors of Nebraska and Iowa for what steps they have taken to slow the virus, but David Leeson, a retiree in Winterset, Iowa, said he can't understand why restrictions that make sense in most of the country haven't been imposed in his home state.
“I think it's idiotic," Leeson said. “The only way this is going to work is to have every state under the same rules."

Manhattan cathedral to host field hospital
The Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in Manhattan, one of the largest church buildings in the world, will partner with the Rev. Franklin Graham's ministry, Samaritan's Purse, to set up a field hospital under its 124-foot-high stone nave, Graham said Monday.
Graham, an evangelist who was to travel to New York on Tuesday to visit the Episcopal church, said New York's Mount Sinai Hospital asked for his ministry's help with the effort.
Tents expected to hold at least 200 patients will be set up inside the cathedral by the end of the week, the Rev. Clifton Daniel III, the dean of the cathedral, told The New York Times, which first reported the news.
Church officials told the Times that about 400 beds were delivered last week, though it's unclear whether patients will be treated specifically for the novel coronavirus.
The crypt will be used as "a staging area" for medical personnel, Daniel told the Times, and it's the first time the cathedral will be used as a hospital.
For decades, Graham's comments about Islam and gay people have induced controversy, and raised red flags for some when his Samaritan's Purse came to New York. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters last week that his office would "monitor" the facility to ensure staff would not discriminate.
Graham said that members of the mayor's office visited the facility Sunday, adding that they were not concerned over issues of discrimination.

Texto completo: More than six weeks after Saudi Arabia reported its first case, the coronavirus is striking terror into the heart of the kingdom's royal family.
As many as 150 royals in the kingdom are now believed to have contracted the virus, including members of its lesser branches, according to a person close to the family.
King Salman, 84, has secluded himself for his safety in an island palace near the city of Jiddah on the Red Sea, while Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, his son and the 34-year-old de facto ruler, has retreated with many of his ministers to the remote site on the same coast where he has promised to build a futuristic city known as Neom.
The sickness in the family may also shed new light on the motivation behind the speed and scale of the kingdom's response to the pandemic.
Its rulers began restricting travel to Saudi Arabia and shut down pilgrimages to the Muslim holy sites of Mecca and Medina even before the kingdom had reported its first case, on March 2. Authorities have now cut off all air and land travel into or out of its borders and between internal provinces.
They have placed all of its biggest cities under a 24-hour lockdown, and they have indicated they are likely to cancel the annual hajj pilgrimage this summer that draws 2.5 million Muslims to Mecca and has taken place every year since 1798, when Napoleon invaded Egypt.
State media reported Wednesday that the king suspended final rulings and judicial orders on visitation rights of children of separated parents, and ordered a number of prisoners released.
Saudi officials also announced the kingdom and its allies would observe a unilateral cease-fire in the war in Yemen starting at noon Thursday, a move motivated by fears of the virus spreading and that could pave the way for ending the brutal five-year-old conflict.

Some of Europe, 'walking a tightrope,' will loosen rules
BERLIN — Austria is allowing small shops to resume business after Easter. Denmark is reopening nurseries and primary schools. The Czech Republic is planning to lift a travel ban.
Gingerly, and with plenty of caveats, some corners of Europe are tiptoeing toward a loosening of the strict lockdown measures that have been in place for close to a month to slow the spread of the coronavirus, idling economies and leaving citizens in an uneasy limbo of social isolation.
But even as the number of new infections appears to be plateauing in several European countries, the message from leaders is clear: The next phase is not a return to normality. It is learning how to live with the pandemic — possibly for quite a long time.
Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen of Denmark was explicit: “It's like walking a tightrope," she said. “If we stand still, we may fall. If we go too fast, it may soon go wrong. We don't know when we'll be on firm ground again."
European governments are eager to give their citizens a sense of hope and to reboot economic activity, too. But overshadowing that desire is the risk of unleashing a second wave of mass infections.
How soon is too soon to allow the resumption of some activities — and which activities — is the overriding question.

Chaos, joy at Wuhan airport as doctors take flights out
The crowd outside Wuhan's Tianhe International Airport on Wednesday morning pushed forward as anxiety grew over catching their flights out of town -- the first to depart since Jan. 23.
Many were people who had come to the central Chinese city for a Lunar New Year vacation in January and found themselves stuck in a protracted, nightmarish stay as the coronavirus outbreak spread and Hubei province was sealed off to curb it.
The lifting of Wuhan's lockdown will be a crucial test for China, which is driving a narrative of triumph over the pandemic amid accusations it manipulated virus data and concern the highly contagious illness isn't fully stamped out.
Still, Wuhan's emergence from an outbreak that overwhelmed its hospital system and left over 2,500 dead provides a blueprint — and a sense of hope — for other cities currently under lockdown and grappling with still peaking infection rates.
Among those catching flights out were a group of doctors and nurses from northeastern Jilin province, who had traveled to the embattled city to shore up the local health-care system, part of the tens of thousands of medical workers from around the country that were sent in to help.

UK's Johnson still in ICU, with condition improving
LONDON — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson remains in intensive care with the coronavirus but is improving and sitting up in bed, a senior government minister said Wednesday, as the UK recorded its biggest spike in COVID-19 deaths to date.
Johnson, the first world leader diagnosed with the disease, has spent two nights in the ICU at St. Thomas' Hospital in London.
That glimmer of good news came as the number of COVID-19-related deaths in Britain approached the peaks seen in Italy and Spain, the two countries with the greatest number of fatalities.
Britain's confirmed death toll reached 7,097 Wednesday, an increase of 938 from a day earlier. Italy recorded a high of 969 deaths on March 27 and Spain 950 deaths on April 2.
The toll in the UK included the first eight doctors or doctors-to-be publicly reported to have died after catching the virus in Britain's National Health Service, according to a New York Times report.
All eight are immigrants — from Egypt, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Sudan — attesting to the extraordinary dependence of Britain's treasured health service on workers from abroad.

Ecuador gives glimpse into impact on Latin America
QUITO, Ecuador — Bodies left out on sidewalks. Authorities struggling to keep track of deaths. Funeral parlors, out of coffins, using cardboard boxes made by companies that package bananas and shrimp.
The calamity unfolding in Ecuador's business capital, Guayaquil, offers an ominous look at how officials' ability to respond to the pandemic in Latin America can be dangerously hamstrung by the inequality, weak public services, and fragile economies that mark much of the region.
A country of 17 million, Ecuador has one of the highest official rates of infections, and deaths, per capita in Latin America. It is still unclear why it has been affected so deeply. Some specialists believe that the virus may have traveled along the country's deep migratory links with hard-hit Spain and Italy, then spread as Ecuador lagged in adopting social distancing.
Ecuador's death count rose to 220 on Tuesday, with 182 other cases listed as “probable" but unconfirmed — higher than its larger and more populous neighbors Peru and Colombia.
Ecuador's president, Lenín Moreno, has warned that the real figure is much higher but that because testing is limited the true extent of infections is impossible to determine.

Texto completo: Since the election of Donald Trump, the American media has become invested in the idea that the modern information landscape is defined by a great struggle between truth and falsehood, facts and misinformation, the real news and the fake. In this drama, there are enemies of truth, and then there is a besieged edifice of expertise, which needs to reclaim ground — whether via better fact-checks or better Facebook regulations — that’s been lost to trolls, populists and scam artists.
This has always been a dubious and self-regarding framework, but in the coronavirus era it has become particularly useless. Not because it misdiagnoses Trump himself: Our chief executive is, indeed, bumptiously dishonest, a manure-shoveler without precedent in the modern presidency, a man with little capacity to handle even a mildly inconvenient truth. No one expects a truthful and realistic appraisal of the crisis from this president; any sensible person should look elsewhere for the truth.
But once you look elsewhere, it quickly becomes clear that no unitary and reliable edifice of truth exists. The only place you can find it is in fiction, specifically the cinematic anticipation of this outbreak, Steven Soderbergh’s film “Contagion” — in which the professional health organizations are admirable, nimble, evidence-based, with just enough rule-bending here and there to make the necessary leaps toward a vaccine. Meanwhile, the internet is terrible, embodied by a sinister blogger peddling a quack cure. Only institutions can be trusted; outsider “knowledge” leads only to the grave.
That’s the movie; the reality has been otherwise. In our actual pandemic, most of the institutions that we associate with public health expertise and trusted medical authority have failed more catastrophically than Trump has.
The worst offender was the World Health Organization, which didn’t side with “facts” and “science” in the early days of the pandemic: It followed its own political imperatives and sided with China, accepting false and propagandistic assessments and ignoring crucial evidence because it came from Taiwan and not Beijing.
Less corruptly but no less disastrously, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration committed serial malpractice across the crucial month of March, botching, delaying and impeding the development of the necessary tests. Both American and international medical authorities lied to people (or, if you want to be kinder, to themselves) about the efficacy of masks. And Britain’s public health experts confidently rolled a complex plan that was supposedly smarter than a simple lockdown — except that it turned out to have missed some basic facts about the virus.
Failure and recklessness aren’t universal; plenty of public health authorities have acquitted themselves better than Boris Johnson’s advisers or the WHO. But there is no definite pattern of outsiders being wrong and dangerous and insiders being trustworthy and good, and indeed up until mid-March you were better off trusting the alarmists of anonymous Twitter than the official pronouncements from the custodians of public health.
In part this reflects the decadence and incapacity of Western institutions (Pacific Rim institutions proved themselves a lot more trustworthy), but in part it isn’t any institution’s fault. A pandemic is a novel circumstance and challenge, a pandemic in a globalized world even more so, and the institutional ways of acquiring information and acting on it — the bureaucratic approach to science and policy — were never going to be commensurate to the problem the coronavirus posed.
That doesn’t mean you should ignore experts and just take random posts and Twitter rants as gospel. But under conditions of fog and uncertainty, armchair epidemiology will sometimes reach truths sooner than officialdom. If one Medium post foolishly lowballs the disease’s contagiousness, another will make a cogent case for masking long before the CDC did. If one nonscientist offers some dubious casualty projections, another may tease out a high-profile model’s crucial faults. And if a certain line of argument is bad — as I think, and argued last week, that the right-wing anti-lockdown argument is bad — then it has to be judged on its own merits, not just dismissed because it lacks the CDC’s patina.
The official experts, under such conditions, are most trustworthy insofar as their admonitions track with nonexpert common sense. The approach that most experts are currently urging, for instance, is not some complicated high-science approach to disease management, but the most basic pre-modern method of disease control, as obvious to 15th-century Florentines as to 21st-century New Yorkers — shut things down, quarantine the sick and hope for the best.
Whereas the more specific and granular the experts get, the more the fluidity and chaos of the situation makes their pronouncements dubious. It’s good that we’re modeling the arc of the pandemic, but that doesn’t make any of the models trustworthy. It’s good that we’re trying to figure out how the disease spreads, but none of the claims so far about how you’re most likely to get it (from air, surfaces or otherwise) or who is most at risk (whether from viral load or pre-existing conditions) can be considered at all definitive. It’s good that we’re practicing social distancing, but all of the rules we’re implementing are just rough and ready guesstimates.
And you don’t want to overweight the pronouncements of official science in a situation that requires experimentation and adaptation and a certain amount of gambling. Yes, you should trust Dr. Anthony Fauci more than Trump when it comes to the potential benefits of hydroxychloroquine. But the exigencies of the crisis require that experiments outrun the confidence of expert conclusions and the pace of bureaucratic certainty. So if you’re a doctor on the front lines trying to keep your patients from ending up on a ventilator, Fauci’s level of caution can’t be yours, and you shouldn’t be waiting for the double-blind control trial to experiment with off-label drugs that Spanish and Chinese doctors claim are helping patients.
The same logic applies for policymakers, for whom there is never going to be a definitive, one-size-fits-all blueprint telling them how and when to reopen cities or communities. Every single reopening will be its own unique experiment, with confounding variables of climate, density, age and genetics that are nearly impossible to model, and the advice of epidemiologists will only go so far. Governors and mayors will have to act like scientists themselves, acting and re-acting, adapting and experimenting, with expert advisers at their shoulders but no sure answers till the experiment begins.
And the logic applies to individuals as well. Most Americans who contract the coronavirus, at this point, won’t even get a test, let alone sustained medical care or supervision. Many people who do get a test will have solid reasons to doubt the negative result. Which means that they will have to make countless important decisions — about what to ask of their doctors, what medical websites to trust, how to take care of their spouse or kids or parents, whether and when to go to work — in a context where the only relevant sample size is one, themselves, and where there is no advice that can be considered medically definitive.
No doubt some of them will behave stupidly or recklessly, just as some governors and mayors will make terrible mistakes once reopening begins. But we don’t have enough information to know what counts as wisdom yet. Is it stupid to ask your doctor to prescribe you an off-label drug if your breathing is constricted, hospitals are overcrowded and 2% of people with your condition end up dead? Is it stupid for rural states to reopen schools if their infection rates seem low? Is it stupid for religious organizations or community groups to bend the rules of quarantine to help people survive isolation and avoid despair? Neither Fauci nor any official institution can answer all these questions. We’ll have to answer them one experiment at a time.
As a society our struggle with the coronavirus resembles the experience of the sick person afflicted with a disease that’s unknown and or misunderstood by medical science. Before falling ill, this person imagined the world of science as a stable room, well-built and well-lit, with a sturdy floor beneath. But now the floor has given way, the patient has fallen through, and in the basement there is darkness, strange shapes, things you can possibly identify by feel but not by sight.
There’s still some light coming through from above, from the world of certainty and expertise, and it’s important to make use of it, to see what can be seen in its illumination. But those shafts of light don’t fill the whole basement, and what they do light up can be partial and misleading. So if you’re going to find your way out and up to health and safety, you have to be prepared to grope, to stumble, to make your own light, and sometimes to move by feel or instinct through the dark.

Texto completo: It should not be this easy for Chinese Communist Party propaganda to make its way into major American newsrooms.
Since the outbreak of the coronavirus, which Chinese lies ensured would become a pandemic, American news media have promoted a number of Beijing-approved talking points, including the one that alleges it is racist to refer to the virus by its country and city of origin. American news media have also accepted at face value a series of dubious claims pushed by Chinese communist apparatchiks, including the absurd boast that China's new case numbers have remained essentially flat since late February.
"[The] U.S. has more known cases of coronavirus than any other country," CNN reported on March 26, its declaration coming in unison with nearly every major news outlet in the United States.
The CNN report, which was published shortly after pandemic trackers placed the number of coronavirus cases in America at more than 85,000, claimed the "U.S. cases piled up ... surpassing China and Italy."
The coronavirus pandemic in the U.S. is indeed a serious crisis, one that has been made all the worse by the sluggish, incompetent, and chaotic response by the federal government. But it is extremely unlikely that the number of cases in China has essentially flatlined for the past five weeks.
That is, the U.S. is "No. 1" only if you believe the numbers reported by China, which you should not. Pandemic trackers work with the data provided, and the data provided by Beijing is unbelievable. Chinese officials claim new coronavirus cases have increased by only 1,782 since late February. There is simply no way that this is true, especially considering China itself reported new cases jumped from 920 to 80,000 between Jan. 23 and Feb. 29.
The trajectory is also not consistent with other countries that have seen a leveling off of cases. The deceleration in South Korea, for instance, has been much more gradual.
But the obvious red flags regarding China's reported data did not slow American newsrooms from declaring the U.S. the leader in reported coronavirus cases without caveats.
This is not the only example of western news media hailing China's allegedly successful campaign to stem the spread of the coronavirus.
Earlier, even before the U.S. had even supposedly passed the case number milestone, the New York Times published a report on March 18 titled "Its Coronavirus Cases Dwindling, China Turns Focus Outward."
The article, the chief claim of which has been repeated elsewhere by the New York Times, Bloomberg, and NBC News, goes to great lengths to cast China as a thoughtful, meticulous, proactive, and responsible world leader, one whose contributions to fighting the pandemic have made it a more reliable and responsible superpower compared to the U.S. The New York Times article repeats the Chinese Communist Party's claim that China's daily coronavirus cases have dwindled "into the single digits."
No attempt is made to verify these numbers.
Earlier than even this New York Times report, Chuck Todd, host of NBC News's Meet the Press, on March 8 hailed China's supposed success in tackling the virus, asking whether the Chinese Communist Party's style of despotic governance deserves all the credit.
"How uncomfortable is it," Todd asked, echoing the sentiments of others in Western media, "that perhaps China's authoritarian ways did prevent this? Meaning, had China been a free and open society, this might have spread faster?"
The U.S. intelligence community determined last week that China has underreported both the total number of coronavirus cases and deaths, all of it in an attempt to conceal the full extent of the pandemic in its country.
Early on, China silenced doctors who raised alarms about the virus, denied access to foreign scientists who could have studied the virus, and falsely claimed that there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission.
NBC breathlessly reported, "As the U.S. struggles to stem coronavirus, China asserts itself as global leader" on efforts by China to provide help to other countries. But the reality is that China has delivered faulty equipment around the world. In the Netherlands, the health ministry recalled 600,000 Chinese manufactured face masks despite their desperate need for medical equipment after their filters did not work properly, and they did not fit. Spain purchased hundreds of thousands of tests from China, only to learn that at least 60,000 did not work.
The American press's readiness to treat reports out of Beijing with little, if any, skepticism comes as actual Chinese communist propaganda videos cite members of the free press in conjunction with its broader, hyperaggressive effort to avoid blame for creating the coronavirus pandemic.
Whether they know it or not, the journalists who claim it is problematic to refer to the virus by its country and city of origin, and the ones who claim China has the pandemic mostly under control, and who praise China's efforts to help other countries are doing the bidding of the Chinese Communist Party, which is eager both to present itself as the world's leading superpower and scrub from the record its culpability in the spread of the virus.

Texto completo: See How the Coronavirus Death Toll Grew Across the U.S.
The first 5,000 COVID-19 deaths in the United States mounted over a month’s time. The second 5,000 followed in fewer than five days. The New York Times gives us a visual look at how quickly the death toll has risen in this interactive graphic.
Opinion: The United States Needs a ‘Smart Quarantine’ In this Letter to the Editor, three public health doctors outline four key measures the United States needs to adopt in order to slow the rise of COVID-19 cases. They write: "The United States needs to adopt smart quarantine as soon as possible. It will require us to endure new and difficult challenges. But the long-term benefits — fewer infections and deaths, a quicker return to work and "normalcy" — will far outweigh the short-term hardships." Read the letter.
My job was to cover the coronavirus pandemic, until I became part of it Lola Gomez, a photojournalist for the Austin American-Statesman, first started feeling sick March 19. She tried five times to get tested for COVID-19. As a 42-year-old woman with no health issues, she did not meet the criteria. By the time she finally was allowed the test, it was time to head to the ER. She tells her story from her hospital bed.
A Tiger Has Coronavirus. Should You Worry About Your Pets?
A tiger at the Bronx Zoo has tested positive for coronavirus, raising questions about the pets we live with and love. NPR tackles those questions.
A Historic Unemployment Crisis The United States’ efforts to contain the coronavirus have resulted in one of the worst unemployment crises in our country’s history. On The Daily podcast, New York Times reporter Jim Tankersley breaks down what the stimulus package means for those seeking unemployment as well as employers. Listen here.

Texto completo: A top White House adviser starkly warned Trump administration officials in late January that the coronavirus crisis could cost the United States trillions of dollars and put millions of Americans at risk of illness or death.
The warning, written in a memo by Peter Navarro, President Donald Trump's trade adviser, is the highest-level alert known to have circulated inside the West Wing as the administration was taking its first substantive steps to confront a crisis that had already consumed China's leaders and would go on to upend life in Europe and the United States.
"The lack of immune protection or an existing cure or vaccine would leave Americans defenseless in the case of a full-blown coronavirus outbreak on U.S. soil," Navarro's memo said. "This lack of protection elevates the risk of the coronavirus evolving into a full-blown pandemic, imperiling the lives of millions of Americans."
Dated Jan. 29, it came during a period when Trump was playing down the risks to the United States, and he would later go on to say that no one could have predicted such a devastating outcome.
Navarro said in the memo that the administration faced a choice about how aggressive to be in containing an outbreak, saying the human and economic costs would be relatively low if it turned out to be a problem along the lines of a seasonal flu.
But he went on to emphasize that the "risk of a worst-case pandemic scenario should not be overlooked" given the information coming from China.
In one worst-case scenario cited in the memo, more than a half-million Americans could die.
A second memo that Navarro wrote, dated Feb. 23, warned of an "increasing probability of a full-blown COVID-19 pandemic that could infect as many as 100 million Americans, with a loss of life of as many as 1.2 million souls."
At that time, Trump was still downplaying the threat of the virus. The administration was considering asking Congress for more money to address the situation, and the second memo, which circulated around the West Wing and was obtained by The New York Times, urged an immediate supplemental spending appropriation from Congress of at least $3 billion.
"This is NOT a time for penny-pinching or horse trading on the Hill," Navarro wrote in the second memo, which was unsigned but which officials attributed to him. It was unclear whether Trump saw the second memo, whose contents were first reported by Axios.
The second memo seemed aimed at members of the White House Task Force established by Trump to manage the crisis, and reflected deep divisions within the administration about how to proceed and persistent feuding between Navarro and many other top officials about his role and his views.
"Any member of the Task Force who wants to be cautious about appropriating funds for a crisis that could inflict trillions of dollars in economic damage and take millions of lives has come to the wrong administration," the memo said.
Among other things, the memo called for an increase in funding for the government to purchase personal protective equipment for health care workers, estimating they would need "at least a billion face masks" over a four- to six-month period. The administration ended up asking for $2.5 billion. Congress then approved $8 billion.
Navarro is now the administration's point person for supply chain issues for medical and other equipment needed to deal with the virus.
The January memo written by Navarro was dated the same day that Trump named a White House task force to deal with the threat, and as the administration was weighing whether to bar some travelers from China, an option being pushed by Navarro. Trump would approve the limits on travel from China the next day, though it would be weeks before he began taking more aggressive steps to head off spread of the virus.
Questions about Trump's handling of crisis, especially in its early days, are likely to define his presidency. Navarro's memo is evidence that some in the upper ranks of the administration had considered the possibility of the outbreak turning into something far more serious than Trump was acknowledging publicly.
Neither Navarro nor spokespeople for the White House responded to requests for comment.
The memo was sent from Navarro to the National Security Council and then distributed to several officials across the administration, people familiar with the events said. It reached a number of top officials as well as aides to Mick Mulvaney, then the acting chief of staff, they said, but it was unclear whether Trump saw it.

Texto completo: Maeve Kennedy Townsend McKean, a human rights attorney who was the daughter of a past Maryland lieutenant governor, died in a boating accident Thursday in Anne Arundel County.
A Washington, D.C., resident, she was educated in Baltimore County and grew up in Ruxton. She was 40.
Her body was recovered in the Chesapeake Bay late Monday afternoon. A search is ongoing for her son, Gideon Joseph Kennedy McKean, age 8, who was in the same accident in Shady Side, about 10 miles south of Annapolis near Herring Bay. Authorities said the pair's canoe was found overturned east of Rockhold Creek in Deale.
A member of a celebrated Democratic family, Ms. McKean was the granddaughter of Robert F. Kennedy and Ethel Skakel. She was the grandniece of President John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Bouvier.
Born Nov. 1, 1979, she was the daughter of David Lee Townsend, a professor at St. John's College in Annapolis, and his wife, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, the former lieutenant governor.
She spent her adolescent years at her family's Ruxton home and participated in Baltimore County Recreation Council sports. She also attended Baltimore County schools before enrolling at St. Paul's School for Girls in Brooklandville, where she graduated in 1997. She was a graduate of Boston College and also studied at Trinity College in Dublin.
A 2009 New York Times article quoted her father, who described her as "always playful, a kind of Annie Oakley character."
She later earned a master's degree and a law degree from Georgetown University.
Ms. McKean made a strong impression as a high school student at St. Paul's.
"I remember the day she received her diploma," said Evelyn A. Flory, the former head of school. "She looked confident and was ready to go off into the world.
"She was an independent young woman, very focused, and positive and part of the school community. She was integrated with her class and worked on the yearbook," said Dr. Flory, who lives in Scottsdale, Arizona.
"Maeve was a star athlete, highly competitive when playing. I remember how she wore a special sash that three-sport girls got to wear," she said. "And while she carried a well-known family name, she was always one of the girls. She had a good sense of humor that was appealing."
The former school head also recalled Ms. McKean's independent spirit.
"She was self-reliant and handled things on her own. I remember she was a good citizen and we wanted our girls to have that quality. By the time she graduated, she was really a young woman ready to confront the adult world."
The 2009 New York Times article called her a "free spirit" and said that after college she joined the Peace Corps and went to Madagascar. She later worked in the West Coast office of Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein in California and received a letter from what turned out to be her future husband, David McKean. He was seeking a summer internship.
The story went on to describe their 2009 wedding and her dress. She wore "sparkly sneakers under an elegant strapless Italian-designed silk and organza wedding gown." She was also tattooed with a small apple because she liked eating apples.
She worked on her mother's unsuccessful 2002 gubernatorial campaign against Robert L. Ehrlich Jr.
After earning her graduate degrees, Ms. McKean became the director of Georgetown University's Global Health Initiative and had earlier been senior adviser to the State Department's global AIDS program. She taught bioethics and human rights as an adjunct professor at Georgetown.
She had also been an associate research professor at the CUNY School of Public Health and Health Policy. Her resume says she co-launched the university's Center for Immigrant, Refugee and Global Health.
She was an advocate for vaccines, and appeared at a rally to condemn the separation and detention of families at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2018.
In addition to her husband of 11 years, an attorney, survivors include a daughter, Gabriella McKean; a son, Toby McKean; three sisters, Meaghan Anne Kennedy Townsend, Rose Katherine "Kat" Kennedy Townsend and Kerry Sophia Kennedy Townsend; and her parents.

It reached a number of top officials as well as aides to Mick Mulvaney, then the acting chief of staff, they said, but it was unclear whether Trump saw it.

Texto completo: A top White House adviser starkly warned Trump administration officials in late January that the coronavirus crisis could cost the United States trillions of dollars and put millions of Americans at risk of illness or death.
The warning, written in a memo by Peter Navarro, President Donald Trump's trade adviser, is the highest-level alert known to have circulated inside the West Wing as the administration was taking its first substantive steps to confront a crisis that had already consumed China's leaders and would go on to upend life in Europe and the United States.
"The lack of immune protection or an existing cure or vaccine would leave Americans defenseless in the case of a full-blown coronavirus outbreak on U.S. soil," Navarro's memo said. "This lack of protection elevates the risk of the coronavirus evolving into a full-blown pandemic, imperiling the lives of millions of Americans."
Dated Jan. 29, it came during a period when Trump was playing down the risks to the United States, and he would later go on to say that no one could have predicted such a devastating outcome.
Navarro said in the memo that the administration faced a choice about how aggressive to be in containing an outbreak, saying the human and economic costs would be relatively low if it turned out to be a problem along the lines of a seasonal flu.
But he went on to emphasize that the "risk of a worst-case pandemic scenario should not be overlooked" given the information coming from China.
In one worst-case scenario cited in the memo, more than a half-million Americans could die.
A second memo that Navarro wrote, dated Feb. 23, warned of an "increasing probability of a full-blown COVID-19 pandemic that could infect as many as 100 million Americans, with a loss of life of as many as 1.2 million souls."
At that time, Trump was still downplaying the threat of the virus. The administration was considering asking Congress for more money to address the situation, and the second memo, which circulated around the West Wing and was obtained by The New York Times, urged an immediate supplemental spending appropriation from Congress of at least $3 billion.
"This is NOT a time for penny-pinching or horse trading on the Hill," Navarro wrote in the second memo, which was unsigned but which officials attributed to him. It was unclear whether Trump saw the second memo, whose contents were first reported by Axios.
The second memo seemed aimed at members of the White House Task Force established by Trump to manage the crisis, and reflected deep divisions within the administration about how to proceed and persistent feuding between Navarro and many other top officials about his role and his views.
"Any member of the Task Force who wants to be cautious about appropriating funds for a crisis that could inflict trillions of dollars in economic damage and take millions of lives has come to the wrong administration," the memo said.
Among other things, the memo called for an increase in funding for the government to purchase personal protective equipment for health care workers, estimating they would need "at least a billion face masks" over a four- to six-month period. The administration ended up asking for $2.5 billion. Congress then approved $8 billion.
Navarro is now the administration's point person for supply chain issues for medical and other equipment needed to deal with the virus.
The January memo written by Navarro was dated the same day that Trump named a White House task force to deal with the threat, and as the administration was weighing whether to bar some travelers from China, an option being pushed by Navarro. Trump would approve the limits on travel from China the next day, though it would be weeks before he began taking more aggressive steps to head off spread of the virus.
Questions about Trump's handling of crisis, especially in its early days, are likely to define his presidency. Navarro's memo is evidence that some in the upper ranks of the administration had considered the possibility of the outbreak turning into something far more serious than Trump was acknowledging publicly.
Neither Navarro nor spokespeople for the White House responded to requests for comment.
The memo was sent from Navarro to the National Security Council and then distributed to several officials across the administration, people familiar with the events said. It reached a number of top officials as well as aides to Mick Mulvaney, then the acting chief of staff, they said, but it was unclear whether Trump saw it.

Texto completo: Service journalism has become an important part of The Times's coverage of the pandemic. The editors coordinating that effort are doing so from home.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
The outbreak of Covid-19, along with the fear that comes intertwined with its presence, has affected seemingly every aspect of our day-to-day lives. In an attempt to combat that worry with knowledge, The New York Times is offering what is known as service journalism: answers to questions people are asking, and solutions to problems they are experiencing.
Elisabeth Goodridge, the deputy Travel editor, and Karen Barrow, an editor on the news product desk who previously worked on Smarter Living, are two of the journalists who are now assigned to make that coverage accessible to readers who might be asking questions like "What if my loved one has the coronavirus?" and "How can I manage my stress eating?"
Their days are flooded with virtual meetings and emails and articles that need editing, combined with dogs, cats (specifically a Russian blue named Lovey) and children all clamoring for their attention. Ms. Goodridge and Ms. Barrow discussed their approach to dealing with both their new duties and new personal realities.
How does this new work differ from what you normally do for The Times?
GOODRIDGE I am usually the deputy travel editor. I was asked to drop that to focus on our coronavirus service journalism. I knew it was going to be a crisis, but nowhere near as extreme as it is now. What I have been doing is figuring out what service stories are needed now. Then, with Karen, making sure that they're assigned to the best writers. There are three ways I'm approaching it. First, what kind of stories are we hearing from our reporting? Second, what reader questions are coming in that we can help answer? Then we can reverse-engineer stories from there. Third, we're reviewing what people are searching for on Google so we can be very, very timely and reverse-engineer these too. Then, actually, fourth is whatever comes out of Karen's mind.
BARROW My logic, having been an editor for Smarter Living for a couple of years, is that if I'm wondering about it, a lot of other people probably are. Usually if it's something I've talked about with my husband earlier that day, then other people need the same guidance. Or at least to know that they're not alone.
What does an average day look like for you?
BARROW We both have kids, so we're balancing that. They're all home, learning at home too. I find myself constantly checking Slack and email and furiously working during windows when they're busy with other things. I'm trying to stay as plugged in as I can.
GOODRIDGE I have been waking up early to get as much work done as I can before my son is awake and going. Then, we have a lot of meetings in the morning, like the morning news meeting. There's just so much news. Then, in the afternoon, I'm doing a lot of editing. I try to get away for a little bit before the 4:30 meeting. It's been a lot of juggling the kid and the work. We're taking ideas from our own lives because we know that other people are having these issues too. It's been constant. It's something that I'm realizing we're going to be doing for a long time.
When your work centers on what's going on in the world, how do you reset and decompress?
GOODRIDGE You have to walk around. And before our 4:30 meeting, I've been trying to at least go to a different room and drink some water.
I think everyone needs to be really disciplined, and I need to start taking my own advice on making sure that we know this is a marathon, not a sprint. And additionally, being good to my mental health, being good to all my co-workers and everyone I know.
BARROW I have a dog who I've never loved more because he gets me out of the house twice a day.
How do you know when you've put out a successful piece of service journalism?
GOODRIDGE It's about what we're hearing back from people, reader comments and certainly page views, because people are just really desperate for news. I feel pretty strongly that we need to get these stories to people when they need them, not three days later.
BARROW We're also providing a little levity in addition to the service, and the comments on those pieces have been satisfying because at least you feel you're brightening someone's day. We did a hand-washing song for people to try at home. Watching other people make videos, singing the song and having a smile on their face was satisfying because you feel you're helping in a different sort of way -- in a way that everybody kind of needs right now.
Is there anything specific you're trying to avoid in your coverage?
GOODRIDGE Duplicative stories. The idea might come to two or three editors at the same time who might be reading the same resources, or they might have stumbled across the same eureka moment at the same time. There has only beenone or two instances where people have been deployed on similar stories, and when that happens, we usually try to combine the reporting.
What has been the most challenging part of this so far?
BARROW Our challenge, and what makes it such a unique news story, is that we're living the news story just like everybody else. It's going on in our own homes. Coronavirus has upended everybody's lives. It's been finding this new sense of normal and balancing life and work. When everything's in the same space, it's a very challenging thing. And that's not even true for just The New York Times employees. That's true for everybody.
Where have you found support while working on this project?
GOODRIDGE Service journalism is coming from every single corner of the newsroom. It's invaluable. It's coming from Business, from Metro, from Parenting, from Health. It's not just us, it's pretty much the entire newsroom that's reporting and writing service stories. We've got extraordinary depth with all the desks.

Texto completo: AIRLINES
Hundreds of Flight Attendants And Pilots Are Infected
Hundreds of flight attendants and pilots at U.S. airlines have been infected by the coronavirus, according to labor unions that represent them.
The Association of Flight Attendants has counted about 200 cases among the workers it represents at nearly two dozen airlines, the union said on Tuesday. About half of those people work for United Airlines, the union's largest member airline.
An additional 100 flight attendants at American Airlines had tested positive as of Sunday, according to the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, which represents more than 27,000 of the company's workers.
Delta's flight attendants are not unionized, but its pilots are. According to that union, the Delta Master Executive Council, at least 51 pilots at the airline have tested positive for the virus, more than half of whom work in the New York area. At least 15 more are sick and awaiting test results.
RELIEF
Loans to Midsize BusinessesAre in 'Design Phase,' Fed Says
Robert S. Kaplan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said in a wide-ranging interview with The New York Times that the central bank's upcoming program to help midsize businesses is "still in the design phase" and that officials needed to determine how to make it work for both companies and banks.
The details of that program, announced on March 23, remain mostly a mystery, though the Fed has made it clear that it plans to use it to help companies that are too big for small-business loans but too small to gain access to the corporate bond market.
The Fed is "trying to determine what would be most useful to business, and trying to make it so that the banks would want to make those loans," Mr. Kaplan said.
When it comes to the Fed's anticipated municipal bond program, which has yet to be announced, he said that it should be "analogous" to the Fed's corporate bond programs, which the Fed will use to buy bonds via an intermediary.
"I don't think we're set up to go directly," he said. "Our job is to set the criteria and work through an intermediary."
The reserve bank presidents are consulted on design and implementation issues for the Fed's emergency lending programs, but they do not have a vote on them. That falls to the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, with signoff and financial backing from the Treasury Department.
Europe's Central Bank Acts To Free Up More Cheap Money
The European Central Bank announced new measures on Tuesday that are intended to make it even easier for people and businesses in the eurozone to get cheap loans.
The measures apply to money that commercial lenders are allowed to borrow from the central bank at zero percent interest, or in some cases even negative interest. Banks must post collateral in case they cannot repay the money.
The central bank said Tuesday that it would temporarily lower the standards it applies to such collateral, accepting assets such as Greek government bonds, which had been considered too risky. The looser standards should greatly expand the amount of money that banks can borrow on very favorable terms.
Credit guarantees issued by governments will also be eligible as collateral, the central bank said, a boon for Italy and other countries that are backing loans to businesses but are themselves financially struggling.

Texto completo: A top White House adviser starkly warned Trump administration officials in late January that the coronavirus crisis could cost the United States trillions of dollars and put millions of Americans at risk of illness or death.
The warning, written in a memo by Peter Navarro, President Donald Trump's trade adviser, is the highest-level alert known to have circulated inside the West Wing as the administration was taking its first substantive steps to confront a crisis that had already consumed China's leaders and would go on to upend life in Europe and the United States.
"The lack of immune protection or an existing cure or vaccine would leave Americans defenseless in the case of a full-blown coronavirus outbreak on U.S. soil," Navarro's memo said. "This lack of protection elevates the risk of the coronavirus evolving into a full-blown pandemic, imperiling the lives of millions of Americans."
Dated Jan. 29, it came during a period when Trump was playing down the risks to the United States, and he would later go on to say that no one could have predicted such a devastating outcome.
Navarro said in the memo that the administration faced a choice about how aggressive to be in containing an outbreak, saying the human and economic costs would be relatively low if it turned out to be a problem along the lines of a seasonal flu.
But he went on to emphasize that the "risk of a worst-case pandemic scenario should not be overlooked" given the information coming from China.
In one worst-case scenario cited in the memo, more than a half-million Americans could die.
A second memo that Navarro wrote, dated Feb. 23, warned of an "increasing probability of a full-blown COVID-19 pandemic that could infect as many as 100 million Americans, with a loss of life of as many as 1.2 million souls."
At that time, Trump was still downplaying the threat of the virus. The administration was considering asking Congress for more money to address the situation, and the second memo, which circulated around the West Wing and was obtained by The New York Times, urged an immediate supplemental spending appropriation from Congress of at least $3 billion.
"This is NOT a time for penny-pinching or horse trading on the Hill," Navarro wrote in the second memo, which was unsigned but which officials attributed to him. It was unclear whether Trump saw the second memo, whose contents were first reported by Axios.
The second memo seemed aimed at members of the White House Task Force established by Trump to manage the crisis, and reflected deep divisions within the administration about how to proceed and persistent feuding between Navarro and many other top officials about his role and his views.
"Any member of the Task Force who wants to be cautious about appropriating funds for a crisis that could inflict trillions of dollars in economic damage and take millions of lives has come to the wrong administration," the memo said.
Among other things, the memo called for an increase in funding for the government to purchase personal protective equipment for health care workers, estimating they would need "at least a billion face masks" over a four- to six-month period. The administration ended up asking for $2.5 billion. Congress then approved $8 billion.
Navarro is now the administration's point person for supply chain issues for medical and other equipment needed to deal with the virus.
The January memo written by Navarro was dated the same day that Trump named a White House task force to deal with the threat, and as the administration was weighing whether to bar some travelers from China, an option being pushed by Navarro. Trump would approve the limits on travel from China the next day, though it would be weeks before he began taking more aggressive steps to head off spread of the virus.
Questions about Trump's handling of crisis, especially in its early days, are likely to define his presidency. Navarro's memo is evidence that some in the upper ranks of the administration had considered the possibility of the outbreak turning into something far more serious than Trump was acknowledging publicly.
Neither Navarro nor spokespeople for the White House responded to requests for comment.
The memo was sent from Navarro to the National Security Council and then distributed to several officials across the administration, people familiar with the events said. It reached a number of top officials as well as aides to Mick Mulvaney, then the acting chief of staff, they said, but it was unclear whether Trump saw it.

Texto completo: Maeve Kennedy Townsend McKean, a human rights attorney who was the daughter of a past Maryland lieutenant governor, died in a boating accident Thursday in Anne Arundel County.
A Washington, D.C., resident, she was educated in Baltimore County and grew up in Ruxton. She was 40.
Her body was recovered in the Chesapeake Bay late Monday afternoon. A search is ongoing for her son, Gideon Joseph Kennedy McKean, age 8, who was in the same accident in Shady Side, about 10 miles south of Annapolis near Herring Bay. Authorities said the pair's canoe was found overturned east of Rockhold Creek in Deale.
A member of a celebrated Democratic family, Ms. McKean was the granddaughter of Robert F. Kennedy and Ethel Skakel. She was the grandniece of President John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Bouvier.
Born Nov. 1, 1979, she was the daughter of David Lee Townsend, a professor at St. John's College in Annapolis, and his wife, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, the former lieutenant governor.
She spent her adolescent years at her family's Ruxton home and participated in Baltimore County Recreation Council sports. She also attended Baltimore County schools before enrolling at St. Paul's School for Girls in Brooklandville, where she graduated in 1997. She was a graduate of Boston College and also studied at Trinity College in Dublin.
A 2009 New York Times article quoted her father, who described her as "always playful, a kind of Annie Oakley character."
She later earned a master's degree and a law degree from Georgetown University.
Ms. McKean made a strong impression as a high school student at St. Paul's.
"I remember the day she received her diploma," said Evelyn A. Flory, the former head of school. "She looked confident and was ready to go off into the world.
"She was an independent young woman, very focused, and positive and part of the school community. She was integrated with her class and worked on the yearbook," said Dr. Flory, who lives in Scottsdale, Arizona.
"Maeve was a star athlete, highly competitive when playing. I remember how she wore a special sash that three-sport girls got to wear," she said. "And while she carried a well-known family name, she was always one of the girls. She had a good sense of humor that was appealing."
The former school head also recalled Ms. McKean's independent spirit.
"She was self-reliant and handled things on her own. I remember she was a good citizen and we wanted our girls to have that quality. By the time she graduated, she was really a young woman ready to confront the adult world."
The 2009 New York Times article called her a "free spirit" and said that after college she joined the Peace Corps and went to Madagascar. She later worked in the West Coast office of Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein in California and received a letter from what turned out to be her future husband, David McKean. He was seeking a summer internship.
The story went on to describe their 2009 wedding and her dress. She wore "sparkly sneakers under an elegant strapless Italian-designed silk and organza wedding gown." She was also tattooed with a small apple because she liked eating apples.
She worked on her mother's unsuccessful 2002 gubernatorial campaign against Robert L. Ehrlich Jr.
After earning her graduate degrees, Ms. McKean became the director of Georgetown University's Global Health Initiative and had earlier been senior adviser to the State Department's global AIDS program. She taught bioethics and human rights as an adjunct professor at Georgetown.
She had also been an associate research professor at the CUNY School of Public Health and Health Policy. Her resume says she co-launched the university's Center for Immigrant, Refugee and Global Health.
She was an advocate for vaccines, and appeared at a rally to condemn the separation and detention of families at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2018.
In addition to her husband of 11 years, an attorney, survivors include a daughter, Gabriella McKean; a son, Toby McKean; three sisters, Meaghan Anne Kennedy Townsend, Rose Katherine "Kat" Kennedy Townsend and Kerry Sophia Kennedy Townsend; and her parents.

'Zoombombing' gets organized

Texto completo: In recent weeks, as schools, businesses, support groups and millions of individuals have adopted Zoom as a meeting platform in an increasingly remote world, reports of Zoombombing or Zoom raiding by uninvited participants have become frequent.
While those incidents may have initially been regarded as pranks or trolling, they have since risen to the level of hate speech and harassment, and even commanded the attention of the FBI.
The weaponization of Zoom - a videoconferencing app that has become a de facto social platform for the coronavirus era - is the latest development in the story of online abuse, the kind playing out on social networks and darker, unmoderated corners of the internet.
An analysis by The New York Times found 153 Instagram accounts, dozens of Twitter accounts and private chats, and several active message boards on Reddit and 4Chan where thousands of people had gathered to organize Zoom harassment campaigns, sharing meeting passwords and plans for sowing chaos in public and private meetings. (Since this articles publication, Reddit has shut down the message boards where Zoom raids were discussed.)
Zoom raiders often employ shocking imagery, racial epithets and profanity to derail video conferences. Although a meeting organizer can remove a participant at any time, the perpetrators of these attacks can be hard to identify; there may be several on a single call, and they can appear to jump from one alias to another.
On March 29, Zahed Amanullah was in the middle of a call he had organized with the Concordia Forum, a global network of Muslim leaders, about maintaining spirituality and wellness during the coronavirus crisis, when suddenly a cursor began to draw a racial slur across one of the slides.
"What is that? How did that happen?" one of the meetings presenters said as it was appearing. "Did somebody just see what I saw?
The infiltrator then began to screen-share a pornographic video while repeating the racial epithet verbally.
"We were all caught off guard, said Amanullah, a resident senior fellow at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue in London. "We had no clue where it was coming from.
Harassers have begun to leverage every feature of Zooms platform for abuse. They have used the apps custom background feature to project a GIF of a person drinking to participants in an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting and its annotation feature to write racist messages in a meeting of the American Jewish Committee in Paris.
When you see this kind of rampant abuse, it isnt just a one-off thing, said Whitney Phillips, an assistant professor at Syracuse University who teaches digital ethics. "Clearly, this is systemic.
Zoom has exploded in popularity as the global population has become increasingly homebound in an effort to limit the spread of the coronavirus. According to the app data firm SensoiTower, first-time installs of the videoconferencing company's mobile app rose by 1,126% in March to more than 76 million, up from just 6.2 million in February.
But the company was not prepared for the rapid growth of its user base. Zoom has offered guidance on making conferences more secure by changing call settings and offering tutorials, but many users have been unsatisfied with the companys response to specific incidents of harassment.
"Zooms response was like, Were sorry, as if this only happened to me, said Dennis Johnson, a doctoral candidate who complained to Zoom after his dissertation defense was disrupted by pornography and a racial slur. "They treated me like an isolated incident - thats my biggest issue.
The company gave an email statement Thursday. "Zoom strongly condemns harassment of this kind and we have been reporting instances of this to various social platforms in order for them to take appropriate action, said Nate Johnson, a Zoom spokesman.
The frequency and reach of the incidents on Zoom prompted the FBI to issue a warning last week, singling out the app and stating that it had "received multiple reports of conferences being disrupted by pornographic or hate images and threatening language" nationwide. On dozens of Twitter accounts and online forums, people are drawn into private group chats on Discord, an app that has been popular in far-right circles. There, people share Zoom codes, raid video conferences simultaneously and designate point values for certain types of harassment in order to drive competition. The Times discovered 14 active Discord chats with dozens of messages sent a minute, with the most popular chat hosting more than 2,000 people.
"This behavior violates Discords terms of service, and we strongly condemn it," a spokesperson from Discord said in an email statement. "Once we identify those servers engaging in this sort of activity, we quickly investigate and take action, including removing content, banning users and shutting down those servers."
On Instagram, a network of accounts with names like Zoomraid and Zoomattack began to appear at the end of March and saw a spike in followers - nearly 30,000 as of Thursday. The owners of these accounts post Zoom meeting codes so that others can coordinate raids of password-protected videoconferences.
"We dont want Instagram used this way. We will block hashtags used to coordinate zoombombing and remove accounts created solely for the purpose of zoombombing when we see them, a Facebook company spokesperson said via email.
As classrooms across the country have largely shifted to online-only education in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, many students feel ill-equipped to perform in this new learning environment. Several teenagers who ran Zoom raid accounts spoke about their frustrations with online schooling and how, for them, Zoom-raiding classes provided an outlet. It was the only way they felt they could escape their crushing academic workload.
Most of the accounts run by teenagers are operating with the goal of derailing middle and high school classes with disruptive but largely inoffensive jokes.
Part of the reason we do it is, a lot of teachers give us a lot of work right now," said James, 16, who runs a Zoom raid account. "Its stressing us out. We just got home for quarantine, and on top of all that we have all this schoolwork to do. We still have tests to do. I have more work to do sometimes now than before because every teacher will assign stuff every week, and sometimes classes get in the way of each other. Its really stressful to keep up."
The more nefarious organizing tends to happen on Discord. In one Discord chat, a middle school's class schedule, including Zoom links for each class, was shared with hundreds of members who stated their intent to harass the students and their teachers.
Another group discussed disrupting a singles mixer organized by a Baptist church in Virginia. "As soon as it starts theres gonna be rape, one member said. "Im putting gore on straight away, another added.
Alcoholics Anonymous, which has largely transitioned to open online meetings using Zoom, has become a frequent target. "Have fun with these AA codes," one Discord user wrote in a post that linked to nearly 600 AA meetings in California. Another uploaded a 28-page document with links to support groups for trans and nonbinary youth.
Jeff, a 39-year-old AA member in Los Angeles, said that in the last three weeks he has attended 30 meetings using Zoom. Every single one, he said, had been interrupted by an online troll.
When he enters a virtual AA meeting now, Jeff said, his heart starts racing. "It's a sense of fear and panic but also a sadness around the loss of this place to be vulnerable, he said.
Videos and livestreams of Zoom harassment have begun to appear on YouTube and Twitch, the Amazon-owned video gaming site.
A popular YouTuber streamed himself for more than six hours harassing dozens of AA meetings hosted on Zoom. Another video posted March 30 about crashing college classes racked up more than 4.2 million views and inspired a slew of copycats. One video posted by a YouTuber with 1.7 million subscribers that purported to show "raids of online classes" instead displayed a woman facing harassment in an AA meeting.
We have strict policies that prohibit content containing harassment, hate speech or unwanted sexualization, and we quickly remove content when flagged by our users," said Alex Joseph, a YouTube spokesman.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - Jason Hargrove was furious.
A woman on his bus had just coughed four or five times, unguarded. He went on Facebook and vented his anger, cursing at times.
In a video posted on March 21, he railed against the d.srespect that he said passengers like her had shown workers like him who
were trying to make Detroit run in the midst of a pandemic.
"We're out here as public workers, doing our job, trying to make an honest living to take care of our families," he said. "But for
you to get on the bus, and stand on the bus, and cough several times without covering up your mouth, and you know that we're in
the middle of a pandemic, that lets me knowthat some folks don't care."
On Wednesday, a week and a half after recording the video outside his bus, Hargrove, a 50-yearold, married father of six, died
from complications of COVID19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, according to his union and city officials.
Hargrove's video has since been viewed more than half a million times, and has resonated as a rem inder of the dangers that
transit employees and other blue-collar workers face as they suddenly find themselves on the front lines of the coronavirus.
"He knew his life was being put in jeopardy - even though he was going to work for the c.tizens of Detroit every day - by
somebody who just didn't care, somebody who didn't take this seriously," Mayor Mike Duggar told reporters on Thursday. "And
now he's gone."
Duggan said he thought of Hargrove and other workers who pu: themselves at risk whenever h? saw people violating social
distancing rules.
"You're putting really gooc people like Jason Hargrove's lives on the line," he said. "I hope the people in this city and in this
country will watch his video and listen to his words, because it's a message this country needs to hear."
Detroit, which has endured population loss and the largest municipal bankruptcy in the nation, has become a coronavirus hot spot,
with more than 3,900 cases anc nearly 130 deaths as of Saturday afternoon, according to the city Health Department.
City officials said they were no: sure when Hargrove contracted the virus.
But even before his death. Detroit's bus drivers had complained that the city was nc: doing enough to protect them, said Glenn
Tolbert, the president of the local transit workers' union, wha himself tested positive for the coronavirus on Thursday. Toiben
said on Saturday that 200 of the union's 525 members were in quarantine.
"The feai is real, and this virus is real, and the closer it hits to home, it just makes it more real," Tolbert said.
On March 17, Detroit's bus drivers refused to go to work until the city acted.
The seme day, Duggan announced several changes ta protect the drivers, including waiving fares; requiring passengers to use
only the rear doors; and making sure drivers had gloves, masks and disinfecting wipes. The city also stepped up the cleaning and
sanitizing of buses, according to John Roach, a city spokesman.
Detroit has also reached an agreement with the Greektown Casino-Hotel to provide rooms for bus drivers who are worried about
infecting family members at home, Roach said.
In his video, Hargrove said the woman who coughed on his bus without covering her mouth showed that some people were not
taking the virus seriously.
"It's folks dying out here," he said, adding that he felt violated both for himself and for other passengers who were on the bus.
Hargrove had been a bus driver since October 2016 and was ân active member of the union, Tolbert said. On his Facebook page,
Hargrove had posted a photo of himself wearing a mask on his bus with the captions "#ICannotStayHome" and
'T'mOnTheRoad4U.'
"He was frustrated, but he was a professional guy to the end," Tolbert said.
"I just don't want his death to be in vain," he added. "I want us to get through this thing, and I want the transit operators around
the world to be recognized as first responders and given the necessary equipment."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The Trump administration is expected to announce Monday that it is designating an ultranationalist group based in Russia as a terrorist organization, according to officials.
It is the first time the government will apply the label to a white supremacist group.
While the label of specially designated global terrorist has been frequently used for Islamist extremists, there have been growing concerns among U.S. officials about violent white supremacists with transnational links over the past five years. In 2018, the White House added that threat to the government's National Strategy for Counterterrorism.
The State Department's designation for the organization, the Russian Imperial Movement, sets up the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control to block any American property or assets belonging to the group. It will also bar Americans from financial dealings with the organization and make it easier to ban its members from travelingtotheU.S.
The U.S. is also designating three of the group's leaders - Stanislav Anatolyevich Vorobyev, Denis Valliullovich Gariev and Nikolay Nikolayevich Trushchalov-as individual terrorists who will face similar sanctions, officials said.
The authority for either the Treasury Department or the State Department to deem a group or an individual a specially designated global terrorist traces back to an executive order issued by President George W. Bush after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
President Donald Trump in September signed an executive order expanding that authority to cover groups that provide training for terrorists even if the groups are not directly linked to any attack.
The Russian Imperial Movement is not considered to be sponsored by the Russian government, officials said, although President Vladimir Putin has tolerated its activities and it has helped advance the Russian government s external goals by recruiting Russian fighters to aid pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine.
The group has also helped support neo-Nazi organizations in Scandinavia, which dovetails with the Russian government's broader pattern of trying to stoke internal divisions, including along racial lines, and sow chaos in Western democracies.
Ambassador Nathan A. Sales, the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, said the group operated two facilities in St.
Petersburg, Russia, that offered paramilitary training to neo-Nazis and white supremacists.
Although a Russian Imperial Movement member has visited the U.S., the organization does not appear to have domestic members. It is not clear if the group has provided training to U.S.-based neo-Nazis.

Texto completo: U.S. high court declines case of 1960s Black militant
WASHINGTON - The Supreme Court is declining to take the case of a 1960s black militant formerly known as H. Rap Brown who is in prison for killing a Georgia sheriff's deputy in 2000.
As is usual, the justices didn't comment Monday in turning away Brown's case. Brown had argued his constitutional rights were violated at trial.
Brown converted to Islam and now goes by the name Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin. He gained prominence more than 50 years ago as a Black Panthers leader and was at one point the chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.
In 2002, Al-Amin was convicted of murder in the death of Fulton County sheriff's Deputy Ricky Kinchen and the wounding of Kinchen's partner, Deputy Aldranon English. He was sentenced to life in prison.
Al-Amin had argued that a prosecutor violated his right not to testify by directly questioning him during closing arguments in a sort of mock cross-examination.

NYC zoo reports wild cats infected with coronavirus
NEW YORK - A tiger at the Bronx Zoo has been infected with the coronavirus, in what is believed to be a case of what one official called "human-to-cat transmission."
"This is the first instance of a tiger being infected with COVID-19," according to the federal Agriculture Department, which noted that although only one tiger was tested, the virus appeared to have infected other animals as well.
"Several lions and tigers at the zoo showed symptoms of respiratory illness," according to a statement by the department.
They are expected to recover.
Public health officials believe that the large cats caught COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, from a zoo employee.
The tiger, a 4-year-old Malayan tiger named Nadia, appeared visibly sick by March 27. Her sister Azul and two Amur tigers are also sick.
The tiger was the only animal tested because the procedure involved general anesthesia, the Agriculture Department said. While there were other tigers and lions showing similar symptoms, the veterinarian wanted to limit the potential risks of general anesthesia to one animal, it said.
The World Organisation for Animal Health says that there is no evidence that cats or dogs spread the disease to humans, but that anyone who is sick should take precautions in contact with their animals as they would with people.

U.S. captain of stricken naval carrier tests positive for virus
Capt. Brett Crazier, the naval captain who was removed from command of the coronavirus-stricken aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt, has tested positive for COVID-19, according to two Naval Academy classmates of Crozier's who are close to him and his family
The commander began exhibiting symptoms before he was removed from the warship Thursday, two of his classmates said. Crazier was fired following a leak to The San Francisco Chronicle of a letter he had emailed to Navy leaders that detailed the failures on the service's part to provide the necessary resources to swiftly move sailors off the carrier and disinfect areas on board as the virus spread through the ship.
Thomas Modly the acting secretary of the Navy, said he had lost confidence in Crozier's ability to command the ship effectively as it dealt with the evolving crisis after Crazier sent the letter on an unclassified email system to 20 to 30 people. Sending such a letter, Modly said, caused unnecessary alarm about the operational readiness of the ship and undermined the chain of command.
Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union" that there were 155 confirmed cases of COVTD-19 among sailors aboard the aircraft carrier.
The news of Crozier's diagnosis is likely to fuel further skepticism of the Navy's handling of the carrier outbreak, which has already received notable criticism from the rank and file.

UPS pilots vote to approve two-year contract extension
ATLANTA - Pilots for UPS have voted to approve a two-year extension of their labor contract.
The pilots for the company's cargo carrier, who are represented hy the Independent Pilots Association, voted 98.9 percent in favor of the contract extension.
"This contract extension provides stability for both UPS and our pilots as we jointly face unprecedented times in our industry," Independent Pilots Association President Robert Travis said in a statement.
UPS has more than 2,900 pilots, and more than 95% of its eligible members cast ballots.
The company said the new agreement includes annual raises, continued benefits and retirement contributions, and it keeps other terms in place.
The two sides in early February announced the tentative agreement for the extension, subject to ratification by pilots. The pilots' current contract ends Sept. 1,2021, and the new agreement extends the contract until Sept. 1,2023.

Domestic abuse ?ourishes amid global virus restrictions

Texto completo: Add another public health crisis to the toll of the new coronavirus: Mounting data suggests that domestic abuse is acting like an opportunistic infection, flourishing in the conditions created by the pandemic.
There was every reason to believe that the restrictions imposed to keep the virus from spreading would have such an effect, said Marianne Hester, a Bristol University sociologist who studies abusive relationships. Domestic violence goes up whenever families spend more time together, such as Christmas and summer vacations, she said.
Now, with families in lockdown worldwide, hotlines are lighting up with abuse reports, leaving governments trying to address a crisis that experts say they should have seen coming.
The United Nations called Sunday for urgent action to combat the worldwide surge in domestic violence.
"I urge all governments to put women's safety first as they respond to the pandemic," Secretary-General Antonio Guterres wrote on Twitter.
But governments largely failed to prepare for the way the new public health measures would create opportunities for abusers to terrorize their victims. Now, many are scrambling to offer services to those at risk.
But, as with the response to the virus itself, the delays mean that irreparable harm may already have occurred.
Lockdown and'intimate terrorism'
As cities and towns across China locked down, a 26-year-old woman named Lele found herself entangled in more and more arguments with her husband, with whom she now had to spend every hour in their home in Anhui province, in eastern China.
On March 1, while Lele was holding her 11-month-old daughter, her husband began to beat her with a high chair. She is not sure how many times he hit her. Eventually, she said, one of her legs lost feeling and she fell to the ground, still holding the baby in her arms.
A photograph she took after the incident shows the high chair lying on the floor in pieces, two of its metal legs snapped off - evidence of the force with which her husband wielded it against her. Another image documents Lele's injuries: Nearly every inch of her lower legs was covered in bruises, a huge hematoma blooming on her left calf.
Lele - her full name is not being used for her safety - said that her husband had abused her throughout their six-year relationship, but that the novel coronavirus outbreak made things far worse.
"During the epidemic, we were unable to go outside, and our conflicts just grew bigger and bigger and more and more frequent," she said. "Everything was exposed."
As quarantines take effect around the world, that kind of "intimate terrorism" - a term many experts prefer for domestic violence - is flourishing.
In China, a Beijing-based NGO dedicated to combating violence against women, Equality, has seen a surge in calls to its help line since early February, when the government locked down cities in Hubei province, then the outbreak's epicenter.
In Spain, the emergency number for domestic violence received 18% more calls in the first two weeks of lockdown than in the same period a month earlier.
"We've been getting some very distressing calls, showing us clearly just how intense psychological as well as physical mistreatment can get when people are kept 24 hours a day together within a reduced space," said Ana Bella, who set up a foundation to help other women after herself surviving domestic violence.
On Thursday, French police reported a nationwide spike of about 30% in domestic violence. Christophe Castaner, the French interior minister, said he had asked officers to be on the lookout for abuse.
"The risk increases due to confinement," he said in an interview on French television.
No escape
In Spain, with the help of women's associations, The New York Times contacted women stuck at home with an abusive husband or partner and conducted interviews over WhatsApp.
One of them, Ana - who asked that her full name be withheld - shares an apartment with her partner and says he has been regularly abusing her. He insists on total surveillance at all times. If she tries to lock herself in a room, he kicks the door until she opens it.
"I can't even have privacy in the bathroom - and now I have to endure this in a lockdown," she wrote in a message sent late at night, to hide the communication from her husband.
Judith Lewis Herman, a renowned trauma expert at Harvard University Medical School, has found that the coercive methods that domestic abusers use to control their partners and children "bear an uncanny resemblance" to those that kidnappers use to control hostages and that repressive regimes use to break the will of political prisoners.
"The methods which enable one human being to control another are remarkably consistent," she wrote in a widely cited 1992 journal article. "While perpetrators of organized political or sexual exploitation may instruct each other in coercive methods, perpetrators of domestic abuse appear to reinvent them."
In addition to physical violence, which is not present in every abusive relationship, common tools of abuse include isolation from friends, family and employment; constant surveillance; strict, detailed rules for behavior; and restrictions on access to such basic necessities as food, clothing and sanitary facilities.
Home isolation, however vital to the fight against the pandemic, is giving still more power to the abuser, Hester said.
"If suddenly people have got to be at home," she said, "that gives him an opportunity, suddenly, to call the shots around that. To say what she should be doing or shouldn't."
The isolation has also shattered support networks, making it far more difficult for victims to get help or escape.
Fragile resources, overwhelmed
After her husband attacked her with the high chair, Lele limped to the next room and called police. When they arrived, however, they only documented the attack, then took no further action.
Next, she hired a lawyer and filed for divorce - only to find that the epidemic had cut off that avenue of escape, too. Her divorce proceeding was postponed until April. She is still waiting for the court's decision.
And finding a new home amid the outbreak proved difficult, forcing Lele and her daughter to continue to live with their abuser for weeks.
It is a pattern playing out around the world.
Institutions that are supposed to protect women from domestic violence, many weak and underfunded to begin with, are now straining to respond to the increased demand.
Feng Yuan, a co-founder of Equality, the Chinese advocacy group, said she had one client who called an emergency line only to be told the police were too overstretched to help her.
"We can come to your place after the crisis," she recounted the operator saying.
In Europe, one country after another seems to have followed the same grim path: First, governments impose lockdowns without making sufficient provisions for domestic abuse victims. About 10 days later, distress calls spike, setting off a public outcry. Only then do the governments scramble to improvise solutions.
Italy was first.
Its lockdown began in early March. Soon after that, domestic violence reports began to rise, but there was nowhere for newly desperate women to go. Shelters could not take them because the risk of infection was too great.
So the government said local authorities could requisition hotel rooms to serve as makeshift shelters where victims could quarantine safely.
Spain announced its lockdown March 14; France's began three days later. About two weeks later, with abuse reports soaring, officials there announced that they, too, planned to turn vacant hotel rooms into shelters, among other emergency efforts.
In Britain, authorities waited longer before imposing a lockdown.
Ten days before it began March 23, The New York Times contacted the Home Office about what it planned to do about domestic violence. The response: Only "existing sources of advice and support" would be available. The government later published a list of hotlines and apps that victims could use to call for help, but only one was specifically tailored for the COVID-19 crisis.
By a week into lockdown, Avon and Somerset, in the southwest of the country, said domestic abuse reports were already up by 20%, and local forces elsewhere were bracing for the same.
Last week, after dozens of civic groups signed an open letter to the government calling for action, officials pledged to respond, without offering specifics.
"Supporting victims of domestic abuse is a priority for the home secretary, and she is fully aware of the distress and anxiety this period may cause to those suffering or at risk of domestic abuse," the Home Office said in a statement. "We are working with the police, domestic abuse charities, help lines and front-line workers to support and protect people."
It also said victims could "disregard orders to stay at home if they need to seek immediate refuge."
Eventually, the lockdowns will end. But as the confinement drags on, the danger seems likely to intensify. Studies show that abusers are more likely to murder their partners and others in the wake of personal crises, including lost jobs or major financial setbacks.
With COVID-19 ravaging the economy, such crises are set to become much more frequent.

Texto completo: For Americans sheltering at home during the coronavirus pandemic, the Zoom videoconferencing platform has become a lifeline, enabling millions of people to easily keep in touch with family members, friends, students, teachers and work colleagues.
But what many people may not know is that, until Thursday, a data-mining feature on Zoom allowed some participants to surreptitiously access Linkedln profile data about other users - without Zoom asking for their permission during the meeting or even notifying them that someone else was snooping on them.
The undisclosed data mining adds to growing concerns about Zoom's business practices at a moment when public schools, health providers, employers, fitness trainers, prime ministers and queer dance parties are embracing the platform.
An analysis by The New York Times found that when people signed in to a meeting, Zoom's software automatically sent their names and email addresses to a company system it used to match them with their Linkedln profiles.
The data-mining feature was available to Zoom users who subscribed to a Linkedln service for sales prospecting, called Linkedln Sales Navigator. Once a Zoom user enabled the feature, they could quickly and covertly access Linkedln profile data - like locations, employer names and job titles - for people in their Zoom meetings by clicking on a Linkedln icon next to their names.
The system did not simply automate the manual process of one user looking up the name of another participant on Linkedln during a Zoom meeting. In tests conducted last week, The Times found that even when a reporter signed in to a Zoom meeting under pseudonyms - "Anonymous" and "I am not here" - the data-mining tool was able to instantly match him to his Linkedln profile. In doing so, Zoom disclosed the reporter's real name to another user, overriding his efforts to keep it private.
Reporters also found that Zoom automatically sent participants' personal information to its data-mining tool even when no one in a meeting had activated it. Last week, for instance, as high school students in Colorado signed in to a mandatory video meeting for a class, Zoom readied the full names and email addresses of at least six students - and their teacher - for possible use by its Linkedln profile-matching tool, according to a Times analysis of the data traffic that Zoom sent to a student's account.
The discoveries about Zoom's data-mining feature echo what users have learned about the surveillance practices of other popular tech platforms over the last few years. The video-meeting platform that has offered a welcome window on American resiliency during the coronavirus - providing a virtual peek into colleagues' living rooms, classmates' kitchens and friends' birthday celebrations - can reveal more about its users than they may realize.
"People don't know this is happening and that's just completely unfair and deceptive," Josh Golin, executive director of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, a nonprofit group in Boston, said of the data-mining feature. He added that storing the personal details of school children for nonschool purposes, without alerting them or obtaining a parent's permission, was particularly troubling.
Late last week, after Times reporters contacted Zoom and Linkedln with their findings on the profile-matching feature, the companies said they would disable the service.
In a statement, Zoom said it took users' privacy "extremely seriously" and was "removing the Linkedln Sales Navigator to disable the feature on our platform entirely." In a related blog post, Eric S. Yuan, the chief executive of Zoom, wrote that the company had removed the data-mining feature "after identifying unnecessary data disclosure." He also said that Zoom would freeze all new features for the next 90 days to concentrate on data security and privacy issues.
In a separate statement, Linkedln said it worked "to make it easy for members to understand their choices over what information they share" and would suspend the profile-matching feature on Zoom "while we investigate this further."

Texto completo: NEW YORK — New York, the epicenter of the global coronavirus outbreak, has begun to show the first signs of controlling the crisis: Its staggering death and hospitalization rates have started to stabilize, according to figures released by Governor Andrew Cuomo on Monday.
But while striking a note of optimistic caution, Cuomo warned that the state's progress could continue only if New Yorkers maintained a sense of discipline and suppressed their natural impulse to gather in the parks or on the streets, especially as the spring weather starts improving.
“We get reckless," Cuomo said at his daily news briefing, “you will see these numbers go up again."
The governor's mixed assessment came as the pandemic entered its second month and neared what federal officials called a crucial moment for determining its future.
Even with the promising signs, the virus' overall toll in New York state was still astonishing: Nearly 5,000 people in the state have died, half of those in New York City.
And across the country, many states were reporting alarming increases in cases that were straining hospitals. Federal officials, who have cited projections indicating that the virus could ultimately kill more than 100,000 people nationwide, warned that the next few days could bring a ghastly uptick in the number of deaths.
In Florida, Indiana, and Louisiana, the number of fatalities attributed to the virus more than doubled in a week. But there were also signs that the situation was improving on the West Coast, where the virus first surged in the United States.
New York City officials are starting to lay contingency plans if deaths from the coronavirus outbreak begin to overwhelm the capacity of morgues: temporarily burying the dead on public land.
Mayor Bill de Blasio said Monday that the city would consider temporary burials if the deaths from the coronavirus outbreak exceed the space available in city and hospital morgues, but it had not reached that point.
“It's going to be very tough but we have the capacity," the mayor said.
New York Times
Watchdog backs governors' concerns over shortages
WASHINGTON — A federal internal watchdog is corroborating warnings by governors and front-line health care workers that hospitals' ability to combat the coronavirus pandemic is being impeded by shortages of tests, protective gear, staff, and space, as well as inconsistent government advice.
Some hospitals are so desperate for protective masks that they are scrounging them from auto body shops and nail salons, according to a report by the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services. At least one hospital is making its own hand sanitizer by mixing gel used for ultrasounds with alcohol from a distillery, the report said.
The report is the first public federal critique of the capacity of the nation's hospitals to cope with the flood of infected patients in coronavirus hot spots. In substantiating complaints about inadequate equipment, it counters assertions by President Trump that hospitals and state officials advocating for them are merely being greedy.
The report's findings are based on a survey of 343 hospitals spanning 46 states. It was conducted during five days at the end of March.
Washington Post
Trump, Biden spoke by phone about outbreak
WASHINGTON — President Trump said he had a “really wonderful, warm conversation" with Joe Biden Monday about the coronavirus outbreak.
“He gave me his point of view, and I fully understood that, and we just had a very friendly conversation," Trump said at his daily press briefing.
The president said he and Biden agreed not to share the details of their conversation, but confirmed an earlier statement from the Biden campaign that the Democrat offered “suggestions" on how to address the pandemic. But Trump added: “It doesn't mean that I agree with those suggestions."
Kate Bedingfield, Biden's deputy campaign manager, said in a statement that the two had a “good call" where Biden “expressed his appreciation for the spirit of the American people in meeting the challenges facing the nation."

Acting Navy secretary slams fired captain as 'stupid'
The Navy's top civilian excoriated the fired commander of the USS Theodore Roosevelt to its crew Monday as the sailors huddled on the island of Guam amid a coronavirus outbreak among their ranks, according to a transcript that was leaked online Monday.
Acting Navy secretary Thomas B. Modly addressed the crew of the aircraft carrier Monday afternoon via the ship's internal loudspeaker system. In a profane and defensive address that one crew member described in an interview as “whiny, upset, irritated, condescending," Modly took repeated shots at the integrity of Captain Brett E. Crozier, who was removed from command last week, and eventually injected partisan political tones into the address by attacking former vice president Joe Biden, who has repeatedly criticized Crozier's removal.
Modly's visit to the aircraft carrier followed the firing of Crozier after an e-mail he wrote seeking further help for his stricken crew was leaked to The San Francisco Chronicle.
Modly said Crozier was “too naïve or too stupid to be a commanding officer" if he thought that letter wasn't going to leak.

A tiger is sick with virus, but your cats are probably OK
When a tiger tests positive for coronavirus, the immediate question is: What about other cats?
Nadia, a 4-year-old Malayan tiger who had a dry cough and a slight loss of appetite, tested positive for the novel coronavirus, the Bronx Zoo in New York City reported Sunday. She is doing well, according to Paul Calle, the zoo's chief veterinarian. And, he said, neither Nadia's infection nor reports from China of domestic cats being infected should make cat owners fear for their pets or fear the cats may pass the virus to humans.

Texto completo: LONDON — The British government hurtled into uncharted territory Tuesday, with its foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, taking up the day-to-day duties of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was being treated in an intensive care unit as he battled a worsening case of the coronavirus.
Britain, with no written constitution, does not have a codified order of succession. That legal lacuna has prompted questions during prior episodes where prime ministers fell ill or underwent surgery, and now looms large at a time when Britain faces its greatest crisis since World War II.
Raab, 46, as first secretary of state, would become the government's de facto leader if the prime minister could not carry out his duties. He was “deputized" by Johnson on Monday, led the government's daily meetings about the pandemic, and will probably take on additional duties, with Johnson's prognosis so uncertain.
The government said Johnson, who has suffered symptoms of the virus for 11 days, was moved into intensive care Monday evening after his condition deteriorated sharply. He has received “standard oxygen treatment" but is breathing on his own and has not been put on a ventilator, officials said Tuesday. Nor has he been diagnosed with pneumonia, they said.
Still, how the government will function if the prime minister is out for a prolonged period, or dies, is not yet clear.
The government will face momentous decisions, including when and how to lift the lockdown on Britain. Johnson, 55, had been leading that process and communicated the government's measures to the public in daily briefings, where his familiar shambling style gave way to a graver mien.
Raab, by contrast, has been a peripheral figure in the government's response, mostly focusing on organizing evacuation flights to bring back Britons stranded overseas. He is best known for his hard-line views on Brexit, which helped him get his post in Johnson's pro-Brexit Cabinet.
No other Western government has been so ravaged by the virus, and it comes after 3½ years of political upheaval. Even before this crisis, analysts said Johnson's Cabinet was weak, in part because he purged several senior party members during last fall's bitter debate over Brexit.

Japan finally declared an emergency, but is it too late?
TOKYO — For months, Japan has confounded the world by reporting a relatively low rate of coronavirus infections without imposing the kind of stringent measures used by other nations.
As the country now declares a state of emergency in the face of a worrisome rise in cases, medical specialists are wondering whether the move Tuesday has come just in time to avoid calamity, or is too little, too late.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, in announcing that the declaration would apply to Japan's biggest population centers for the next month, painted an optimistic picture. By asking citizens to significantly reduce human-to-human contact, he said, “the expansion of infections can be turned to a decline in two weeks."
But some specialists said the state of emergency amounted to a tacit admission that the approach the country had stood by for months was no longer working, as Japan reached 3,906 confirmed cases Tuesday, exactly double the number a week earlier.

Turkey orders people to wear masks, as infections climb
ISTANBUL — Turkey has ordered all citizens to wear masks when shopping or visiting crowded public places and announced that it will deliver masks to every family, free of charge, as infections increase in the country of 80 million.
The order is the latest in a gradual tightening of antivirus measures by a government that has insisted the virus was under control and has resisted a complete lockdown.
Turkey has more than 34,000 confirmed cases of the virus and has registered 725 deaths. More than 1,400 patients are in intensive care units and at least 600 medical workers have been infected, according to figures released Tuesday by the Health Ministry.
The number of confirmed cases places Turkey among the top 10 currently worst-affected countries and reflects a steep rise since its first confirmed death from the disease on March 17.

Europe's nursing homes in spotlight for uncounted dead
ROME — Italian authorities said Tuesday they were investigating the country's biggest nursing home where 70 residents died last month, in a stark reminder of the difficulties Europe faces in accurately counting its pandemic victims, particularly among the elderly
Lombardy regional Governor Attilio Fontana said he had opened a commission of inquiry into the deaths at Milan's Pio Albergo Trivulzio home, given published assertions by a doctor and a union leader that management downplayed the risk of infection and wrongly attributed the causes of death. La Repubblica newspaper said Milan prosecutors had opened a criminal investigation.
The Trivulzio home, which has 1,000 residents, disputed the Repubblica report, saying it had abided by all health care precautions, that COVID-19 tests simply weren't available for its sick residents, and that the number of dead was in line with its 2019 toll.
Nursing home deaths have come to represent a significant hidden toll from the pandemic in Europe, since many elderly were never tested for the coronavirus, were never hospitalized, and their deaths were never counted in official virus tolls.

Most people on Antarctica cruise ship have coronavirus
MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay — Nearly 60 percent of 217 people — many from Australia, Europe, and the United States — on board a cruise ship off the coast of Uruguay have tested positive for the coronavirus, the ship's operator said Tuesday.
“There are currently no fevers on board, and all are asymptomatic," said Aurora Expeditions, the Australian operator of the Greg Mortimer ship that is working to disembark the crew and passengers and arrange flights to their home countries.
The Greg Mortimer departed March 15 on a voyage to Antarctica and South Georgia that was titled “In Shackleton's Footsteps," a reference to the polar explorer who led British expeditions to the region and died there in 1922.
Of 217 people tested on the vessel, 128 were positive for the virus that causes COVID-19 and 89 tested negative, Aurora Expeditions said.
Another six people who were evacuated from the ship are in stable condition and being treated in Montevideo.
In a separate case, a cruise ship anchored in Santos, on the coast of Brazil's Sao Paulo state, had its quarantine extended until at least April 19 after doctors found new suspected cases of the coronavirus, according to Brazilian officials. There are now 40 suspected cases aboard the Costa Fascinosa vessel, which is owned by Costa Cruises. Hundreds of people are on the ship.

What you need to know today about the virus outbreak

Texto completo: US authorities on Tuesday reported 29,000 more people infected with the novel coronavirus and more than 1,800 more deaths — the highest daily death toll so far.
But amid the grim data, some officials said they saw grounds for hope that the pandemic's devastation would at least not be as bad as the direst projections.
New York, the state hit hardest by the virus, reported its highest-ever daily death toll: 731. But Democratic Govwenor Andrew Cuomo said the number of new patients admitted to hospitals appeared to be trending downward.
"Right now we're projecting that we are reaching a plateau in the total number of hospitalizations, and you can see the growth and you see it starting to flatten," Cuomo told reporters Tuesday.
Nationwide, one computer model of the disease's future spread — relied upon by governors and the White House — shifted its estimate of COVID-19's US death toll downward this week. Instead of roughly 94,000 deaths as estimated a week ago, the University of Washington model now predicts about 82,000 by late summer.
"Even during this painful week, we see glimmers of very, very strong hope," President Trump told reporters Tuesday. Vice President Mike Pence added that "we continue to see evidence of stabilization" in hard-hit areas.
Still, what is passing for good news still means about 70,000 Americans alive today may die by August. The models predict the worst day for deaths will be around April 16, meaning daily death tolls will grow higher until then.
Yet the tone of some of the nation's top experts has changed in the past 48 hours.
"You're starting to see that we may be actually — in a series of communities outside of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut — creating a much flatter graph, a much flatter curve," said Deborah Birx, director of the White House coronavirus response.
That echoed Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a day earlier.
"Everybody who knows me knows I'm very conservative about making projections, but those are the kind of good signs that you look for," Fauci said of the New York figures.
But some experts urged caution.
"From all the data we have, it suggests we're just beginning to approach the peak for several regions of the country," said Marynia Kolak, assistant director of health informatics at the University of Chicago's Center for Spatial Data Science. She said she is worried about future surges in tribal areas in the Southwest, and in areas of the South where social distancing measures were implemented just recently.
Washington Post
States, courts move to put limits on abortion
Texas struck a blow against abortion rights when a federal appeals court ruled the state can ban most procedures as long as the governor's emergency health decree to save medical supplies for fighting the pandemic is in effect.
A three-judge panel in New Orleans said in a 2-1 ruling that a woman's constitutional right to abortion can be temporarily set aside during a national health emergency.
US Supreme Court precedent says “all constitutional rights may be reasonably restricted to combat a public health emergency," Circuit Judge Kyle Duncan, who was appointed by President Trump, wrote in the majority opinion.
The ruling came after clinics, impatient for guidance, threatened to escalate the issue to the Supreme Court on Wednesday morning.
A March 22 order by Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, banned all nonessential medical procedures in order to preserve hospital beds and personal protective equipment for treating COVID-19 patients. The order applies to even nonsurgical abortions that don't require masks and gloves, and violators face steep fines and jail time, according to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, also a Republican.

Crew member on hospital ship tests positive
A crew member aboard the Navy hospital ship USNS Comfort tested positive for the coronavirus, and several others have gone into isolation, the Navy said Tuesday, the latest setback in the ship's troubled mission to New York to assist in the pandemic response.
News of the infection came a day after President Trump relented to pressure from New York hospitals and allowed the Comfort to begin accepting patients who had the virus.
The ship arrived last week with great fanfare and was supposed to relieve pressure on New York's overburdened hospitals by taking patients suffering from other ailments.
But bureaucratic hurdles, as well as a sharp decline in hospitalizations unrelated to the virus, resulted in few patients being transferred to the ship.
By Thursday, the 1,000-bed ship had only 20 patients. The empty beds angered hospital leaders, whose facilities have been overwhelmed with people sick with COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus.

Governor looks at 'new options' after criticism
SAVANNAH, Ga. — Georgia Governor Brian Kemp is “considering new options" amid criticism from local officials for his order that reversed beach closures and other restrictions imposed by cities and counties to battle the coronavirus, the governor's spokeswoman said Tuesday.
Kemp's executive order last week requiring Georgia residents to shelter at home, except under prescribed exceptions, drew an outcry from some city and county leaders for a provision that rolled back any tougher restrictions already imposed by local governments. Those nullified restrictions included local decisions to close public beaches on the 100-mile Georgia coast.

Nurses from Philippines await visas to help US
As the coronavirus pandemic threatens to strain nursing staffs at hospitals across the United States, Melanie N. Beckham knows where to find reinforcements. But first, the Trump administration needs to give its approval.
Beckham, president of Vintage Health Resources Inc. in Germantown, Tenn., specializes in helping hospitals throughout the southeastern US hire nurses from the Philippines, a country with a large population of English speakers and a long history of sending health care workers abroad.
Of the several hundred Philippine recruits now in Vintage's application process, more than 100 nurses have passed the licensing and language exams. They've completed background checks and are ready to head to the United States. Yet they are stuck because they can't get their visas processed.
"They could come tomorrow," Beckham said. "The demand is overwhelming right now."
Since President Trump took office on a promise to crack down on immigration, nurses from the Philippines have faced more red tape. Officials return about 50 percent of Vintage's applications and demand additional paperwork, up from just 5 percent of applications during the Obama administration, Beckham said.

No statewide shutdown orders from nine governors
DES MOINES — Even as most Americans are under orders from their governor to stay at home to slow the spread of the coronavirus, leaders in a handful of states have steadfastly refused to take that action, arguing it's unneeded and could be harmful.
Nine governors have refused to issue statewide mandates that people stay at home, but local leaders have taken action in some of those states. North Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, and Arkansas are the only states where no one is under a stay-at-home order.
The lack of action from those governors — even as they take other steps such as closing schools and limiting the size of gatherings — has frustrated health experts and left some residents puzzled.
“If social distancing maneuvers are going to work, they're most likely going to work if you do them early," said Arthur L. Reingold, a professor and infectious disease expert at the University of California Berkeley. “The longer you wait, the harder it is for them to have a substantial impact on transmission of the virus."
That also has been the message of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, who has said all states should have statewide orders that people remain at home.
Fauci on Monday credited the governors of Nebraska and Iowa for what steps they have taken to slow the virus, but David Leeson, a retiree in Winterset, Iowa, said he can't understand why restrictions that make sense in most of the country haven't been imposed in his home state.
“I think it's idiotic," Leeson said. “The only way this is going to work is to have every state under the same rules."

Manhattan cathedral to host field hospital
The Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in Manhattan, one of the largest church buildings in the world, will partner with the Rev. Franklin Graham's ministry, Samaritan's Purse, to set up a field hospital under its 124-foot-high stone nave, Graham said Monday.
Graham, an evangelist who was to travel to New York on Tuesday to visit the Episcopal church, said New York's Mount Sinai Hospital asked for his ministry's help with the effort.
Tents expected to hold at least 200 patients will be set up inside the cathedral by the end of the week, the Rev. Clifton Daniel III, the dean of the cathedral, told The New York Times, which first reported the news.
Church officials told the Times that about 400 beds were delivered last week, though it's unclear whether patients will be treated specifically for the novel coronavirus.
The crypt will be used as "a staging area" for medical personnel, Daniel told the Times, and it's the first time the cathedral will be used as a hospital.
For decades, Graham's comments about Islam and gay people have induced controversy, and raised red flags for some when his Samaritan's Purse came to New York. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters last week that his office would "monitor" the facility to ensure staff would not discriminate.
Graham said that members of the mayor's office visited the facility Sunday, adding that they were not concerned over issues of discrimination.

Bicycle-pedestrian awareness helps make everyone safer

Texto completo: To all bicyclists, thank you to those of you who have bells or other ways of warning pedestrians you are coming from behind them. I'd also like to say some of us walking may be hard of hearing or deaf. We may or may not hear your bell or your shout. Please make sure the pedestrian acknowledges your warning. And pedestrians, please acknowledge you hear the warning.I am severely hearing impaired and wear hearing aids. Even so, I may not hear you. I try to stay aware and check behind me if I want to move across a path, but I'm not perfect. Many times I am startled as a rider rushes past me. I will gladly step to the side, if needed, for you to get by easily and safely. But I have to know you are coming. Thank you for your consideration. Let's all, bicyclists and pedestrians, work to be more aware.

Between the lines
If you endorse a candidate who snarlingly promoted policy adjudicated as racist or if you spend tax dollars erecting signs that I believe promote hatred against the homeless, with knowledge that this class of citizens are disproportionately people of color, you just might be a racist. That's true however blandly you present yourself.
Three decades ago, during the regime of another mayor I saw as insipidly racist, I did the lion's share of my retail shopping in Albuquerque. Looks like I'll be going down there again to give my 7.88 cents' worth, instead of the 8.44 cents here.

Ahead of the curve
A recent New York Times had an article on Helen Branswell, a reporter at Stat, a medical and science news website ("The medical news site that saw the coronavirus coming months ago," New York Times, March 30). On Jan. 4, Stat published Branswell's report of a "growing cluster of unexplained pneumonia cases" in central China. There was some indication, she said, of "a new virus, and perhaps even a new coronavirus."
Had we still the Pandemic Response Team that the president in his infinite wisdom disbanded in 2018, these guys would have sprung to action and we, the American people, would have learned of the serious threat in early January, not in mid-March, and my friends would not have gone to New York for the Armory Show in early March where they contracted the virus.
I say President Donald Trump is directly responsible for their plight. They should sue him for all he is worth.

Use blood draws
This is a suggestion in response to the editorial, ("Test everyone: That's how to get ahead of the virus," Our View, March 29). For those of us who have to have periodic blood drawn for chronic conditions, in my case on a quarterly basis for rheumatoid arthritis, have the COVID-19 and/or antibody test done at the same time. This may be a way to increase the number of people who are tested until more test kits are available. It also would be a way to reduce the duplication of services. In addition, the antibody test could be administered again the next time blood is drawn to determine any changes from the previous test.

Thanks, Kaune's
We wish to thank The New Mexican for its recent feature article on Kaune's Neighborhood Market ("We're gonna be here," March 23). We are longtime customers of Kaune's who go there almost every day. Cheryl Sommer and her entire staff are always completely professional and wonderfully personal and especially so in this time of unprecedented national difficulty. They are providing an essential and invaluable service to the people of Santa Fe, and they are providing it with a warm and caring human touch at some risk to their own health and that of their families. Theirs is a true and touching community spirit.
All Santa Feans should be extremely proud of the dedicated people of Kaune's; we certainly are and we are proud to be among their loyal customers and friends. To Cheryl and to everybody on the Kaune's staff, we say a sincere and heartfelt "thank you."

No news is bad news in briefing room

Resumen: New York Times’ executive editor Dean Baquet said that possible exposure to the coronavirus and the White House news briefings’ lack of news value drove his decision, The Washington Post reported. The correspondents’ association has negotiated with the White House to limit how many journalists safely can be in the room; 14 out of 49 seats are spaced for social distancing and rotated among interested outlets. If the White House wanted Rion in the room, as a One America News Network executive told The Washington Post, the press office should have given her a seat among administration staff on the sideline where she can ask Trump, as she once did, if the term "Chinese food" is racist.

Texto completo: The Washington Post and The New York Times aren’t sending reporters to the Trump White House for daily briefings.
Washington Post executive editor Martin Baron explained, "We have to keep in mind our reporters’ health and those of our colleagues at other media outlets," as he noted that Post reporters were exposed to a symptomatic reporter who later tested negative.
New York Times’ executive editor Dean Baquet said that possible exposure to the coronavirus and the White House news briefings’ lack of news value drove his decision, The Washington Post reported.
How low the titans of journalism have slumped.
News outlets routinely send reporters into war zones and natural disasters with ugly death tolls. Yet somehow the White House is just too dangerous?
It’s one thing for editors to tell reporters who can work at home to do so and to direct journalists who are at high risk to cede their spots to other colleagues. It’s another thing for major news organizations to engage in — what else can you call it? — a boycott.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classifies reporters as essential workers whose presence is vital in keeping the public informed.
In effect, Baron and Baquet are arguing: We’re not essential. We don’t need to be there. Our crew can watch it on TV.
Liberal bias surely is a driver, and also can be seen in the debate as to whether cable news should air the ratings-rich briefings. It’s no accident that this debate is percolating as President Donald Trump’s approval ratings have been inching upward.
Washington Post columnist Margaret Sullivan wrote: "Business as usual simply doesn’t cut it. Minor accommodations, like fact-checking the president’s statements afterward, don’t go nearly far enough to counter the serious damage this man is doing to the public’s well-being."
And: "Radical change is necessary: The cable networks and other news organizations that are taking the president’s briefings as live feeds should stop doing so."
In this cloistered news climate, the vaunted public’s right to know is for suckers.
It looks bad when journalists say there is not enough news in the briefings after the White House press corps spent so much time decrying the end of daily briefings in March 2019.
It’s a good thing that the White House Correspondents Association canceled its annual dinner in April, because we’d look pretty silly patting ourselves on the back for courageously standing up for the First Amendment. In our bathrobes.
Yes, I am writing this from home. But I’ll be back in the White House for pool duty, and I am up for a coveted briefing room seat — unless I show symptoms.
The White House has to be one of the safest places inside the beltway to work. Someone takes your temperature before you can get through the gate, and again before briefings.
The correspondents’ association has negotiated with the White House to limit how many journalists safely can be in the room; 14 out of 49 seats are spaced for social distancing and rotated among interested outlets. Under this social-distancing regime, reporters cannot stand in the aisles.
Wednesday, there was a kerfuffle when Chanel Rion, a Trump-friendly reporter with One America News Network, broke the new regimen by standing in the aisle for the second day in a row. The correspondents association kicked her out of rotation.
On Twitter, One America News Network staff tried to frame the move as the liberal establishment squashing a conservative voice. It’s a happy conceit that has the network trolling for victimhood after Rion flouted rules that apply to everyone else.
Inconvenient fact: One America News Network was on rotation for a seat.
If the White House wanted Rion in the room, as a One America News Network executive told The Washington Post, the press office should have given her a seat among administration staff on the sideline where she can ask Trump, as she once did, if the term "Chinese food" is racist.
By the way, Trump can grant Rion an interview whenever he wants. No one is standing on the way.
I’m not a fan of Rion’s style, which falls under the heading showboat on a soapbox. That profile is equally unappealing when practiced by left-leaning cable news correspondents who prefer pontificating to asking questions.
But at least Rion wants to be in the room, which is more than I can say for The New York Times and Washington Post.

Inconvenient fact: One America News Network was on rotation for a seat. By the way, Trump can grant Rion an interview whenever he wants. No one is standing in the way.
I’m not a fan of Rion’s style, which falls under the heading showboat on a soapbox. That profile is equally unappealing when practiced by left-leaning cable news correspondents who prefer pontificating to asking questions.
But at least Rion wants to be in the room, which is more than I can say for The New York Times and Washington Post.

Texto completo: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff requested information from acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell about recent staffing changes while raising concerns about the politicization of the spy process.
“I am writing to express my concern that you are pursuing organizational and personnel changes at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence without consulting and seeking authorization from Congress and in a manner that undermines critical intelligence functions,” Schiff said in a four-page letter on Tuesday. “This effort appears to be proceeding despite the coronavirus pandemic and amid indications, exemplified by a March 10 briefing to members of Congress, of political interference in the production and dissemination of intelligence.”
Grenell shot back on Twitter, accusing Schiff of playing political games.

“His letter was sent to the press before it was sent to me,” Grenell said after journalists tweeted the letter out. “These press leaks politicizing the intelligence community must stop.”

Grenell, who is concurrently serving as U.S. ambassador to Germany, has faced opposition from Democrats who claim he was picked to be acting spy chief for his loyalty to President Trump. He has been a forceful advocate for U.S. interests in strengthening NATO and countering Russia.
Schiff said his committee would be undertaking “additional oversight” of three issues — the reorganization of the ODNI, election security, and the termination of Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson — in order to “ensure the independence of the IC.”
The Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not immediately respond to the Washington Examiner’s request for comment.
"Congress has neither authorized organizational changes at ODNI nor appropriated funds for that purpose," said Schiff, who also told Grenell that “President Trump did not nominate you for confirmation as permanent DNI." Trump has renominated Texas Rep. John Ratcliffe to take on the spy chief role permanently.
Schiff demanded by April 16 a “detailed written explanation for all potential organizational and personnel changes at ODNI” and all internal communications related to the departure of Russell Travers, the acting director of the National Counterterrorism Center, and acting Deputy Director Peter Hall.

Grenell's office denied a report claiming Travers was fired.
“We are grateful for acting Director Russ Travers’s many years of service to the American people. Russ told acting Director Grenell he wanted to retire and that he did not want another assignment,” Amanda Schoch, the assistant DNI for strategic communications, told the Washington Examiner in March.
Since taking on the new role, Grenell has embarked on a weekslong effort to end what he views as redundant efforts carried out by the ODNI, aiming to shift some power back to the other spy agencies.
“Acting DNI Grenell has emphasized with ODNI leadership this review is not an effort to purge, as some have erroneously suggested,” Schoch said. “The goal is to make sure scarce Intelligence Community resources are used in the best way possible.”
In his letter Tuesday, Schiff also claimed “reports indicate that one or more members of your staff may be inappropriately interfering with the production and briefing of intelligence information on election security to Congress.” The Democrat said “if accurate, this politicization of intelligence would constitute a grave breach of your duty as Acting DNI to preserve the independence of the IC.”
Schiff demanded Grenell hand over by the same April 16 deadline “any and all communications” related to the Director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center William Evanina’s participation in the March 10 briefing. The chairman also requested a “written election security update” by May 30 and Grenell’s own testimony before the committee “at the earliest practicable opportunity.”
National security officials told lawmakers in March the intelligence community had not concluded Russia was backing any particular 2020 candidate while warning about meddling by China, Iran, and North Korea. An unclassified ODNI fact sheet rejected a stream of media reports on classified briefings on election security.

“The IC has not concluded that the Kremlin is directly aiding any candidate’s reelection or any other candidates’ election. Nor have we concluded that the Russians will definitely choose to try to do so in 2020,” the ODNI said.
That countered media reports by the Washington Post and others in which anonymous sources said the intelligence community concluded Russia was helping Trump with reelection and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont win the Democratic primaries.
In February, the intelligence community disputed information the media were given about another classified House Intelligence Committee briefing, with officials denying lawmakers were told Russia was attempting to help Trump in 2020.
The New York Times from March, cited by Schiff as evidence of inappropriate interference, was largely based upon complaints by Schiff and other Democratic lawmakers. The article claimed Kash Patel, a senior adviser to Grenell, "imposed limits" on what intelligence officials could tell Congress, but other spy agencies said they received no such request.
Patel, a former top aide to the GOP’s current House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes, was the primary author of a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act memo in early 2018, which detailed alleged FISA abuses against Trump campaign associate Carter Page.

Patel sued the New York Times and Politico last fall over reporting he says falsely accused him of being a back channel to Trump on Ukraine. He also criticized Schiff, tying him to the leaks from closed-door impeachment hearings.

Schiff claimed on Tuesday that Trump’s recent remarks prove his firing of Atkinson was “politically-motivated reprisal.”
He asked Grenell for a “written certification” that ODNI officials “will not permit retaliation or reprisals” against whistleblowers. And Schiff said Grenell has a “legal obligation” to submit to the committee the ICIG’s semi-annual report by the end of May.
“I thought he did a terrible job — absolutely terrible. He took a whistleblower report, which turned out to be a fake report. It was fake. It was totally wrong,” Trump said of Atkinson’s handling of the Ukraine whistleblower complaint this weekend.

Trump selected retired Air Force colonel and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency General Counsel Thomas Monheim to be the acting intelligence community watchdog.
“We are honored to have such an incredibly qualified expert,” Grenell said of Monheim.

US media parrot Chinese propaganda, talk of censoring White House briefings

Texto completo: Why do members of the free press keep parroting Chinese agitprop, including the preposterous and totally unverified claim that China has had not a single new coronavirus death since January?

“U.S. reports 1,264 coronavirus deaths in over 24 hours,” NBC News recited this week. “Meanwhile in China, where the pandemic broke out, not a single new coronavirus death was reported.”

Chinese officials concede they have new infection cases, but they also allege those cases were imported into China by dirty foreigners. This is the level on which the Chinese Communist Party has long operated — a sort of ultranationalism that seeks to blame outsiders for its nation's problems. Yet our media are accepting its dubious (even just from a math perspective) claims at face value.

Let me put this in terms that American journalists might understand, were they not so bound up in irrational hatred of the Trump administration: Is it possible, just maybe, that the timing of China's supposed good news is not coincidental to the fact that it recently expelled a bunch of U.S. reporters?

“Health officials reported 32 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus in mainland China on Monday, all of them imported, bringing the total to 81,740,” the NBC article continues. “The former epicenter of the epidemic, Wuhan, reported only two new confirmed cases in the past 14 days.”
Now seems like a good time to remind everyone that the regime that claims now to have had no new coronavirus deaths since January is the same regime that claims only 200 civilians and security personnel died in the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. (The actual number may be as high as 10,000.)
Here comes the best part of the NBC report [emphasis added]:
The city has been showing signs of going back to normal since last week. With its subway and train service resuming last weekend, some businesses, supermarkets and shopping malls have also re-opened their doors. Photos shared by state media in the past few days showed people venturing out into the streets, walking their dogs, buying food in the street markets and even relaxing on the banks of the Yangtze River — with many still wearing masks.
That latter part about state-provided photos should serve as a red flag. Has NBC spoken to anyone in Wuhan? Does anyone in the newsroom know anybody with a camera who may be able to verify that the state-provided photos are not from November? NBC's reporters seem incapable of considering that China’s data, and its potentially staged photographs, are unreliable and should not be passed along to viewers as fact.

But don't be too hard on NBC — a whole slew of Western news outlets, including Bloomberg News, CNN, the New York Times, and the Washington Post are doing the same thing.

To their credit, the New York Times and the Washington Post at least noted in their coverage that there are serious doubts about the accuracy of China’s official figures.

But NBC, CNN, and Bloomberg failed even to do this.

Speaking of Bloomberg, it reported on April 1 that the U.S. intelligence community concluded in a classified report that China has “concealed the extent of the coronavirus outbreak in its country, under-reporting both total cases and deaths.”
Do its reporters not talk to one another?

It is nothing short of amazing that as U.S. media continue to recite Chinese propaganda with all the eagerness of party functionaries, then wrestle with whether to censor or boycott President Trump’s coronavirus press briefings to protect the viewing public from false or misleading claims.

Good luck squaring that circle.

Paul Krugman: Will we flunk coronavirus economics?

Texto completo: Just a month ago Donald Trump was still insisting that COVID-19 was a trivial issue, comparing it to the “common flu.” And he dismissed economic concerns; after all, during flu season, “nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on.”
But pandemics come at you fast. Since Trump’s blithe dismissal, something like 15 million Americans have lost their jobs — the economic implosion is happening so quickly that official statistics can’t keep up.
In our last economic crisis the economy shrank around 6% relative to its long-run trend, and the unemployment rate rose around five percentage points. At a guess, we’re now looking at a slump three to five times that deep.
And this plunge isn’t just quantitatively off the charts; it’s qualitatively different from anything we’ve seen before. Normal recessions happen when people choose to cut spending, with the unintended consequence of destroying jobs. So far this slump mainly reflects the deliberate, necessary shutdown of activities that increase the rate of infection.
As I’ve been saying, it’s the economic equivalent of a medically induced coma, in which some brain functions are temporarily shut down to give the patient a chance to heal.
While a deep slump is unavoidable, however, good policies could do a lot to minimize the amount of hardship Americans experience. The problem is that the U.S. political landscape has long been dominated by an anti-government ideology that left us unprepared, intellectually and institutionally, for this crisis.
What should we be doing? Serious economists have already reached a rough consensus over the appropriate policy response to a pandemic. The bottom line is that this isn’t a conventional recession, which calls for broad-based economic stimulus. The immediate mission, beyond an all-out effort to contain the pandemic itself, should instead be disaster relief: generous aid to those suffering a sudden loss of income as a result of the economy’s lockdown.
It’s true that we could suffer a second round of job losses if the victims of the lockdown slash spending on other goods and services. But adequate disaster relief would address this problem, too, helping to sustain demand.
So it’s all about helping the economic victims of the coronavirus lockdown. How are we doing?
The good news is that thanks to Democratic pressure, the CARES Act, the $2 trillion not-a-stimulus bill that became law less than three weeks after Trump dismissed the notion that COVID-19 might pose an economic problem, is mostly focused on the right things. The core provisions of the legislation are aid to hospitals, the unemployed and small businesses that maintain their payrolls; these are exactly the kinds of things we should be doing.
What’s especially remarkable is that we got mostly sensible legislation even though the president was talking nonsense, pushing for — what else? — tax cuts as the solution for the economy’s problems. Actually, I can’t think of any other recent example in which Republicans agreed to major fiscal legislation that mainly involved spending to benefit the needy, without any tax cuts for the rich.
The bad news comes in two parts.
First, the bill falls far short of what’s needed on one crucial dimension: aid to state governments, which are on the front line of dealing with the pandemic. Unlike the federal government, states have to balance their budgets each year. Now they’re facing a surge in costs and huge revenue losses; unless they get a lot more aid, they’ll be forced to cut spending sharply, which will directly undermine essential services and indirectly deepen the overall slump.
And it’s not clear when or whether that hole will be filled. Senate Republicans are hostile to the idea of another rescue package; White House officials are reportedly still talking about tax cuts.
Second, decades of hostility to government have left us poorly positioned to deliver even the aid Congress has voted. State unemployment offices have been underfunded for a long time, and red states have deliberately made it hard to apply for benefits. So the surge in unemployment is overwhelming the benefits system; Congress may have voted disaster relief, but the money isn’t flowing.
The loan program for small businesses is also, by all accounts, off to a shambolic start. And those $1,200 checks everyone is supposed to get? Many Americans won’t get them for weeks or months.
It doesn’t have to be like this. Canada has already set up a special web portal and phone system to provide emergency unemployment benefits. Germans have been pleasantly surprised by how quickly aid is flowing to the self-employed and small businesses.
But decades of conservative attacks on the idea that government can do anything good have left America with a unique case of learned helplessness. And this is combined with utter lack of leadership from the top.
We know what we should be doing in terms of economic policy, and Congress passed a relief bill that, while flawed, was better than I expected. But right now it looks as if our response to the economic emergency will fall far short.

Texto completo: Do you remember President George W. Bush’s remarks at ground zero in Manhattan after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks? I can still hear him speaking of national grief and national pride. This was before all the awful judgment calls and fatal mistakes, and it doesn’t excuse them. But it mattered, because it reassured us that our country’s leader was navigating some of the same emotional currents that we were.
Do you remember President Barack Obama’s news conference after the school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, that left 28 people, including 20 children, dead? I do. Freshest in my memory is how he fought back tears. He was hurting. He cared. And while we couldn’t bank on new laws to prevent the next massacre, we could at least hold on to that.
One more question: Do you remember the moment when President Donald Trump’s bearing and words made clear that he grasped not only the magnitude of this rapidly metastasizing pandemic but also our terror in the face of it?
It passed me by, maybe because it never happened.
In Trump’s predecessors, for all their imperfections, I could sense the beat of a heart and see the glimmer of a soul. In him I can’t, and that fills me with a sorrow and a rage that I quite frankly don’t know what to do with.
Americans are dying by the thousands, and he gloats about what a huge, rapt television audience he has. They’re confronting financial ruin and not sure how they’ll continue to pay for food and shelter, and he reprimands governors for not treating him with adequate adulation.
He’s not rising to the challenge before him, not even a millimeter. He’s shriveling into nothingness.
On Friday, when Trump relayed a new recommendation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that all Americans wear face masks in public places, he went so far out of his way to stress that the coverings were voluntary and that he himself wouldn’t be going anywhere near one that he might as well have branded them Apparel for Skittish Losers. I’ve finally settled on his epitaph: “Donald J. Trump, too cool for the coronavirus.”
This is more than a failure of empathy, which is how many observers have described his deficiency. It’s more than a failure of decency, which has been my go-to lament. It’s a failure of basic humanity.
In The Washington Post a few days ago, Michael Gerson, a conservative who worked in Bush’s White House, wrote that Trump’s spirit is “a vast, trackless wasteland.” Not exactly trackless. There are gaudy outposts of ego all along the horizon.
When the direness of this global health crisis began to be apparent, I was braced for the falsehoods and misinformation that are Trump’s trademarks. I was girded for the incompetence that defines an administration with such contempt for proper procedure and for true expertise.
But what has taken me by surprise and torn me up inside are the aloofness, arrogance, pettiness, meanness, narcissism and solipsism that persist in Trump — that flourish in him — even during a once-in-a-lifetime emergency that demands something nobler. Under normal circumstances, these traits are galling. Under the current ones, they’re gutting.
“I don’t take responsibility at all.” “Did you know I was number one on Facebook?” To bother with just one of those sentences while a nation trembles is disgusting. To bother with both, as Trump did, is perverse.
He continues to bash the media, as if the virus were cooked up in the bowels of CNN. He continues to play blame games and to lord his station over those of a lesser political caste, turning governors into grovelers and suggesting that they’re whiny piggies at the federal trough.
He continues his one-man orgy of self-congratulation, so that in the same breath recently he speculated about a toll of 100,000 deaths in America from COVID-19 and crowed about what a great job he’s doing.
And he continues to taunt and smear his perceived political adversaries. Last week, on Fox News, he called Nancy Pelosi “a sick puppy.” This is how he chooses to spend his time and energy?
At those beloved daily briefings of his, where he talks and talks and talks, he sometimes seems to regard what’s happening less as a devastating scourge than as a star-studded event. Just look at the nifty degree of prominence it’s conferring on everyone and everything involved! He has mused aloud about how well known Anthony Fauci has become. He has marveled at the disease’s celebrity profile.
“Become a very famous term — C-O-V-I-D,” he said Thursday. Was that envy in his voice?
He leaps from tone deafness to some realm of complete sensory and moral deprivation.
“I want to come way under the models,” he said Friday, referring to casualty projections. “The professionals did the models. I was never involved in a model.”
“At least this kind of model,” he added. No context like a pandemic for X-rated humor.
It’s an extraordinary thing: to fill the air with so many words and have none of them carry any genuine sadness or stirring resolve.
I can hear his admirers grumble that he doesn’t do camera-perfect emotions, that Obama was just a better actor, that Trump is the more authentic man.
To which I answer: What’s the point of having a showman for a president if he can’t put on the right kind of show? Performances count, even if they’re just performances. And Trump clearly isn’t averse to artifice. Just look at his hair.
A cheap shot? I’m feeling cheap. A loss of life and livelihoods on this scale will do that to you.
As of this writing, at least 9,600 people with the coronavirus have died in the United States. That’s more than three times the number killed in the Sept. 11 attacks. New York state alone reported 630 new deaths Saturday. No school shooting has taken even a small faction of as many lives.
And while I’m not looking to Trump for any panacea, is it too much to ask for some sign that the dying has made an impression on him, that the crying has penetrated his carapace and that he’s thinking about something other than his ratings? I watch. I wait. I suspect I’ll be doing that forever.

Texto completo: Se suponía que iban a pasar seis días de luna de miel en las islas Maldivas. Un idílico paraíso en un resort de cinco estrellas en una nación compuesta por más de mil pequeñas islas en el Océano Índico. Casi una semana a los pies de un mar cristalino que concluiría el pasado 22 de marzo. Pero Olivia, de 27 años, y Raúl De Freitas, de 28, aún siguen allí. La pandemia de coronavirus y las crecientes restricciones de viaje, les han impedido regresar a Sudáfrica, donde residen, y se han quedado atrapados en el edén vacacional.
La pareja se aseguró de preguntar a su agente de viajes si habría algún problema debido a la crisis sanitaria global. La agencia les despreocupó y les animó a pasarlo bien durante su luna de miel. Entonces llegaron los problemas. Días después de aterrizar, recibieron un aviso de que los aeropuertos de su país estarían cerrados para la medianoche del día siguiente. La mayoría de huéspedes del complejo turístico tuvieron margen para empacar sus maletas y regresar a sus países de origen. Para ellos resultaba un quimera.
Decidieron ponerse en contacto con el Consulado de Sudáfrica en las Maldivas y con la Embajada de Sudáfrica más cercana, ubicada en Sri Lanka, en busca de ayuda. Un funcionario les comunicó a través de WhatsApp que había unos 40 sudafricanos repartidos entre las islas y que la mejor opción para regresar a casa era contratar un avión privado. El coste: $104,000 dólares, según publica The New York Times.
La opción más plausible era dividir el precio del alquiler de jet entre todos los viajeros atrapados en las islas, $2,600 dólares por cabeza. Pero el gobierno sudafricano solo había llegado a contactar con 20 de ellos y no muchos no podían pagar ese precio o no querían, además de que el coste sería el doble si los funcionarios solo daban con esa cantidad de ciudadanos. A día de hoy, el vuelo sigue sin concretarse.
Este fin de de semana, Olivia y De Freitas, eran los únicos huéspedes el centro vacacional, el Cinnamon Velifushi Maldives , que normalmente atiende a unos 180 invitados por estas fechas. Según su página web, las tarifas de las habitaciones comienzan en $750 dólares por noche. Para la pareja, profesora y carnicero, la luna de miel suponía un gasto fuera de lo común y casi una extravagancia. Aunque sus ahorros disminuyen cada día, el hotel les ofreció “un generoso descuento diario”, según contaron al Times.
Se supone que el bloqueo en Sudáfrica durará hasta el 16 de abril. Pero, como en todas partes, los decretos sobre viajes y movimiento cambian continuamente. Mientras tanto, los recién casados pasaron sus días buceando, comiendo marisco y tomando el sol en el complejo hotelero que ocupa toda la isla, mientras han sido atendidos en exclusiva el personal del hotel.
Este domingo, según contó la pareja a The New York Times, la embajada les pidió que hicieron sus maletas rápidamente. Fueron llevados en una lancha a otro resort de cinco estrellas, donde están reuniendo a todos los sudafricanos repartidos por las islas. Pero todavía desconocen cuando podrán regresar a casa.
“Todo el mundo fantasea con quedarse atrapado en una isla tropical, hasta que realmente ha sucedido, así que es genial haber tenido este tiempo extra. Pero solo suena bien porque sabemos que en algún momento podremos irnos”, resumió Oliva al Times.

Could that bad December cough have been coronavirus?

Texto completo: A handful of widely circulated Facebook posts have asserted that people in the United States likely contracted the coronavirus as early as last fall.
"Who got sick in November or December and it lasted 10 to 14 days, with the worst cough that wouldn't go away?" the posts say. "If you can answer, yes, then you probably had the coronavirus. There were no tests and the flu test would come back negative anyway. They called it a severe upper respiratory infection."
Many of the posts currently circulating include the profile photo of a Facebook user named Donna Lee Collier. Collier did not respond to a USA TODAY request for comment on the origin of the posts.
Bonnie Powell, of Waynesboro, Georgia, copied the status and received more than 230 shares. She said the post reflects her opinion, not necessarily scientific proof. But she said she had heard from friends about sickness at the end of last year, which makes her suspicious.
Coronavirus likely originated in November, was first in U.S. in January Researchers have tied the origin of the virus to a live animal market in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization first received a report of the outbreak on Dec. 31, but the virus originated in China more than a month earlier than that. A study published in early March by researchers at ETH Zurich puts the origin of the virus in the first half of November.
Rumors surrounding the origins of the novel coronavirus have swirled as it spreads around the globe. Theories that the virus originated in a Chinese laboratory, or that it originated outside of China and was brought over by the U.S. Army, are not supported by evidence, according to medical experts. The virus is believed to have animal origins, likely in bats.
On Jan. 21, the Centers for Disease Control announced the first case of novel coronavirus in the United States from a person who had recently returned to Washington from Wuhan. The United States has since surpassed China and Italy to become the most infected country in the world, according to a tracker from Johns Hopkins University.
Symptoms of the novel coronavirus include a fever, cough and shortness of breath. Reported illnesses range from mild symptoms to severe symptoms and death.
Could the coronavirus have been in the U.S. before January? Experts say it's plausible that coronavirus came over to the U.S. from China before that first January case, but more testing is needed to be sure.
"Anecdotally, we've heard about some influenza-like illnesses in December and January that were a little bit atypical," said Dr. Luis Ostrosky, a professor of infectious diseases at McGovern Medical School at UTHealth in Houston. "But the thing we need to solve that puzzle is when we actually start doing testing of antibodies, not just detecting the virus."
Ostrosky said that would include taking a look at blood samples from December and January to see if the virus was already in circulation.
Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said he believes when researchers do more testing, they will probably find the disease was in the U.S. earlier than first believed.
"I believe at the end of this, when we do look back — and we will — we will probably find that this disease was here earlier than we thought," he said. "We also know that when we closed our borders, it was very, very leaky."
However, Benjamin said it's "plausible but not likely" that the coronavirus was in the United States in November and December. If it were in the U.S. before the end of the year, the case would also have likely been connected to travel from China, he said, and likely not widespread.
Dr. Josh Petrie, assistant research professor at the University of Michigan School of Public Health, said it's important to remember that multiple existing viruses can cause severe upper respiratory symptoms and circulated late last year. Among them was Influenza B, which grew in intensity around November and December, as well as RSV and Influenza A.
He said it's possible there were "sporadic" travel-related cases earlier than the discovery of the first case, but agreed it was likely not widespread as far back as November or December.
"There's a lot of surveillance that goes on for influenza every year, and so if we were seeing a lot of coronavirus activity at that time — even if you couldn't test for it — you would see signals in that influenza surveillance," he said.
Would already having the coronavirus make someone immune to further infection by it? That's also still under investigation. Ostrosky said that, in general terms, other coronaviruses do result in built-up immunity.
A New York Times article published Wednesday about research efforts underway to study antibodies characterized the answer to the immunity question as "a qualified yes, with some significant unknowns." Dr. Vineet D. Menachery, a virologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, told the Times that people who are infected may have one to two years of immunity, with any longer time span hard to predict.
Our ruling: More information needed At this point, experts contacted by USA TODAY say it's unlikely that just because someone had a cough or other symptoms of an upper respiratory infection that they "probably had the coronavirus," especially as far back as November.
But it's also plausible that some cases did arrive in the U.S. earlier than the first reported case in January. Experts say additional testing and research is needed to get an exact picture.

Texto completo: These 12 films, all streaming on Netflix, will satisfy your itch for fresh content without demanding much of your time.
As many of us have found ourselves with more time for in-home entertainment, some ambitious souls have taken advantage of these seemingly elastic days by packing in some epic viewing: lengthy, challenging movies, for example, or full-series binges of long-running television shows. But some of us are having a bit of trouble staying -- what's the word? -- ah well, I'll just scroll Twitter again while I try to think of it. Sorry, what were we talking about?
If you also find yourself suffering from a short attention span -- or merely seeking simple, easily completed tasks to check off an arbitrary list for a sense of accomplishment -- here are a dozen movies currently streaming on Netflix that are worth your time (specifically, a time of less than an hour and half).
'Frances Ha' (86 minutes)
Stream it here .
If you're looking for something sunny (and who could blame you?), look no further than this fizzy 2013 indie comedy from Noah Baumbach (who co-wrote and directed) and Greta Gerwig (who co-wrote and stars). Gerwig's Frances is a charming, aimless, young New Yorker who floats from one makeshift home to another, attempting to puzzle out her career, romantic entanglements and future. Along the way, she takes an impromptu trip to France, tries to save her relationship with her best pal (Mickey Sumner) and frolics through Manhattan to the sounds of David Bowie. It's a cool breeze of a movie, and not a second longer than it should be. (Read the New York Times review.)
'The Incredible Jessica James' (85 minutes)
Stream it here .
Similarly summery vibes saturate this 2017 fleet-footed, character-driven rom-com from the writer and director Jim Strouse, who devised this vehicle specifically for its star, Jessica Williams ("The Daily Show" and "2 Dope Queens"). It's easy to see why. She radiates charisma, sass and style as a Brooklyn playwright navigating a rough spot in her creative and romantic life, as she finds her usually high spirits tempered by rejection letters and a bad breakup. Her potential new paramour (Chris O'Dowd) is as much a mess as she is -- so they just might be right for each other. Events unfold about as expected; the reason to watch is Williams, who plays the picture's comedic, dramatic and romantic moments with exhilarating energy and unflagging ease. (Read the New York Times review.)
'Obvious Child' (84 minutes)
Stream it here .
And if you'd like to spend more time with appealing New York protagonists, queue up this modest 2014 indie comedy from the writer and director Gillian Robespierre. Jenny Slate stars as Donna, a Brooklyn stand-up comedian in her late-20s who meets a charming, if square, rebound guy (Jake Lacy). She goes to bed with him and ends up dealing with the consequences of that one-night stand in a way that most comedies sidestep. It's a tricky balancing act of honest comedy, relationship drama and character study, held aloft by Robespierre's wise script, Slate's nuanced characterization and a stellar supporting cast (including Richard Kind, Polly Draper, and Gaby Hoffmann). (Read the New York Times review.)
'Tramps' (83 minutes)
Stream it here .
Stay in the New York groove with this giddily entertaining 2017 crime comedy/romance from the writer and director Adam Leon ("Gimme the Loot"). Callum Turner and Grace Van Patten charm as a pair of small-time crooks doing grunt work on a job that's half-explained and barely understood, by them or the audience. When it goes awry, they have to chase a misplaced package out to the suburbs, where their improvised stakeout turns into a hangout (and, just maybe, a makeout). The movie is full of warm character beats and keenly observed moments, including the ultimate gesture of Gotham romance: "I wanna give you my MetroCard."
'Win It All' (88 minutes)
Stream it here .
There are probably smarter people to entrust with a big bag of money than a compulsive gambler like Eddie Garrett (Jake Johnson) -- he might, for example, decide to "borrow" some cash to scratch his itch and end up several grand in the hole. The story of how Eddie blows that money and tries to win it back is a tricky one to tell, since characters like him don't always make for sympathetic protagonists. But the laid-back charm that Johnson honed to perfection over seven seasons of "New Girl" pairs nicely with Joe Swanberg's affable, shambling, dialogue-driven direction in this 2017 movie, resulting in a brisk and engaging character study.
'Burning Cane' (77 minutes)
Stream it here .
The brief running time of Phillip Youmans's debut feature is, in a way, an act of mercy; it is a story of such bleakness and melancholy, of so many lives in various states of distress and despair, that to dig in longer might be more than some viewers can bear. Yet "Burning Cane" is somehow not a depressing experience; its filmmaking is so exhilarating, its performances so electrifying, its sense of time and place so deeply felt that the picture crackles and vibrates like the old blues records that inspired Youmans, who wrote and directed the 2019 film. That Youmans was a teenager at the time renders his work all the more stunning; it has the kind of richness and wisdom some filmmakers spend a lifetime accumulating. (Read the New York Times review.)
'Paris Is Burning' (71 Minutes)
Stream it here .
This Sundance-winning documentary from Jennie Livingston is an energetic portrait of New York's drag-club scene of the late 1980s, known by its denizens as the ball circuit, and an introduction to some of the inimitable characters in it. Over the course of its short but rich run time, the 1991 film becomes a snapshot of a subculture steeped in history, hierarchies, rivalries and lingo (shade, mopping, vogueing and more). From today's perspective, it's also a work of anthropology, pinpointing elements of a scene that have since permeated mainstream pop culture, often without proper acknowledgment. But the film's most heart-rending sections -- dealing in issues of homophobia, gender bias and anti-transgender violence -- sadly haven't aged a day. (Read the New York Times review.)
'Chasing Coral' (89 minutes)
Stream it here .
In this unsettling yet majestic 2017 documentary, marine scientists and underwater photographers unite to explain the disappearance of major coral reefs. As temperatures rise worldwide, much of the Earth's coral has been destroyed at an alarmingly fast rate. "Chasing Coral" picks up from Jeff Orlowski's previous environmental documentary, "Chasing Ice," and uses similar time-lapse photography to capture the dying of the coral. He wisely puts a human face to the story: Zack Rago, a "coral nerd," finds that even his considerable enthusiasm is no match for the bleakness of his research. (Read the New York Times review.)
'Jiro Dreams of Sushi' (81 minutes)
Stream it here .
"You must dedicate your life to mastering your skill," Jiro Ono explains. "That is the key to happiness." He has certainly mastered his skill; his 10-seat sushi-only Tokyo eatery is recognized the world over and is less a restaurant than a temple. But has that perfectionism made him (or the people around him) happy? David Gelb's mouthwatering 2012 documentary poses that question and further explores his philosophies of life and work, while also crafting a healthy dose of stunning "food porn," painstakingly capturing the careful preparation of Ono's culinary gifts and lovingly lingering on the results. (Read the New York Times review.)
'Slow West' (84 minutes)
Stream it here .
This gorgeous, gloriously eccentric debut feature from the Scottish musician-turned-filmmaker John Maclean brings a welcome international flavor to the Western, a film genre that has traditionally been dominated by all-American icons like John Wayne and James Stewart, but often tells stories of a real-life frontier filled with immigrants and outsiders. In "Slow West" (2015), a young Scotsman (Kodi Smit-McPhee) seeks his lost love with the assistance of an Irish bounty hunter (Michael Fassbender) and with a mysterious stranger (Ben Mendelsohn) in hot pursuit. It's a film of cockeyed humor and strange beauty -- and enough wide-open landscapes to temporarily stay your cabin fever. (Read the New York Times review.)
'I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House' (89 minutes)
Stream it here .
The director Oz Perkins -- son of the "Psycho" star Anthony -- uses unorthodox photography, creepy music and hushed performances to craft this genuinely unsettling 2016 haunted-house movie. It's a modest movie, small even, often filled with just one person rattling around in an old house. But this slow-boiler of a movie is patient and deliberate, emphasizing unease and tension over the modern horror film's typical gore and jump scares (though there are a handful of those, and they're beauties). In fact, it's not really a horror movie at all; it's a ghost story, and quite a good one.
'Cloverfield' (85 minutes)

The concept of the "found footage" horror movie -- a story told entirely in documentary-style video, shot by the participants and discovered after the events it captures -- was still a fairly fresh one in 2008, when the director Matt Reeves fused it with a "Godzilla"-style monster movie to create this inspired "document" of a terrifying alien attack on New York City. But it's not all carnage and shaky-cam; the clever script begins as a home movie shot at a farewell party, establishing a core group of friends and ex-lovers who must rely on one another as the city plunges into chaos, thus creating the kinds of realistic relationships and emotional stakes not often present in monster flicks.

Texto completo: Movement restrictions aimed to stop the spread of the coronavirus may be making violence in homes more frequent, more severe and more dangerous.
Add another public health crisis to the toll of the new coronavirus: Mounting data suggests that domestic abuse is acting like an opportunistic infection, flourishing in the conditions created by the pandemic.
There was every reason to believe that the restrictions imposed to keep the virus from spreading would have such an effect, said Marianne Hester, a Bristol University sociologist who studies abusive relationships. Domestic violence goes up whenever families spend more time together, such as the Christmas and summer vacations, she said.
Now, with families in lockdown worldwide, hotlines are lighting up with abuse reports, leaving governments trying to address a crisis that experts say they should have seen coming.
The United Nations called on Sunday for urgent action to combat the worldwide surge in domestic violence. "I urge all governments to put women's safety first as they respond to the pandemic," Secretary General António Guterres wrote on Twitter.
[Analysis: Peaks, testing and lockdowns: How coronavirus vocabulary causes confusion .]
But governments largely failed to prepare for the way the new public health measures would create opportunities for abusers to terrorize their victims. Now, many are scrambling to offer services to those at risk.
But, as with the response to the virus itself, the delays mean that irreparable harm may already have occurred.
Lockdown and 'Intimate Terrorism'
As cities and towns across China locked down, a 26-year-old woman named Lele found herself entangled in more and more arguments with her husband, with whom she now had to spend every hour in their home in Anhui Province, in eastern China.
On March 1, while Lele was holding her 11-month-old daughter, her husband began to beat her with a high chair. She is not sure how many times he hit her. Eventually, she says, one of her legs lost feeling and she fell to the ground, still holding the baby in her arms.
A photograph she took after the incident shows the high chair lying on the floor in pieces, two of its metal legs snapped off -- evidence of the force with which her husband wielded it against her. Another image documents Lele's injuries: Nearly every inch of her lower legs was covered in bruises, a huge hematoma blooming on her left calf.
Lele -- her full name is not being used for her safety -- said that her husband had abused her throughout their six-year relationship, but that the Covid-19 outbreak made things far worse.
"During the epidemic, we were unable to go outside, and our conflicts just grew bigger and bigger and more and more frequent," she said. "Everything was exposed."
As quarantines take effect around the world, that kind of "intimate terrorism" -- a term many experts prefer for domestic violence -- is flourishing.
In China, a Beijing-based NGO dedicated to combating violence against women, Equality, has seen a surge in calls to its help line since early February, when the government locked down cities in Hubei Province, then the outbreak's epicenter.
In Spain, the emergency number for domestic violence received 18 percent more calls in the first two weeks of lockdown than in the same period a month earlier.
"We've been getting some very distressing calls, showing us clearly just how intense psychological as well as physical mistreatment can get when people are kept 24 hours a day together within a reduced space," said Ana Bella, who set up a foundation to help other women after surviving domestic violence herself.
On Thursday, the French police reported a nationwide spike of about 30 percent in domestic violence. Christophe Castaner, the French interior minister, said he had asked officers to be on the lookout for abuse.
"The risk increases due to confinement," he said in an interview on French television.
No Escape
In Spain, with the help of women's associations, The New York Times contacted women stuck at home with an abusive husband or partner and conducted interviews over WhatsApp.
One of them, Ana -- who asked that her full name be withheld -- shares an apartment with her partner, and says he has been regularly abusing her. He insists on total surveillance at all times. If she tries to lock herself in a room, he kicks the door until she opens it.
"I can't even have privacy in the bathroom -- and now I have to endure this in a lockdown," she wrote in a message sent late at night, to hide the communication from her husband.
Judith Lewis Herman, a renowned trauma expert at Harvard University Medical School, has found that the coercive methods domestic abusers use to control their partners and children "bear an uncanny resemblance" to those kidnappers use to control hostages and repressive regimes use to break the will of political prisoners.
"The methods which enable one human being to control another are remarkably consistent," she wrote in a widely cited 1992 journal article. "While perpetrators of organized political or sexual exploitation may instruct each other in coercive methods, perpetrators of domestic abuse appear to reinvent them."
In addition to physical violence, which is not present in every abusive relationship, common tools of abuse include isolation from friends, family and employment; constant surveillance; strict, detailed rules for behavior; and restrictions on access to such basic necessities as food, clothing and sanitary facilities.
Home isolation, however vital to the fight against the pandemic, is giving still more power to the abuser, Dr. Hester said. "If suddenly people have got to be at home," she said, "that gives him an opportunity, suddenly, to call the shots around that. To say what she should be doing or shouldn't."
The isolation has also shattered support networks, making it far more difficult for victims to get help or escape.
Fragile resources, overwhelmed
After her husband attacked her with the high chair, Lele limped to the next room and called the police. When they arrived, however, they only documented the attack, then took no further action.
Next, she hired a lawyer and filed for divorce -- only to find that the epidemic had cut off that avenue of escape, too. Her divorce proceeding was postponed until April. She is still waiting for the court's decision.
And finding a new home amid the outbreak proved difficult, forcing Lele and her daughter to continue to live with their abuser for weeks.
It is a pattern playing out around the world.
Institutions that are supposed to protect women from domestic violence, many weak and underfunded to begin with, are now straining to respond to the increased demand.
Feng Yuan, a co-founder of Equality, the Chinese advocacy group, said she had one client who called an emergency line only to be told the police were too overstretched to help her. "We can come to your place after the crisis," she recounted the operator saying.
In Europe, one country after another seems to have followed the same grim path: First, governments impose lockdowns without making sufficient provisions for domestic abuse victims. About 10 days later, distress calls spike, setting off a public outcry. Only then do the governments scramble to improvise solutions.
Italy was first.
Its lockdown began in early March. Soon after that, domestic violence reports began to rise, but there was nowhere for newly desperate women to go. Shelters could not take them because the risk of infection was too great.
So the government said local authorities could requisition hotel rooms to serve as makeshift shelters where victims could quarantine safely.
Spain announced its lockdown on March 14; France's began three days later. About two weeks later, with abuse reports soaring, officials there announced that they, too, planned to turn vacant hotel rooms into shelters, among other emergency efforts.
In Britain, the authorities waited longer before imposing a lockdown.
Ten days before it began on March 23, The New York Times contacted the Home Office about what it planned to do about domestic violence. The response: Only "existing sources of advice and support" would be available. The government later published a list of hotlines and apps that victims could use to call for help, but only one was specifically tailored for the Covid-19 crisis.
By a week into lockdown, Avon and Somerset, in the southwest of the country, said domestic abuse reports were already up by 20 percent, and local forces elsewhere were bracing for the same.
Last week, after dozens of civic groups signed an open letter to the government calling for action, officials pledged to respond, without offering specifics.
"Supporting victims of domestic abuse is a priority for the home secretary, and she is fully aware of the distress and anxiety this period may cause to those suffering or at risk of domestic abuse," the Home Office said in a statement. "We are working with the police, domestic abuse charities, help lines and front-line workers to support and protect people,."
It also said victims could "disregard orders to stay at home if they need to seek immediate refuge."
Eventually, the lockdowns will end. But as the confinement drags on, the danger seems likely to intensify. Studies show that abusers are more likely to murder their partners and others in the wake of personal crises, including lost jobs or major financial setbacks.
With Covid-19 ravaging the economy, such crises are set to become much more frequent.

HHS watchdog agency finds severe hospital shortages in combating COVID-19

Texto completo: NEW YORK — New York, the epicenter of the global coronavirus outbreak, has begun to show the first signs of controlling the crisis: Its staggering death and hospitalization rates have started to stabilize, according to figures released by Governor Andrew Cuomo on Monday.
But while striking a note of optimistic caution, Cuomo warned that the state's progress could continue only if New Yorkers maintained a sense of discipline and suppressed their natural impulse to gather in the parks or on the streets, especially as the spring weather starts improving.
“We get reckless," Cuomo said at his daily news briefing, “you will see these numbers go up again."
The governor's mixed assessment came as the pandemic entered its second month and neared what federal officials called a crucial moment for determining its future.
Even with the promising signs, the virus' overall toll in New York state was still astonishing: Nearly 5,000 people in the state have died, half of those in New York City.
And across the country, many states were reporting alarming increases in cases that were straining hospitals. Federal officials, who have cited projections indicating that the virus could ultimately kill more than 100,000 people nationwide, warned that the next few days could bring a ghastly uptick in the number of deaths.
In Florida, Indiana, and Louisiana, the number of fatalities attributed to the virus more than doubled in a week. But there were also signs that the situation was improving on the West Coast, where the virus first surged in the United States.
New York City officials are starting to lay contingency plans if deaths from the coronavirus outbreak begin to overwhelm the capacity of morgues: temporarily burying the dead on public land.
Mayor Bill de Blasio said Monday that the city would consider temporary burials if the deaths from the coronavirus outbreak exceed the space available in city and hospital morgues, but it had not reached that point.
“It's going to be very tough but we have the capacity," the mayor said.

Watchdog backs governors' concerns over shortages
WASHINGTON — A federal internal watchdog is corroborating warnings by governors and front-line health care workers that hospitals' ability to combat the coronavirus pandemic is being impeded by shortages of tests, protective gear, staff, and space, as well as inconsistent government advice.
Some hospitals are so desperate for protective masks that they are scrounging them from auto body shops and nail salons, according to a report by the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services. At least one hospital is making its own hand sanitizer by mixing gel used for ultrasounds with alcohol from a distillery, the report said.
The report is the first public federal critique of the capacity of the nation's hospitals to cope with the flood of infected patients in coronavirus hot spots. In substantiating complaints about inadequate equipment, it counters assertions by President Trump that hospitals and state officials advocating for them are merely being greedy.
The report's findings are based on a survey of 343 hospitals spanning 46 states. It was conducted during five days at the end of March.
Washington Post
Trump, Biden spoke by phone about outbreak
WASHINGTON — President Trump said he had a “really wonderful, warm conversation" with Joe Biden Monday about the coronavirus outbreak.
“He gave me his point of view, and I fully understood that, and we just had a very friendly conversation," Trump said at his daily press briefing.
The president said he and Biden agreed not to share the details of their conversation, but confirmed an earlier statement from the Biden campaign that the Democrat offered “suggestions" on how to address the pandemic. But Trump added: “It doesn't mean that I agree with those suggestions."
Kate Bedingfield, Biden's deputy campaign manager, said in a statement that the two had a “good call" where Biden “expressed his appreciation for the spirit of the American people in meeting the challenges facing the nation."

Acting Navy secretary slams fired captain as 'stupid'
The Navy's top civilian excoriated the fired commander of the USS Theodore Roosevelt to its crew Monday as the sailors huddled on the island of Guam amid a coronavirus outbreak among their ranks, according to a transcript that was leaked online Monday.
Acting Navy secretary Thomas B. Modly addressed the crew of the aircraft carrier Monday afternoon via the ship's internal loudspeaker system. In a profane and defensive address that one crew member described in an interview as “whiny, upset, irritated, condescending," Modly took repeated shots at the integrity of Captain Brett E. Crozier, who was removed from command last week, and eventually injected partisan political tones into the address by attacking former vice president Joe Biden, who has repeatedly criticized Crozier's removal.
Modly's visit to the aircraft carrier followed the firing of Crozier after an e-mail he wrote seeking further help for his stricken crew was leaked to The San Francisco Chronicle.
Modly said Crozier was “too naïve or too stupid to be a commanding officer" if he thought that letter wasn't going to leak.

A tiger is sick with virus, but your cats are probably OK
When a tiger tests positive for coronavirus, the immediate question is: What about other cats?
Nadia, a 4-year-old Malayan tiger who had a dry cough and a slight loss of appetite, tested positive for the novel coronavirus, the Bronx Zoo in New York City reported Sunday. She is doing well, according to Paul Calle, the zoo's chief veterinarian. And, he said, neither Nadia's infection nor reports from China of domestic cats being infected should make cat owners fear for their pets or fear the cats may pass the virus to humans.

ProPublica and Partners Tie for Investigative Reporters and Editors Awards

Texto completo: Investigative Reporters and Editors announced Monday that, in an unusual tie, two ProPublica projects won IRE Awards in the same category. The annual contest recognizes outstanding investigative work.
“He’s a Liar, a Con Artist and a Snitch. His Testimony Could Soon Send a Man to His Death.” by ProPublica senior reporter Pamela Colloff, co-published with The New York Times Magazine, won in the Print/Online Division 1 category for publications with a circulation larger than 400,000. “Profiting From the Poor” by MLK50: Justice Through Journalism editor Wendi C. Thomas, a project of the ProPublica Local Reporting Network, also won in this category.
“While the judges were impressed with all of the entries, they were unable to name just one winner in the Print/Online Division I category,” contest judge Ron Nixon said. "We felt that both pieces were important and strong. Both investigations saved lives in different ways."
In “ He’s a Liar, a Con Artist and a Snitch. His Testimony Could Soon Send a Man to His Death ,” Colloff revealed the corrosive effect that jailhouse informants play in the criminal justice system. She focused on a prolific jailhouse informant named Paul Skalnik, ultimately showing that he gave dubious testimony or questionable information in at least 37 cases in one Florida county alone. Skalnik helped send a total of four men to death row.
Colloff’s reporting also found that prosecutors let Skalnik out of jail, again and again, in exchange for his testimony, despite assuring jurors that he was receiving nothing in return. This leniency resulted not only in numerous injustices; it also created a whole new group of crime victims, who Skalnik preyed upon each time he was released from jail. These victims included two women Colloff interviewed, who were molested by Skalnik when they were 12 and 15.
Jailhouse informants are an opaque part of the criminal justice system cloaked in secrecy — a major reporting barrier for Colloff. In most states, prosecutors’ use of these witnesses is not tracked or regulated. The deals they receive are rarely made public. To tell this story, Colloff relied on extensive public records and conducted interviews with dozens of people who crossed paths with Skalnik. Another challenge was finding the two women who were molested by Skalnik when they were minors. Though Colloff was able to obtain police reports in one case and court records in another, the girls’ names were redacted. Using context clues within those documents and doing on-the-ground reporting in Texas and Florida, she was able to find both women and persuade them to speak on the record about what happened.
Newspaper editorial boards across Florida cited Colloff’s reporting in calling for Gov. Ron DeSantis to stop the execution of James Dailey, a man who Skalnik testified against, from moving forward. A week after the story’s publication, the Miami Herald published an opinion piece called “Don’t let Florida execute James Dailey, Gov. DeSantis. He might be innocent.” Similar editorials also appeared in the Los Angeles Times and The New York Times. Dailey’s case is now under new scrutiny in a Florida circuit court, and DeSantis has indicated that he will hold off on setting an execution date until Dailey’s appeals have played out in the courts.
In her series “ Profiting From the Poor ” from MLK50: Justice Through Journalism, Thomas exposed the predatory debt collection practices of Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare, the largest health care system in Memphis, Tennessee. Thomas showed how Methodist was suing and garnishing the wages of thousands of patients, including many of its own employees, for unpaid hospital bills. Over a five-year period, in the second-poorest large city in the nation, Methodist sued more than 8,300 people. The lawsuits made it hard, if not impossible, for poor people to make ends meet.
Week after week for five months, Thomas sat and took notes as hospital defendants appeared in court, encountering stern judges and a system that often pitted confused defendants against Methodist’s savvy legal team. In the hallway, many agreed to an interview later and gave Thomas their phone number or email address. To gain their trust, she spent time in their homes and their churches; to tell their stories, she expertly wove details of their lives with courtroom observations. Some of those defendants showed up to court wearing their Methodist uniforms. Asked how she manages to make ends meet, one hospital housekeeper said she doesn’t. “It’s killing me, killing me softly,” she said.
The small monthly payments many defendants could afford were drowned by the mountains of court costs and interest Methodist added onto cases. Not only was Methodist aggressive in court; its financial assistance policy for low-income patients was unusually stingy compared to other nonprofit hospitals across the state. Thomas gathered the policies of nonprofits throughout the state to reach that conclusion.
Outrage from the series was swift. Less than five weeks post-publication, chastened hospital officials — who had refused all interview requests — announced sweeping changes that in the end, wiped away $11.9 million in debt for more than 5,300 patients. Methodist also expanded its charity care policy to encompass more than 50% of area residents and raised the pay of its lowest-paid employees.
Deborah Douglas, Andrea Morales, Maya Miller, Beena Raghavendran, Doris Burke, Lylla Younes, Rebecca Davis and Martha Park also contributed to this series.
In addition, “The Quiet Rooms” by ProPublica Illinois and The Chicago Tribune was a finalist for the Print/Online Division 1 category. “A 911 Emergency” by The Public’s Radio, another ProPublica Local Reporting Network partner, was a finalist in the radio/audio category.

Texto completo: Comedian Larry David said Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin might have had more “redeeming” qualities than President Trump.
The mastermind behind Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm spoke with the New York Times for an expansive article on his career, the coronavirus, and his thoughts on Trump.
“You know, it’s an amazing thing. [Trump] has not one redeeming quality. You could take some of the worst dictators in history, and I’m sure that all of them, you could find one decent quality. Stalin could have had one decent quality, we don’t know!” David said.
Historians attribute millions of deaths to the communist dictator during his rule of the Soviet Union.
“That’s the hardest thing about the day, watching what comes out of this guy’s mouth,” he said. “It turns you into a maniac because you’re yelling at the television. All of a sudden, you find yourself screaming, like I used to do on the streets of New York, pre-Seinfeld, when I saw happy couples on the street.”
David, who often plays Sen. Bernie Sanders during sketches on Saturday Night Live, also told the New York Times it is time for people to rally around presidential candidate Joe Biden, suggesting it is time for Sanders to drop out.
“I feel he should drop out,” David said. “Because he’s too far behind. He can’t get the nomination. And I think, you know, it’s no time to fool around here. Everybody’s got to support Biden.”
David follows a long list of Hollywood stars bashing the president, including Chrissy Teigen, who called Trump a “pussy ass bitch,” and Alec Baldwin, who suggested Trump was the real “virus” and “the vaccine arrives in November.”

Texto completo: It should not be this easy for Chinese Communist Party propaganda to make its way into major American newsrooms.
Since the outbreak of the coronavirus, which Chinese lies ensured would become a pandemic, American news media have promoted a number of Beijing-approved talking points, including the one that alleges it is racist to refer to the virus by its country and city of origin. American news media have also accepted at face value a series of dubious claims pushed by Chinese Communist apparatchiks, including the absurd boast that China's new case numbers have remained essentially flat since late February.
"U.S. has more known cases of coronavirus than any other country," CNN reported on March 26, its declaration coming in unison with nearly every major news outlet in the United States.
The CNN report, which was published shortly after pandemic trackers placed the number of coronavirus cases in America at more than 85,000, claimed the “U.S. cases piled up … surpassing China and Italy.”
The coronavirus pandemic in the U.S. is indeed a serious crisis, one that has been made all the worse by the sluggish, incompetent, and chaotic response by the federal government. But it is extremely unlikely that the number of cases in China has essentially flatlined for the past five weeks.
That is, the U.S. is “No. 1” only if you believe the numbers reported by China, which you should not. Pandemic trackers work with the data provided, and the data provided by Beijing is unbelievable. Chinese officials claim new coronavirus cases have increased by only 1,782 since late February. There is simply no way that this is true, especially considering China itself reported new cases jumped from 920 to 80,000 between Jan. 23 and Feb. 29.
The trajectory is also not consistent with other countries that have seen a leveling off of cases. The deceleration in South Korea, for instance, has been much more gradual.
But the obvious red flags regarding China’s reported data did not slow American newsrooms from declaring the U.S. the leader in reported coronavirus cases without caveats.
This is not the only example of western news media hailing China’s allegedly successful campaign to stem the spread of the coronavirus.
Earlier, even before the U.S. had even supposedly passed the case number milestone, the New York Times published a report on March 18 titled “Its Coronavirus Cases Dwindling, China Turns Focus Outward.”
The article, the chief claim of which has been repeated elsewhere by the New York Times, Bloomberg, and NBC News, goes to great lengths to cast China as a thoughtful, meticulous, proactive, and responsible world leader, one whose contributions to fighting the pandemic have made it a more reliable and responsible superpower compared to the U.S. The New York Times article repeats the Chinese Communist Party’s claim that China’s daily coronavirus cases have dwindled “into the single digits.”
No attempt is made to verify these numbers.
Earlier than even this New York Times report, Chuck Todd, host of NBC News’s Meet the Press, on March 8 hailed China’s supposed success in tackling the virus, asking whether the Chinese Communist Party’s style of despotic governance deserves all the credit.
“How uncomfortable is it,” Todd asked, echoing the sentiments of others in Western media, “that perhaps China’s authoritarian ways did prevent this? Meaning, had China been a free and open society, this might have spread faster?”
The U.S. intelligence community determined last week that China has underreported both the total number of coronavirus cases and deaths, all of it in an attempt to conceal the full extent of the pandemic in its country.
Early on, China silenced doctors who raised alarms about the virus, denied access to foreign scientists who could have studied the virus, and falsely claimed that there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission.
NBC breathlessly reported, "As U.S. struggles to stem coronavirus, China asserts itself as global leader" on efforts by China to provide help to other countries. But the reality is that China has delivered faulty equipment around the world. In the Netherlands, the health ministry recalled 600,000 Chinese manufactured face masks despite their desperate need for medical equipment after their filters did not work properly, and they did not fit. Spain purchased hundreds of thousands of tests from China, only to learn that at least 60,000 did not work.
The American press’s readiness to treat reports out of Beijing with little, if any, skepticism comes as actual Chinese Communist propaganda videos cite members of the free press in conjunction with its broader, hyperaggressive effort to avoid blame for creating the coronavirus pandemic.
Whether they know it or not, the journalists who claim it is problematic to refer to the virus by its country and city of origin, and the ones who claim China has the pandemic mostly under control, and who praise China's efforts to help other countries are doing the bidding of the Chinese Communist Party, which is eager both to present itself as the world’s leading superpower and scrub from the record its culpability in the spread of the virus.

China said Tuesday the number of infections from a new virus surpassed 20,000 as medical workers and patients arrived at a new hospital and President Xi Jinping said "we have launched a people's war of prevention of the epidemic."

Charles M. Blow: Social distancing is a privilege

Texto completo: People like to say that the coronavirus is no respecter of race, class or country, that the disease COVID-19 is mindless and will infect anybody it can.
In theory, that is true. But, in practice, in the real world, this virus behaves like others, screeching like a heat-seeking missile toward the most vulnerable in society. And this happens not because it prefers them, but because they are more exposed, more fragile and more ill.
What the vulnerable portion of society looks like varies from country to country, but in America, that vulnerability is highly intersected with race and poverty.
Early evidence from cities and states already shows that black people are disproportionately affected by the virus in devastating ways. As ProPublica reported, in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, as of Friday morning, 81% of the deaths were black people. Black people make up only 26% of that county.
[Read complete coronavirus coverage here .]
As for Chicago, WBEZ reported Sunday that “70% of COVID-19 deaths are black,” and pointed out about surrounding Cook County, “While black residents make up only 23% of the population in the county, they account for 58% of the COVID-19 deaths.”
The Detroit News reported last week, “At least 40% of those killed by the novel coronavirus in Michigan so far are black, a percentage that far exceeds the proportion of African Americans in the Detroit region and state.”
If this pattern holds true across other states and cities, this virus could have a catastrophic impact on black people in this country.
And yet, we are still not seeing an abundance of news coverage or national governmental response that center on these racial disparities. Many states haven’t even released race-specific data on cases and deaths. The federal government hasn’t either.
Partly for this reason, we are left with deceptive and deadly misinformation. The perception that this is a jet-setters’ disease, or a spring breakers’ disease, or a “Chinese virus” as President Donald Trump likes to say, must be laid to rest. The idea that this virus is an equal-opportunity killer must itself be killed.
And, we must dispense with the callous message that the best defense we have against the disease is something that each of us can control: We can all just stay home and keep social distance.
As a report last month by the Economic Policy Institute pointed out, “less than one in five black workers and roughly one in six Hispanic workers are able to work from home.”
As the report pointed out, “Only 9.2 percent of workers in the lowest quartile of the wage distribution can telework, compared with 61.5 percent of workers in the highest quartile.”
If you touch people for a living, in elder care or child care, if you cut or fix their hair, if you clean their spaces or cook their food, if you drive their cars or build their houses, you can’t do that from home.
Staying at home is a privilege. Social distancing is a privilege.
The people who can’t must make terrible choices: Stay home and risk starvation or go to work and risk contagion.
And, this isn’t just happening here, it is happening with poor people around the world, from New Delhi to Mexico City.
If they go to work, they must often use crowded mass transportation, because low-wage workers can’t necessarily afford to own a car or call a cab.
Such is the life of the working poor, or those slightly above poverty, but still struggling. Our entire discussion around this virus is stained with economic elitism. In social media commentary about images of packed buses and crowds of delivery workers outside restaurants, people chastise black and brown people for not always being inside, but many of those doing the chastising do so from comfortable homes with sufficient money and food.
People can’t empathize with what it truly means to be poor in this country, to live in a too-small space with too many people, to not have enough money to buy food for a long duration or anywhere to store it if they did. People don’t know what it’s like to live in a food desert where fresh fruit and vegetables are unavailable and nutrient-deficient junk food is cheap and exists in abundance.
People are quick to criticize these people for crowding into local fast food restaurants to grab something to eat. Not everyone can afford to order GrubHub or FreshDirect.
Furthermore, in a nation where too many black people have been made to feel that their lives are constantly under threat, the existence of yet another produces less of a panic. The ability to panic becomes a privilege existing among those who rarely have to do it.
I wholeheartedly encourage everyone who can to stay home, but I’m also aware enough to know that not everyone can or will, and that it is not simply a pathological disregard for the common good.
If you are sheltering in place in an ivory tower, or even a comfortable cul-de-sac or a smartly well-appointed apartment, and your greatest concern is boredom and leftover food, please stop scolding those scratching to survive.

Texto completo: Patricia Bosworth
LOS ANGELES - Patricia Bosworth, an actress who once starred alongside Audrey Hepburn and later wrote biographies on several stars including Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift, has died due to the coronavirus. She was 86.
Bosworth's stepdaughter, Fia Hatsav, told The New York Times that pneumonia brought on by the virus was the cause of death. Bosworth died on Thursday in New York.
The Associated Press
Bosworth played a nun opposite of Hepburn in the 1959 classic "The Nun's Story." Along with penning bios for Brando and Clift, she also wrote biographies on actress Jane Fonda and famed photographer Diane Arbus, who photographed Bosworth in a Greyhound bus advertisement.
Her biography on Arbus served as the base for the 2006 film "Fur: An Imaginary Portrait of Diane Arbus," which starred Nicole Kidman.
Under the tutelage of Lee Strasberg, Bosworth studied acting at the Actors Studio alongside Marilyn Monroe, Paul Newman, Steve McQueen and Fonda. Bosworth worked on Broadway and starred in television shows including "Naked City" and "The Patty Duke."
Bosworth turned her attention from acting to focus on a career in journalism as a successful editor and writer. She wrote for The New York Times and New York magazine, and was an editor for several publications including Screen Stars, McCall's and contributed to Vanity Fair.
She wrote memoirs about her own life in 1998's "Anything Your Little Heart Desires: An American Family Story" and 2017's "The Men in My Life: A Memoir of Love and Art in 1950s Manhattan."

Texto completo: What is happening with the Tampa Bay Times?

The Tampa Bay Times is temporarily reducing print frequency to twice a week. Starting today, readers will receive the Times on Sundays and Wednesdays. The first day readers who subscribe to the daily print newspaper will experience a change will be Monday.

Why is the Times changing its print frequency?

Like most newspapers, the bulk of our revenue comes from print advertisements. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, retailers and event-related customers have been forced to close their doors to slow the spread of the virus. Many of them have canceled their advertisements. Under these circumstances, the Times cannot afford to print and deliver the paper every day.

How long will this change last?

This is a temporary measure to help our company navigate this unprecedented crisis. As we are able, we look forward to re-introducing print days.

How am I supposed to get the latest news?

Our journalists are publishing stories on tampabay.com, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Subscribers have unlimited access to all content on tampabay.com and our mobile apps. Readers can access the e-Newspaper, an exact digital replica of a print newspaper available seven days a week.

How do I get to the e-Newspaper?

Visit tampabaytimes.com. If youre a subscriber and have not yet activated your account, please go to myaccount.tampabay.com to enjoy the e-Newspaper. If youve activated your account but have not logged in, go ahead and log in now. You also can access the e-Newspaper from our Tampa Bay Times mobile app, available in the Google Play or to Apples app store.

I dont think this is fair. I signed up for a newspaper every day.

We understand, but the coronavirus is forcing a lot of changes. We still are providing our journalism to you every day. Weve simply changed our method of delivery, not the quality product we bring to you. In fact, we are expanding the e-Newspaper to include more features.

You can support local journalism by reading tampabay.com and sharing our free coronavirus coverage with others.

If you still want to discuss your account, email us at custserv@tampabay.com. Our Customer Service representatives will be in touch. You may call 800-888-7012, but please be patient. We expect call volumes to be high as readers adapt to this change.

Shouldnt I get a discount on my subscription?

We are not adjusting prices. Our subscribers will continue to receive our e-Newspaper and our online journalism seven days a week. If you do not have access already, go to myaccount.tampabay.com and activate your subscription.

Will the Times still sell the paper on newspaper racks and at retailers?

Readers can find the Times in stores and in newspaper racks on Wednesday and Sundays, the days we print the newspaper. On other days, we invite readers to view the e-Newspaper, which is a daily digital version of a printed Tampa Bay Times.

The Times provides home delivery for various publication such as the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. Will those deliveries continue?

Our carrier force will work on Wednesdays and Sundays. The Times will deliver the New York Post and the New York Times on those days. Investors Business Daily and the Business Observer also will be delivered on Sundays. Readers can expect TV Weekly deliveries on Wednesdays. For information about publications not listed here, or to learn about how you can receive a publication on days we will not deliver, please contact the publication directly.

Texto completo: I get my news from the news. Tainted as little as possible. I try to read as many sources as I can. Like the Wall Street Journal. Washington Post. New York Times. USA Today. Chicago Tribune. Time Magazine. Newsweek. And yes. The Public Opinion. Record Herald. Herald Mail. I am a paid subscriber to many of these. I trade off on which television and online news sources that I watch. FOX. CNN. NBC. CBS. ABC. Yahoo! News. Google News. I even read the conservative Washington Examiner and the liberal Huffington Post. They both offer alternative viewpoints from widely different perspectives.
After 45 years of writing, nationally and internationally, in more than 150 publications plus hundreds of columns in the Public Opinion, after all this time, my wife tells me I should no longer voice my opinion. Particularly regarding the state of politics today.
She believes too many people have somehow forgotten the foundation of our nation. Respect for those different than themselves. For those with a different set of understandings. She is afraid.
I rarely question my wife's judgement. She is right more than not. And again in this case she is right. I have received emailed threats. Online words and memes that go beyond common decency. Ugliness that is unspeakable. Crude, raw, unthinking posts on my Facebook page that to shield from my grandchildren, I have had to delete and block the poster.
Yet, I have trudged on. I have attempted to be that voice in the wilderness.
The one that says be respectful, caring, empathetic.
Rise up above name calling and loathing of others.
Do not spit on people with different heritages.
Do not mistreat the downtrodden.
Do not separate children from their families.
Perhaps I should listen to my wife. It would be easier. Yet I retain my faith. In the people. In my readers.
I pray empathy will prevail over hatred. Blame fixing will become a thing of the past. Bullying of those unlike ourselves will just stop.
I look for the truth. I couldn't care less what commentators tell me on television or radio. Their opinions are just that. Their opinions.
I get my news from the news. Tainted as little as possible. I try to read as many sources as I can. Like the Wall Street Journal. Washington Post. New York Times. USA Today. Chicago Tribune. Time Magazine. Newsweek. And yes. The Public Opinion. Record Herald. Herald Mail. I am a paid subscriber to many of these.
I trade off on which television and online news sources that I watch. FOX. CNN. NBC. CBS. ABC. Yahoo! News. Google News.
I even read the conservative Washington Examiner and the liberal Huffington Post. They both offer alternative viewpoints from widely different perspectives.
And I follow three rules.
(1) Traditional news outlets are not fake news.
(2) News is never fake.
(3) Opinion is never news.
I do not trust information posted on Facebook and other social media. That, too, is opinion. And opinion is not news.
I have discovered that people who want to sell ideas interpret news as they see fit. A well-known example: Fox Opinion. Which is not Fox News. Same channel. Different departments.
Shepard Smith was the chief news anchor and managing editor of Fox breaking news. From 1996 until 2019. 23 years. Well respected. Stellar reporting. Award winning. When Smith left, Bill Hemmer took the Fox news role.
On the other hand. Fox & Friends. Sean Hannity. Tucker Carlson. Laura Ingraham. Jeanine Pirro. They may be popular and entertaining. But not news. All opinions. And all report to Rupert Murdoch.
Rupert Murdoch is a billionaire. Owns Fox. Faced allegations his companies hacked phones of public citizens. Faced criminal investigations by FBI and others for bribery and corruption. After Fox CEO Roger Ailes resigned due to accusations of sexual harassment, Murdoch named himself acting CEO of Fox. Runs Fox opinion.
That's why I try to insulate myself from opinion, Murdoch's or anyone else's. I try to concentrate on the news. What really happened. That way I can make good decisions.
So when I talk about politics. I talk about what was done or not done. Not what someone thinks of what was done.
News is corroborated by numerous well-respected news organizations. Not opinions.
I have discovered something in today's electronic age which makes gathering news much easier and faster. It helps me determine when people know what they are talking about. Or when they are blowing smoke. Or when they are being fed lies or manipulated by talking heads with a false agenda.
I use news assimilators. These online engines gather the news and present it to me in headlines. Easy to read summaries. And the full news article should I decide to dig deeper. My favorites are Yahoo! News. Google. Flipboard. SmartNews.
They are all free.
Flipboard is available as a free app on your smartphone. Flipboard is also available as a program for your computer at flipboard.com. You can choose a number of categories to suit your interests. I choose news. Yes, there are some hardcore right news sources. And some hardcore left news sources. But for the most part nearly all the well respected news sources are available on Flipboard. You can read as much as you wish. Then decide for yourself what is news. Not opinion.
SmartNews is available as a free app on your smartphone. SmartNews is also available as a program for your computer. SmartNews advertises itself as "the fastest, most efficient way to get all your news now. Your news in one minute." On SmartNews you choose your news sources from a list. I have chosen both mainstream and well respected sources plus a few additional for balance.
Being well read and up-to-date with what is real allows us to talk and debate using facts. Again. Not someone else's opinion.
I will keep writing. For now. Because I believe. Like my old friend U.S. Senator Bob Dole, the former U.S. Senate majority leader. Our way of life requires a "commitment to honesty, decency, and personal responsibility."

Texto completo: Sign up here to get our daily updates on coronavirus in Minnesota delivered straight to your inbox each afternoon. And go here to see all of MinnPost’s COVID-19 coverage.
For the foreseeable future, MinnPost will be providing daily updates on coronavirus in Minnesota, published following the press phone call conducted by the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) with Gov. Tim Walz and administration officials each afternoon. There was no MDH call on Sunday, April 5, so here’s a quick look at the latest numbers.
Here are the latest updates from April 5, 2020:
* 935 confirmed cases; 29 deaths
* Walz to give State of the State on YouTube
935 confirmed cases; 29 deaths
Twenty-nine Minnesotans have died of COVID-19, after the Minnesota Department of Health announced five additional deaths Sunday, including:
* An 87-year old Olmsted County resident
* A 90-year-old Washington County resident
* An 83-year-old Dakota County resident
* An 88-year-old Hennepin County resident
* A 67-year-old Hennepin County resident
There have been 935 total confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Minnesota, with an additional 70 announced since Saturday. Because Minnesota doesn’t have the capacity to test everybody with symptoms, the number of people with the virus in the state is assumed to be significantly higher.
The number of Minnesotans currently in the hospital is 106, up 11 from Saturday. Forty-eight are in intensive care, up six from Saturday. There are 451 Minnesotans who previously tested positive for COVID-19 who no longer need to be isolated, which means they are considered to have recovered.
The median age of people who have died from COVID-19 is 86; the median age of those who have been hospitalized is 63.
More information on cases can be found here.
On Saturday, MDH began releasing names of long-term care facilities with outbreaks (defined as one or more cases in a resident or staff member), provided the facilities have 10 or more residents. That list can be found at the link above.
State of the YouTube
Gov. Tim Walz will deliver his second State of the State address Sunday evening via YouTube from his Summit Avenue abode. We’re guessing coronavirus will come up.
Here’s the link. Starts at 7 p.m.
Today on MinnPost
* Asking yourself how long it’s been since this all started? Us too.
* As always, a look at the numbers on the MinnPost COVID-19 dashboard.
Around the web
* The Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota are both working on antibody tests, which would tell if somebody had previously had COVID-19. Mayo’s is expected to be available Monday, MPR reports.
* The person behind the number: Remembering one of COVID-19’s first Minnesota victims, from the Pioneer Press.
* A South African couple are the only guests left at a fancy resort, stranded on their honeymoon in the Maldives due to COVID-19 shutdowns, via the New York Times.
* Candyland was created for polio wards, and a closer read on the game shows it’s full of symbolism, the Atlantic.
* The Queen’s speech: Queen Elizabeth recorded her fourth-ever special address directly to the people of Britain, on the subject of COVID-19. “It carries a distinct echo of the celebrated radio address her father, George VI, delivered in September 1939, as Britain stood on the brink of war with Germany,” the New York Times reports.

Nicholas Kristof: What’s next in the war on COVID-19?

Texto completo: In the world war against the coronavirus, there’s both very good news and very bad news.
To understand what lies ahead, epidemiologists study the places battered first. Here are lessons from the front lines:
First, we have a toolbox that works. Even for countries that bungled the initial response, like Italy and the United States, there’s hope: Social distancing succeeds in slowing the contagion, and it does so quickly — within a few weeks of the adoption of tough measures.
Both Italy and Iran appear to have passed through the worst of this wave of COVID-19, as measured by new cases. But even after new cases slow, deaths continue at a high rate because people often die four weeks after they were infected.
In the United States, two of the first places to suffer outbreaks were the Seattle area and New Rochelle (a suburb of New York). There were firm responses for both, with New Rochelle subject to a controversial containment zone and Washington state working with large companies to get people to work from home.
This was effective. New Rochelle is no longer a hot spot, and Washington also flattened its curve, with coronavirus hospitalizations dropping.
For the United States as a whole, confirmed infections are still increasing rapidly, but one hopeful sign is that Kinsa Health Internet-linked thermometers show a downward trend in fevers across most of the country (these are for all kinds of fevers, not just those from COVID-19, and some people with infections are asymptomatic).
On balance, all this is excellent news. Early on, epidemiologists simply didn’t know how well social distancing would work. Now it’s clearer: We have the tools to save lives, if we will use them.
Second, countless thousands will still die because of past mistakes and complacency.
A pandemic is like an oil tanker: It continues to move forward long after you hit the brakes. In China, deaths didn’t fall sharply until a month after controls had been imposed. The benefits from social distancing in the United States will take time to ripple through the system, and there will continue to be new infections — and many more deaths.
The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington has a constantly updated model that predicts that the daily death toll across the United States will rise until April 16 and then slowly decline. By the beginning of August, it estimates that more than 93,000 Americans will have died from COVID-19.
(I interrupt this bleakness for a dose of uplift: In Oregon, a 103-year-old, William Lapschies, caught the coronavirus in early March but recovered in time to celebrate his 104th birthday with pizza and chocolate cake on Wednesday. Happy 104th, Mr. Lapschies!)
More bad news: Case fatality rates have been creeping up, and lethality may be greater than many had expected. Germany was hailed for a death rate of only about 0.5%, and South Korea was not much higher; now both have case fatality rates well above 1%.
In models of the virus that my colleague Stuart A. Thompson and I published, we used a death rate of 1%. But if the South Korean death rate by age is applied to the demography of the United States, the American case fatality rate is about 2%, according to Dr. Christopher Murray, director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.
A great majority of the deaths in the United States will have been avoidable. South Korea and the United States had their first coronavirus cases on the same day, but Seoul did a far better job managing the response. The upshot: It has suffered only 174 coronavirus deaths, equivalent to 1,100 for a population the size of America’s.
That suggests that we may lose 90,000 Americans in this wave of infections because the United States did not manage the crisis as well as South Korea did. As of Friday evening, the U.S. had already had more than 7,000 deaths.
Third, while we can bend the curve, it will bend back when we relax our social distancing.
This is more bad news, for many people seem to believe that once we get through this grim month or two, the nightmare will be over. But the virus is resilient, and health experts warn that this may be just the first wave of what may be many waves of infections until we get a vaccine sometime in 2021.
Already, Japan after initial success is seeing a surge of infections, while China and South Korea have struggled with imported infections; that seems inevitable as economies restart and travel resumes.
“There’s this biological fact that still in South Korea, the people who haven’t been infected aren’t immune, and as soon as there’s an end to social distancing they’ll be vulnerable again,” noted Dr. Mark Poznansky of Harvard Medical School.
The same is true in the United States.
“We’re just looking at this first wave,” noted Murray. He estimates that in June, some 95% of Americans will still be susceptible to the virus.
“The world’s on fire with this virus,” said Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, and this means that even if one country succeeds in putting out the blaze, sparks will keep arriving from elsewhere to cause new outbreaks. He added: “I think the transmission will continue to occur for some time.”

Ross Douthat: The road to semi-normal in an age of the coronavirus

Texto completo: There will be three stages to the coronavirus era. The stage we’re in now is the period of emergency, when stores are shuttered, church services suspended, even playgrounds closed. The stage we aspire to reach, the stage with reliable treatments and ready vaccination, is the period of normalcy — or the period when we get to discover what normal after the coronavirus means.
But in between is the phase we may inhabit into 2021: The time of semi-normalcy, when strictures are partially lifted, the economy partially reopened, social and cultural life partially resumed. And since it’s the goal of all our efforts now, it’s worth offering some speculation about what that “semi” will entail.
Balkanized normality . In their “Road Map to Reopening,” Scott Gottlieb of the American Enterprise Institute and his co-authors offer several criteria for making the shift out of emergency: A “sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days,” a hospital system capable of treating coronavirus cases “without resorting to crisis standards of care,” and the capacity to test and monitor every suspected viral case.
They imagine this shift happening state by state, though you could also imagine it happening city by city. Either way there will be an inevitable patchwork, reflecting differences in both spread and containment. San Francisco may be semi-normal, while things are getting worse in Texas. Places with a terrible infection spike may reopen before places that have a gentler infection curve. Rural states will enjoy a much more normal semi-normalcy than Brooklynites or Chicagoans. There will be “red zones” and “green zones” all across the country, with wide differences in daily life, and much less travel than usual from one region to another.
Alongside this geographical patchwork will be other balkanizations. The emerging coronavirus class divide, with a working class risking their health in the real world and white-collar workers retreating into Zoomspace, will diminish if offices and schools reopen, but it will hardly disappear. The experiences of the young and old will diverge, with over-70 Americans inhabiting a more enduring quarantine. And the minority of Americans who have survived the virus will become a special class, returning more easily to old routines than a majority still afraid of getting sick.
Life at half-capacity . Right now our institutions must survive while essentially closed — with few or no customers, moviegoers, travelers. But soon they will have to figure out how to reopen while maintaining the social distancing that semi-normalcy requires.
Widespread masking may help, if shoppers and commuters wear their masks religiously. But there will still be the challenge of operating persistently at half-capacity — because fewer people will come out, and because there will be rules governing how many people can come in.
Thus the scenes at some grocery stores right now, the line of people six feet apart waiting to come inside and shop, may become a permanent feature of the semi-normal landscape. Churches will hold services with every other pew occupied. Restaurants will seat every other table. Planes could fly without a single middle seat occupied. Sports may resume without spectators, relying on TV revenue alone.
And since the flow of money and custom and attendance won’t come close to what existed just a month ago, any government response will have to be calibrated to a half-capacity world — where institutions are technically open for business, but they still need help to stay alive.
New ways to quarantine . Right now, if you think you have coronavirus you’re just instructed to quarantine at home while you wait (and wait ...) for the test results to come through. But the virus seems to spread rapidly through families, not everyone can take care of themselves without leaving the house, and we don’t have a good way of knowing when someone ceases to be contagious — so there are lots of ways a self-quarantine can fail.
Under the faster testing regime of semi-normalcy, there may be other quarantine options. Just as hospitals can use beds in empty hotels to handle surges, cities may invite the asymptomatic and mildly sick into “COVID hotels,” where they can be monitored for worsening symptoms and tested for antibodies, provided with food and internet and toilet paper, and even allowed to socialize with their fellow milder cases.
The Chinese version of this collective-quarantine system was harshly enforced; any American system would be more voluntary and haphazard. But it seems like a plausible addition to the “test and trace” approach urged by many epidemiologists: It doesn’t help to track down cases if you don’t remove a larger share of them from circulation, and you won’t remove that larger share unless some of the sick have a place to go besides their home.
At the very least, we should expect that some experiment as strange as a COVID hotel will emerge as a feature of semi-normalcy. Because that’s what the “semi” means: A twilight zone, a curious limbo, in which things that seemed impossibly weird will be accepted, even welcomed, as the price of not being in an emergency anymore.

Texto completo: Washington • A few years ago, when some photos by New York Times photographers adorning our office walls were swapped out for others, I found one headed for the dumpster.
It captured the scene when Andy Card came over to whisper to George W. Bush, as he read “The Pet Goat” to schoolchildren in Sarasota, Florida, that a second plane had crashed into the World Trade Center.
It was such a pivotal moment in this country’s history, it seemed too important to toss. So I hung it in my office.
But then three days later, I had to get rid of it. The look in Bush’s eyes was so disturbing, I couldn’t bear to see it anymore.
He looked frightened, like a horrible bill had come due and he was utterly unprepared to pay it. He looked like what he was: a man who had been winging it for the first half of his life, playing and swaggering around while he relied on his daddy and daddy’s friends to prop him up.
W. was shaken to the core, and that left him vulnerable to being influenced by the older advisers around him with their own crazy agendas. America is still paying for the dreadful decisions that came after that moment. The same blend of arrogance and incompetence informed the Bush administration’s handling of Katrina — the earlier lash of nature that exposed the lethal fault line between the haves and have-nots. W. retreated to clinical states’ rights arguments as a beloved city drowned.
Now we have another pampered scion in the Oval, propped up by his daddy for half his life, accustomed to winging it and swaggering around. And he, too, is utterly unprepared to lead us through the storm. Like W., he is resorting to clinical states’ rights arguments, leaving the states to chaotically compete with one another and the federal government for precious medical equipment.
Donald Trump is trying to build a campaign message around his image as a wartime president. But as a commander-in-chief, Cadet Bone Spurs is bringing up the rear.
“I would leave it up to the governors,” Trump said Friday, when asked about his government’s sclerotic response. Trouble is, when you leave it to the governors, you have scenes like we did in Florida with the open beaches — not to mention a swath in the middle of the country that, as of Friday night, still had not ordered residents to stay home.
The Los Angeles Times reported that two months before the virus spread through Wuhan, the Trump administration halted a $200 million early-warning program to train scientists in China and elsewhere to deal with a pandemic. The name of the program? “PREDICT.”
It is said that nature abhors a vacuum, but this virus loves it.
At Thursday’s briefing, Rear Adm. John Polowczyk, who barely two weeks ago became the head of the administration’s supply-chain task force, added to the confusion when he defended the government’s decision to send the supplies governors are pleading for to the private sector first.
“I’m not here to disrupt a supply chain,” the admiral said.
Trump was elected to disrupt things. So disrupt.
The president seems oblivious to the fact that his own clown car of an administration bungled the priceless lead time we had to get ready for the pandemic.
With the death toll in this country soaring past 7,000, Trump is focused on the same thing he is always focused on: himself. He proudly told reporters Wednesday, “Did you know I was No. 1 on Facebook? I just found out I was No. 1 on Facebook. I thought that was very nice for whatever it means.” Our doom, perhaps?
Trump’s most defining qualities have been on display in this fight: He has been mercurial, vindictive, deceptive, narcissistic, blame-shifting and nepotistic.
At the Thursday briefing, the president brought out another wealthy, uninformed man-child who loves to play boss: Jared Kushner. Where’s our Mideast peace deal, dude? Surely Trump did not think giving Kushner a lead role would inspire confidence. This is the very same adviser who told his father-in-law early on that the virus was being overplayed by the press and also urged him to tout a Google website guiding people to testing sites that turned out to be, um, still under construction.
Now he is leading a group, mocked within the government as “the Slim Suit crowd,” that is providing one more layer of confusion — and inane consultant argot — to the laggardly, disorganized response.
From the lectern, Kushner drilled down on his role as the annoying, spoiled kid in every teen movie ever made. “And the notion of the federal stockpile was, it’s supposed to be our stockpile,” he said. “It’s not supposed to be the states’ stockpiles that they then use.”
Our stockpile?
That’s the way the Trump-Kushner dynasty has approached this whole presidency, conflating what belongs to the people with what is theirs. Trump acts like he has the right to dole out “favors,” based on which governor is most assiduous about kissing up to him.
On Friday, the administration changed the wording on the Department of Health and Human Services website about the stockpile to be matchy-matchy with Kushner’s cavalier dismissal of the states.
It was typical of Trump’s muddled message that on Friday, as the CDC issued new guidelines to wear masks, the president said: “You can wear ’em. You don’t have to wear ’em,” adding he had no intention of wearing one because “Somehow, sitting in the Oval Office behind that beautiful Resolute desk, the great Resolute desk, I think wearing a face mask” did not gel with his image of greeting “prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens, I don’t know somehow, I don’t see it for myself.”
Trump’s eyes may not have the same fearful look that W.’s did. But ours do.

Texto completo: Brett Crozier, the Navy captain who sounded the alarm of a coronavirus outbreak aboard an aircraft carrier he led, has tested positive for covid-19, the New York Times reported.
Crozier began showing symptoms of coronavirus before he was removed from the USS Theodore Roosevelt last Thursday, the paper reported, citing two Naval Academy classmates.
ABC
A Navy spokesman declined to comment to the Times on Crozier's status.
Crozier, was relieved from his command on Thursday after he wrote a letter that the Navy needed to get more sailors off the carrier swiftly to protect their health amid an outbreak spreading aboard the ship.
"We are not at war. Sailors do not need to die," he wrote.

Cal Thomas: To survive, media should acknowledge and correct bias

Texto completo: I confess to a certain self-interest in today’s column. The media, especially newspapers, are in trouble. Conservatives like myself have been relentless in attacking their collective bias over the years, but as more of them fold or reduce staff, it is crucial the institution be saved.
Margaret Sullivan, a columnist for The Washington Post, has suggested that federal bailout money should be allocated to newspapers. That is an amusing suggestion since the world’s richest man, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, owns the Post. He could infuse some of his own money to prop up that reliably liberal paper.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2656862" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Cal-Thomas-Color-300x190.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="190" />
In an age when fewer schoolchildren are taught civics, it is useful to recall that the press is the only profession mentioned in the Constitution’s First Amendment, which specifically forbids Congress from “abridging” freedom of the press.
The Founders were aware of newspapers’ tendency to print inaccurate, even outrageous, stories, but as Benjamin Franklin noted: “I am … for freedom of the press, and against all violations of the constitution to silence by force and not by reason the complaints or criticisms, just or unjust, of our citizens against the conduct of their agents.”
Newspapers then — and one could argue since, along with modern television — have been full of factual errors, innuendo and slanted coverage (check out the corrections section of The New York Times over the years, and those are only the mistakes they admit to), but no country has a freer press than the United States. Notice that the first entities totalitarians seek to shut down or take over are newspapers and television stations, which ought to tell us something.
In a lengthy Vanity Fair article titled “Can the News Industry Survive Coronavirus,” Charlotte Klein, quotes New York Times media columnist Ben Smith, who advocates “a painful but necessary shift” for saving the news business.
Smith writes, “Abandon most for-profit local newspapers whose business model no longer works, and move as fast as possible to a national network of nimble new online newsrooms.”
Facebook has pledged $100 million to help struggling news outlets weather the financial storm caused in part by advertisers not buying ads because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Financial subsidies are only a partial solution, like quitting smoking but refusing treatment when diagnosed with lung cancer. The real problem for the major media is the perception that their reporters are biased. It doesn’t matter how many times they deny their biases or the frequency with which it’s pointed out to them, especially by conservative organizations. The point is that as in any business if customers aren’t buying your product, denying the reason why only prolongs your company’s downfall.
A 2018 Columbia Journalism Review story reported on a Knight Foundation-Gallup Poll: “A majority of those who were surveyed said they had lost trust in the media in recent years, and more than 30 percent of those who identified themselves as being on the conservative end of the spectrum said they had not only lost faith in the media, but they ‘expect that change to be permanent.’ According to a separate Gallup poll from earlier this year that tracked trust in major institutions, newspapers and television news were among the lowest, exceeded only by Congress.”
Among the solutions would be for the major media to address the perceived bias by including more conservatives and serious religious people on their staffs as part of “diversity” campaigns. No industry that ignores the concerns of large numbers of the public can long endure. It is vital to a free society, as the Founders believed, that a vibrant, free and, yes, responsible press endure, but the media can only save itself. That salvation will come, if it comes at all, not through financial aid alone, or even mainly, but by media owners coming to their senses and honestly addressing the concerns of people who no longer believe their message.

Navy aircraft carrier Capt. Brett Crozier tests positive for coronavirus

Texto completo: Brett Crozier, the Santa Rosa- reared Navy captain relieved of his command last week after he sent a widely distributed plea to protect his crew from COVID-19, has tested positive for the disease and is in quarantine.
Crozier, who lost one of the Navy’s most prestigious jobs as skipper of one of its 11 aircraft carriers, found himself at the center of a national debate this weekend over his decision to request a speedy evacuation of his crew as the coronavirus began to spread through the ship.
On Sunday, his family confirmed that Crozier himself is among more than 150 reported crew members from the nuclear- powered aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt who’ve tested positive for the viral infection behind the global pandemic.
“He has told us he is OK,” said his mother, Gina Crozier, a Santa Rosa child and family counselor.
The 50-year-old captain began exhibiting symptoms before he was removed from the warship on Thursday at a U.S. naval base on Guam, the New York Times reported.
Crozier was cheered by his crew as he departed the ship, with videos posted to social media showing sailors hailing the departing captain as he walked down the gangplank. Many chanted, “Captain Crozier! Captain Crozier!”
Thomas Modly, acting secretary of the Navy, has said he lost confidence in Crozier’s ability to command the ship after the captain sent a letter on an unclassified email system to 20 to 30 people. Modly said Crozier rightly wrote to superiors with his concerns about the spread of coronavirus among his crew of nearly 5,000, but that Crozier erred by sharing copies of the four-page memo outside the chain of command.
“In sending it out pretty broadly, he did not take care to ensure that it couldn’t be leaked,” Modly told reporters. “And that’s part of his responsibility.”
The nearly 1,100-foot-long Nimitz-class carrier is docked at the mouth of Apra Harbor on Guam, a Pacific U.S. island territory. Secretary of Defense Mark T. Esper said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” that there were 155 confirmed cases of COVID-19 among sailors aboard the aircraft carrier, and that more than half of the ship had been tested. So far there have been no hospitalizations.
In Crozier’s extraordinary letter, reported first by the San Francisco Chronicle, Crozier wrote that the virus was spreading aboard and pleaded for “decisive action” to remove and isolate more than 4,000 sailors.
“We are not at war,” Crozier wrote. “Sailors do not need to die. If we do not act now, we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset — our sailors.”
Navy officials later announced they would offload 2,700 sailors in the coming days. On Guam, about 1,000 crew members have been evacuated from the aircraft carrier. Some have been moved to a makeshift gym, others to hotel rooms.
Crozier has not spoken publicly about the letter or his dismissal as the ship’s commander.
Esper on Sunday defended the firing but declined to explicitly say he agreed with Modly’s assessment, noting that there is “an investigation ongoing.”
In two television interviews, Esper said Modly made a “very tough decision” to oust Crozier. “It was based on his view that he had lost faith and confidence in the captain, based on his actions. It was supported by Navy leadership,” Esper said.
Foreign Policy magazine reported Friday that a source said Navy officials felt blindsided by Crozier’s widely quoted letter because the captain had been assured during two phone calls earlier in the week that his crew would be cared for.
“Crozier was given Modly’s personal cellphone number to raise further concerns, the source added, but there was no contact between the captain and Navy brass between that time and when Crozier’s letter was sent by email to higher-ups and some crew,” Foreign Policy reported.
Modly told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on Friday, “I think sort of most disappointing to me is that I had set up a direct line to him that if he felt that any- thing, way before his letter was written, that if he felt anything wasn’t going well and he needed help, that he could reach out to me directly. And he did not do that.”
Across the country, lawmakers and citizens have demanded Crozier’s reinstatement as skipper of the Theodore Roosevelt. Leading Democrats on the House Armed Services Committee condemned the stripping of his command.
They wrote, “While Captain Crozier clearly went outside the chain of command, his dismissal at this critical moment — as the Sailors aboard the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt are confronted with the COVID-19 pandemic — is a destabilizing move that will likely put our service members at greater risk and jeopardize our fleet’s readiness.”
The most successful of several online change.org petitions seeking his return as skipper had collected well more than 240,000 signatures by Sunday evening.
President Donald Trump weighed in on Saturday, defending the removal of Crozier as skipper of the Theodore Roosevelt.
Trump said he did not make the decision to fire Crozier, but he disagreed with Crozier’s actions and suggested the captain was at fault for the coronavirus infections on board the aircraft carrier for docking the ship in Vietnam.
“I thought it was terrible what he did, to write a letter. This isn’t a class on literature. This is a captain of a massive ship that’s nuclear-powered,” Trump said Saturday.
Both Democratic presidential hopefuls Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders praised Crozier’s actions in defense of his crew.
On Sunday, Biden called the Trump administration’s handling of the case as “close to criminal” and said Crozier “stood up and said what had to be said.”
“I think he should have a commendation rather than be fired,” Biden said.
Sanders, a senator from Vermont, wrote on Twitter, “The Navy appears to be retaliating against him for acting out of concern for his sailors’ health. His position should be restored immediately.”
Tweed Roosevelt, the great grandson of former President Theodore Roosevelt, called Crozier a “hero.”
“In this era when so many seem to place expediency over honor, it is heartening that so many others are showing great courage, some even risking their lives. Theodore Roosevelt, in his time, chose the honorable course,” Tweed Roosevelt wrote in an op-ed Friday in the New York Times. “Captain Crozier has done the same.”
Esper insisted it was not unusual for the Navy to relieve commanders so quickly without first completing a review into their actions. But he also declined to say what will happen to Crozier, citing the current ongoing investigation. Navy officials have previously said that though Crozier was removed as captain of one the world’s largest and most lethal warships, he will not be discharged or demoted.
Crozier grew up in Santa Rosa and graduated from Santa Rosa High School in 1988. He knew what he wanted to do with his life as the theater lights came up after a screening in his hometown of the 1986 box office hit, “Top Gun,” starring Tom Cruise as a carrier-based Navy fighter.
He attended the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Mary-land, and, following graduation from the academy in 1992, trained to fly the Seahawk helicopter, then the F/A-18 Hornet fighter. He earned a master’s degree in National Security and Strategic Studies from the Naval War College in 2007 and completed Nuclear Power School in 2014.
From 2014 to 2016, Crozier served as executive officer of the aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan.
He received his first command in mid-2017 as captain of amphibious command ship the Blue Ridge, flagship of the U.S. 7th Fleet and the oldest operational ship in the Navy.
Among the awards he has received are the Legion of Merit, Defense Meritorious Service Medal, Meritorious Service Medal, Air Medal, Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, and various unit commendations.
Last Nov. 1, the crew of the carrier Theodore Roosevelt, nicknamed “Big Stick” in tribute to the U.S. Cavalry Volunteer Rough Rider and 26th U.S. president, welcomed Crozier as their new captain.

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES - Patricia Bosworth, an actress who once starred alongside Audrey Hepburn and later wrote biographies on several stars including Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift, has died due to the coronavirus. She was 86.
Bosworth's stepdaughter, Fia Hatsav, told The New York Times that pneumonia brought on by the virus was the cause of death. Bosworth died on Thursday in New York.
Bosworth played a nun opposite of Hepburn in the 1959 classic "The Nun's Story." Along with penning bios for Brando and Clift, she also wrote biographies on actress Jane Fonda and famed photographer Diane Arbus, who photographed Bosworth in a Greyhound bus advertisement.
Her biography on Arbus served as the base for the 2006 film "Fur: An Imaginary Portrait of Diane Arbus," which starred Nicole Kidman.
Under the tutelage of Lee Strasberg, Bosworth studied acting at the Actors Studio alongside Marilyn Monroe, Paul Newman, Steve McQueen and Fonda. Bosworth worked on Broadway and starred in television shows including "Naked City" and "The Patty Duke Show."
Bosworth turned her attention from acting to focus on a career in journalism as a successful editor and writer. She wrote for The New York Times and New York magazine, and was an editor for several publications including Screen Stars, McCall's and contributed to Vanity Fair.
She wrote memoirs about her own life in 1998's "Anything Your Little Heart Desires: An American Family Story" and 2017's "The Men in My Life: A Memoir of Love and Art in 1950s Manhattan."

Texto completo: Louis C. K. addressed his #MeToo accusations in his first stand-up special released since his career imploded following a 2017 New York Times investigation detailing sexual harassment complaints toward the comedian.
The surprise special, titled "Sincerely Louis C. K. ," released Saturday and is available only for purchase and download from the comedian's website for $7. 99.
Greeted by the Washington, D. C. , audience with a standing ovation, C. K. asked viewers about how their "last couple of years" have been.
"How was 2018 and 2019 for you guys?" he asked. "Anybody else get into global amounts of trouble? (Expletive) that was crazy. Man, I was in a lot of trouble. Wait 'till they see those pictures of me in blackface. That's gonna make it a lot worse, because there's a lot of those. There's thousands of pictures of me in blackface. I can't stop doing it. I like it. I like how it feels. "
The comedian said he learned "a lot," elaborating that the experience taught him how to be able to eat alone in a restaurant with angry onlookers.
"When you get in trouble, you learn who your real friends are," he said. "People like saying that like it's a good thing. Who the (expletive) wants to know who their real friends are?. . . It's never who you want it to be. It's not your cool friends and it's not your fun friends. "
At another point, C. K. offered the audience "some advice only I can give you" regarding the scandal: Ask a partner for permission and then "check in often. "
"It's not always clear how people feel," he said. "Men are taught to make sure the woman is OK. The thing is, women know how to seem OK when they're not OK. So you can't just look at her face and be like, 'Her eyes are dry, we're fine. Let's just keep going. '"
For the majority of the special, it was business as usual for C. K. , who launched into his usual irreverent stand-up, wondering whether or not a god exists ("he could clear a lot of (expletive) up with a five-minute press conference"), discussing the death of his mother last year, talking about pedophilia and referencing the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing in a lengthy bit about disability that repeatedly used a derogatory term used to discriminate against those with intellectual disabilities.
"I'm a little bit confused by this, because it wasn't always a bad word," he said. "When I grew up in the '70s, it wasn't bad back then. And most bad words were always bad. (Expletive) never had its day in the sun. There was never a day when Santa Claus at the mall was like, 'Come here, you little (expletive). Tell me what you want for Christmas. '"

The comedian’s career imploded in November 2017 after he acknowledged complaints of harassment reported by the New York Times, most of which involved him masturbating in the presence of women he knew professionally.
Some of the women said they feared their careers would suffer if they discussed the incidents, which took place more than a decade ago.
C. K. released a statement after the Times report, saying “these stories are true. ” He acknowledged abusing his power over others and causing them pain but did not publicly apologize.
The revelations, which came at the height of the #MeToo movement against sexual abuse in the workplace, led to the cancellation of C. K. ’s numerous TV contracts and the scrapping of his feature-length film, “I Love You, Daddy,” shortly before its release.
The comedian vowed to “step back and take a long time to listen. ” He returned to the stage less than a year later, touring in the U. S. and around the world with several sold-out shows.

Texto completo: China is stockpiling masks and ventilators.

And there's more! China makes more than 90 percent of our antibiotics, vitamin C, ibuprofen and hydrocortisone, 70 percent of acetaminophen and 40 percent of heparin, according to The New York Times.

The last American penicillin plant closed more than 15 years ago.

In early March, the Chinese government ominously warned that if China stopped exporting drugs, "the United States would sink into the hell of a novel coronavirus epidemic."

For decades, people like Trump's trade director Peter Navarro have warned us that something like this would happen someday. But we were condescendingly told this is capital seeking the most efficient market! Anyway, we can always make it ourselves.

Really? But I notice that Wall Street made a lot of money off of globalization.

Even before China gave us this latest viral disease -- not to be confused with H1N1, Asian flu, SARS and bird flu, also from China -- one of the most frequent questions about Amazon products was: "Is this made in China?"

Obviously, a lot of consumers would happily pay more to know that something is made in the USA -- or at least not in China. We'd like to support our fellow Americans. We also prefer products that don't kill the family pet, instantly fall apart or risk being embargoed during a viral pandemic.

How about that search refinement, Amazon? "Made in USA including constituent parts" or "0 percent Chinese."

Not a chance. The globalists are making a lot of money selling us crappy products, manufactured in a culturally backward, totalitarian regime with zero quality control and absolutely no interest in the well-being of our country.

Nearly a month ago, The New York Times reported that Trump was preparing an executive order requiring the federal government to buy American-made pharmaceuticals.

We're still waiting.

Navarro had the executive order ready to go, but then dozens of pharmaceutical companies lobbied against it, arguing that "a diverse pharmaceutical supply chain is precisely what enables the industry to respond quickly and make adjustments in its supply chain sourcing during natural emergencies and global public health crises."

The Big Pharma lobbyists also noted that Trump's (idle) threat for America to make its own drugs "could run afoul of commitments it made under the WTO's Government Procurement Agreement."

Trump is the president of the United States. Either he is responsible for a monstrous virus arriving on our shores and destroying our economy -- or China is.

I expected the media to say, "Trump!" I didn't expect Trump to agree.

Texto completo: NEWNAN--Can a middle-aged white woman from Rhode Island help a Southern town contend with its troubled past?
It's a question the artist Mary Beth Meehan, 52, asked herself while working on the public art project "Seeing Newnan" for the town of 38,000 located 40 miles southwest of Atlanta.
Currently on view through June, the project features 17 enormous photo banners that hang from various buildings in Newnan's historic downtown, including the Presbyterian Church, a toy store, the Wadsworth Auditorium and a fitness center.
The images are portraits that present a cross-section of people who live in Newnan -- a domestic worker, manual laborer, mill-worker, high school students, pastors, children in their cotillion finery, an Ivy Leaguer -- in a kind of alternative advertisement of place. In addition, Meehan posted interviews with her subjects on her blog at marybethmeehan.com. Black, white, well-to-do and on-the-margins -- all are put on an equal footing. Meehan's billboard-sized photos suggest a kind of Norman Rockwell street art, treating ordinary people as monumental in keeping with an American democratic ideal.
Her project is part of Newnan ArtRez, an artist-in-residency program that provides a retreat for artists who, in turn, enrich the community with their work. It is sponsored by the University of West Georgia and funded by charitable trusts.
Soon after arriving in Newnan in 2016 and speaking to its residents, Meehan knew her project was going to be about race. How could it not be? Even though Newnan had a growing population of immigrants and newcomers drawn by the town's affordability and its proximity to Atlanta and Harts-field-Jackson International Airport, the town's past still haunted some black residents. Historically, Newnan made its fortune from a cotton industry fueled by slavery, like much of the South. And it was the site in 1899 of one of the most notorious lynchings in Southern history of victim Sam Hose.
Even today, Newnan remains geographically divided by race. Yet, "there are still people who think race is not an issue," says Andrew Copeland, 26, the youngest and only black board member for Newnan ArtRez.
More than half of Meehan's banner subjects are nonwhite in a town where 62% of the population is white. More importantly, they are economically and socially diverse. They represent a broad spectrum of black life in a nation where such complex portraits are still relatively rare.
Meehan knew when she started the project that a northerner treating race in the South was a tinderbox.
"It wasn't easy for any of us. There were people who were going,'Why is she writing about white supremacy? Get her out of here,'" said Meehan, whose photography has appeared in The New York Times, the Boston Globe and Le Monde. Her previous photo projects have addressed issues such as income inequality in Silicon Valley and immigration in Providence, Rhode Island.
The Newnan project almost didn't happen. Business owners worried it would stir up controversy. Even members of the Newnan ArtRez board had reservations. "Why are you doing this?" Meehan was asked about her motives. "We had some really rough conversations. There were tears," said board member Liza Nelson Brown. One mural had to be moved to another location when the original sponsor backed out.
"Seeing Newnan" debuted in the spring of 2019, and Newnan ArtRez board president Robert Hancock says the response on social media was immediate. "I was so overwhelmed and disarmed by it," he says. He wondered, "is this the town I live in?"
Some residents complained on Facebook about a portrait of teenage sisters Aatika and Zahraw Shah wearing hijabs that hangs on an office building. That photo fueled anti-Muslim invective and generated a story in The New York Times.
"The nastiness of the posts," says Meehan. "It made me think, this is what it must have been like for people of color one generation ago."
"Take down the Muslim picture or someone else will,"one commenter wrote.
But Hancock says the rebuttals to those comments were also instantaneous, with people calling out their neighbors for racist and Islamophobic comments.
"There are these dissenting voices," says ArtRez board member Susan Crutchfield. "But the majority of people are so positive."
Despite the negative attention, Aatika is glad she participated in the project, which she likened to Brandon Stan-ton's "Humans of New York" project that features street photography of ordinary people who share their personal stories. "I love Georgia," she says. "Seeing those faces around Newnan, it opened up a lot of conversations. (It) opened up Newnan through a new lens and (created) an understanding of the diversity of Newnan, in religion, in race."
Monique Bentley, a 23-year-old senior at Georgia State University, was photographed in Newnan's Farmer Street cemetery adjacent to the African American Heritage Museum, where enslaved people are buried.
"(Race) can be a scary topic to talk about," Bentley says. "The white community doesn't want to accept what their ancestors did to our ancestors. (But)what we do moving forward is what matters, even if it means uncovering the dark history."
Meehan says it is hard to deny the injustices of the past in the stories she heard from people like domestic worker Helen Berry, resplendent in a tangerine-colored caftan in Meehan's portrait. Berry grew up in Newnan under segregation and found limited prospects available to her.
"The fact that Mrs. Berry graduates from high school in 1954 and is consigned to a professional life that is way below her intellectual, human abilities because of racially inscribed laws," posits Meehan, "how could that not have had an effect on how people are relating to each other in 2020?"
The murals have prompted many residents to contemplate disturbing events like Hose's lynching and the neo-Nazi rally held in 2018 in Newnan's Greenville Street Park, where the local counter-protesters far outnumbered the white supremacists, who were outsiders to the community.
"It's not where it was 50 years ago," says Copeland, of Newnan. "But we're not where we need to be today. And I think that this project is inherently good because it can spark these conversations."
Newnan still feels like a place where black and white residents live in separate worlds.The charming downtown area is home to Meehan's regal portrait of a black pastor, Rev. Rufus Smith Sr., and a monument to Confederate dead.
For longtime Newnan resident Tavaris Johnson, a student at Georgia College & State University in Milledgeville, "Seeing Newnan" provided a way to look at his community in a new light.
"My race has shaped my life's experiences, and some people are unwilling to acknowledge that," says Johnson, who credits Meehan's outsider status for bringing a fresh perspective to the topic. "I think it's important for people to be exposed to the people they normally have no, or limited, contact with. That's why I was drawn to this project."
In the end, "Seeing Newnan" is evidence of public art's potential to prompt a community to look deeper at itself and examine what lies beneath the surface of perceived realities.
When so many Americans seem unwilling to grapple with the issue of racism, at least Meehan is trying, and so is Newnan.

Texto completo: The raid was just like the ones on television. A blur of federal agents in gear emblazoned with acronyms stormed into the Chamblee office complex. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. The door flew open.
"You got the girl? You got the girl?" the agents yelled.
Louise Clark, a mother of two daughters, was the only "girl" in the department, and she was pretty sure she was going to prison.
More than 20 years later, Wahida Clark, as she is now known, recounts that moment from the sitting room of her metro Atlanta home. At 50-something, she is petite and energetic, using animated gestures to punctuate her story. In a plaid shirt with black skinny jeans and a pearl choker, the self-titled "queen of street lit" is wearing square framed glasses, going without makeup and sporting a shaved head.
Clark, a former federal inmate turned New York Times bestselling author, is one of the most recognized names in the literary genre known for its gritty depictions of life on the streets. Once ignored by the mainstream, street lit has since become a cultural force that has influenced music, television and film. Becoming an author and publisher of street lit was a path forward for Clark -- a way to support her family without confronting the societal challenges of being an ex-con, and a way to offer the same to other inmates. Today, her empire is expanding. She is currently filming a docuseries of her life and she runs a nonprofit with international reach, but part of her mission has remained the same.
"All I wanted to do was to publish authors, sell a lot of books and make noise for this genre," Clark said. "We are making good stuff. It is good storytelling."
Prison lit, street lit or urban fiction emerged 50 years ago, but some historians would argue that it has roots in the 19th century. "What we are calling prison literature is also what was coming out of the plantations right after Reconstruction," said H. Bruce Franklin, author of "Prison Literature in America." With mass incarceration in the late 1960s and 1970s, black prisoners began to connect their experiences to slavery, Franklin said. Donald Goines --a street hustler who began writing about his experiences while incarcerated -- defined the modern genre, but it was then and in some ways remains invisible to the arbiters of American culture.
"The walls of a prison are designed not only to keep the prisoners in but to keep the rest of society from knowing what is going on inside. Prison literature is very subversive in that it reaches out from inside the prison to the larger society," Franklin said. "This is different literature and separate from what people consider modern American literature, but it is extremely important."
A new path in life takes an unexpected turn
Clark grew up in a housing project in Trenton, New Jersey. Her mother was 16 when Clark was born and struggled to care for Clark and her younger brother. When the family was evicted from the housing project in the dead of winter, they went to live with Clark's aunt.
As a teen, Clark and her friends would steal school supplies, personal care items and other things they needed while trying to find ways to make money. During her freshman year in high school, Clark and her friend met up with a group of older girls who had their own apartments and introduced them to the teachings of Elijah Muhammad, leader of the Nation of Islam.
Clark was enthralled. She stopped drinking and experimenting with drugs and began covering her head, a symbol of modesty. At 14, she ran away to New York City, where she spent nine months studying for Muslim Girl Training. The program for young women in the Nation of Islam includes training in life skills. Clark eventually returned home, but she had changed. She dropped out of school and moved in with a fellow Nation of Islam member.
"I had to get out of there. It was so much drama," Clark said. "I wanted to practice Islam in peace without being bothered and harassed."
She had also met Al Dickens, aka Uncle Yah Yah, an inmate in state prison serving time for bank robbery. Clark had read Dickens' book based on his personal pearls of wisdom and told a friend she had to meet him. She was smitten with the older man, with whom she would have two daughters while he served 25 years in state and federal prisons. Dickens encouraged Clark to get a GED and attend community college. When he was transferred to a prison in Atlanta, Clark moved the entire family to DeKalb County. That's when her life took a detour.
Driven by Nation of Islam teachings of self-reliance, Clark always had an entrepreneurial streak. In Atlanta, she and her family branched into everything from landscaping to multilevel marketing. Clark shifted from an administrative job to telemarketing so she would have time to visit Dickens in prison. She eventually began working for American Eagle Advertising, a Chamblee-based company that engaged in fraudulent telemarketing sales for 18 months, according to court documents. Clark was a top seller, sometimes making $100,000 in sales a week by upselling senior citizens on items like gold coins and high-end business supplies.
The feds had been watching the business for years before the day they stormed the offices. Clark declined to take a plea bargain, and after a 17-week trial in Arizona, where the company headquarters was a front for money laundering, a jury found Clark and her co-defendants guilty of wire fraud and money laundering. Clark was sentenced to 10.5 years in federal prison.
Writing from behind bars When Clark entered the women's federal penitentiary in Lexington, Kentucky, Dickens, her husband, was just finishing his prison term. She hadn't been able to return home to get the family affairs in order. One day, she called to get money for her commissary account, but her family told her there was nothing to give. All of their businesses were gone. All of the money was gone. The cars were being repossessed and the house was in foreclosure. They had even pawned her Rolex watch for $50. Clark worked in the prison library and taught computer classes, but she knew she needed more money. She hung up the phone and started to pray.
"I said, 'Allah, what am I going to do right now to make money while I am in prison?' Also 'Lord, my kids are on the outside and I have to take care of them. My husband is locked up and I need to send him money.' Very shortly after that, he sent me an answer," Clark said.
Prison jobs in federal prisons usually pay 25 cents to $1 per hour, said Lauren-Brooke Eisen, director of the Justice Program at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law. Any money inmates do make can be directed to paying court fees, restitution or the cost of incarceration.
"For the vast majority of people behind bars, there is no way to provide for their families," Eisen said. But Clark would become an outlier, one of a small group of inmates who would take their experiences, real or fictionalized, and turn a profit by writing about them from behind bars.
In 2016, Curtis Dawkins, who is serving a life sentence in Michigan for murdering a man during a botched robbery, scored a book deal with Simon and Schuster for $150,000. Two years later, the state wanted him to redirect 90% of his assets from an education fund for his three children to state coffers to pay for cost of his imprisonment, according to a report in The New York Times. But before Dawkins was an inmate, he earned a master's in fine arts. Clark, like most other inmates writing in the street lit genre, had no such training.
Her turning point was seeing a magazine story about Shannon Holmes, a pioneer of modern street lit who had no prior writing experience, writing a book while in prison. Clark began to envision her own name on the spines of books in the library. She told her husband.
"He said, 'If you are going to write a book, the only thing they are buying from us is about pimping, ho-ing and drugs,'" she said.
She came up with a storyline, a tale of three women choosing between the thugs they love or a life beyond crime, and wrote every day in longhand on a yellow legal pad. She signed up for a creative writing class and started reading urban literature. In six months, Clark had the makings of a novel. She wrote to Carl Weber, a popular African American author at the time, for advice on getting published. Weber wrote back and told her he was starting a publishing company.
"That was when I got my first book deal," Clark said. She had family members type her manuscript, and she asked prison staff to help her get it copied.
When the book was published in 2002, 15 copies arrived at the prison, but the check for $25,000 in royalties bounced and the company went out of business, she said. Weber did not respond to a request for comment on the deal.
Despite Clark not receiving that money, the prison lieutenant took notice of Clark's burgeoning success. She was summoned to the office and grilled on how she managed to publish a book while in jail, Clark said. She ended up in solitary confinement.
"They said I was there for writing a book and profiting from it when the prison says you are not supposed to do that," she said.
Most people behind bars are not getting book deals, so policies can vary from one prison to the next, said experts.
"The few situations where someone had a source of income that was significant that was not part of the prison economy, those are taken on a case-by-case basis," Eisen said.
During nine months in solitary confinement, Clark started writing what would become her second book series. When she was transferred to Alderson, the minimum-security women's prison in West Virginia, she got an agent, a new book deal and an advance from Kensington Publishing Corp.
Meeting Martha
Street lit was experiencing a renaissance, and publishing houses were paying attention.
"Mainstream publishers saw there was a real desire from readers to have books about this part of people's lives, and since authenticity is so important in this genre, working with people who had been in prison was the right way forward," said Esi Sogah, executive editor at Kensington Publishing. In 2000, the company launched the Dafina imprint specifically to publish books that centered on race and cultural identity.
At any given time, editors are likely to be working with two to three authors who are incarcerated, Sogah said. The biggest challenge is communication.
"You can't just make a quick phone call if there's a story point that needs clarifying. Normally, we work with an author's representative -- sometimes a literary agent or lawyer, but often a family member," Sogah said. "This person is an equally important part of the process as the author, responsible for managing communication and handling any marketing requirements that would be difficult from prison."
Under Kensington's Dafina imprint, Clark's books, "Thugs and the Women Who Love Them" and "Every Thug Needs a Lady," began to hit bestseller lists in USA Today and Essence Magazine. She would later be credited with creating a subgenre of street lit with stories about street thugs who are also family men and doting fathers.
But Clark ran into trouble again when her books came out. Prison officials took away her privileges, but she kept writing.
Not only did she want to support her family, but she also had to pay $290 a month in restitution for her crimes. The publisher paid her earnings directly to her family, she said.
In October 2004, the mundane pace of prison life got a jolt of excitement. Clark's prison mom, Diana Sanchez, practically flew into the television room to tell Clark that media maven Martha Stewart had arrived. Stewart had been found guilty of conspiracy, obstruction of justice and lying to federal investigators in an insider trading scandal.
"Get dressed!" Sanchez yelled. "The lady is here. The lady is here."
Clark got dressed and walked into what she could only describe as a meet and greet. She introduced herself but didn't interact with Stewart much until she asked her to participate in a career day with a presentation on business trends. Clark did a presentation on writing and publishing as she was prepping to launch a publishing company. She asked Stewart to review her business plan before Stewart finished serving her sentence.
By the time she entered a halfway house in New Jersey in 2007, Clark had published seven books and had two manuscripts waiting to launch her publishing company, W. Clark Publishing. Her authors included Cash, an inmate in Georgia State Prison who would go on to launch his own publishing company.
Well-versed in the street lit genre, Clark looked for authors who could paint a picture for readers and make it feel real, even if it wasn't true to their experiences. "They say, write what you know, but to me, your imagination can take you wherever you want to go," Clark said. "It is basically what they know and live, but you add that something extra to give it that edge."
'A bit of a legend' To celebrate 20 years of the
Dafina imprint, Kensington has published reissues of Clark's early books. "Wahida is a bit of a legend, both in the street lit genre and in publishing," said Sogah, the Kensington editor.
Through the decades, the street lit market has become increasingly saturated. Unwilling to wait for entry into traditional avenues, more urban authors have branched off and created their own publishing companies, Sogah said, with their influence extending into popular entertainment. "One thing I think will be interesting as we move forward is seeing more people turn to street lit to engage with our current conversations about mass incarceration and prison reform," Sogah said.
There are about 30 authors on the roster of W. Clark Publishing, most of whom are current or former inmates. Clark has mentored and taught more than a few people. Now she is looking beyond publishing.
On a recent morning in February, Clark is recovering after a trip to Ghana, where she picked up two strains of E. coli and salmonella. She was there for the nonprofit Prodigal Sons and Daughters. Clark serves as vice president of the organization through which she hopes to reach an increasingly younger population of inmates entering prison with limited life skills and education.
In Ghana, the organization is working to open a state-of-the-art mental health facility and prison. "It is a huge commitment," said Clark, but it helps that her family -- including her husband, and her daughters, now in their 30s -- continue to be engaged in business affairs.
With the release of her 15th book, "Thugs: Seven," the time seemed right for Clark to reflect on her life and success and the ways in which prison gave her the drive to remain independent and reach back to help some of the people she met along the way. If she learned anything behind bars, it was to never waste time, because you don't get it back, she said.
Lately, Clark's schedule is a blur of media appearances and international travel. She is often trailed by a film crew as she returns to the places in New Jersey and Atlanta that helped shape her life. She views the docuseries as just another way for her to tell a story -- one that happens to be her own. It is the one book she has yet to write, she said, but she is working on it.

Texto completo: Traveling for pleasure is out for now, and many of us are stuck at home day in, day out. Here are some ideas for taking those lemons and getting some joy out of them.
Nobody's traveling for fun right now, and a lot of people are spending all day, every day, cooped up at home. You may, of course, be working your regular hours in a home office or at the kitchen table, but when you're not, you could try to make the best of the situation. Here are the ways that Wirecutter editors are keeping busy (or at least sane) during their off-work hours while stuck at home.
Kareway Epielle Moisturizing Gloves and Socks
Your hands are going through a lot these days with all that washing -- give them (and yourself) a D.I.Y. spa session with these hydrating and moisturizing treatments. ( $ 15 from Amazon)
BenQ HT2150ST Short-Throw Projector
Been on the fence about investing in a home-theater projector? With some studios streaming current releases, now is the time. This one is good for smaller spaces. ( $ 750 from B & H Photo)
Carcassonne
One of Wirecutter's favorite adult board games for beginners, this medieval city-building game can also be played remotely, via Android and iOS apps and game consoles. ( $ 28 from Amazon)
Fitbit Charge 3
Even where "shelter-in-place" restrictions are in effect, going outside to exercise (alone) is likely to be allowed. A fitness tracker can serve as gentle encouragement. ( $ 150 from Walmart)
Coleman Sundown 4
This budget tent makes a great indoors fort for children -- or lets them camp out overnight in the backyard, if you have one and of course, climate permitting. ( $ 65 from Amazon)
L. L. Bean Wicked Good Moccasins
Breathable and long-wearing, these slippers have a thick rubber outsole, so they are fine for stepping outside to get the mail or sign for a package. ( $ 80 from L. L. Bean)

Texto completo: Circle the globe with these international thrillers, comedies, dramas and documentaries.
There's no getting around it: Most of us won't be traveling for a good, long while. There are certainly more pressing concerns -- personal health, supply lines, stocking the pantry, caring for the children -- but the anticipation and inner peace of an upcoming vacation, a family gathering, or a trip abroad have now disappeared, and who knows for how long. It's neither safe nor (increasingly) possible to visit Norway or Brazil or France or anywhere else when you're stuck in your home.
But maybe it is. One of the genuine delights of the streaming era is the degree to which it has made international television available, and readily too -- with scores of shows streaming on Amazon, Hulu, HBO and (especially) Netflix. Sprinkle in an assortment of travelogues and you can go all over the world, from the comfort (and confines) of your couch. Here are some of the best shows for treating cabin fever:
'Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations'
Streaming on Hulu.
Any respectable world television tour should begin with Anthony Bourdain's globe-trotting food and travel docu-series, in which the late, great celebrity chef visits places large and small, from Singapore to Saudi Arabia to Sweden, taking in the local cuisine, culture and citizens. (And he doesn't slouch on the scenery, either -- the series twice won the Emmy award for Outstanding Cinematography for Nonfiction Programming.) Over the course of its nine-season run, it became clear that Bourdain wasn't just out to see sights or swipe recipes; the show seemed like his personal mission to correct the Ugly American stereotype, and to remind us that when we're abroad, we should aim to be travelers rather than tourists. (Read The New York Times review.)
'Somebody Feed Phil'
Streaming on Netflix.
"Food is the great connector," says Phil Rosenthal, "and laughter is the cement." This Netflix original often plays like a comic riff on "No Reservations" (though that show is frequently funny itself), as the nebbish "Everybody Loves Raymond" creator travels to Lisbon and Buenos Aires and other places around the globe, in an attempt to "go to the source" of some of his favorite foods -- and take in the world in the process, with most of the show's laughs generated by the incongruity between his markedly urban American persona and the kind of "roughing it" often required by these locales.
'Travel Man: 48 Hours In ...'
Streaming on Hulu.
There's a long, rich tradition of British comedians "presenting" travel programs, from Michael Palin's marvelous BBC docu-series ("Around the World in 80 Days," "Pole to Pole," "Full Circle," etc.) to the ongoing "Trip" series (to northern England, Italy, Spain and Greece) with Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon to this Channel 4 treat, in which the comic actor and director Richard Ayoade ("The IT Crowd") visits the great cities of the world for 48 hours with a celebrity guest. The results are enjoyable as both a travel series and a parody of them; Ayoade and his friends hit the must-see sights and capture the beauty of these hot spots, but also detour to goofier locations, indulging in wry commentary and awkward interplay.
'Our Planet'
Streaming on Netflix.
Narrator David Attenborough and the team behind his acclaimed BBC series "Planet Earth" spent four years crafting this eight-part Netflix original with two purposes: to celebrate the world we inhabit, and to note the disruptions and dangers that have entered its ecosystems. That message remains vital, but the show's sense of wonder and powerful visuals are not to be denied and, as the entire series was shot with 4K cameras -- taking in images of Indonesian jungles, Central African Deserts, the forests of Madagascar, the Atlantic Ocean and the Arctic on a big flat screen -- this is about as close as you're going to get to the real thing. (Read The New York Times review.)
'Sense8'
Streaming on Netflix.
From "The Matrix" trilogy to "Cloud Atlas," the Wachowskis have never lacked in ambition, and their two-season Netflix series has exotic locations built into its premise, which connects eight strangers in eight cities with each others' lives and worlds. In telling that story, they covered as much ground as any travel show, with breathtaking photography in Mumbai, London, Seoul, Nairobi, Mexico City, Berlin, Naples, Malta, Amsterdam, São Paulo and many, many more places. (Read The New York Times review.)
'The Night Manager'
Streaming on Amazon Prime.
When the screenwriter David Farr and the director Susanne Bier adapted John le Carré's 1993 spy novel for television, they not only updated the time period, but tweaked the locations -- shooting the sleek, glossy tale in Switzerland, Marrakesh and Spain (of particular note: a gorgeous Spanish villa for the villain Hugh Laurie). The le Carré purists may object, but the rest of us will be too busy luxuriating in the Continental flavor and sun-soaked photography. (Read The New York Times review.)
'Killing Eve'
Streaming on Hulu.
Spy shows and films generally hopscotch around the globe, which makes them especially ripe for wanderlust viewing, and though the smash BBC America adaptation of Luke Jennings' "Villanelle" novels is, in many ways, a subversion of the spy series conventions, one must often embrace those tropes to send them up. So the MI6 agent Eve Polastri must trek from London to such locales as Tuscany, Berlin, Bucharest, Paris, Amsterdam, Rome and other places in her pursuit of the high-level assassin Villanelle (Jodie Comer). (Read The New York Times review.)
'Wallander'
Streaming on Hulu and BritBox.
Henning Mankell's series of detective novels, previously adapted into films and a series for Swedish television, are here dramatized by British TV with the quintessentially British actor Kenneth Branagh in the role. But the series keeps the original Swedish setting, and to great effect; Times critic Mike Hale praises the show's use of "the stark, flat expanses of the southern Swedish coast, with their shimmering fields and lonely trees outlined against big blue-gray skies." (Read The New York Times review.)
'Occupied'
Streaming on Netflix.
And from here our world tour takes us to Norway, for this ongoing series from the minds behind such archetypal Scandinavian crime films as "Insomnia" and "Headhunters." This fast-paced political thriller, in which high-minded Norwegian government officials cease production of oil and gas in the face of climate change, only to find their country occupied by Russian forces, offers up not only the snowy landscapes we've come to expect, but plenty of urban portraiture as well. (Read The New York Times review.)
'Babylon Berlin'
Streaming on Netflix.
Next stop: Germany, for this extravagantly mounted, neo-noir series, set during the city's pre-Hitler, Weimar Republic era. The production -- reportedly the most expensive in German TV history -- leans heavily on a giant, permanent standing set at the Babelsberg Studio, but also uses copious locations throughout the city (and country), including the Theater am Schiffbauerdamm, the Berlin City Hall, the Protestant Church of the Redeemer, and the Bavarian Railway Museum. (Read The New York Times review.)
'Dark'
Streaming on Netflix.
On the other hand, if you'd like to visit small-town Germany in the present day (sort of), we can pay a visit to the forest village of Winden, the setting for this dizzyingly complicated and moodily atmospheric Netflix original. Winding together four families and three generations of tragedies -- kidnappings, suicides, murders -- that often converge in the dark and scary woods, this one is frightening enough to make you feel all right about staying indoors. (Read The New York Times review.)
'Call My Agent!'
Streaming on Netflix.
The French film industry gets the "Curb Your Enthusiasm"/"Extras" treatment with this inside-showbiz satire, mixing real stars of their big and small screens with the fictional exploits of a rapidly splintering and highly dysfunctional talent agency. The takeaway is that the machinery that keeps things running behind the scenes is far from glamorous (it's petty, gossipy and back-stabbing), but there's still plenty of screen time for the glam, and many opportunities to gawk at the Parisian scenery and high-powered red carpets. (Read The New York Times review.)
'My Brilliant Friend'
Streaming on HBO.
Some series float through their locations, only making fleeting connections. But HBO's ongoing adaptation of Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan novels isn't just set in Italy in the 1950s; it's dug in there, intimately aware of every stairwell, courtyard and apartment in its working class neighborhood. It's a setting, James Poniewozik writes, "where everyone is packed close and prying eyes and whispers are inescapable." But the series also offers gorgeous glimpses of the world outside that neighborhood, of an upper-crust area of Naples, or a resort island. It's a welcome reminder that even when things are bleak, escape is still possible. (Read The New York Times review.)
'Kingdom'
Streaming on Netflix.
And on we travel, both around the globe (to South Korea) and back in time (to the 16th century) for this Netflix original, gleefully mixing historical drama, zombie horror, swordplay, political satire and (gulp) contagion thriller -- and mounted on a grand scale, with big, colorful action sequences carefully choreographed in gorgeous forests and rolling vistas. Mike Hale picked it as one of the best international shows of the decade, and praised the "rousing" series for its "rich production values." (Read The New York Times review.)
'Giri / Haji'
Streaming on Netflix.
And we land in both London and Tokyo for this recent Netflix addition (a pickup from BBC Two), a cross-cultural story of a Tokyo detective (Takehiro Hira) attempting to track down his gangster brother in the criminal underworld. Aiding him in the search -- as best she can -- is a London police detective (Kelly MacDonald), whose perpetual mood seems to take its cues from the city: cold and gray. But the show also beautifully captures the neon glow of these cities at night, when the respectable citizens clear the streets, and things start getting interesting.
'Outlander'
Streaming on Netflix and Starz.
There's a strange circularity about watching (or, likely, rewatching) Starz's adaptation of Diana Gabaldon's books for the scenery -- since a fair number of its enthusiastic viewers have gone to central Scotland for the primary purpose of visiting its locations. And they're gorgeous, rolling hills and venerable castles and foggy marshes and leafy forests, offering even more escape than we were already enjoying from this tale of a 1940s woman inexplicably zapped into 18th-century Scotland. And she does what we're all trying to do: she makes the best of it. (Read The New York Times review.)
'Black Sails'
Streaming on Hulu.
By the time this thing is over, we may not even want to be landlocked anymore -- and there's no better show for taking to the high seas than Starz's four-season pirate adventure/drama, presenting the origin story of Long John Silver. Though set in the West Indies circa 1715, the series was shot in South Africa, which convincingly doubles for the region; the blue waters are crystal clear, and the beaches would be irresistibly inviting were it not for all those pesky pirates. (Read The New York Times review.)
'Fortitude'
Streaming on Amazon Prime.
And finally we land at the top of the world -- well, close to it, on the Arctic island of Fortitude, setting of this Sky Atlantic mystery/thriller series. Fortitude, however, is a fictional location (that'd be just a bit too nice and neat), so the three-season series was shot in Iceland and Norway; its icy glaciers and snow-capped mountains could come in handy if we're still indoors this summer.

CDC rethinks merit of covering our faces

Texto completo: At the urging of national health officials, Minnesotans now are being asked to wear cloth face masks when they head out to grocery stores and other public places.
Friday's recommendation from the CDC, an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19, came with a strong plea that the public preserve medical-grade masks for health care providers, as well as a warning that masks are no substitute for social distancing and thorough, frequent hand-washing.
When the pandemic first hit the United States, the CDC said only people who were infected or showed symptoms should wear a mask in public. But as infections and deaths across the country multiplied, the CDC began reconsidering its advice.
Before the new recommendation was announced, Minnesota health experts had expressed caution about the value of wearing cloth masks in public. In short, they said, there are little data to assess the value of the homemade masks. And yet they agree that masks could keep people who are infected but have no symptoms from spreading the virus through coughs, sneezes or even talking.
If the CDC recommends it, that's what people should do, said Helen Strike, who oversees Allina Health's COVID-19 response team and is president of two of its hospitals.
"At this point, we have to do everything we can to flatten this curve," she said. "At some point, we're going to look back on this and we're going to figure out what's the best practice. Right now, we're trying everything we can."
The push for the public to wear makeshift masks comes as cities and states strain to get necessary medical supplies for health care providers exposed to infected people. At one point, the CDC recommended that health care providers use homemade masks, saying even a bandanna or scarf would do if no medical-grade masks were available.
"Oh, my God," said Deb Dittberner, a family physician in Alexandria, Minn. "We need something better than bandannas."
So she and legions of Minnesotans who sew have churned out thousands of masks for medical care providers. Their overwhelming response quickly emptied store shelves of elastic, interfacing and twill tape.
To be clear, using cloth masks in hospitals and clinics remains a stop-gap measure until manufacturers can ramp up production of high-grade medical masks. "When we have nothing else, we'll be using it," Dittberner said.
Allina health care facilities are laundering piles of donated cloth masks and using them in clinics for patients with respiratory symptoms.
Eventually, they may be used by Allina staff who don't deal directly with patients.
Lakeville's Julie Skovran and her 19 "sewing angels" have stitched more than 500 masks, sending them to Presbyterian Homes in Bloomington as well as to care providers in hospices and a hospital pediatric unit.
There's an even larger workforce that could use the cloth masks, including day-care providers, EMS workers, police officers, firefighters and assisted living facilities' administrative staffs and cleaning crews, Dittberner said.
What's more, the cloth mask may become the public's best defense against the infection, she said.
In some Asian countries, wearing a face mask in public is the norm during an epidemic. In the Czech Republic, officials recently mandated that face masks be worn in public, citing the idea that, "My mask protects you. Your mask protects me."
The theory promoting universal mask-wearing is that it could keep people who are ill from sharing the virus, said Dr. Susan Kline, a professor in the division of infectious diseases and international medicine at the University of Minnesota.
The effectiveness of the N95 mask, which fits tightly on the face and is made of material that allows for a high level of filtration, is proven, she said. "They're carefully engineered and tested," Kline said.
"The world demand for these supplies had skyrocketed," Kline said. "We can't even meet the need for our health care facilities."
For the general public, cloth masks, although unregulated and untested but now recommended by the CDC, may have to be good enough, she said.
The key is to make sure the mask fits tightly, covers the lower part of the nose and entire mouth, and tucks under the chin and is securely fastened.
There should be no gaps, Kline said.
As the pandemic has swept the United States, a multitude of designs and free patterns for DIY face masks have popped up on the internet.
Michele Hoaglund, owner of Treadle Yard Goods in St. Paul, has partnered with the nonprofit Sew Good Goods, Allina and Blue Cross Blue Shield to churn out masks for health care workers from designs approved by Allina. Her shop, open only for curbside pickup, provides free kits to volunteers and includes tightly woven fabric for the outside of the mask, 100% cotton flannel for the inside and elastic -- if she has it in stock.
"People are doing this because it's something they can do," Hoaglund said.
That idea inspired Shannon Williamson, who has a University of Minnesota degree in apparel design and medical device innovation, to come up with her own design after consulting with experts, including engineers, physicians and material scientists.
The design includes a pocket to accommodate a filter -- even something as simple as a vacuum bag or coffee filter.
"The reason the N95 mask is so wonderful is because it's a tight fit," Williamson said. Her design allows for a tighter fit than many simpler designs.
"There's nothing wrong with many of those," she said. "The best mask is one that's worn."
Staff writer Christopher Snowbeck and the New York Times contributed to this report.

CONVENTIONAL MASKS vs. THE N95
An N95 respirator is a respiratory protective device designed to achieve a very close facial fit and very efficient filtration of airborne particles. Here's how it compares to a surgical mask:
Surgical mask
Loose-fitting fabric around edges. Provides protection from large droplets.
N-95 mask*
Fiber cup fits tighter around edges, metal band to form around the top of nose.
* The 'N95' designation means that when subjected to careful testing, the respirator blocks at least 95 percent of very small (0.3 micron) test particles. If properly fitted, the filtration capabilities of N95 respirators exceed those of surgical face masks. However, even a properly fitted N95 respirator does not completely eliminate the risk of illness or death.

Texto completo: When every other Democrat in America was swooning over Andrew Cuomo, Gina Raimondo was sparring with him.
I can’t say I’m surprised.
Raimondo, the second-term governor of Rhode Island, is blunt and sometimes contrarian. That’s what I’ve always liked about her.
I can’t say I like how she singled out New Yorkers, stopping cars with New York license plates at the border and ordering any drivers who planned to remain in Rhode Island for a while to quarantine themselves for 14 days. Cuomo, the New York governor, blew a gasket.
But I understood the epidemiological logic of it. The coronavirus was raging in New York. It wasn’t nearly as prevalent in Raimondo’s state. One strategy to limit a contagion is with checkpoints and barriers. She did on a state level what the United States was already doing with Americans returning from hot spots abroad.
The New York Daily News called her policy — which also involved having the National Guard visit and talk with people in vacation homes and rental properties where cars with New York plates were spotted — “authoritarian.” An editorial in The Providence Journal said it was “reminiscent of police states.”
There were rumors — false ones — that visitors were being turned back at the border.
And Cuomo threatened to sue.
That was last Saturday. Hours later, Raimondo changed course. But she didn’t let New Yorkers off the hook. She just gave us company there, decreeing that all out-of-state motorists would be treated the way New Yorkers were. That’s where things stand now.
It isn’t pretty. She conceded as much when we talked on the phone Wednesday night. But it’s necessary, she said, at least if she’s to honor her obligation to save as many Rhode Islanders as possible from death, illness and economic devastation.
“This is a different time,” she told me. “I was asked last week during my daily news conference, ‘Do you worry about the image that you’re creating with National Guardsmen knocking on doors of renters and stopping cars at the border?’ Absolutely! I care about civil liberties. I care about equal protection. I do not like that image.”
“Having said that,” she continued, “the image that I worry a lot more about is hospitals overflowing with people. I’m focused on outcomes, not optics. Regular politics and political considerations are out the window right now. Am I doing things that I would prefer not to and I’m uncomfortable with because we’re in a state of emergency? Absolutely. There’s no doubt about that.”
She told me that Cuomo’s ire didn’t prompt her policy revision; evolving data about infection rates in nearby states other than New York did. After she made the change last weekend, Cuomo quickly sent out an exultant tweet. She scoffed at it.
“If he feels it’s important for him to take credit, go ahead,” she said when asked about it at a news conference. “I will say I think it’s odd that Governor Cuomo is focused on this sort of politics at a time that we’re fighting disasters.”
I just hate it when my fellow Italian Americans squabble. And I hate that these two did, because they’re more alike than different, and they tell the same story, which is that everyone’s flying blind here. No one has a playbook.
It’s better to acknowledge the horror before us and take extraordinary (if imperfect) measures than to peddle misinformation and wallow in happy talk, which is what a certain denizen of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue has done.
“This is about acting quickly based on facts, acknowledging that your decisions have to change when the facts change and that when you move quickly, you do make mistakes, and you just have to correct them and move on,” Raimondo said.
So was the focus on New Yorkers a mistake — a needless stigmatization?
“Maybe,” she said. “I don’t know. I did it because Rhode Island is so close to New York and I was hearing from my constituents in coastal towns that they were really, really afraid because rental properties were being rented out at a rapid rate by New Yorkers.”
Many New Yorkers with means have indeed fled the city for less congested places where coronavirus infection rates are lower — for now.
“Here’s a thing I’ve learned,” she told me. “In uncertain times, there are no easy answers.”
Friends of mine in Rhode Island tell me that the state’s residents, including many who weren’t previously fond of Raimondo, have been impressed with and comforted by her.
They point to the steady flow of unvarnished information that she has provided, to how and when she closed schools and issued social-distancing directives, and to the energy with which she has up rounded up resources for a state that as of this writing had 711 confirmed cases of infected people and 14 deaths. (New York, in contrast, had 92,743 cases and 2,473 deaths.)
They praise her for her manner — sometimes tough, other times tender, almost always candid — at the daily news briefings that she, like Cuomo, holds. They say that she’s more popular than ever.
And while there’s no polling to support or refute that, there’s The Providence Journal Election Panel, a group of more than a dozen ideologically diverse Rhode Island voters who periodically weigh in on events. Asked several days ago to assign grades to Raimondo and Trump for their handling of the pandemic, most of them gave her an A and him, a C, D or F.
She’s also being validated by novelty clothing. A Providence gift shop named Frog & Toad has sold thousands of T-shirts that say “Knock It Off,” words that she has directed so often at Rhode Islanders who flout her distancing directives that they have become her signature catchphrase.
One of the owners of Frog & Toad, Asher Schofield, told The Boston Globe’s Edward Fitzpatrick: “We all need an Italian mother right now. Break out the wooden spoon.” (The shirts are sold only online, and some of the proceeds go toward coronavirus relief efforts.)
Raimondo, 48, told me that “Knock it off” was a frequent reprimand from her mother, 88, from whom she is staying away, as a precaution and an example.
“It’s hard for me not to see my mom,” she said. “I’m used to seeing her all the time.”
She added that it’s also hard being unable to go to her Roman Catholic parish.
“I had to call the bishop and say, ‘I’d like you to cancel Mass indefinitely,’” she marveled. “Whether it’s church or synagogue or mosque or whatever, all these things that you rely on for community and faith and grounding and structure are suddenly gone, and that’s what people are struggling through — all of us.”
At her news conference Thursday, she answered questions that she’d solicited from children in the state and spoke directly to them. She admonished those who, doing their lessons at home, might be slacking off.
“Teenagers, this is school,” she said. “Don’t get out of bed at 11 a.m. This is not time to chill out. This is real school. Do your work.”
But she also commiserated with the class of 2020.
“This stinks,” she said. “I know this isn’t the senior year you hoped to have. All I can say is I’m sorry. It’s really unlikely that you will have prom in the same way. But I promise you we will find new ways to celebrate your accomplishments and make sure you have some fun.”
It’s fascinating, in this era of profound political cynicism, to watch some public officials play such central roles in our lives, embrace such difficult judgment calls, and dole out terrible news and tentative reassurances in equal measure.
It’s just as fascinating to see the response. Polling in various states has shown remarkably high marks for the handling of the pandemic by governors such as Mike DeWine of Ohio, a Republican; Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, a Democrat; and of course, Cuomo.
Raimondo likes and respects Cuomo, she told me.
“He didn’t want his constituents to be singled out,” she said. “Very reasonable, I give him credit. He’s speaking up for New Yorkers. I’m sticking up for Rhode Islanders. And forget it. We moved on.”
She’s racing to set up field hospitals. She’s trying to figure out how to help all the desperate Rhode Islanders with shuttered businesses and lost jobs. It can be overwhelming.
“I will be very, very honest,” she said. “It goes in waves. You have waves where you think, ‘I’m on top of this. The system is working. We can do this.’ Then there’s the downside of the wave where you think, ‘Wow, this is so enormous, we have to do so much so quickly.’ But then you get right back on it. There’s no option to stop. There’s no option to stop.”

BUCKY PIZZARELLI: 1926-2020

Texto completo: Bucky Pizzarelli, who after many years as a respected but relatively anonymous session guitarist became a mainstay of the New York jazz scene in the 1970s, died Wednesday in Saddle River, New Jersey. He was 94.
Guitarist and singer John Pizzarelli, his son and frequent musical associate, said the cause was the coronavirus.
A master of the subtle art of rhythm guitar as well as a gifted soloist, Pizzarelli was sought after for recording sessions in the 1950s and '60s and can be heard on hundreds of records in various genres, although he was often uncredited. He also toured with Benny Goodman and was a longtime member of the "Tonight Show" orchestra. But he was little known to all but the most knowledgeable jazz fans until he was in his 40s.
When Johnny Carson moved "The Tonight Show" to California from New York in 1972, Pizzarelli stayed behind. He explained at the time that he did not want to uproot his four school-age children from their home in Upper Saddle River, New Jersey. Freed of the responsibilities of a regular job, he began performing more frequently in New York nightclubs.
Among those clubs was a midtown Manhattan spot appropriately named the Guitar, where he had already attracted attention in a duo with fellow guitarist George Barnes in 1970.
Reviewing one of their first performances, John S. Wilson of The New York Times wrote: "This is a brilliant and unique team. Mr. Barnes and Mr. Pizzarelli can be dazzling, and they can be sensuously brooding. They sparkle with excitement, leap with joy or relax with a warm romantic glow."
After Pizzarelli and Barnes parted ways in 1972, Pizzarelli began performing and recording in a variety of high-profile settings: unaccompanied, as the leader of small groups, as a sideman with leading jazz musicians like saxophonists Zoot Sims and Bud Freeman and violinists Stephane Grappelli and Joe Venuti.
In 1980, he began performing with a new duo partner: his son John, 20 at the time, who went on to become a jazz star in his own right.
The two Pizzarellis would perform and record together many times over the years, often joined by Pizzarelli's other son, Martin, a bassist, and vocalist Jessica Molaskey, John's wife.
John Pizzarelli once described them as "the von Trapp family on martinis." As John's star ascended, he frequently employed his father as a sideman.
Pizzarelli's sons survive him, as do his wife, Ruth (Litchult) Pizzarelli; two daughters, Anne Hymes and Mary Pizzarelli; and four grandchildren.
Pizzarelli was among the few guitarists (his son was another; George van Eps is believed to have been the first) to play an instrument with seven strings rather than the customary six. The extra string, tuned to a low A, enabled him to provide his own bass line, an important advantage when he played unaccompanied or in a duo setting.
John Paul Pizzarelli was born Jan. 9, 1926, in Paterson, New Jersey, where his parents owned a grocery store. Two uncles, Pete and Bobby Domenick, played guitar and banjo professionally.
His unlikely nickname was bestowed on him by his father, who as a teenager had decided to explore the Wild West he knew only from movies. He returned to New Jersey with a lot of memories and a lingering love for the West that would lead him to nickname his young son Buckskin. Shortened to Bucky, the name stuck.
Pizzarelli continued to perform into his 90s.
Reviewing a June 2017 performance at the Jazz Showcase in Chicago, Howard Reich of the Chicago Tribune praised Pizzarelli's "uncommonly sweet and delicate tone" and "disarmingly straightforward approach to melodic line."

UP ON THE TIGHTROPE WITH DR. FAUCI

Texto completo: By the middle of this week, more than a half-dozen special agents had been assigned to protect a 79-year-old immunologist against whatever tangible idiocy might bubble up from the ever-churning internet, where lies run laps around the world before the truth gets its pants on.
I doubt even the knuckle-draggers in the online conspiracy theorists hall of fame could intimidate Dr. Anthony Fauci, who is up on a tightrope in his every waking hour, balanced so delicately between the tenuous approval of President Donald Trump, always a candidate for next month's cover of Unscientific American, and the vast ocean of empirical virological evidence Dr. Fauci's spent a career curating and with which he hopes to save a nation.
Is Dr. Fauci ever haunted, in his few spare moments, of those ancient Leon Russell lyrics?
I'm up on a tightrope; one side's hate and one is hope.
Who would blame the man?
Dr. Fauci refused to comment the other day on the Trump Show, aka the daily briefing from the White House coronavirus task force, when asked about his heightened security.
"He doesn't need security," Mr. Trump blurted. "Everybody loves him."
Well, not everybody, at least certainly not online, where Dr. Fauci is seen in some circles as just another Deep State operative in the long-running conspiracy to bring down the president.
"Sorry liberals," went one tweet I saw Thursday, "but we don't trust Dr. Fauci."
Life and death is one thing. Owning the libs is still quite another.
The moment that sent the lunatics out to bay at the moon came on the March 20 episode of the Trump Show when Mr. Trump was introducing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. At one point, Mr. Trump said Mr. Pompeo needed to get back to the State Department, "or as they like to call it, the Deep State Department."
In the background, Dr. Fauci's left hand went slowly to his forehead, and that was seen almost universally as a sign of mockery by the far right, because clearly no one over the past month has had any legitimate reason to put their head in their hands.
Don't touch your face? Good luck.
Then someone went back a few years and found an instance where Dr. Fauci was complimentary of Hillary Clinton, and, well, I suppose now if I spent some time at it I could find a place online where COVID-19 is called the Hillary Virus.
To be sure, you can find pockets of Fauci criticism elsewhere on the cultural spectrum. You can find learned observers and even scientists who think Dr. Fauci has held onto the director's title at the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases through six administrations because he is as politically savvy as he is just plain brilliant.
Perhaps that's why, in all likelihood, Dr. Fauci's been able to push Mr. Trump hard toward scientific reality with plain language, all while staying on the tightrope.
"I can't jump in front of the microphone and push him down," Dr. Fauci said about the president's talent for spouting misinformation. "OK, he said it. Let's get it corrected for the next time."
Dr. Fauci got away with that one, but he said in an interview with Science Magazine only this week, "When you're dealing with the White House, sometimes you have to say things one, two, three, four times, and then it happens. So I'm going to keep pushing."
Mr. Trump, always the preening counter-puncher, won't take forever to push back, and that happens to be among the most ominous possibilities in the atmosphere at the moment. Experts who've tried to school Mr. Trump on cold reality haven't done well these last few years. Whether they're intelligence professionals, military men, lawyers, economists, climatologists, or even willing lickspittles like former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, they were never more than one presidential tantrum removed from dismissal.
Dr. Fauci might be among the most decorated immunologists of the 21st century, but Mr. Trump's idea of an expert is pretty much limited to his mirror.
"I know South Korea better than anybody," he said this week on the Trump Show. "Do you know how many people are in Seoul? Do you know how big the city of Seoul is? Thirty-eight million people."
Ooh. Missed it by just 28 million. There are less than 10 million people in Seoul. And no, he didn't mean the population of South Korea, which is close to 52 million. Wouldn't you expect more from someone who knows South Korea better than anyone?
This is the kind of willful ignorance Dr. Fauci sees from the tightrope. And yet he remains hopeful.
Asked how he thinks this dark period in history will be remembered on a New York Times podcast the other day, Dr. Fauci said this:
"I think it will be remembered (as) really showing what a great country we are. We have been through, as I've said, if you look at the history of our country, some extraordinary ordeals. I mean, world wars and diseases and depressions. And we've gotten through it. I have a great deal of faith in the spirit of the American people. We're resilient. We're going to get over this. And this is going to end."
Uh-huh. It will end a lot later if somebody pushes Dr. Fauci off that high wire.
I believe it was that same Leon Russell who said:
And the wire seems to be the only place for me
A comedy of errors and I'm falling
Like a rubber neck giraffe, you look into my past
Well, baby you're just too blind to see.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - As the coronavirus pandemic has all but shut down New York City, its subway - an emblem of urban overcrowding - has become almost unrecognizable, with overall ridership down 87%.
But even as officials crack down on gatherings in New York, removing hoops from basketball courts and sending police to break up parties, subway stations in poorer neighborhoods are still bustling, as if almost nothing has changed.
It is a striking turnabout for a system that has long been the great equalizer, a space where hourly workers jostled alongside financial executives. Now the subway has become more of a symbol of the city's inequality, amplifying the divide between those with the means to safely shelter at home and those who must continue braving public transit to preserve meager livelihoods.
"This virus is very dangerous. I don't want to get sick, I don't want my family to get sick, but I still need to get to my job," said Yolanda Encanción, a home health aide, as she waited for her train in the Bronx.
The station she uses is one of two in the Bronx that have largely retained their ridership and serve neighborhoods with some of the highest poverty rates in the city, a New York Times analysis found.
The 170th Street station in the University Heights neighborhood and the Burnside station in the Mount Eden area are surrounded by large Latin American and African immigrant communities where the median household income is about $22,000 - one-third the median household income in the state, according to census data.
Many residents say they have no choice but to pile onto trains with strangers, potentially exposing themselves to the virus. Even worse, a reduction in service in response to plunging ridership has led, at times, to crowded conditions, making it impossible to maintain the social distancing that public health experts recommend.
Across New York, nearly 66,500 people have tested positive for the coronavirus and 1,218 people have died, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said Monday. Most cases are concentrated in New York City, where over 36,000 people have tested positive.
Sitting on a bench at the 170th Street station, Encanción stretched a medical mask across her face and slipped her hands into latex gloves. The risk of exposure to the coronavirus on the subway is just part of the simmering anxiety that hangs like a backdrop to her everyday life.
Her two teenage children are desperate to see their friends, but she only allows them to leave the family's two-bedroom apartment for a walk with their aunt once a day.
Encanción's husband was a janitor at a private school until he was laid off after the school shut down, slashing her family's income in half. They have enough savings to cover this month's rent, but nothing more.
"Next month how will we pay? I can't even think about it," she said.
Encanción was one of the few passengers on her line on a recent weekday after ridership across the subway plunged nearly 90% compared with the same day last year, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the subway and buses.
Put differently, before the crisis erupted more than 5 million people squeezed onto the system everyday - today, it carries fewer than 1 million.
But a Times analysis of MTA data shows that ridership declines in each of the four boroughs served by the subway varies significantly and largely along socioeconomic lines.
Over the past two weeks, the steepest ridership declines have occurred in Manhattan, where the median household income is $80,000 - the highest of any of the city's five boroughs.
Subway ridership in Manhattan fell around 75%, while ridership in the Bronx, which has the highest poverty rate of any of the boroughs and the lowest median income at $38,000, dropped by around 55%, according to an analysis of data of Friday morning commutes through March 20.
The MTA has tried to protect its diminished ridership: It has deployed cleaners to disinfect train cars and buses every three days with the same disinfectants used in hospitals and nursing homes.
But hobbled by a growing number of workers falling sick and the free fall in ridership, the agency has cut subway service by 25%.
"Service is constrained by the number of crews we have available during this crisis - not surprisingly, absences are in the thousands," said Sarah Feinberg, interim president of New York City Transit.
As of Monday, seven MTA workers had died from the coronavirus while at least another 152 workers had tested positive, and 1,181 were quarantined, officials said. The chairman of the MTA, Patrick J. Foye, also has the infection.
Outside the 170th Street station, the streets are nearly empty. Most stores have shuttered, their metal security gates pulled closed. The only places open were two pharmacies, where lines of customers curled out the front doors.
A short ride on the No. 4 train is Burnside Avenue station. Every morning riders still stream onto its outdoor platforms.
The No. 4 train was among the lines where service was reduced, a policy that health officials warn could lead to packed trains and increase health risks for the essential workers, including health care employees, that need to ride them.
Still, for other riders, the possibility of contracting the coronavirus was the least of their concerns.
Daouda Ba, a 43-year-old immigrant from Senegal, sat hands tucked between his knees at the Burnside Avenue station.
Ba lives in a nearby shelter, where he says more than 50 men share three bathrooms. The idea of disinfecting doorknobs or even having hand sanitizer is laughable. Just getting time at the sink to wash his hands is hard enough.
"I'm already stuck in a crowded box in the shelter; I can't do anything for my health," he said, looking at the other people standing nearby. "The only thing I'm worried about is the economic stuff."
Ba was laid off from his job working for a sightseeing bus tour company at the end of December. His boss said they would hire him back by the end of March, but now his job prospects are as uncertain as ever.
On a recent morning, a friend had called with a small paying job: Someone was moving out of their apartment and needed a hand. He sat waiting for the train to take him to Brooklyn, the rin-tin-tin of light rain hitting the metal awning.
"If I die, I die," he said.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - Zoom, the videoconferencing app whose traffic has surged during the coronavirus pandemic, is under scrutiny by the office of New York's attorney general, Letitia James, for its data privacy and security practices.
On Monday, the office sent Zoom a letter asking what, if any, new security measures the company has put in place to handle increased traffic on its network and to detect hackers, according to a copy reviewed by The New York Times.
While the letter referred to Zoom as "an essential and valuable communications platform," it outlined several concerns, noting that the company had been slow to address security flaws such as vulnerabilities "that could enable malicious third parties to, among other things, gain surreptitious access to consumer webcams."
Over the last few weeks, internet trolls have exploited a Zoom screen-sharing feature to hijack meetings and do things like interrupt educational sessions or post white supremacist messages to a webinar on anti-Semitism - a phenomenon called "Zoombombing."
The New York attorney general's office is "concerned that Zoom's existing security practices might not be sufficient to adapt to the recent and sudden surge in both the volume and sensitivity of data being passed through its network," the letter said. "While Zoom has remediated specific reported security vulnerabilities, we would like to understand whether Zoom has undertaken a broader review of its security practices."
Zoom video meetings have quickly become a mainstay of communication for many during the stay-at-home orders of outbreak.

Texto completo: Headnote First-time recipients receive pandemic survival lessons
The cars arrived at the food bank in southern Dallas in a stream - a minivan, a Chevrolet Tahoe, a sedan with a broken window, a Jaguar of unclear vintage. Inside the vehicles sat people who could scarcely believe they needed to be there.
There was a landscaper, a high school administrator, a college student, and Dalen Lacy, a warehouse worker and 7-Eleven clerk.
Like 70% of those who showed up at Crossroads Community Services one day last week, Lacy had never been there before. But when the coronavirus pandemic drove the economy off a cliff, Lacy, 27 and a father of two, lost his warehouse job, and saw his hours at 7-Eleven slashed.
"Eve never had to actually do this," Lacy said after a gloved pantry worker hefted a box of food into the trunk of the car he was riding in with two neighbors. "But I've got to do what I've got to do for my kids."
By the hundreds of thousands, Americans are asking for help for the first time in their lives, from nail technicians in Los Angeles to airport workers in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and from bartenders in Phoenix to former reality show contestants in Minnesota. Biting back shame and wondering guiltily about others in more dire straits, they are applying for unemployment, turning to GoFundMe, asking for money on Instagram, quietly accepting handouts from equally strapped co-workers, and showing up in unprecedented numbers at food banks, which in turn are struggling to meet soaring demand as volunteers, many of them retirees, stay home for safety.
David Greenfield, chief executive of Met Council, a nonprofit that provides food and housing assistance in New York City, said that at first, "we saw retail workers, chefs and waiters, and restaurant owners."
By last week, he said, they were seeing employees from law firms: "Folks who in many cases were employed their entire lives."
In its unsparing breadth, the crisis is pitting two American ideals against each other-the e pluribus unum credo of solidarity and its near-religious devotion to the idea that hard work brings rewards. Those notions coexist peacefully in prosperous times.
Today, both are being put to the test, forcing the newly unemployed to reevaluate beliefs about themselves and their country.
In St. Louis Park, Minnesota, Scott Theusch, 61, a mechanic, filed for unemployment benefits for the first time, becoming one of the record-shattering 3.3 million people who made claims across the country in one week. He set aside his deeply felt conviction that people who had to seek the aid, which is largely funded by payroll taxes on employers, were not trying hard enough.
"There really isn't any option for people," Theusch said. "They're told not to show up for work, so what do you do?"
In Los Angeles, Samantha Pasaye, a 29-year-old nail technician, pleaded for donations on Instagram after the salon where she worked shut its doors. The request made her mother cry.
"I'm not someone who asks for help," Pasaye said. "I do everything by myself. But at this moment, I needed to put my pride aside."
Another new Dallas food-bank client, Adedyo Codrington, a trade-show worker and union steward, filed for unemployment as soon as his jobs were canceled on March 8. But the first check would not arrive in time.
So Codrington, 41, a father of two, went to the food bank, only to learn its supplies had run out. Humiliated, he tried again last week, arriving early. But people were already lined up around the block by then, and he left with a lone bag of green beans. Colleagues scrounged together $100 for him, but it is nearly gone, and he is down to eating just one meal a day, living off sugar water and what he calls "wish sandwiches" - two slices of bread with imaginary filling.
"To go from making $1,500 to $2,000 a week," he said, "to be reduced to this."
Even with America's long tradition of giving, from immigrant-aid groups begun by religious organizations in the 19th century to the politically polarizing social welfare programs born in the 20th, rugged individualism has remained a defining feature of the national identity. Perhaps no class of worker is more lionized today than the startup tech entrepreneur.
"A lot of people in the United States are very proud of feeling self-sufficient and independent," Alice Fothergill, a professor of sociology at the University of Vermont who has studied the human effects of natural disasters. "This is something that is definitely going to be very, very difficult."
She said that people who feel ashamed about seeking help are often the ones who need it the most. In one study of women who had endured devastating floods in North Dakota, she found that working-class and middle-class women were the ones who despaired most about needing public assistance, because of a fear of a loss of status. They did not want to be seen as poor. They also engaged in techniques to make it clear-to themselves and others - that they were accepting charity reluctantly, such as offering to pay for donated items and refusing to refer to their government-supplied trailers as "home."
Greenfield, of New York's Met Council, said the scores of people approaching his charity for the first time are roundly apologetic: "They're saying: 'I'm sorry but can you help me? I'm sorry but I need food, I'm sorry but I need rent, I'm sorry but I need help.'"
For people of some means, deciding whether to file for benefits also involves second-guessing. Does the fact that others are in greater need mean that they should not apply, even if they are qualified?
KirkDeWindt, 36, a personal trainer from Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, and a three-time contestant on "The Bachelor" television franchise, saw his business come to a halt after all in-person sessions had to be canceled. He has some savings, so when his mother urged him to apply for unemployment benefits, DeWindt hesitated.
"I'm in a more privileged situation than I would assume most that are filing," he said. "So what do you do with that?" He decided he would file.
The anonymity of the internet has helped some charity-seekers get over any shame, with restaurant and other business owners setting up online fundraising campaigns that keep their workers' names private. On GoFundMe, some $120 million has been donated for campaigns related to the pandemic since the first week in March, a spokeswoman said. By comparison, that is more than four times as much as campaigns for the Australian wildfires raised in three months.
But unlike natural disasters, the pandemic has hit a far greater swath of people hard, making it difficult for some to gin up help. And some campaigns have fallen short.
In Phoenix, Raven Green, a 28-year-old single mother of two young girls, turned to GoFundMe after losing all three of her jobs - bartending, promotional work and singing gigs - in less than a week.
Green was terrified. She had a few days' worth of groceries, but her car payment had wiped her out and she was not sure she qualified for benefits. She set up a GoFundMe page seeking $1,500 but, abashed at having to ask for help, could not bring herself to share it on social media. "I don't want people to know that I'm struggling like this," she said. As of Tuesday afternoon, the campaign had no donations.
The abrupt change in circumstances may perhaps be toughest for people who reordered their whole lives around the American dream: immigrants.
Ernst Virgile, 38, moved from Haiti with his wife in 2012, determined to work tirelessly. He held two jobs at the Fort Lauderdale airport, as a wheelchair attendant and in international arrivals customer support, and she worked in concessions. They saved painstakingly for a house, and bought one last year, where they are raising their three children, ages 7, 5 and 2. They were stunned when they both lost their jobs in March, and bereft.
Virgile's wife wept at the prospect of having to ask the bank to put their mortgage payments on hold. Virgile is still trying to figure out how to apply for food stamps and unemployment benefits, and fears seeking out food banks because of possible virus exposure. They had never before needed such assistance, and both, he said, are devastated.
"We're not used to it," Virgile said. "We knew before we got here that we had to work hard, very hard, to live the American dream. But we have to file unemployment. We have no choice. There's nothing we can do."

New York Times highlights critic of Trump’s coronavirus response and forgets to mentions she’s advising the Biden campaign

Texto completo: It is weird, the things that manage to slip through the cracks.

The New York Times on Friday published a detailed, lengthy report on the Trump administration's efforts to address shortages of crucial medical supplies, including masks and ventilators, as the COVID-19 pandemic makes its way across the continent.

Nearly as interesting as what the article says is what it does not say. Namely, the report fails to mention that a quoted critic of the administration’s move to ban exports of medical gear is also advising former Vice President Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign.

“Trump Seeks to Block 3M Mask Exports and Grab Masks from Its Overseas Customers,” reads the report’s headline. Its subhead adds, “The move would significantly expand the American government’s reach and reverse President Trump’s hesitant use of the Defense Production Act.”

The article concludes by quoting Jennifer Hillman of the Council on Foreign Relations, who says, “Export bans end up having an unintended negative effect on everybody’s ability to supply these goods. They’re a bad idea.”

Though the New York Times article is careful to highlight Hillman’s credentials as someone who is in a position to criticize export bans, making sure to note she a “senior fellow for trade and international political economy,” it declines to mention her affiliation with the presumptive Democratic nominee’s presidential campaign.

On Hillman’s Council on Foreign Relations bio page, it claims she is a senior adviser “providing outside informal counsel to the Biden for President Campaign.”

This seems like a relevant detail to mention, no? This seems worth mentioning especially as the New York Times gives Hillman the final word on whether the Trump administration’s export bans are a good idea or a bad idea.

It is true that Hillman appears only very briefly in a much larger, longer article. Still, it seems strange to end the report with her comments criticizing the current administration’s policies without also mentioning that she is involved with the campaign to unseat the current administration.

On coronavirus origins, a lot of people owe Tom Cotton an apology

Texto completo: When Republican Sen. Tom Cotton speculated that the coronavirus outbreak might have come out of a Chinese laboratory in Wuhan, he was roundly pilloried, mocked, and chastised by politicians and journalists.
But it turns out that Cotton might have been correct, and the very expert the media used to attack Cotton as some kind of conspiracy theorist now admits as much.
Cotton went on Fox Business on Feb. 16 and told Maria Bartiromo that he rejected the official story that the virus originated from Wuhan’s seafood market. “The virus went into that food market before it came out of that food market,” Cotton said, adding that “we don’t know where it originated.”
He said that “we have to get to the bottom of” where it came from.
That’s when Cotton brought up the Wuhan lab. “A few miles away from that food market is China's only biosafety level 4 superlaboratory that researches human infectious diseases. Now, we don't have evidence that this disease originated there, but because of China's duplicity and dishonesty from the beginning, we need to at least ask the question to see what the evidence says.”
New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie responded on Twitter, “Tom Cotton is one of the most irresponsible and dangerous people in federal office.”
The Washington Post rolled out a piece headlined “Tom Cotton keeps repeating a coronavirus conspiracy theory that was already debunked.” The Washington Post's lead: “Sen. Tom Cotton ... repeated a fringe theory suggesting that the ongoing spread of a coronavirus is connected to research in the disease-ravaged epicenter of Wuhan, China.”
Cotton had made similar comments weeks earlier, which were also greeted with mockery — as was his insistence that the coronavirus was a huge threat.
“I would note that Wuhan, the province where the ailment was first reported, has China’s only biosafety level 4 superlaboratory that works with the world’s most deadly pathogens to include, yes, coronavirus,” Cotton said before the committee.
“Don’t listen to Tom Cotton about coronavirus” was the HuffPost headline. Cotton’s crazy ideas, according to HuffPost senior reporter Nick Robins-Early, included calling for a massive response to battle the coronavirus, including a ban on travel from China. Cotton's other idea that needed to be ignored, according to HuffPost, was that the coronavirus could have come from a “superlaboratory that works with the world’s most deadly pathogens."
Many of Cotton’s critics attacked him by misrepresenting what he actually said. What's striking, though, is that so many different critics misrepresented his comments in the same exact way, as if they were all reading from the same talking points.
HuffPost wrote in late January that Cotton was suggesting “that the virus is the result of some sort of bioweapon or other manufactured cause,” yet they never could quote him asserting as much — because he didn't.
A Washington Post piece two weeks after the Fox Business appearance quoted Cotton suggesting the virus could have come out of the lab and then made the same jump HuffPost did: implying Cotton was calling the virus a deliberately engineered bioweapon.
“In response to Cotton’s remarks, as well as in previous interviews with The Washington Post, numerous experts dismissed the possibility the coronavirus may be man-made,” Washington Post health columnist Paulina Firozi wrote.
Throughout the pandemic, Eric Kleefeld at Media Matters for America has tirelessly tried to blur the two theories, the bioweapon theory and the came-from-a-lab theory, into one. And it seems he has convinced a lot of the media to follow his lead.
The New York Times and the Daily Beast performed this conflation.
Tweet
CBS then helped China weaponize (so to speak) this rampant U.S. media conflation. Twitterer @AGHamilton29 collected the conflators into a thread of shame.
This should be obvious, but I suppose it needs saying: Suggesting that a virus may have entered into human communities through a lab is not at all suggesting that it was man-made. As Cotton himself has said, researchers working on bats may have become infected or improperly disposed of waste.
These circumstances are entirely plausible, they are not crazy conspiracy theories, and they are exactly the sort of thing the authoritarian, imperialist government of China would cover up.
The theory is finally overcoming the fallacies of its objectors. David Ignatius of the Washington Post makes exactly that argument in his column.
Ignatius writes: "What’s increasingly clear is that the initial “origin story” — the virus was spread by people who ate contaminated animals at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan — is shaky."
Ignatius quoted the very same microbiologist, Richard Ebright, whom his colleague Firozi used to attack Cotton as a spreader of debunked conspiracy theories. Ebright had told Firozi, “There’s absolutely nothing in the genome sequence of this virus that indicates the virus was engineered” — which, of course, wasn’t what Cotton was charging.
Ebright told Ignatius, “The first human infection … could have occurred as a laboratory accident, with, for example, an accidental infection of a laboratory worker.”
Ignatius continued: “He noted that bat coronaviruses were studied in Wuhan at Biosafety Level 2, ‘which provides only minimal protection,’ compared with the top BSL-4.”
With Ignatius’s column and with increasing suspicion that the virus did not come from the Wuhan seafood market, the idea that the virus accidentally came out of that lab may seamlessly move from “fringe opinion” to respectable — even to consensus.
The first question should be whether the folks who attacked that notion in February will explain why they were unwilling to consider it. I think we all know the answer to that one.
The more important question is whether we can get to the bottom of it. China is so secretive and so controlling that we may never get that answer.

Texto completo: Would you do us a favor? Would you be willing to describe how the coronavirus is affecting your mental health? Is the combination of isolation and existential stress making you feel more depressed and anxious? Or is the family togetherness and the pause from normal life giving you a greater sense of belonging and equilibrium? How would you describe your psychological state? What are you doing to cope? If you’re a mental health worker, what are you seeing out there?
If you’re willing to share, please email me your answers at opinioncomments@nytimes.com. The Times may publish some responses online, and I’ll write another column reporting on what you say.
I ask for a couple of reasons. This is a moment that calls for deeper conversations and emotional accompaniment. We’re all going through something together. We’ll be more resilient if we can see others experiencing it in the same way.
Also, it’s hard to get an accurate read on the nation’s psychological state right now. On the one hand, this has become a wonderful moment of national solidarity. Millions are responding with acts of generosity, finding ways to bring food to elders, hosting virtual cocktail parties. People are checking in with each other. You hear of these 50-person family reunion Zoom calls.
Our national identity is being remade in real time. What had once seemed a bitter and divided society now seems more like a nation of people finding creative ways to show up for one another.
But it’s also likely that something much darker is going on, especially among the less fortunate. A study by Samantha Brooks of King’s College London finds that quarantine produces a range of bad mental health outcomes, including trauma, confusion and anger.
There’s an invisible current of dread running through the world. It messes with your attention span. I don’t know about you, but I’m mentally exhausted by 5 p.m. every day, and I think part of the cause is the unconscious stress flowing through us.
Many people are alone, consuming media all day. Others are trapped in homes with abusers and dysfunction. Alcohol and drug use is rising. In France, reported cases of domestic violence are up by about a third.
Tyler Norris of the Well Being Trust points to a curve behind the COVID-19 curve. Every one-percentage-point increase in unemployment leads eventually to a 3.5% increase in opioid addiction, so the pandemic’s economic effects alone will exacerbate our drug and mental health problems down the road.
Psychological health in times of crisis is like a wrestling match. The situation throws stressors at you. The question is whether your coping mechanisms are strong enough to overcome them.
The pandemic spreads an existential feeling of unsafety, which registers in the neurons around your heart, lungs and viscera. It alters your nervous system, changing the way you see and perceive threat.
It’s very hard to grasp what’s going on so deep inside. “All trauma is preverbal,” Dr. Bessel van der Kolk writes in his book “The Body Keeps the Score.” “Rational brain is basically impotent to talk the emotional brain out of its own reality.”
The best way to combat this visceral sense of fear and disassociation is by having what Bonnie Badenoch, the author of “The Heart of Trauma,” calls “disconfirming experiences.” These are experiences of deep reciprocal attunement with others that make you feel viscerally safe.
These moments of attunement and co-regulation register in the same autonomic nervous system and overcome the fear and helplessness.
Creating these experiences takes effort. “Being together is not the same as being connected,” Columbia professor Martha Welch told me. She recommends that people engage in deep intentional and vulnerable conversations, in which they pause — for as long as 90 seconds — after something important has been said, just to let it sink in. “You have to have the feelings conversation,” she says.
She and the other experts I spoke with endorse anything rhythmic. Anything that will create an experience of attunement: singing, dancing, yoga, deep eye contact, daily rituals and games.
I asked the experts whether they thought it was possible to have this sort of deep, visceral attunement over the internet. They thought it was, as long you can see the other person’s face and hear vocal tone. “The internet is a huge variable in this pandemic,” van der Kolk told me. “We have a profound new way to comfort one another.”
Anna Freud’s famous research found that during World War II the children left in London to endure the bombings suffered less trauma than the children who were sent away from their families to the country for their “safety.” She determined that the physical injury is often not the harshest part of trauma; it’s the breakdown of relationships during and after.
Sharing your emotional state with the world is not for everybody, and people who feel fragile should take care. But if you feel like emailing your experience, you may give others somebody to relate to. You might help turn a fractious country into a resilient community.

Texto completo: Early Monday morning the email arrived. The subject line began, “ALARM AT THE GATE,” written in all caps. Someone had died. That is always what that phrasing means.
The message came via a group email list maintained by the fraternity I joined in college some 30 years ago.
A younger member, a rising chef in his 30s, had died. As the email read, he passed away “due to immune system complications resulting from contracting the COVID-19 virus as a Type-1 diabetic.” He was in Detroit, which has emerged as a hot spot for the virus.
This was the third death I’d heard about of someone with a connection to my college or a friend who went there. All relatively young, all black men, all diabetics. The two others were in New Orleans, another emerging hot spot.
I recalled an arresting article I’d read from “Undark,” a Knight Foundation-funded, science-oriented digital magazine in Cambridge, Massachusetts. (I’m on the advisory board of the magazine.) As the article pointed out, the virus may prove most devastating in the South because of “poorer health, curbed health care access and skepticism of government.”
What the article doesn’t state outright, but I read in the subtext, was that the virus is more likely to be deadly to black people. Most black people in America still live in the South. The states with the highest percentage of black people are in the South.
We may be waiting for a racial time bomb to explode with this disease.
In the early days of the virus, the relatively few cases on the African continent, I believe, gave black people in America a false sense of security, that black people may be somehow less susceptible to it.
But that is not true, and African Americans should not look to Africa as the model. Even as researchers worry about Africans’ vulnerabilities — some being the same issues that exist in the American South — African countries also have advantages that America and, in particular, African Americans don’t.
As Berkeley economist Edward Miguel explained, “The median age in a lot of countries is 20 or 18, much younger than in Europe, and it appears that young people who are infected are often asymptomatic or just get a cold.” The median age in the United States is 38. Furthermore, some African nations have a medical infrastructure experienced in dealing with pandemics, and in many cases people still live in rural areas.
But what is most worrisome is the racial disparity in prior health conditions that exist in the United States. As Bloomberg reported about a study of the deaths in Italy: “Almost half of the victims suffered from at least three prior illnesses, and about a fourth had either one or two previous conditions. More than 75% had high blood pressure, about 35% had diabetes and a third suffered from heart disease.”
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, high blood pressure is most common in non-Hispanic black adults (54%), and black people have the highest death rate from heart disease.
As for diabetes, the 2015 National Medical Association Scientific Assembly, held in Detroit, where my friend died, delivered these stark statistics:
“African American patients are more likely than white patients to have diabetes. The risk of diabetes is 77% higher among African Americans than among non-Hispanic white Americans. The rates of diagnosis of diabetes in non-Hispanic African Americans is 18.7% compared to 7.1%.”
The group went on to say that in 2006, “African Americans with diabetes were 1.5 times more likely to be hospitalized and 2.3 times more likely to die from diabetes than non-Hispanic whites.”
In addition, many Southern states refused to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, and there is a rural hospital crisis in this country. But that crisis is compounded in the South, where, as the magazine Facing South points out, the rural areas “have higher poverty rates, higher mortality rates, and lower life expectancies than other rural regions of the country.”
This all worries me, because I take a lesson from the HIV/AIDS crisis. In the beginning, it was largely seen as a New York and San Francisco problem affecting white men who were gay. Over the decades, treatments became available, and those cities saw their new infection rates plummet.
But the disease remained very much alive, particularly in the South, particularly among black people, where it has reached epidemic proportions. In the United States, more than 40% of people living with HIV and 40% of people with new infections are black, according to the CDC, and “African American men accounted for three-quarters of new HIV infections among African Americans in 2016, and 80% of these were among African American gay and bisexual men.”
Black people were already suffering through an epidemic, one with treatments that could have arrested it, and yet it rarely made the news.
We know that if a person is under treatment and the HIV is well controlled, meaning undetectable, there is “effectively no risk” of transmitting the virus. We also know that drugs can be taken to prevent contracting the disease.
But here, the connection must be made with that refusal to expand Medicaid. As the Kaiser Family Foundation has pointed out: “Medicaid beneficiaries with HIV are more likely to be male (56% vs. 42%), black (50% vs. 22%) and between the ages of 45-64 (54% vs. 13%) than the Medicaid population overall.”
On some level, HIV is ravishing the South because Southern states have made a policy decision not to care in a sufficient way because the people suffering are poor and black.
And many of these people are also vulnerable to this new virus, as Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House’s coronavirus response coordinator, said at a news conference a couple of weeks ago. “We are all very worried about” long-term survivors of HIV, many of whom “still carry a level of immune-compromise,” she noted.
I don’t want that to be the future of COVID-19 and black America.
The problem we have now is that we don’t see the racial demographic data for this virus.
I echo the concerns of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Rep. Ayanna Pressley and others who wrote Friday to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services:
“The CDC is currently failing to collect and publicly report on the racial and ethnic demographic information of patients tested for and affected by COVID-19. Our concerns echo those from some physicians: that decisions to test individuals for the novel coronavirus may be ‘more vulnerable to the implicit biases that every patient and medical professional carry around with them,’ potentially causing ‘black communities and other underserved groups … (to) disproportionately mis(s) out on getting tested for COVID-19.’ ”
The letter went on: “Although COVID-19 does not discriminate along racial or ethnic lines, existing racial disparities and inequities in health outcomes and health care access may mean that the nation’s response to preventing and mitigating its harms will not be felt equally in every community.”
I have been communicating with my niece, Cortney, a nurse on the front lines of the crisis in Louisiana. (She’s actually my niece’s half-sister, but my brothers and I have always called her our niece as well.)
She has seen racial disparities in treatments but also black people being hit particularly hard by the disease, something that she says others in the state are also seeing. As she messaged me: “I can’t speak for the U.S. as a whole, but in the South, particularly Louisiana, we are seeing more black cases that aren’t responding well to the virus.”
We need data to know if her observations are anomalous or endemic.
People like to say “we’re all in this together,” but black people have every right to respond, “but will we all emerge from it together?”

Texto completo: Over a normal two-week period we’d expect around half a million U.S. workers to file claims for unemployment insurance. Over the past two weeks we’ve seen almost 10 million filings. We’re facing an incredible economic catastrophe.
The question is whether we’re ready to deal with this catastrophe. Alas, early indications are that we may be handling fast-moving economic disaster as badly as we handled the fast-moving pandemic that’s causing it.
The key thing to realize is that we aren’t facing a conventional recession, at least so far. For now, most job losses are inevitable, indeed necessary: They’re a result of social distancing to limit the spread of the coronavirus. That is, we’re going into the economic equivalent of a medically induced coma, in which some brain functions are temporarily shut down to give the patient a chance to heal.
This means that the principal job of economic policy right now isn’t to provide stimulus, that is, to sustain employment and GDP. It is, instead, to provide life support — to limit the hardship of Americans who have temporarily lost their incomes.
[Read complete coronavirus coverage here .]
There is, to be sure, a strong risk that we’ll have a conventional recession on top of the induced coma; more on that in subsequent columns. But for now, the focus should be on helping those in need.
The good news is that the $2 trillion CARES Act (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act) Congress passed last week does, on paper, provide a lot of economic life support. The bad news is that it looks as if it could be weeks, maybe even months, before serious amounts of money flow to those who need aid right now.
Journalists keep referring to the CARES Act as a “stimulus package,” but mainly it’s disaster relief. The best piece of the legislation — which, by the way, Democrats forced unwilling Republicans to include — is a major enhancement of unemployment benefits. Not only will laid-off workers get much more than they normally would, but many workers who weren’t previously covered by unemployment insurance, such as freelancers and independent contractors, are supposed to receive full benefits.
The legislation also provides loans to small businesses — loans that will be forgiven, that is, turned into straight subsidies, if businesses use the money to maintain their payrolls.
Both of these programs are very good ideas. The trouble is that both are having a hard time getting started — and time is one thing millions of distressed Americans, many of whom were already living on the edge, don’t have.
On unemployment benefits: State unemployment offices, already overwhelmed by the surge in applications, aren’t ready to disburse these extra benefits, and may not be ready for quite a while — a disastrous delay for families already in dire financial straits.
Small-business loans are also facing a crippling lag in processing, with potential borrowers either unable to complete the forms or being told that they will have to wait three weeks. Furthermore, for some reason the federal government, instead of lending money directly, is channeling small-business lending through private banks — and the banks are complaining that they have yet to receive crucial guidelines and that the administration is setting unworkable requirements.
In other words, it may be a long time before the economy starts getting the life support it needs right away.
And even when workers and businesses finally get the promised aid, the CARES Act doesn’t provide remotely enough money to state and local governments, which are seeing revenues plunge and expenses soar. This is likely to force big cuts in government services precisely when they’re needed most.
So what do we need right now? First, we need an all-hands-on-deck effort to resolve the bottlenecks that are holding up unemployment benefits and small-business loans.
The obvious parallel here is to the crash of healthcare.gov when the Affordable Care Act was first going into effect; things looked terrible at first, but an Obama administration expert task force, working around the clock, resolved the problems more quickly than anyone imagined possible, and new enrollments ended up exceeding expectations.
I don’t see any reason, in principle, a similar effort couldn’t rescue the CARES Act. But here’s the thing: We’re talking about the Trump administration, which disdains expertise of every kind, and in which every effort somehow ends up being directed by Jared Kushner.
Second, we need another relief bill to fill the holes in the CARES Act, especially inadequate aid to state and local governments.
But will Republicans be willing to provide that aid? Donald Trump is talking, as he has many times before, about a giant infrastructure bill. But Senate Republicans are notably unenthusiastic. And although going big on infrastructure is a good idea, right now it’s less pressing than providing aid to states facing huge budget gaps.
And going back to the bill that Congress already passed: I’m fairly sure that we’ll eventually get the kinks worked out. But when you’re losing 6 million jobs a week, “eventually” isn’t good enough.

Texto completo: Doctors and nurses responding to the COVID-19 pandemic are the superheroes of our age, putting themselves at risk to save the lives of others.
At least 61 doctors and nurses have died from the coronavirus in Italy so far. Already, in New York City alone, two nurses have died and more than 200 health workers are reported sick at a single major hospital.
These superheroes are at risk partly because we sometimes send them into battle without adequate personal protective equipment, or PPE. This should be a national scandal, and now hospitals are compounding the outrage by punishing staff members who speak up or simply try to keep themselves safe.
In Bellingham, Washington, an emergency room physician, Dr. Ming Lin, pleaded on social media for better protections for patients and the staff at PeaceHealth St. Joseph Medical Center, where he had worked for 17 years.
“I do fear for my staff,” Lin warned. “Morally, I think when you see something wrong, you have to speak out.”
The hospital responded by terminating Lin.
Lin told me that he had no regrets, but he asked supporters not to circulate petitions on his behalf for fear that such an effort would distract from managing the pandemic.
Charles Prosper, the CEO of the hospital network, wouldn’t take my call, although he said in a statement that he regretted losing “such a long-standing and talented member of our medical staff.” The PeaceHealth board should recognize that its hospital has more need for an experienced ER doctor than for a bungling CEO.
Hospitals sometimes discourage staffers even from bringing their own protective gear, for fear of scaring patients or leaving other employees feeling unprotected. In New York City, Dr. Ania Ringwelski, an ER physician, was concerned by what she felt was insufficient PPE supplied by Weill Cornell Medical Center, so last week she obtained her own.
“I want to help out, but I need to feel protected,” Ringwelski told me. “I’m not expecting the hospital to provide it in this time of shortage, but if I can procure it on my own, then I’d like to be able to wear it.”
The hospital refused to allow this and sent her home. Her future is unclear.
Weill Cornell told me in a statement that it issues “appropriate” PPE and that it can’t allow doctors to bring their own “of unknown provenance and safety.” That’s a pretty patronizing way for hospital executives to treat professionals who are risking their lives.
In Chicago, a nurse, Lauri Mazurkiewicz, warned colleagues that standard face masks distributed by the hospital were not safe. She brought in her own higher-grade N95 mask — and was fired by Northwestern Memorial Hospital. She is now suing the hospital, which declined to comment except to tell me that its practices are safe.
In Texas, my New York Times colleague Matt Richtel reported on an anesthesiologist, Dr. Henry Nikicicz, who in effect was suspended without pay because he wore a mask in public places in the hospital. The hospital relented after it was asked for comment.
Tension arises not only because of shortages of PPE but also because of uncertainty about how much protection is optimal. No one knows. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has given conflicting advice, and other countries have varying standards. Singapore avoided infections with modest PPE, while Chinese doctors and nurses now use full-body coverings much more substantial than the protective clothing in the U.S.
Meanwhile, American health workers see colleagues falling sick. At Weill Cornell, a former ER doctor is now fighting for her life on a ventilator.
“We’re seeing our fellow caregivers getting sick, and we’re stressed out,” said another Weill Cornell emergency room physician, who feared being fired if his name were published. “Within one morning, I saw a gastroenterologist, an internist, a nurse and a pulmonologist” — he was talking about his patients — “and you want to protect yourself.”
It’s baffling that the richest country in the history of the world fails so abysmally at protecting its health workers, especially when it had two months’ lead time. And for hospitals now to retaliate against health workers who try to protect themselves — ousting them just when they are most needed — is both unconscionable and idiotic.
On websites like allnurses.com, nurses wonder whether they can refuse to work because of inadequate PPE or even whether they should quit the profession.
The doctors, nurses, technicians and cleaning staff members on the front of this pandemic deserve our eternal gratitude. Instead, we’re betraying them: They have our back, but we don’t have theirs.
“We still don’t have enough masks; we still don’t have enough gowns,” said a resident at a New York hospital who asked not to be named for fear of being punished. “Our necks are exposed, our hair is exposed, and our colleagues are getting sick.
“Many of my colleagues are making wills, and they’ve sent their families away. People are scared and rightfully so. We see it every day. We see the COVID people coming in, short of breath and dying right in front of us.”

Texto completo: The albatross hanging from every arts reporter' neck is the stack of untouched books sitting on their desk, on a shelf, or shamefully hidden away in the closet farthest from them. Sent in from authors, agents and publishers it is the combined weight of all these unwritten about books that (I assume) will one day drag my soul to the depth of the River Styx.
I'm not saying it's a silver lining, far from it, but with the coronavirus forcing most events to shut down or cancel, we are all now going to have a lot more time on our hands for literary pursuits. With no upcoming festivals or performances to profile, now is the perfect time to let readers know what is on the reading agenda for the next week, or month or longer interval before society as we know it returns to some semblance of normalcy.
Some of these books I've read most or all of, others I haven't read at all. But none of them have been covered in depth by the Press-Citizen heretofore.
'Afterlife' by Julia Alvarez Genre: Fiction
Length: ~250 pages
From the author of "In the Time of Butterflies" is a new novel for adults. "Afterlife" is a novel about immigrant and English teacher Antonia Vega who is hit with a trio of problems at once. Her husband dies, her sister goes missing and an undocumented and pregnant teenager appears at her doorstep.
This is the kind of book I'd love to cover, but Alvarez's scheduled tour dates and tours sent with the book will not bring her through Iowa City. The book, a roughly 250-page affair, is scheduled for release on April 7, 2020.
'All the Flowers in Paris' by Sarah Jio Genre: Fiction
Length: ~ 300 pages
A novel that switches between a pair of perspectives, one of which is Caroline, who wakes up with no memory in a Paris hospital in 2009. The other is Celine, a woman in Nazi-occupied Paris in 1943. The story follows both women as they try to make sense of their respective situations: Caroline who gradually pieces together who she is and Celine who needs to try to
Not necessarily the kind of book I myself would be on the edge of my seat to read, but I can think of a half dozen friends I'd recommend this to by description alone. Plus, an aspect of Caroline's character is discovering she's had a "reclusive life in a sprawling apartment on the rue Cler," which — at this moment —sounds like the exact situation I'd like to be living in (at least for the next few weeks).
'An American Bum in China' by Tom Carter Genre: Biography
Length: ~125 pages
A brief biography following five years with Muscatine native Matthew Evans as he finds himself in China in 2014 as the Hong Kong protests were just beginning. Evans' tale is told by Tom Carter who previously published "Unsavory Elements: Stories of Foreigners on the Loose in China."
Initially, I'd planned to run a review of the book back in December that didn't end up finding its way to print. It was a topical read at the time with the Hong Kong protests in the news cycle and — while Hong Kong hasn't been the focus of recent coverage — China's arguably in the news cycle even more now than it was then.
'Bedlam' by Kenneth Paul Rosenberg, MD Genre: Nonfiction
Length: ~200 pages
The full title of the text is "Bedlam: An Intimate Journey Into America's Mental Health Crisis." Rosenberg's book is intended to give readers an inside look at the American mental health system and its failings. After seven years of interviews, the book uses those accounts to shine a light on the criminalization of individuals with mental health issues among other topics.
This book and the author behind it are the exact kinds of things I love to cover. When it was first delivered to our office I showed it to everyone in the newsroom. The only reason why it's not pending on my personal reading list is I'm not sure I have the emotional fortitude to read about institutional, systemic failure, especially at this particular moment.
'Bloody Genius' by John Sanford Genre: Mystery
Length: ~375 pages
This is the most recent Virgil Flowers novel from New York Times bestselling author John Sanford, marking the 12th novel in a series that started in 2007 with "Dark of the Moon." In this particular book, a culture war on a state campus between the science and medical departments is interrupted when a scholar turns up dead. Enter the series investigator Virgil Flowers, tasked with finding the killer.
While this title was briefly alluded to in my write-up on the 2019 Iowa City Book Festival, it didn't end up receiving full coverage, even though Sanford is a Cedar Rapids native and University of Iowa grad. This fell by the wayside for me at the time partly because of my own ignorance of Sanford being a local name and the sheer volume of events surrounding the book festival.
'Deacon King Kong' by James McBride Genre: Historical Fiction
Length: ~375 pages
Set in September of 1969, "Deacon King Kong" starts with the deacon of Five Ends Baptist Church shooting a 19-year-old-drug dealer in the face in South Brooklyn. The release that came with the book touts it as being infused with "humor and compassion" as it explores the lives of the fictional characters around this incident.
I've had a copy of this book so long and I've wanted to read it so bad! As if to taunt me Penguin Random House sent me a second copy which I also have not read.
I'm positive I'll get around to this once I work through my personal pending backlog of unread books, but like Entertainment Weekly and The New York Times, this book is high on my to-read list and can make it to yours too since it was released on March 3.
'The Dearly Beloved' by Cara Wall Genre: Fiction
Length: ~350 pages
The story of this novel spent 15 years coming into focus for its author, Iowa Writers' Workshop graduate Cara Wall, who first conceived of the novel during her 2004 pregnancy. The book focuses on a pair of couples, each of which includes an individual drawn to the Christian faith and another who is skeptical of it.
This is another novel I had planned to write a review of. First, before it's Aug. 13, 2019 publication and then before Wall's Sept. 23 visit to Prairie Lights. Though outside my general area of interest, it's one I feel strangely drawn to and would like to pick up and finish someday.
'Everywhere You Don't Belong' by Gabriel Bump Genre: Fiction
Length: ~250 pages
This is the first novel from the Chicago originating author Gabriel Bump, an experience explored in this novel through the character of Claude McKay, a young black man growing up on the South Side.
This is another book on my personal reading list and comes recommended by numerous other publications. it represents yet another instance of not enough local connections for me to cover.
'Hey Grandude!' by Paul McCartney, Illustrated by Kathryn Durst Genre: Picture Book
Length: ~ 30 pages
I think there are only two reasons I haven't read or reviewed this book: First, world-renowned singer/songwriter Paul McCartney has not had a book tour through Iowa City promoting it. Second, I don't know that I could justify a picture book review to my editor as the 4- to 6-year-old age range does not make up a huge amount of our readership.
But now I can, so here's my one-paragraph review:
As a book about a bunch of kids stuck inside who turn to their grandude to entertain them, I think this book will resonate with kids in this very specific moment in time. While the plot is somewhat aimless, it's a fun read with pretty illustrations that takes its characters to the beach, to the American West and to the mountainside. All through the aid of a magic compass.
'The Mountains Sing' by Nguyen Phan Que Mail Genre: Historical Fiction
Length: ~350 pages
The 11th book from Nguyen Phan Que Mai, "The Mountains Sing" follow the Tran family as they navigate their way through a Vietnam wrapped in War. The most recent addition to my ever-growing work shelf of unread books, "The Mountains Sing" will have been published just before this article runs. I have never read this book, but, for what it's worth, it comes with my highest recommendation.
'One Night At the Lake' by Bethany Chase Genre: Fiction
Length: ~275 pages
The jacket description of this book pitches two straight forward premises. The first: Leah has been dating Ollie for four years and, upon being invited to his family's lake house, she suspects he's going to propose. The second: June is visiting her fiance's Ollie's lake house, "a house haunted by long-buried memories of her lost friend" Leah.
If this wasn't the first novel that hit my desk after I started at the P-C last year, it's one of the first. But I'd completely forgotten about it until I started putting this list together. It's not usually the kind of thing I'd go for, but if the description appeals to you, it strikes me as the kind of book that would be a pleasant distraction during turbulent times.
'Pitty the Reader' by Kurt Vonnegut and Suzanne McConnel Genre: Nonfiction
Length: ~375 pages
Half of this book's authorship is renowned author Kurt Vonnegut, the other half is Suzanne McConnell who was a student of Vonnegut's at the Iowa Writers' Workshop. The latter has collected everything she can about what Vonnegut as a teacher regarding the craft of writing.
I seem to have a problem with not reading books by Kurt Vonnegut. I've been told I'd love "Slaughterhouse-Five," which has nonetheless been gathering dust on my personal shelf for ages. Of all the books on my P-C shelf though, this is maybe the one I was most hoping to read most of all, and was only reminded of as I started to put together this list.
'Real Life' by Brandon Taylor Genre: Fiction
Length: ~325 pages
This is a story about an Alabama-born protagonist, Wallace, and his navigating of his sexuality and self-preservation while at a Midwestern university. Author Brandon Taylor is a staff writer Literary Hub and a graduate of the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop. He read from this book at Prairie Lights in February.
Sometimes I like to imagine alternate realities. While putting this article together, I wonder if the version of me that's read all these books is a happier person. I feel like he is. I feel like he's somehow more attractive too. Yet, despite being interested and having months of notice, I slept on this book and ended up not writing any local coverage.
If you're interested in reading, this is your chance to not be like this realities me. Be like alternate-universe, happy/handsome me.
'These Boys and Their Fathers' by Don Waters Genre: Memoir
Length: ~250 pages
A 2010 mission self-set by author Don Waters was "to write a magazine story about a surfing icon who had known his absentee father"." That resulted in the investigative and introspective memoir we have today.
The book was published by the University of Iowa Press last year and Waters was another attendee of the Iowa City Book Festival who went uncovered by the P-C. From the very little I've read, the books seems to be in a similar vein as "The Glass Castle" by Jeannette Walls.
'Time After Time' by Lisa Grunwald Genre: Fiction
Length: ~400 pages
The release for this one pitches this love story as a fusion of "The Time Traveler's Wife" and "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button." Joe is a railroad man and Nora is an aspiring artist who discover's she is stuck, in a very real sense, in Grand Central Terminal by a force she doesn't understand. The narrative charts the relationship between the two over roughly a decade.
God, I love the cover and title of this book. Yet another example of a text I'm not particularly inclined toward that I can't help but want to read whenever it catches my eye. Once again we see a character who is stuck in a place and, maybe it's just because of the time and place we're all currently stuck in, but that resonates.
'Surfside Sisters' by Nancy Thayer Genre: Fiction
Length: ~300 pages
Protagonist Keely Green grew up in Nantucket with her best friend, Isabelle, with dreams of becoming a novelist. Years later she's achieved those dreams and is living the glamorous big city life of a successful New York novelist. Her dream life is interrupted by the one-two punch of her editor passing on her novel and her mom's health declining, forcing her to return to Nantucket to things she thought she'd put behind her.
Technically I have two Nancy Thayer books on my desk. (This and "Let It Snow" a Christmas themed novel.) But coverage for one of them felt like enough for our purposes here. I don't know much about Thayer, but going through the press releases included with her work here I've discovered she's famous for capturing the "natural beauty" of Nantucket. So for those of you stuck inside and wishing you were somehow in Nantucket, Thay surely has a book for you.
'When You Learn the Alphabet' by Kendra Allen Genre: Nonfiction
Length: ~150 pages
A book of essays focusing on the parental relationships of author Kendra Allen, this shortish book touches on a wide array of topics. Marriage, race, mental health and feminism are just a few of the themes interwoven throughout the book.
Like "Bloody Genius" this is one I didn't get a chance to cover in full because of the local event relating to it being positioned during the local literary festival. That said I've only heard good things and if someone demanded why I hadn't read this yet I would probably mutter something about "having a lot on my plate" and then failing to go to sleep because I'm questioning internally why I haven't read this book.

Texto completo: I confess to a certain self-interest in today's column. The media, especially newspapers, are in trouble. Conservatives like myself have been relentless in attacking their collective bias over the years, but as more of them fold or reduce staff, it is crucial the institution be saved.
Margaret Sullivan, a columnist for The Washington Post, has suggested that federal bailout money should be allocated to newspapers. That is an amusing suggestion since the world's richest man, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, owns the Post. He could infuse some of his own money to prop up that reliably liberal paper.
In an age when fewer schoolchildren are taught civics, it is useful to recall that the press is the only profession mentioned in the Constitution's First Amendment, which specifically forbids Congress from "abridging" freedom of the press.
The Founders were aware of newspapers' tendency to print inaccurate, even outrageous, stories, but as Benjamin Franklin noted: "I am...for freedom of the press, and against all violations of the constitution to silence by force and not by reason the complaints or criticisms, just or unjust, of our citizens against the conduct of their agents."
Newspapers then - and one could argue since, along with modern television - have been full of factual errors, innuendo and slanted coverage (check out the corrections section of The New York Times over the years, and those are only the mistakes they admit to), but no country has a freer press than the United States. Notice that the first entities totalitarians seek to shut down or take over are newspapers and television stations, which ought to tell us something.
In a lengthy Vanity Fair article titled "Can the News Industry Survive Coronavirus," Charlotte Klein, quotes New York Times media columnist Ben Smith, who advocates "a painful but necessary shift" for saving the news business.
Mr. Smith writes, "Abandon most for-profit local newspapers whose business model no longer works, and move as fast as possible to a national network of nimble new online newsrooms."
Facebook has pledged $100 million to help struggling news outlets weather the financial storm caused in part by advertisers not buying ads because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Financial subsidies are only a partial solution, like quitting smoking but refusing treatment when diagnosed with lung cancer. The real problem for the major media is the perception that their reporters are biased. It doesn't matter how many times they deny their biases or the frequency with which it's pointed out to them, especially by conservative organizations. The point is that as in any business if customers aren't buying your product, denying the reason why only prolongs your company's downfall.
A 2018 Columbia Journalism Review story reported on a Knight Foundation-Gallup Poll: "A majority of those who were surveyed said they had lost trust in the media in recent years, and more than 30 percent of those who identified themselves as being on the conservative end of the spectrum said they had not only lost faith in the media, but they 'expect that change to be permanent.' According to a separate Gallup poll from earlier this year that tracked trust in major institutions, newspapers and television news were among the lowest, exceeded only by Congress."
Among the solutions would be for the major media to address the perceived bias by including more conservatives and serious religious people on their staffs as part of "diversity" campaigns. No industry that ignores the concerns of large numbers of the public can long endure. It is vital to a free society, as the Founders believed, that a vibrant, free and, yes, responsible press endure, but the media can only save itself. That salvation will come, if it comes at all, not through financial aid alone, or even mainly, but by media owners coming to their senses and honestly addressing the concerns of people who no longer believe their message.

Texto completo: 'Joy at Work: Organizing Your Professional Life'
By Marie Kondo and Scott Sonenshein, 320 pages, Little, Brown, Spark, $26
Marie Kondo, the tidying expert and bestselling author, has a new book, "Joy at Work," that takes her trademarked method to the workplace and encourages readers to find joy there by cleaning their desks, among other things.
Of course, the terrible joke right now is that the coronavirus is the new KonMari, having scoured most businesses more thoroughly than any decluttering plan could by sending its messiest elements -- people -- home, a turn of events unlikely to lead to much joy, professional or otherwise.
But back to the book.
Can you find joy at work, and is that a good thing? Is it asking too much of a stapler that it spark joy? Is it asking too much of a job?
To a Calvinist or early American, work was the embodiment of Christian principles, and so a duty: work for work's sake. Joy's? Not so much.
Marx thought work could be joyous, if the worker felt he or she was represented in the labor. Certainly happiness, if not actual joy, is a buzzword in the new business lexicon, decorating the covers of a flurry of business primers, from Zappos czar Tony Hsieh ("Delivering Happiness") on down.
And more employers have been offering wellness and other happiness-boosting programs and perks, like nap rooms, fitness tracking and meditation (the last especially useful right now).
But the Goopification of the workplace is just a contemporary spin on what has long been a best practice of capitalism, albeit at specific times.
"Basically, worker happiness becomes an issue any time the labor market gets tight," said Charles Duhigg, a former New York Times reporter who studies productivity and wrote "Smarter Faster Better," among other books. "Look at Henry Ford. The reason he paid his workers twice as much as everyone else is he figured out it was so hard to train them, he needed a way to keep them."
A few decades ago, social scientists started measuring happiness and productivity, and what they found, Duhigg said, is that happier workers are more productive.
Kondo's first job out of college was in the sales force of a staffing agency, and she writes of how she floundered initially, finding herself overworked but getting nowhere, among the worst-performing of the 15 new hires that year.
With a desk awash in papers, office equipment, dried-up tea bags and pens with their caps missing, she had lost touch with her "inner tidying geek." After she snapped to, what followed was a publishing phenomenon.
Still, not all messes are physical, and an empty desk doesn't mean workers aren't suffering from virtual clutter and chaotic systems. Such messes, like pointless meetings, too much email, too many decisions and lousy in-office communication, are not necessarily of their own making.
Kondo has gathered studies that show that the average worker spends half of his or her day answering emails (amplifying stress levels and untethering focus) and wastes 2 1/2 hours a week in ineffective meetings, at a cost of $3.7 billion in lost productivity each year. Lost passwords, according to a study of U.S. and British workers, equals a loss in productivity, per employee, of $420 each year. And so forth.
Our own bad habits and the natural entropy of most systems has caused misery and burnout, and attendant self-help books. Kondo collaborated on this one with Scott Sonenshein, an organizational psychologist, and they take turns explaining how to tidy desks, drawers, meetings (otherwise known as activity clutter), time, inboxes, behaviors and, ultimately, careers.
Throw out random cords, ketchup packets and dried-up pens. Throw out business cards, an outmoded nicety, though many of Kondo's Japanese clients believe they are proxies for a person's soul. Thank them for their information, she suggests, and shred them. Stop accumulating snacks, along with airplane minis, apparently an especially American habit.
"Learning about different cultural characteristics is what makes tidying up in other countries so fascinating," she notes impishly.
Keep your physical desktop clear of everything except that which you're working on at the moment, as well as your computer and perhaps a plant. In these dark times, an uncluttered surface anticipates the caress of the Clorox wipe.
As for your virtual desktop, clean that up too. You can thank your digital data for its service, as you once did your balled-up socks at home, and let it go. (Maybe backing the most important of it up first.)
Attitudes need cleaning too. Be kind, resolve personal conflicts, say thank you. Tidy your meetings: Don't pontificate, cut co-workers off or assign blame.
Tidying such disordered systems may not be possible for most workers, for whom happiness at work is measured mostly, Duhigg said, by how much autonomy they feel they have.
"What matters is having agency," he said, "as does having one colleague that you feel a connection with, having a boss you don't dislike and, optimally, respect, and also feeling like your work has some impact or meaning. People are happier when they feel they have control over their environment. It doesn't matter if it's clean or not."
But Kondo's method offers tidying as a metaphor, "a dialogue with yourself," as she likes to say -- and at this moment when no one feels they have control over their environment, it can be bracing.
Clear your head. Be brave. Kondo writes of her qualms about creating her own social media accounts; she dreaded the trolling that would surely ensue. When a therapist tells her, "Don't worry, Marie. Plenty of people hate you already," she Googles herself.
After her website and blog, the highest-ranking article she found was: "Why We Hate Marie Kondo."
"Too often we clutter our minds with our biggest fears," she writes.

Texto completo: Emmy- and Grammy-winning musician Adam Schlesinger, co-founder of the band Fountains of Wayne, died Wednesday due to coronavirus complications, according to his longtime attorney, Josh Grier.
The 52-year-old was a Dutchess County resident, according to a comment from County Executive Marc Molinaro on his own Facebook post regarding Schlesinger's passing. The comment has since been deleted, and Molinaro subsequently declined to comment to the Journal on Schlesinger's residency, citing privacy reasons.
Grier said Schlesinger died at an "upstate hospital," and The New York Times reported he died in Poughkeepsie.
In posting the New York Times article on Facebook, Molinaro wrote, "Adam Schlesinger still had songs to write, plays to score & life to live. Like far too many, he was taken too early by a disease that knows no social, geographic or economic boundaries. We join his family, friends and devoted fans in mourning his death and celebrating his life."
Schlesinger had been sedated and on a ventilator for several days, Grier told the Associated Press.
Previously, five coronavirus-related deaths have been announced by the county, the latest being a 68-year-old woman on Wednesday. The identities of previous victims have not been revealed.
As of Wednesday afternoon there were 547 confirmed cases in Dutchess County, according to the state. The county said numbers are expected to continue to rise as testing continues.
Fran Drescher, who was developing "The Nanny" musical on Broadway with Schlesinger, wrote on Instagram: "We will miss you ... Devasted. My prayers are for you. May peace be with you."
The songwriter formed the power-pop group Fountains of Wayne, playing bass, with Chris Collingwood, who played guitar and sang lead vocals, in 1995. The band was named after a lawn ornament store in Wayne, New Jersey, near Schlesinger's Montclair hometown. The 2003 hit "Stacy's Mom," which had a music video featuring model Rachel Hunter, was the band's most popular song.
He received Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for writing the theme song to the 1996 Tom Hanks-directed movie "That Thing You Do!" Hanks referenced the movie's fictional Playtone Record Label paying tribute on Twitter.
"There would be no Playtone without Adam Schlesinger," wrote Hanks. "He was a One-der. Lost him to Covid-19. Terribly sad today."
Schlesinger won two Emmys for parody songs written for the 2012 and 2013 Tony Awards telecasts, and won another last year for co-writing "Antidepressants Are So Not a Big Deal" for Rachel Bloom's CW series "Crazy Ex-Girlfriend." His other television and film credits include "Sesame Street," "Music and Lyrics" and "Shallow Hal."
Schlesinger was also nominated for two Tony Awards, including best musical for the 2008 Broadway show "Cry-Baby," an adaptation of the John Waters comedy starring Johnny Depp.
He won the 2009 Grammy for best comedy album for writing the songs on "A Colbert Christmas: The Greatest Gift of All!" a companion to a TV Christmas special with songs performed by Stephen Colbert and Elvis Costello.
Schlesinger, the cousin of "The Walking Dead" actor Jon Bernthal, leaves two daughters.
Fountains of Wayne's most recent album, "Sky Full of Holes," was released in 2011.
"I think part of the reason we still exist is because we're so slow between records. ... We tend to put out a record every three to four years and then do some touring and then we get away from each other for a while," Schlesinger told the Asbury Park Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, in 2011. "It's always a nice thing to come back to, but it definitely doesn't feel like that much time has elapsed. I feel pretty much like the same guy."

Gun sales surge on local, national level

Texto completo: Gary's Gun Shop owner Steve Naatjes gave a one-word answer when asked how business has been of late at his Sioux Falls store and firing range.
"Booming."
That isn't surprising to Naatjes or anyone else who sells firearms. When America finds itself in times of crisis, gun sales thrive. COVID-19 is no exception.
"We've been very busy," Naatjes said of his store on 41st Street. "Protection, handguns, rifles, shotguns, ammo – you know how it goes. Some guys just want to be prepared, and they are. It's just like someone stocking up on 100 rolls of toilet paper."
According to a New York Times analysis, this March was the second-busiest month for gun sales on record in America, trailing only January of 2013, which came just after the re-election of Democratic president Barack Obama and the Sandy Hook Elementary school shooting.
On March 20, the U.S. broke a single-day record by conducting 210,308 background checks, according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a national trade group for the firearms industry. Nearly 1.2 million background checks were conducted that week, also a record.
Per the New York Times study, 1.9 million guns were purchased in the U.S. last month, just shy of the record 2 million sold in Jan. 2013. By comparison, 1.1 million guns were sold in November of 2008, when Obama was elected to his first term, and 754,000 guns were bought the month of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in 2001.
"It's always political – a fear of Democrats," Naatjes said. "The last time was when the Democrats were talking about putting big taxes on ammo and (expanding) background checks. But 9/11, shootings, everything associated with that. It's been (busy) for the last three weeks or so."
Politics aside, surges in gun sales are driven by fear of civil unrest in a time of crisis. The millions of Americans racing out to buy guns aren't planning crime sprees – they're preparing to defend themselves from perceived threats amid fear of COVID-19 infection and economic collapse.
In Sioux Falls, Gary's has reduced store hours to restock and sanitize inventory and offers in-store pick-up and shipping. The 12-lane gun firing range is still open, but to comply with social distancing standards, Naatjes has closed half the lanes to create space between customers. He says he'll cut available lanes further if necessary.
David Hughes, owner of Blue Collar Tactical in Sioux Falls, declined to be interviewed for this story.
South Dakota has not issued shelter-in-place demands, but if that eventually happens the Trump administration has declared gun shops as essential businesses. That's good news for Naatjes and other firearm dealers and manufacturers.
"We'll stay open as long as we can," he said. "We'll just keep limiting the amount of people in here and in the range, washing our hands and sanitizing as much as we can."
Gary's Gun Shop's Anthony Naatjes writes down information after a gun purchase at the store.

Keeping The Times Humming

Texto completo: Developers, technicians, systems analysts and many other employees are working remotely to maintain the flow of information to readers.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
When Jack Wheeler got his job as a product manager at The New York Times in September 2019, he joyfully left a remote-work life behind, and to commemorate the occasion, he sold his desk. Yet when Times leadership asked the majority of employees to begin working from home on March 13 as a precaution against the global spread of the coronavirus, Mr. Wheeler had to readjust. He bought a new desk.
Such has been the shift among employees over the last few weeks. As Times employees have grappled with a new reality of what will most likely be a prolonged stint of remote work against a backdrop of anxiety, they've continued to do the jobs they've always done.
Times journalists have been working around the clock to ensure readers have access to the latest information on a complex and rapidly developing story. But working alongside them -- remotely -- are designers, developers, technicians, project managers, systems analysts, data scientists and many others whose expertise on the website, apps and other digital products helps maintain the flow of information to readers.
To support a newly distributed work force, the group that provides computers and technical assistance for employees spun into overdrive, helping people troubleshoot home internet connections and fielding over 1,100 requests for computer equipment since mid-March. To date, they have shipped nearly 400 monitors to people's homes.
Even as The Times worked to ensure employees have the equipment they need, it encouraged people to take time to care for themselves and their families. In what is shaping up to be a marathon, people from all levels of the company worked to balance the ordinary in extraordinary times.
With most schools closed, the days now take more planning than ever before. School at home is something M. Ryan Murphy, an archivist working with The New York Times Store, now navigates with his 9-year-old in Mamaroneck, N.Y. His days are split between devising a home-school curriculum, team meetings and helping Times readers order reprints of articles.
Jaymin Patel, a senior software engineer working on election coverage, wakes up before 6 a.m. to eat breakfast and plan a schedule for the day that includes homework help for his kids and a walk around their neighborhood in Sayreville, N.J.
While some Times employees have always worked remotely, others have had to adapt to an entirely new lifestyle without impromptu in-person chats and built-in break time between meetings as people walked from one conference room to another.
Some teams began rethinking how to best collaborate on projects and whether calendars normally packed with meetings could be lightened. For the meetings that will stay on the schedule, some people have experimented with new ways of connecting with and motivating their colleagues.
Gaëlle Sharma, a product manager who works on the technical aspects of the login page on the Times website and apps, joins her team's daily check-ins from Brooklyn and reads poems from Lin-Manuel Miranda's book, "Gmorning, Gnight!" Ms. Sharma said, "I try to keep it in line with the mood of the day or what we'll be working on."
On the UX Foundations team, which seeks ways to improve how readers experience the Times website and apps, the first person to sign on in the morning shares a question for the team to answer -- examples include "What's your favorite show to binge-watch?" and "Do you prefer the local or express train?" It's a way for everyone to connect on something silly before digging into the day's work.
For the team that handles email, push notifications and personalized content recommendations, daily team meetings end with The Times's word-formation game, Spelling Bee. "Everyone just shouts out words and one person types them in," said Dan Schlosser, a senior product manager on the team who signs on from Manhattan's Upper West Side.
Just as teams connected in work meetings, people have been meeting virtually to talk more casually over lunch, coffee and happy hours.
Lauren Rollins, an associate marketing manager from the Games team, said that she and her colleagues recently held a virtual happy hour in honor of a colleague headed to a new job. Everyone made a drink from their homes -- Ms. Rollins made an Aperol spritz -- and dialed into a Google Hangout for a little over an hour.
The gathering evolved into a show-and-tell where members from the team shared items from their homes: a Woody figurine from "Toy Story," a microphone for recording music, art and gaming setups. Ms. Rollins's contribution was a limited edition makeup palette inspired by the Japanese manga "Sailor Moon."
The locus of The Times's culture has primarily revolved around the Times building, with many conversations happening over casual coffees and quick chats while waiting for the elevators.
This put remote employees at a disadvantage because they couldn't participate in casual in-person conversations, and joining video calls was an imperfect solution. Now, with everyone on video calls or Slack, the rules of communication have been equalized. "It's easy to get your words in" during team meetings, said Vicki Crosson, a software engineer on The Times's search team. Ms. Crosson, who has been working remotely from Boston for over a year, said that people on her team are doing more to make sure everyone is heard.
Where Times employees do their jobs has changed, but how they do the work and support one another has not. "I've been so inspired by my colleagues," Meredith Kopit Levien, chief operating officer at The Times, wrote via email. "They're working from kitchens and bedrooms, between home schooling lessons, while caring for loved ones, and for many, facing unprecedented solitude and anxiety."
Over the last couple of years, The Times has promoted ways to encourage employees to bring more of themselves to work. For now, however, employees are defining what it looks like to bring their whole homes.

Texto completo: Bucky Pizzarelli, one of the nation's preeminent seven-string guitarists, who began his career as a coveted sideman and studio musician before stepping out on his own and forming an acclaimed jazz duo with one of his sons, died April 1 at his home in Saddle River, N.J. He was 94.
The cause was the coronavirus disease covid-19, said his son John Pizzarelli, a guitarist and singer with whom Mr. Pizzarelli formed one of the rare father-son duos in jazz.
Mr. Pizzarelli honed a gentle, richly textured sound while playing as an accompanist and solo artist, performing lyrical improvised solos that typically featured chords rather than single notes.
Although he began his career in the 1940s, touring as a teenager with singer Vaughn Monroe's dance band, he came into his own after acquiring a seven-string Gretsch guitar in 1969, inspired by seven-string pioneer George Van Eps.
The instrument featured an extra bass string, which Mr. Pizzarelli used to virtuosic effect in swing-era standards, Brazilian bossa nova and songs by the Beatles, Burt Bacharach and Henry Mancini. A fixture of the New York jazz scene for decades, he was also a staff musician at ABC and NBC, where he played with the "Tonight Show" band and tuned Tiny Tim's ukulele before the musician got married before a TV audience of millions in 1969.
Mr. Pizzarelli spent much of the 1950s and '60s inside recording studios, where he arrived early to practice his nylon-string classical guitar and did three sessions a day, recording tracks such as Dion's "Runaround Sue," Ray Charles's version of "Georgia on My Mind," Ben E. King's "Stand By Me" and Brian Hyland's "Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polkadot Bikini."
He also performed with the pop group the Three Suns, toured across Europe with Benny Goodman and collaborated with artists including Buddy Rich, Tony Bennett, Frank Sinatra, Wes Montgomery, Zoot Sims, Bud Freeman and French violinist Stéphane Grappelli, the former musical partner of his guitar idol Django Reinhardt.
But he was perhaps best known for his work in guitar duos, including with George Barnes, one of the first artists to record with an electric guitar. "Their duets are built on the contrast between the soft, dark sound of Mr. Pizzarelli's thumb and finger plucking and Mr. Barnes's use of a pick to produce high, tight phrases that dart and dazzle over his partner's foundation lines," New York Times jazz critic John S. Wilson wrote in 1970.
"They may be light and airy - a perfect soufflé of sound - and then go rollicking off through rapid-fire lines that wrap around each other, chase each other, join in unison and set up challenges of the musicians and the listening ear," he added. "This is a brilliant and unique team."
Mr. Pizzarelli and Barnes recorded a 1971 album, "Guitars Pure and Honest," but within a year began "to detest one another," according to a report from the New Yorker jazz critic Whitney Balliett, who witnessed a chaotic performance at the St. Regis Room in Manhattan that brought the musicians' rivalry into public view.
"The guitarists' swan set was played not on their instruments," he wrote, "but on each other."
Mr. Pizzarelli found far less drama while performing with members of his own family. His 1972 album, "Green Guitar Blues," featured a duet with his 14-year-old daughter Mary, whom he trained on classical guitar. By the end of the decade he was performing with his son John, with whom he recorded albums such as "2 x 7 = Pizzarelli" (1980) and "Twogether" (2001), which featured duets of jazz standards.
In time, they also performed with Mr. Pizzarelli's other son, bassist Martin Pizzarelli, and with John's wife, singer Jessica Molaskey, forming a group that John Pizzarelli likened to "the von Trapp family on martinis."
"I learned by sitting with him on the bandstand," John Pizzarelli told TV interviewer Steve Adubato in 2013, accompanied by his father. "It was trial by fire. He would just play melodies and stare at me." ("We don't get mad," Bucky Pizzarelli told the New York Times, "but we knock heads once in a while. I don't interfere.")
In a 2016 interview with Inside Jersey magazine, jazz guitarist Ed Laub, a onetime pupil of Mr. Pizzarelli's, recalled a piece of advice from his former teacher: "If you're planning on being a professional musician, you need to understand that your job is to always make the other guy as good as he can possibly sound. It's not about you."
For Mr. Pizzarelli, Laub said, "It's about making beautiful music. It's not about grandstanding."
Mr. Pizzarelli was born John Pizzarelli on Jan. 9, 1926, in Paterson, N.J., where his childhood classmates included poet Allen Ginsberg. His parents owned a grocery store, and his father played the mandolin and nicknamed his only son Bucky, out of a love for cowboys and the American West that he had nurtured since working in Texas as a teenager.
His uncle Bobby Dominick was a banjo and guitar player who "looked like a million dollars every time I saw him," Mr. Pizzarelli told George Cole, author of the Miles Davis history "The Last Miles." "He had a suit, a new car and he was picking up 50 bucks a week on the road with all his bands. . . . When I saw that, I said, 'That's what I want to do.' "
Mr. Pizzarelli learned the basics of music during Sunday jam sessions that included Bobby and another uncle, Pete Dominick, as well as Joe Mooney, a blind Paterson jazz accordionist. Influenced by guitarists such as Reinhardt, Freddie Green and Charlie Christian, he went on to perform at weddings and dances before joining Monroe's dance band at 17.
He was soon drafted into the Army and, at the close of World War II, served in Europe and the Philippines, where he "spent nine months doing nothing," as he put it, aside from playing guitar. He returned home to spend five years with Monroe and join NBC.
Mr. Pizzarelli's records included "The Red Door" (1998), a tribute to Sims, featuring Scott Hamilton on tenor sax; and "5 for Freddie" (2007), a tribute to Green with pianist John Bunch in the role of Count Basie, Green's longtime musical collaborator.
At home in Saddle River, he presided over what one journalist described as "a living jukebox," where Goodman dropped in to nap, Sims swam in the family pool, bassist Slam Stewart stayed over and impromptu performances broke out almost daily, with most family members taking part. Mr. Pizzarelli's wife of 66 years, the former Ruth Litchult, did not play an instrument but "knows music and can say what's good and bad," her husband told the Times in 1973.
"I'm a critic mostly when he plays too long or when it's time for dinner," she said.
In addition to his wife, survivors include four children, Anne Hymes of Orlando, Martin Pizzarelli of Saddle River and John and Mary Pizzarelli, both of Manhattan; a sister; and four grandchildren.
In recent years, Mr. Pizzarelli told Cole, the music scene had transformed, and the kind of playing he did in studio bands was all but nonexistent. "Guitar players - it's mostly effects," he said. "Guitars in the hands of these kids today are weapons!"
Still, he plowed ahead, playing dozens of club dates each year and maintaining the approach that had fueled his career for nearly eight decades. "Every day I get up and I try to correct what I screwed up the night before," he said. "That's my theory. I prepare for the next time. I'm playing mostly live dates now and that's a big thrill, because that's the ultimate - to be in front of people."

Texto completo: The claim: Unless there’s a critical need, avoid grocery shopping during the first three days of the month because that’s when low-income families receive WIC and SNAP benefits
As a new month begins, multiple Facebook users have encouraged people to stay away from grocery stores during the first three days of the month unless they have an urgent cause to go.
The reason: That’s when many people receive food assistance, resulting in an influx of shoppers at that time.
A Monday post by Facebook user Betsey Brock with this message had received more than 12,000 shares as of Thursday evening.
“Please avoid grocery shopping on April 1-3 unless you have a critical need,” her post said. “Many WIC/SNAP benefits come to low-income families at the first of the month and there will be a surge as these families redeem them. ”
A similar Texas-focused Monday post by the Facebook page “Dallas County” had more than 10,000 shares as of Thursday evening.
“Many of these families' benefits were depleted more quickly because children are staying home from school and some families are going hungry right now,” the post said. “Give these families space to shop and please respect their needs by not buying items with a WIC shelf tag unless you absolutely need them. ”
Some Dallas city leaders made a similar call, according to local media reports. But the city of Dallas’ official Facebook page responded to this post Tuesday, clarifying that the city itself was not behind the post urging people to avoid grocery stores.
The city’s post said that WIC participants do receive reloaded benefits on the first day of the month but can use them any day. Additionally, the state has relaxed some of the criteria for WIC to give participants more food options.
A message sent by USA TODAY to Brock was not returned. The Dallas County page, which describes itself as a "community fan page," did not have contact information listed.
Shortages of WIC items during the coronavirus outbreak
The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) is a federal grant program that provides nutritious foods and education to low-income women during and after pregnancy, as well as to their children up to age 5. WIC served an average of 6. 4 million Americans in 2019, according to the U. S. Department of Agriculture. Shoppers use either electronic benefit transfer cards or paper vouchers to purchase WIC-eligible items, which in some states carry specific markings in stores.
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), also known as food stamps, provides benefits to needy families to help them purchase food. SNAP served about 35. 7 million Americans in 2019, according to USDA data.
States distribute WIC and SNAP benefits at different times of the month. In Iowa, SNAP benefits are staggered over the first 10 days of each month. In Texas, they are staggered over the first 15 days. WIC benefits in Texas are issued at the beginning of each month.
But as the coronavirus pandemic has spread, shortages of WIC-eligible foods, such as infant formula, have occurred as shoppers have stocked up, said Brian Dittmeier, senior public policy counsel at the National WIC Association, the nonprofit education arm and advocacy group for WIC.
The New York Times reported on Monday that panic buying had led to a shortage in items such as baby formula, diapers and wipes.
Laura Strange, a spokeswoman for the National Grocers Association, a group that represents independent retail and wholesale grocers, said it has taken some time for the supply chain to catch up to the demand, and it continues to catch up in some areas.
She said the NGA has been working closely with the USDA to keep retailers aware of when food assistance benefits will be issued.
"It's so they're aware of when those benefits are released so that they can be prepared in case they were to see an uptick," she said.
How best to help WIC, SNAP recipients when you shop
Dittmeier said the National WIC Association isn't calling on people to avoid shopping at a certain times of the month. Like other families, those on food assistance go shopping when they need to, not necessarily right when their benefits are allocated, he said.
"I think our main message is that WIC shoppers can shop at any time," he said. "They don’t shop necessarily on the day they receive benefits. Keeping this attitude of respectfulness and neighborly behavior is something to keep in mind throughout the entire duration. "
That respectfulness, Dittmeier said, includes refraining from hoarding items, especially those of particular need to WIC recipients, such as infant formula. And if there's a choice in the grocery store between two types of the same item — one marked eligible for WIC and one not — it's prudent to leave the WIC-eligible item for someone else. Some stores, however, do not mark WIC-eligible items, he said.
Strange said customers should prioritize items they need for the one week to two weeks while shopping.
"The biggest thing here is just the not panic-buying and not hoarding," she said.
If the large crowds are a concern, experts have encouraged shopping at off-peak times to avoid overcrowding. Some grocery stores have begun limiting the number of people who can enter a store at a time.
For those on WIC who are having difficulties finding items, Dittmeier recommends looking at a state WIC agency's website. WIC recipients can also speak with store managers or call ahead to learn when the next shipment of an in-demand item, such as infant formula, will be ready.
The federal government has additionally responded to the pandemic by making both SNAP and WIC more flexible. And due to the public health emergency, many states are broadening the types of brands and package sizes eligible for WIC.
In Texas, Elliott Sprehe, press officer with the Texas Health & Human Services Commission, said the state has been in continuing communication with WIC-authorized grocery stores and been assured that they can keep up with the demand. The state has also temporarily added more options for certain food items that WIC participants can buy.
"In the event a WIC approved item is out of stock, clients should ask the store clerk for help or consult the WIC website or app," he said.
The National WIC Association is also working with retailers and food manufacturers on making grocery shopping a better experience for WIC recipients during the outbreak, Dittmeier said.
Our ruling: Partly false
The fact-based claims in the Facebook posts may or may not be false, depending on where the reader is living. For example, the claim in the Dallas County, Texas, post that WIC recipients receive benefits on the first of the month is true.
But since other posts are circulating without specific states attached to them, and because not all states issue WIC or SNAP benefits at the beginning of the month, those claims could easily be taken out of context and provide false information.
For that reason, any sweeping call to avoid grocery shopping on the first three days of the month because that's when people receive benefits can paint an inaccurate picture.
Although avoiding a grocery store so people on WIC and SNAP can have more room is likely well-intentioned, advocates with the National WIC Association aren't recommending avoiding a grocery store entirely during those times. That's because not all food assistance recipients will be shopping on the same days.
Instead, the association recommends consumers keep others in mind as they shop by not hoarding and being conscious of WIC labels on items. Shoppers should particularly pay attention to items such as infant formula, diapers and baby wipes that have experienced shortages in the past few weeks.

Texto completo: In February, Michael Bond purchased tickets to a concert scheduled to take place in April at the Birchmere Music Hall in Alexandria, Virginia.
As is the case in all his concert and travel purchases, Bond also bought insurance with Allianz Global Assistance, the industrys premier coverage provider.
Then the coronavirus struck.
"The Birchmere postponed the concert until August, but we have other commitments with our grandchildren," Bond said.
When Bond reached out to Allianz, he was told that "the fine print in the insurance agreement" negates any refund.
"You should have known about the coronavirus, it was in China," Bond said an Allianz representative told him.
The Bond family isn't alone, and neither are D.C. residents.
At City Winery in Philadelphia, a family of five also purchased tickets in February for a Sheila E. concert scheduled for April 17.
The family had been visiting the City of Brotherly Love and checked their schedules and realized that they'd indeed be able to return to the area for the concert. They proceeded to purchase tickets that totaled roughly $300.
Recently, the family received this email message from City Winery Box Office Manager Justin Dye:
"Please be advised that due to Coronavirus (COVID-19) safety precautions, the Sheila E. performance has been postponed. As soon as we get a new date locked in, we will be reaching out to you with options that will be available."
When the family responded that they were facing financial difficulties because of the pandemic, the response was equally unsettling.
"Thank you for reaching out to the Philadelphia Concierge Team, your email is important to us," was the automatic reply received by Ben Griffith, who originally planned to make a second trip into the city from Ohio to see Sheila E.
"As we closely monitor the current situation, our team is communicating to the best of our ability," the email from City Winery noted. "Our staff is limited and working around the clock to ensure everyone's safety and to provide the most up to date information we can regarding the status of upcoming shows and events."
"We called, we emailed. There's been nothing," said Griffith, who purchased tickets in February as a treat to his family, which includes his two daughters, both aspiring drummers.
"They don't want to give us our money back," Griffith said. "You'd think in the interest of their business, and because this pandemic is causing problems for so many people financially, they'd give you your money back. It's not like they went through with the show. It's our money, and frankly, we can use it to buy food or something else that might be needed."
Eileen McNamara Lash, of Fredonia, New York, told The New York Times that she spent days on the phone trying to get refunds for another event.
"I just put the phone down on speaker and just let it go for a couple of hours," she said. "At one point, it actually died on me, and that's why I had to disconnect and then start over the next night."
City Winery CEO Michael Dorf did not return requests for comment.
Throughout the nation, concerts, events and even Broadway shows have been canceled or postponed. Some have complied with refund requests, while others have balked.
When the NCAA canceled its famed March Madness tournament, the organization said refunds, except applicable fees, would be issued within 30 dates of the cancellation.
On Broadway, where all shows have shut down indefinitely, the refund process has been described as painless.
Kristina Aquilina, who had two tickets to "Come From Away," walked into the box office of the Gerald Schoenfeld Theater and was told that Telecharge, the vendor from which she had bought the tickets, had already granted her a refund, according to the New York Times.
Notices posted by the Shubert Organization, the largest landlord on Broadway, revealed that most purchases would be refunded automatically to the buyer's credit card.
If the ticketholder purchased through a source separate from Telecharge, the box office, the discount TKTS booth, or the nonprofit Theater Development Fund, that person would have to go directly to the vendor.
StubHub, a marketplace for third-party ticket sellers, sent an email offering customers that purchased tick- ets to now-canceled events a "coupon worth 120 percent of your original order to go to the live event of your choice within the next 12 months."
"Alternatively, you can choose to receive a full refund for the original order amount (including service and delivery fees) to the original payment method," the company said.
However, officials at the South by Southwest music festival in Austin, Texas, were among the more challenging.
"We have a strict no-refund policy on badges," South by Southwest officials noted in a statement.
The badges cost as much as $1,725, and the company said it would consider offering a deferral of the badge until next year or two years after that.
The Ultra Music Festival that takes place in Miami told ticket-holders that they would not issue refunds to the canceled event.
There is now hope that Ultra officials will change their minds after Miami-Dade officials declared that all venues must close.
"We completely understand how extremely frustrating this is because so many of you are looking forward to coming to Ultra, having already made travel arrangements," Ultra officials wrote in a statement posted on its website. "This is, however, an unprecedented issue which is not being taken lightly, and we must continue to defer to the authorities for guidance. Ultimately, there is no higher priority for us than the health, safety, and physical well-being of each of you, together with everyone else involved in the production of the event. All ticket purchasers will be contacted by email regarding the next steps."

Trump is right to want to get the economy started again

Texto completo: President Trump loves to talk up the roaring economy he sees arriving sooner than you might think. “Once we get rid of the virus, I think we’ll have a boom economy … a tremendous rebound,” he insisted last week. “We’ll be the talk of the world soon. … We’re going to be stronger than ever.”
This is more than just the usual Trump hyperbole. He will be in a stronger position to free up parts of the economy from coronavirus restrictions than in late March, when he was pressured to back off his plan to do so by Easter. Trump had to yield to a superior force: the collusion of the public health network, both political parties, and the media. But if there are indications that the growth in new coronavirus infections has peaked by May, the president is poised to argue for easing constraints on some areas of the country and boosting the economy.
He would take advantage of the blue state/red state divide. The coronavirus has become a plague in urban areas, which are mostly in blue states. Red states, though not all of them, are less infected. Democrats, the blue-state folks, might object to loosened regulations, but red-state Republicans are more likely to favor an end to the current “lockdown.”
“States are different,” Trump said at a White House briefing. “You have to give a little flexibility for every state.” His idea here is to allow some of the less infected states to open up their economies by ending rules such as the “stay at home” requirement. The effect would be to hasten the rising economy that’s forever on the president's mind.
It makes sense economically and politically. The longer the economy is strapped with restrictions, the longer it will take for it to revive — and the weaker the economy will be on Election Day in November.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York hasn’t endorsed Trump’s strategy. But he’s not far off. “The smartest way forward is a modified public health strategy that dovetails and complements a get-back-to-work strategy,” Cuomo said. “Younger people can go back to work. People who can … show they have had the virus and resolved can go back to work. It’s not [that] we’re either going to do public health or we’re going to do economic development. We’re going to do both.”
The sticking point with Trump’s effort to stir economic activity is the timetable. It’s clear from his comments he wants to start revving the economy in May, a few weeks after Easter.
The New York Times has other ideas. Keeping people tethered inside for two months or more doesn’t faze the press giant. Nor does associating their notion with historic greatness. “It’s a Marshall Plan, an Apollo mission and a New Deal all rolled into one,” declared an opinion writer for the New York Times. The theme is that the New York shutdown is good for everyone: “It increasingly appears necessary that for the next eight weeks, and possibly for longer, all nonessential businesses should be closed, domestic travel restricted and the ‘shelter in place’ measures being employed by some parts of the country extended to the rest.”
The New York Times is not alone in restraining the economy for the time being. If people are “disciplined about social distancing and testing increases … the economy can open back up again probably in two months,” according to Bill Gates. Dr. Ezekiel J. Emanuel wrote in the New York Times that if the federal government “acts now … a strong national response may allow America to open up sooner — in June, not by Easter — and do it more safely.”
A June startup is awfully late. The economy has done more than just come to a near halt. Fortune 500 companies continue to pay employees, but the smaller elements of the economy are disassembling. The longer the wait for an economic go-ahead, the harder to put things back together. Apartment dwellers have stopped paying their rent. Mortgage lenders fearing a wave of unpaid loans want a $40 billion bailout to cover the next three months.
Democrats are living up to their reputation for exploiting a crisis for whatever unrelated bonuses they can get. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is seeking to resurrect the deduction of state and local taxes from federal tax returns. It would come in the fourth “relief” measure costing billions. And would be the biggest tax payoff ever for the top 1%. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said no to spending bill No. 4 and a tax reward the wealthy.
Trump is on the right track on the economy. Yes, he has a vested interest in a strong economy. Nate Silver said, “A bad economy makes life harder for the incumbent party.” That’s not all. It makes life harder still for the American people.

Texto completo: Fox News host Sean Hannity and a New York Times opinion writer sparred on social media after the columnist, Kara Swisher, wrote a piece criticizing Fox News's coverage of the coronavirus.
The column from Swisher, which was published on Tuesday, begins with a swipe at Hannity.
“You can relax, Sean Hannity, I’m not going to sue you,” Swisher wrote before claiming the network's early coverage of the pandemic made her mother believe the virus was being “overblown by the mainstream news media.”
Swisher called out the network's "on-air talent," writing, they "did not mind being egregiously bad at their jobs when it came to giving out accurate health data" and said that her mother was not concerned about contracting the virus because "her primary source of news is Fox."
Hannity rebuked the piece and repeatedly castigated Swisher on social media.
"Hey Kara whoever u are. I’ll accept you are a pest, but you are also ignorant, lazy and a total hypocrite," he tweeted. Hannity later asked if she was "proud of your paper" printing a "garbage" opinion piece that questioned whether it was safe to travel to China and claimed that "the coronavirus travel ban is unjust and doesn’t work anyway."
Tweet
Hannity appeared to be referring to an opinion piece from Rosie Spinks, a global tourism reporter for Skift, which was published in the New York Times on Feb. 5.
Hannity also encouraged Swisher to file a lawsuit against him, despite her saying she had no intention of doing so, and claimed he would file a countersuit that "could be a landmark case!!"
Swisher responded to Hannity with jabs of her own and some humor. Swisher also reiterated she had no intention of suing Hannity or the network. In addition, Swisher posted a screenshot of a text message she said was from her mother imploring the prime-time host to "not use the terrible words against you." Swisher's mother, according to the text, prefers Bret Baier, one of the network's news anchors, over Hannity, an opinion host.
Tweet
The commentary by Swisher and the subsequent pushback from Hannity comes as Fox has faced scrutiny for its opinion hosts' coverage of the coronavirus from the onset. Hannity claims he never downplayed the severity of the virus and accused Democrats of trying to use the pandemic to push their agenda as well as to "stop Donald Trump."
“After a week of coronavirus-related panic, lies, propaganda, and misinformation, thankfully, the market is roaring back in a big way,” Hannity said during his opening monologue on his March 3 show. “It needs to be very clear to every American, the Democrats, the media mob, they will stop at nothing.”
“Their rage, hate Trump psychosis is even worse than I thought. … They’re now using the natural fear of a virus as a political weapon,” he added.
Such accusations against Democrats were echoed by former Fox Business anchor Trish Regan, who was let go from the network earlier this month. In its statement, the network made no mention of the backlash Regan faced for a monologue in which she claimed that Democrats and certain members of the media were using the coronavirus as a mechanism to remove President Trump from office.
Hannity's and Regan's commentary diverged from another prime-time host, Tucker Carlson, who had been sounding the alarm over the virus for weeks. He traveled to Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida for the first time earlier this month because, as Carlson put it, he felt a "moral obligation" to urge the president to take the pandemic seriously.

No institution has failed the public worse than the news media during the COVID-19 pandemic

Texto completo: No institution has failed the public worse during the COVID-19 pandemic than the news media.

It seems impossible that this should be the case, especially considering the federal government’s sluggish, incoherent, and unfocused handling of this crisis. But even the federal government has managed to get some things right. The same cannot be said for our self-important Fourth Estate.

From the very beginning, corporate media got the story wrong, publishing article after article assuring readers that the virus was not as dangerous or serious as it sounded.

“Is this going to be a deadly pandemic?” Vox asked on social media on Jan. 31. “No.”

Later, after it became clear the pandemic that began in China was indeed a fatal, fast-moving global disaster and the bodies started to stack up, major newsgroups in the United States changed tacks, abandoning earlier efforts to downplay the seriousness of the disease to champion the Beijing-approved talking point that says it is “racist” and “xenophobic” to refer to the virus by its city or country of origin.

“Rep. Kevin McCarthy’s coronavirus tweet echoes anti-Chinese racism. He must apologize,” the Sacramento Bee’s editorial board demanded on March 10 after the House GOP leader used the term “Chinese coronavirus” in a tweet. Prior to its editorial, the Sacramento Bee published no fewer than five news headlines featuring the exact term “Chinese coronavirus."

As corporate media rushed to condemn the terms it coined, its individual members embraced a number of demagogic talking points and outright falsehoods, perpetuating junk arguments and total lies in a none-too-subtle effort to score political points.

It gets worse.

Since the pandemic came to U.S. shores, members of the White House press corps have attended coronavirus briefings for the explicit purpose of peppering the president and his response team with insipid questions about whether it is racist to use terms such as “Wuhan virus” and “Kung flu.” Members of the press have belittled and talked down to the healthcare experts charged with leading the White House’s response efforts. Reporters and pundits ridiculed a business owner who overhauled his facilities so that they are now focused mostly on producing cotton face masks. NBC News has even suggested that the president is responsible for an Arizona couple who drank fish tank cleaner thinking it would protect them from the virus.
Worst of all, U.S. newsgroups have taken to praising despotic regimes that are hostile to the U.S., including Russia and China, going so far as to parrot their propaganda. CNN, for example, published a report on March 21 comparing the U.S. unfavorably to Russia, which CNN claims has its coronavirus cases mostly under control thanks to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The figures touted in the CNN report come directly from Moscow.

Elsewhere, major media have blindly accepted Beijing’s laughable assertion that it has halted the spread of the disease in Wuhan and in other places.

“How uncomfortable is it,” asked MSNBC’s Chuck Todd, “that perhaps China’s authoritarian ways did prevent this? Meaning, had China been a free and open society, this might have spread faster?”

Chinese authorities knew about the virus in December when it first appeared in the city of Wuhan. Instead of taking measures and sharing what it knew about the disease with the international community, China’s government engaged in a massive cover-up. The Chinese Communist Party suppressed the sharing of relevant information, arresting and punishing medical professionals who tried to warn people that there was something going around with SARS-like symptoms.

China’s deception and incompetence, all of which led to its gross mishandling of the COVID-19 outbreak, are a matter of historical fact. Yet ostensibly free and independent journalists in the U.S. eagerly repeat Beijing’s coronavirus case counts anyway, "reporting" uncritically China’s totally unbelievable claim that new incidents of infections have remained essentially flat since late February.

On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that the U.S. intelligence community has determined that China “has concealed the extent of the coronavirus outbreak in its country, under-reporting both total cases and deaths.”

Don’t hold your breath waiting for corrections from the same journalists who reported last week that the U.S. has more known coronavirus cases than any country in the world. You certainly should not expect a correction from New York Times editors responsible for the March 18 report titled “Its coronavirus cases dwindling, China turns focus outward.”

The Bloomberg news alert, by the way, came just hours after a number of journalists and pundits interpreted a tweet from a New York Times reporter to mean the White House’s stated “goal” is to reach 100,000-240,000 deaths from the virus. (This most certainly is not the administration’s goal.)

In other words, the news media’s handling of the crisis has been consistently wrong and tendentious from the get-go. It has only gotten worse since then.

There is a reason why, amid the coronavirus pandemic, the press is the least trusted institution in the U.S. compared to hospitals, schools, daycare centers, state governments, President Trump, and Vice President Mike Pence, according to recent Gallup polling data.

This is what happens when an entire industry is bad at its job.

'Zoom-bombing' and privacy flaws plague app that has become immensely popular during coronavirus outbreak

Texto completo: The founder of Zoom apologized for privacy feature flaws and so-called “Zoom-bombings” that have taken place as the video conferencing company's popularity has skyrocketed during the coronavirus crisis.
With its free app downloaded more than any other in the United States and dozens of other countries in recent weeks, Zoom stock shares doubled since the start of the year as workers are stuck at home under widespread stay-at-home orders meant to stem the spread of the COVID-19 virus. As Zoom usage has risen — there have been spikes of up to 200 million people per day in March, up from 10 million in late December — so has law enforcement concern about the remote meetings being hacked and users being harassed or exploited.
“Usage of Zoom has ballooned overnight — far surpassing what we expected when we first announced our desire to help in late February,” Zoom CEO Eric Yuan wrote in a blog post Wednesday night. “However, we recognize that we have fallen short of the community’s — and our own — privacy and security expectations. For that, I am deeply sorry.”

Included in Yuan's mea culpa was an admission that the product was not designed "with the foresight that, in a matter of weeks, every person in the world would suddenly be working, studying, and socializing from home.”
The billionaire also outlined what the company is doing to fix the problems, including “enacting a feature freeze, [effective] immediately, and shifting all our engineering resources to focus on our biggest trust, safety, and privacy issues.”
Yuan's apology for the security lapses in his product, after which shares of Zoom stock dropped a precipitous 11%, came after the FBI warned on Monday about Zoom’s vulnerabilities.

“As large numbers of people turn to video-teleconferencing platforms to stay connected in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis, reports of VTC hijacking (also called “Zoom-bombing”) are emerging nationwide,” the bureau said. “The FBI has received multiple reports of conferences being disrupted by pornographic and/or hate images and threatening language.”
One glaring issue the company is facing is what has become known as "Zoom-bombing," when uninvited guests break into virtual meetings.
Zoom-bombers have interrupted "work from home" happy hours by screensharing pornography. And the FBI's Boston division revealed a Massachusetts high school teacher’s online classroom was interrupted by unidentified individuals who “yelled a profanity and then shouted the teacher’s home address in the middle of instruction.” Another school in the state reported a Zoom meeting interrupted by an unknown person who “displayed swastika tattoos.”
These Zoom-bombings have also hit multiple virtual Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. In the middle of one such meeting, an uninvited guest began shouting misogynistic and anti-Semitic slurs, according to Business Insider. The person mocked the group by saying, “Alcohol is soooo good.” The organizers removed the intruder, but by then, more than half of the participants had left the chat.

The FBI emphasized on Wednesday that it “anticipates cyber actors will exploit increased use of virtual environments ... as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.”
The PC Magazine website reported Zoom harassment campaigns were being organized openly online, and some participants are sharing recordings of their Zoom-bombing runs on YouTube and TikTok or livestreaming them on Twitch.
"We are deeply upset to hear about the incidents involving this type of attack,” a Zoom spokesperson told the Washington Examiner. "We take the security of Zoom meetings seriously," the representative said, adding the company “strongly encouraged” Zoom users to make full use of the app’s privacy settings.
The FBI has warned users not to make meetings of classrooms "public" and advised against sharing links to a teleconference or classroom.
"These new, mostly consumer use cases have helped us uncover unforeseen issues with our platform," Yuan wrote, adding that “dedicated journalists and security researchers have also helped to identify pre-existing ones.”
An analysis by ex-National Security Agency hacker Patrick Wardle, which was reported by TechCrunch, found that a cyberattacker who gains low-level access to a person’s computer could exploit Zoom’s “shady” software setup to inject malware to gain high-level access to the computer or could use Zoom’s webcam and microphone features to inject malicious code to gain access automatically to all of Zoom’s rights.

The tech-focused Bleeping Computer site reported that Zoom's chat feature for Windows is vulnerable to having its links manipulated to allow hackers to steal passwords from those who click on them.

A Zoom spokesperson admitted to the Intercept that “currently, it is not possible to enable [end-to-end] encryption for Zoom video meetings.”

The New York Times reported a “data-mining feature on Zoom” that “allowed some participants to surreptitiously access LinkedIn profile data about other users — without Zoom asking for their permission during the meeting or even notifying them that someone else was snooping on them.”

On Wednesday, Zoom said it was “acknowledging and apologizing for the confusion” around its encryption, removed the “attendee attention tracker feature” from the app, released “fixes” for issues raised by Wardle, unveiled a “fix” for the UNC link issue, and removed the LinkedIn app “after identifying unnecessary data disclosure.”
Last week, Motherboard reported “the iOS version of the Zoom app is sending some analytics data to Facebook, even if Zoom users don't have a Facebook account.” Zoom announced that “we will be removing the Facebook” tracking software, adding, “We sincerely apologize for this oversight.”

Earlier this week, the New York Times reported that New York Attorney General Letitia James sent a letter to Zoom, noting vulnerabilities “that could enable malicious third parties to, among other things, gain surreptitious access to consumer webcams” and asking for answers about “whether Zoom has undertaken a broader review of its security practices.”

A spokesperson for the office told the Washington Examiner the attorney general was working to “ensure the company is taking appropriate steps to ensure users’ privacy and security.”

No, liberal media outlets don’t have good reasons for ignoring Joe Biden’s accuser

Texto completo: Weeks have passed since former Senate staffer Tara Reade accused Joe Biden of sexually assaulting her in the 1990s. Her story alleging that the then-senator pushed her up against a wall and forcibly penetrated her with his hand in 1993 has been completely ignored by CNN, the New York Times, the Atlantic, and most other major liberal national media outlets. Only fringe left-wing sites and conservative media outlets have dedicated any attention to Reade’s story, even though Biden himself has previously embraced the standard that all female accusers should be heard.
Writing for Salon, left-wing journalist Amanda Marcotte tried to pull a blindfold over her audience’s eyes with an article attempting to explain away this double-standard.
Here’s some of what she wrote:
"There's a reason why mainstream journalists such as Ronan Farrow of the New Yorker and Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey of the New York Times — all Pulitzer Prize winners for their meticulous coverage of the 2017 Harvey Weinstein investigation — are so careful when reporting allegations of sexual harassment and assault. (Salon is not addressing any individual outlet's choice not to cover this specific story, but the general considerations typically involved in such a decision.) It's not just about fairness to the accused, but also to the accusers. Women who tell these stories inevitably get blasted by skeptics who pick their stories apart, so it's critical to their safety that the reporting holds up under close scrutiny. That's only going to be more true when the story has major political implications or confusing twists that could be interpreted as red flags — or both, like this one does. "The timeline shows that Reade's involvement in the online world of Bernie fandom coincided with her escalation of accusations against Biden. To be clear, this does not mean she's lying. But taken along with the other discrepancies in Reade's accounts — which are also, on their own, not reasons to discredit her — it's enough to make publications take a slow and careful approach to amplifying this story. "In light of these details, Salon concludes that mainstream outlets who are being criticized for not writing about Reade's allegations probably aren't making that choice because they're covering up for Joe Biden. What's more likely driving the silence — so far — is a genuine reluctance to dive into a story that contains such a high number of complicating factors and proves difficult to pin down, especially with the coronavirus emergency dominating the news cycle."
That's interesting — suddenly, responsible liberal journalists don't report on accusations that have “major political implications” or “confusing twists that could be interpreted as red flags.” At least, not when it’s a Democrat that’s accused!
Because when it was Brett Kavanaugh, there weren’t any “political implications"? It’s not as if the account of his accuser, Professor Christine Blasey-Ford, almost derailed his nomination to the highest court in the land or anything.
Marcotte's standard appears to be malleable to the point of nonexistence. Blasey-Ford’s story, after all, had its own red flags — no contemporaneous corroboration, no evidence, no recollection of the date or location of the alleged assault. That all seemed relevant at the time. It seemed to be a red flag when the witness Blasey-Ford said could back up her story had no recollection of it. In contrast, even Salon admits that Reade has two contemporary corroborating witnesses, whom journalists confirmed were told about the assault at the time Reade says it happened. So if Reade is just putting this on to help Bernie Sanders, she must have been plotting to help him for the better part of three decades.
Biden, just like Kavanaugh, deserves due process in the court of public opinion and the legal presumption of innocence. But it isn't too much to demand a bit of intellectual honesty and consistency in how the media treats accusations against political figures. To read Marcotte's sophomoric dismissal of this allegation as a news story is to understand the liberal media’s double standard.

Texto completo: Because the national media see every single thing through a warped lens of privilege and victimhood, it’s only natural that the New York Times editorial board would claim that illegal immigrants are unique sufferers of the coronavirus pandemic.
And of course, it’s President Trump’s fault because he’s apparently the only one who doesn’t like the idea of hundreds of thousands of poor and sick foreigners flooding into the country unaccounted for.
“Rounding up undocumented immigrants and shutting down the border is something President Trump has yearned to do since long before the coronavirus began its fateful spread,” moaned the Times. “And his animosity toward undocumented immigrants is affecting the efforts to contain the coronavirus far beyond the border.”
The word “animosity” is defined here as: Any enforcement of our laws and any policy directive meant to prevent people dumping themselves into the care of the American taxpayer. Unless we foot the bill to clothe, house, and feed every illegal immigrant who makes their way onto U.S. soil and claims asylum, we are victimizing them.
The Times continued, “Those who are not documented are afraid that going to a public health facility will expose them to ICE agents ... These immigrants are particularly at the mercy of the pandemic. They often live in crowded conditions, have little money and no paid sick leave, and so lack the ability to self-quarantine.”
This is supposed to be an argument against cracking down on the gaping hole in the United States known as the southern border when it’s actually the opposite. If we weren’t equipped to handle coronavirus outbreak testing and treatment for everyone here legally, both citizens and temporary residents from abroad, why would we have ever thought it acceptable to put ourselves at even greater risk by throwing the doors open to anyone and everyone else?
Thank the New York Times, the rest of the national media, and every single Democrat who ran for president this year for that bright idea. Oh, and every federal judge who hamstrung each attempt by the administration to close the holes in our immigration system, effectively turning our border into a welcome mat for the world’s destitute.
Now we’re all getting sick, and the Times wants still more people to be made comfortable coming into the U.S., where they will inevitably consume yet more of our already depleted medical resources. I can't wait. Thanks, New York Times!

Texto completo: Doctors and nurses responding to the COVID-19 pandemic are the superheroes of our age, putting themselves at risk to save the lives of others.
At least 61 doctors and nurses have died from the coronavirus in Italy so far. Already, in New York City alone, two nurses have died and more than 200 health workers are reported sick at a single major hospital.
These superheroes are at risk partly because we sometimes send them into battle without adequate personal protective equipment, or PPE. This should be a national scandal, and now hospitals are compounding the outrage by punishing staff members who speak up or simply try to keep themselves safe.
In Bellingham, Washington, an emergency room physician, Dr. Ming Lin, pleaded on social media for better protections for patients and the staff at PeaceHealth St. Joseph Medical Center, where he had worked for 17 years.
“I do fear for my staff,” Lin warned. “Morally, I think when you see something wrong, you have to speak out.”
The hospital responded by terminating Lin.
Lin told me that he had no regrets, but he asked supporters not to circulate petitions on his behalf for fear that such an effort would distract from managing the pandemic.
Charles Prosper, CEO of the hospital network, wouldn’t take my call, although he said in a statement that he regretted losing “such a long-standing and talented member of our medical staff.” The PeaceHealth board should recognize that its hospital has more need for an experienced ER doctor than for a bungling CEO.
Hospitals sometimes discourage staffers even from bringing their own protective gear, for fear of scaring patients or leaving other employees feeling unprotected. In New York City, Dr. Ania Ringwelski, an ER physician, was concerned by what she felt was insufficient PPE supplied by Weill Cornell Medical Center, so last week she obtained her own.
“I want to help out, but I need to feel protected,” Ringwelski told me. “I’m not expecting the hospital to provide it in this time of shortage, but if I can procure it on my own, then I’d like to be able to wear it.”
The hospital refused to allow this and sent her home. Her future is unclear.
Weill Cornell told me in a statement that it issues “appropriate” PPE and that it can’t allow doctors to bring their own “of unknown provenance and safety.” That’s a pretty patronizing way for hospital executives to treat professionals who are risking their lives.
In Chicago, a nurse, Lauri Mazurkiewicz, warned colleagues that standard face masks distributed by the hospital were not safe. She brought in her own higher-grade N95 mask — and was fired by Northwestern Memorial Hospital. She is now suing the hospital, which declined to comment except to tell me that its practices are safe.
In Texas, my colleague Matt Richtel reported on an anesthesiologist, Dr. Henry Nikicicz, who in effect was suspended without pay because he wore a mask in public places in the hospital. The hospital relented after it was asked for comment.
Tension arises not only because of shortages of PPE but also because of uncertainty about how much protection is optimal. No one knows. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has given conflicting advice, and other countries have varying standards. Singapore avoided infections with modest PPE, while Chinese doctors and nurses now use full-body coverings much more substantial than the protective clothing in the U.S.
Meanwhile, American health workers see colleagues falling sick. At Weill Cornell, a former ER doctor is now fighting for her life on a ventilator.
“We’re seeing our fellow caregivers getting sick, and we’re stressed out,” said another Weill Cornell emergency room physician, who feared being fired if his name were published. “Within one morning, I saw a gastroenterologist, an internist, a nurse and a pulmonologist” — he was talking about his patients — “and you want to protect yourself.”
It’s baffling that the richest country in the history of the world fails so abysmally at protecting its health workers, especially when it had two months’ lead time. And for hospitals now to retaliate against health workers who try to protect themselves — ousting them just when they are most needed — is both unconscionable and idiotic.
On websites like allnurses.com, nurses wonder whether they can refuse to work because of inadequate PPE or even whether they should quit the profession.
The doctors, nurses, technicians and cleaning staff members on the front of this pandemic deserve our eternal gratitude. Instead, we’re betraying them: They have our back, but we don’t have theirs.
“We still don’t have enough masks; we still don’t have enough gowns,” said a resident at a New York hospital who asked not to be named for fear of being punished. “Our necks are exposed, our hair is exposed, and our colleagues are getting sick.
“Many of my colleagues are making wills, and they’ve sent their families away. People are scared and rightfully so. We see it every day. We see the COVID people coming in, short of breath and dying right in front of us.”

Paul Krugman: Notes on the coronavirus

Texto completo: The economic contraction we’re experiencing is the fastest on record, by a large margin; we’ve probably lost as many jobs over the past two weeks as we did in the whole of the Great Recession. The policy response is also gigantic, several times as large a share of gross domestic product as the Obama stimulus.
But it seems to me that we’re still not having a very clear discussion of the economics of what’s happening, why we’re doing it and what implications all this will have for the longer term, once the pandemic ends. So I’ve been trying to think it through in terms of a simple model — not even one involving any explicit equations, although I don’t think that would be hard to do.
The main moral of this analysis is that what we should be doing — and to some extent what we are doing — is more like disaster relief than normal fiscal stimulus, although there’s a stimulus element too. This relief can and should be debt-financed. There may be a slight hangover from this borrowing, but it shouldn’t pose any major problems.
The nature of the problem
What we’re experiencing is not a conventional recession brought on by a slump in aggregate demand. Instead, we’re going into the economic equivalent of a medically induced coma, in which some brain functions are deliberately shut down to give the patient time to heal.
To simplify things, think of the economy as consisting of two sectors, nonessential services (N) that we can shut down to limit human interactions and hence the spread of the disease, and essential services (E) that we can’t (or perhaps don’t need to, because they don’t involve personal interaction.) We can and should close down the N sector until some combination of growing immunity, widespread testing to quickly find and isolate cases, and, if we’re very lucky, a vaccine let us return to normal life.
For those (like me) still receiving their regular paychecks, this period of shutdown — call it the coronacoma — will be annoying but not serious. I miss coffee shops and concerts, but can live without them for however long it takes.
Things will, however, be very different and dire for those who are deprived of their regular income while the coronacoma lasts. This group includes many workers and small businesses; it also includes state and local governments, which are required to balance their budgets but are seeing revenues collapse and expenses soar.
How big is the N sector? Miguel Faria-e-Castro of the St. Louis Fed summarizes estimates that are as good as any: 27 to 67 million people, which he averages to 47 million. That’s a lot; we could be looking at a temporary decline in real GDP of 30% or more. But that GDP decline isn’t the problem, since it’s a necessary counterpart of the social distancing we need to be doing.
The problem instead is how to limit the hardships facing those whose normal income has been cut off.
Disaster relief with a dash of stimulus
What can be done to help those cut off from their normal incomes during this period of national lockdown? They don’t need jobs — we don’t want them working at a time when normal work routines can spread a deadly disease. What they need, instead, is money. That is, what’s needed now is disaster relief, not economic stimulus.
OK, a few qualifications. Some idled workers may be able to switch to doing other things at fairly short notice — say, Uber drivers making deliveries for Amazon. But that can’t absorb more than a small fraction of the idled workforce.
A more important point is that if we fail to provide enough help to those afflicted by this crisis, they will be forced to sharply cut their spending even on goods and services we can still produce, leading to a gratuitous further rise in unemployment (and a multiplier process as laid-off workers cut spending even more.) So aid to those in the shutdown sector actually does include an element of conventional fiscal stimulus, even though that’s not its central goal.
Finally, the sudden shutdown of revenue streams for many businesses is creating financial stresses that resemble those of 2008-09, with prices of risky assets plunging and investors trying to pile into government bonds. So the Fed is right to be going all out — doing “whatever it takes” — to stabilize financial markets.
In other words, there are pieces of this crisis that resemble conventional recession-fighting. But the core issue remains disaster relief for those hit hardest by the lockdown.
How do we pay for relief?
Where will the government get the money for the $2 trillion bill that Congress has already passed, a bill that’s much better than nothing but still far short of what we should be doing? The answer is, borrow. Real interest rates on federal borrowing are negative; the markets are basically begging the feds to take their money.
But why is borrowing so cheap? Where’s the money coming from? The answer is private savings that have nowhere else to go. When we finally get data on what’s happening now, we’ll surely see a sharp rise in private saving, as people stop buying what they can’t, and a fall in private investment, because who’s going to build houses or office parks in a plague?
So the private sector is going to be running a huge financial surplus that’s available for government borrowing. And this is no time to worry, even slightly, about the level of government debt.
Still, the pandemic will eventually end. Will there be a debt hangover?
From the point of view of government solvency, none at all. We live in a world in which interest rates are consistently below the growth rate, so that government debt melts instead of snowballing. The government won’t have to pay back the money it’s borrowing, just return to a sustainable level of deficits ( not zero) and let the debt/GDP ratio decline over time.
There might, however, be a slight macroeconomic issue when the pandemic ends. The private sector will have added several trillion dollars to its wealth via more or less forced saving; between that wealth increase and, perhaps, pent-up demand, there might — might — be some inflationary overheating when things return to something like normal.
This may be a nonissue in an era of secular stagnation, when we might welcome the extra demand. Even if it is an issue, however, it’s unlikely, given the numbers, to be something the Fed can’t contain with modestly higher interest rates. You could imagine a world in which the costs of the immediate crisis eventually require some future fiscal austerity, but I don’t think we’re living in that world.
Let me summarize where we are. We’re facing a period of unknown length when much of the economy can and should be shut down. The principal goal of policy during this period should not be to boost GDP but to alleviate the hardship facing those deprived of their normal incomes. And the government can simply borrow the money it needs to do that.

Coronavirus Consequence: Crackdown on Press Freedom World-Wide; Hard-hit Iran and China have been among the most repressive, media groups say, but attacks on independent reporting have emerged widely

Texto completo: The spread of coronavirus has led to widespread clampdowns on press freedom around the world, with numerous governments seeking to rein in independent reporting on the virus in their countries, watchdog groups said.
Two of the countries among the hardest hit by the virus, China and Iran, have been among the most repressive, the groups said, cracking down on independent reporting and arresting citizens who have published social-media posts that contradicted official accounts.
Other countries are also limiting the free flow of information about the virus, including several Middle East nations, Russia, Belarus, Honduras, Venezuela and India, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists and Reporters Without Borders. In the highly repressive Central Asian country of Turkmenistan, the government has banned the use of the word coronavirus entirely, according to Turkmen living abroad.
Suppressing information during a pandemic can have wide-ranging impact as decision makers around the world look at how the contagion unfolded in earlier-hit nations to make their own policy decisions.
"This is a truly global event, so having a clear understanding of what is going on in every country that has been affected is vital," said Robert Mahoney, CPJ's deputy executive director. "Press freedom becomes even more important at times like this."
Problems also extend to the U.S., according to CPJ. It has criticized the office of Florida's governor, Ron DeSantis, for barring a statehouse reporter working for both the Miami Herald and Tampa Bay Times from attending a press conference on the coronavirus last week.
The papers said the reporter was given no explanation at the time; Mr. DeSantis's office later said in a statement that the event was done as a "pool report" where a small group of reporters attend and later share notes with others. A second statement said the event in question was open to all "that wished to attend." The office didn't respond to a request seeking clarification.
Other moves against journalists attributed at least in part to reasons besides pandemic reporting nonetheless have had the effect of curtailing coverage of the outbreak.
China last month revoked the press credentials of more than a dozen reporters from The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times and the Washington Post.
China says the March decision was in response to a move by the Trump administration to limit the number of reporters working for Chinese news outlets in the U.S.
In February, China had expelled three other Journal reporters , citing a headline on the paper's opinion page.
In an open letter to the Chinese government last week, the publishers of the Journal, Times and Post asked China to reconsider the expulsions during the global coronavirus pandemic, so as not "to deprive the world of critical information at a perilous moment."
China has also been accused of muzzling doctors who spoke out about the situation in Wuhan where the virus emerged and of censoring posts on social-media platforms about the virus.
Messages sent to the Chinese embassy in the U.S. weren't returned.
In Iran last month, four local journalists were arrested for posting comments on social media that challenged the official account of how the virus has been spreading, the watchdog groups said.
"The Iranians don't want any independent journalist looking at what is really going on," said Dokhi Fassihian, executive director of Reporters Without Borders in the U.S.
Several Iranians have also been brought in for questioning for social-media posts that cast doubt on the official death toll , Reporters Without Borders reported. In one case, a person was arrested after posting a widely shared video showing the bodies of 30 purported coronavirus victims in a morgue in the city of Qom, where the official death toll was far lower, the group said.
Over the past weekend, Iran suspended the publication of all printed newspapers in the country in what it said was an effort to halt the spread of the disease. The move came a week after Oman, Yemen, Jordan and Morocco stopped the printing and distribution of independent and state-owned newspapers to contain the virus, CPJ said.
Messages sent to the Iranian foreign ministry, London embassy and Mission to the United Nations weren't returned. A Jordanian official said the newspaper suspensions were done to help limit the spread of the virus, that reporters have been granted special permits to work, and that news outlets remain active online. Representatives for the governments of Oman, Yemen and Morocco didn't respond to messages seeking comment.
The editor of a news website in Belarus was arrested on alleged corruption charges after publishing an article critical of the government's response to the virus, Reporters Without Borders said .
In India, journalists reporting on a nationwide lockdown put in place last week were beaten by police in several cities, CPJ reported .

Last month, the Egyptian government said it revoked the press credential of a reporter for British newspaper the Guardian after she wrote an article citing a Canadian research paper that said the number of infected people in the country was likely far higher than the official figure. It also pressured the reporter to leave the country, according to a person familiar with the matter. The government also said it issued a warning to the New York Times's Cairo bureau chief for linking to the Canadian report on Twitter.
In Russia, the state media watchdog has forced some independent news outlets to take down articles about the virus outbreak under a law passed last year that bans "fake news."
A spokesman for the Russian embassy in Washington, D.C., said that the specific articles "fall within the scope of this law and have become subject to relevant procedures including a possibility to challenge a decision of the regulatory body in the court."
Messages sent to government representatives of Turkmenistan, Egypt, Honduras, Venezuela and Belarus weren't returned. A man who answered the phone at the Indian embassy in Washington said no one was available to comment.

Texto completo: A look at what other reputable news sources are reporting about the coronavirus pandemic.
Infected but Feeling Fine: The Unwitting Coronavirus Spreaders The director of the CDC says as many as 25% of people infected with COVID-19 may not show symptoms, leading the agency to reconsider its recommendations on wearing masks. The New York Times explains what it looks like to be asymptomatic and what this new information means for the spread of the virus.
How to Sew a Face Mask With the CDC reconsidering its recommendations on wearing face masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19, more of us might need to make our own. This tutorial from The New York Times is less complicated than some out there and does not require a sewing machine.
Underlying Health Disparities Could Mean Coronavirus Hits Some Communities Harder New data shows Americans with underlying health conditions such as heart disease and diabetes are more at risk for hospitalization and even death due to COVID-19. NPR and the Center for Public Integrity break down the numbers and examine what this means for low-income communities.
A Major Medical Staffing Company Just Slashed Benefits for Doctors and Nurses Fighting Coronavirus Emergency room doctors and nurses are working harder than ever on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic. But now many are seeing their compensation cut because the staffing companies they work for are losing revenue as hospitals postpone elective procedures and noncoronavirus-related treatments. ProPublica looks into Alteon Health, a staffing company backed by private-equity firm Frazier Healthcare Partners, and the increasingly common use of staffing companies in health care. Read the story here.
Not going coronavirus outbreak alone: Some find quarantine buddies to lessen isolation Many people are creating impromptu families during stay-at-home orders. Meet one "quarantine gang" of four young people who have agreed to see only each other. "This is all about limiting the number of new contacts in your life," Jeffrey Martin, an internist and professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at UC San Francisco, told the Los Angeles Times. "Of those people who you contact, they are a product of all their contacts. If you can keep that circle small, it doesn’t matter if you’re related or not." Read the story here.
Why We Waited So Long To Take The Coronavirus Seriously Steven Taylor, a professor, clinical psychologist and author of "The Psychology of Pandemics," talks about "optimism bias" and how it contributed to Americans’ slow grasp of the scale of the pandemic — and their refusal to just stay home — in this Q&A with HuffPost.

Texto completo: ASHEVILLE – Local officials are questioning numbers used in an MSNBC report that named Asheville as part of a potential "next wave" of COVID-19 cases.
The report by journalist Steve Kornacki on Brian Williams' "11th Hour" show alarmed local residents by including Asheville as one of 11 places on US map entitled "The Next Wave?"
Kornacki specifically called out Asheville among the nearly dozen metro areas where he said there had "been the largest rate of increase the last seven days."
"Are we going to be talking about places like Asheville, North Carolina; Mobile, Alabama; Toledo, Ohio?" he said.
Speaking at an April 1 video press conference, Fletcher Tove, Buncombe County's director of public health emergency preparedness, pushed back on the report, saying the percentage increase in the county's was large, but the actual number of cases, 25, was small for a county with more than 250,000 residents.
"That was a reflection of a very small data set that made it a bigger deal than it was," Tove said.
Kornacki didn't give specific data and also said the "raw numbers" of cases were not necessarily that big and that he could not be 100% certain a wave of cases were coming to the areas because of the large disparity in testing around the country.
"There is a lot of unevenness in data that is out there right now. So we were putting these together today. And the best thing I can say is we are looking at these because the numbers that we do have suggest these places have seen a big increase in the last few days."
According to county data, from March 23-30, cases rose from eight to 21. That represents a 163% jump, though it's just an increase of 13 cases. There has been one death.
At the April 1 press conference, Tove and County Health Department spokeswoman Stacey Wood said the quick increase in testing would also give the sense that there was a large jump.
"We've pushed testing, right?" Wood said. "We didn't have a lot of access to testing early on. And then we had our three days of community testing."
Kornacki didn't respond to messages sent by the Citizen Times through Twitter.
On March 31, Asheville spokeswoman Polly McDaniel, using the city's Twitter account, tweeted at Kornacki, saying "Hi Steve, can you please call us to discuss this clip? 828-774-7602. Thank you, really appreciate it."
McDaniel said Kornacki called her.
"I asked him what was his source for this reporting. He cited the New York Times coronavirus map," she said.
McDaniel said she sent his information to the Buncombe County Health Department.
New York Times data appears to show a change of 1 to 20 cases in Buncombe during that time period, with 22 cases as of April 1. It's not clear why those numbers are different than official county health department data.

Texto completo: Initially dismissed by some as a Miles Davis imitator, Mr. Roney, who has died of coronavirus complications, emerged as a major musician in his own right.
This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the coronavirus pandemic .
Wallace Roney, a virtuoso trumpeter whose term as Miles Davis's only true protégé opened onto a prominent career in jazz, died on Tuesday in Paterson, N.J. He was 59.
The cause was complications of the coronavirus, his fiancée, Dawn Jones, said.
By the time he linked up with Davis, Mr. Roney was already a leading voice in what came to be called the Young Lions movement, a coterie of young musicians devoted to bringing jazz back into line with its midcentury sound. And he was already associated -- sometimes distressingly so -- with Davis's legacy. Many dismissed him as a musical clone: ravishingly talented but lacking the necessary distance from his idol to claim creative agency.
Yet as his career went on, Mr. Roney managed to neutralize most of those criticisms. His nuanced understanding of Davis's playing -- its harmonic and rhythmic wirings as well as its smoldering tone -- was only part of a vast musical ken. His own style bespoke an investment in the entire lineage of jazz trumpet playing.
Most of the ideas in Mr. Roney's compositions began at the center of jazz's mainstream language and cut a path outward, often by way of funk, hip-hop, pop, Brazilian or Afro-Caribbean music.
Mr. Roney made nearly 20 albums as a bandleader, including three for Warner Bros. at the peak of the Young Lions era, all grounded in his unshakable linguistic command and his appetite for harmonic adventure. His recordings for Muse in the late 1980s and early '90s -- especially his 1987 debut, "Verses" -- featured a mix of A-list jazz musicians from Mr. Roney's generation and the one before, and they established him as a premier young bandleader.
In his New York Times review of a 1988 concert by the drummer Tony Williams's quintet, Jon Pareles singled out Mr. Roney as "the standout soloist, bitingly articulate at fast tempos and lucidly melodic in gentler passages."
Profiling Mr. Roney in The Washington Post in 1987, James McBride -- who later became a prizewinning novelist -- declared: "His name is Wallace Roney III. He is 27 years old. He is from Washington, and he is one of the best jazz trumpet players in the world."
The two albums that Mr. Roney released in the early 2000s, immediately after leaving Warner Bros., were among his most memorable, and more formally ambitious than his early work. They represented a flush of creativity after years of frustration under contract to a label that often imposed unwelcome creative demands.
On "No Room for Argument" (2000), released on Stretch Records, Mr. Roney struck a nimble balance between historical reverence and futurist adventure, pairing a synthesizer with a Fender Rhodes electric piano and, at one point, mashing up parts of John Coltrane's "A Love Supreme" with Davis's "Filles de Kilimanjaro." Its follow-up, "Prototype" (2004), for High Note, featured different sorts of homage: separate reworkings of the titular OutKast ballad and Al Green's "Let's Stay Together."
Mr. Roney won a Grammy in 1994 for his participation in "A Tribute to Miles," filling the trumpet chair alongside the four supporting members of Davis's second great quintet: Tony Williams, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock and Ron Carter. All were younger than Davis -- and indeed, throughout the latter half of his career, Davis worked almost exclusively with junior musicians. But before meeting Mr. Roney, he had never agreed to mentor another trumpet player.
Struck by Mr. Roney's performance at a 1983 tribute concert at Radio City Music Hall, Davis invited the young trumpeter to join him at his home in Manhattan the next day. A close friendship blossomed between the 23-year-old upstart and the ailing elder, one that culminated in a momentous performance at the 1991 Montreux Jazz Festival, just months before Davis's death. It was the only time Davis publicly revisited material from his back catalog.
With Quincy Jones conducting, the two trumpeters stood shoulder to shoulder in what would become a timeless piece of postclassic jazz iconography. Davis, wizened and wire-thin, hunched over a music stand alongside his burly young protégé, who picked up the slack whenever his idol missed a note.
"A lot of people like to say, 'Yeah, well, I hung with Miles, but we never talked about music,"' Mr. Roney said in a 2016 interview. "Well, guess what? I did. I loved him because of his music, and he talked to me about music all the time. You definitely had to earn Miles Davis's respect, and not everybody could do that."
Mr. Roney remembered that Davis -- whose birthday was just one day apart from his -- had once told him, "You look at me just like how I used to look at Dizzy," referring to his own mentor Dizzy Gillespie.

Wallace Roney III was born on May 25, 1960, in Philadelphia, to Roberta Sherman, a homemaker, and Wallace Roney Jr., a U.S. Marshal and vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees. His parents divorced when he was young, and he lived for a time with his grandmother, Rosezell Roney.
In his teens, he lived with his father in Washington, enrolling in the Duke Ellington School of the Arts. His father's friends were not professional musicians, but they had an abiding devotion to jazz. Mr. Roney often recalled that they would hold listening parties at which each person would listen closely to a different instrument as a track played, and then would compare notes.
The immersion in a music-loving family gave Mr. Roney a head start -- but he was also loaded with preternatural talent. He had perfect pitch, and he impressed his father by teaching himself the basics of the trumpet using the family's horn, which had been lying around unused. At 12, he became the youngest member of the Philadelphia Brass, a professional classical quintet.
By his midteens, he was already making trips to New York to perform. In his city debut, in 1976, he played at Ali's Alley, a loft space in SoHo.
"As soon as Mr. Roney commenced to swing, the noise level in the club immediately dropped off, and those in the middle of conversations or laughing and joking turned their attention to the bandstand," the critic Stanley Crouch later wrote of that show for a profile in The New York Times in 2000. In the youthful trumpeter's playing, Mr. Crouch wrote, "the passion for jazz was so thorough that the atmosphere inside the club was completely rearranged."
"At the end of the tune, the room took on a crazily jubilant mood, and the clapping wouldn't stop," Mr. Crouch added.
In addition to his fiancée, a vocalist and educator whom he had known since high school, and his grandmother Rosezell, Mr. Roney is survived by his sister, Crystal Roney; a brother, the saxophonist Antoine Roney; two half sisters, April Petus and Marla Majett; a half brother, Michael Majett; a son, Wallace Vernell Roney, a trumpeter now on the rise on the New York scene; and a daughter, Barbara Roney. His marriage to Geri Allen, a noted pianist and frequent musical collaborator during Mr. Roney's early career, ended in divorce.
In both 1979 and 1980, Mr. Roney won DownBeat magazine's award for best young jazz musician of the year. A decade later, he pulled off a similar double victory: He was voted trumpeter to watch in back-to-back DownBeat critics' polls in 1989 and 1990.
He attended both Howard University and Berklee College of Music before moving to New York City to pursue a career.
After years of lean times (jazz in particular was in a commercial slump for much of the 1980s), he received two separate calls within the same month inviting him to join the bands of Tony Williams and Art Blakey, both pre-eminent elder drummers. He spent years in both ensembles before his solo career took off.
Even in later years, Mr. Roney continued to balance his devotion to the greats of jazz's past with an urge to make his own way. In 2014, he starred in the public debut of "Universe," a large-ensemble suite that the saxophonist Wayne Shorter wrote for Davis in the late 1960s, but that had never been performed.
"I see my music as an extension of 'Nefertiti,' 'A Love Supreme,' Tony Williams's Lifetime, Herbie's sextet and Miles' last band," Mr. Roney said in a 2004 interview with JazzTimes.
"You could look at it as if Lifetime had a gig one night, and Miles sat in, and Wayne came and played, and Herbie played and wrote some arrangements, and Joe Zawinul came and sat in too, and Ron and Me'shell Ndegeocello played bass, and Prince, Sly Stone, Bennie Maupin and Mos Def dropped by," he said. "That's part of what I'm doing."
He added: "The other part is updating it with stuff that I hear today, the new synthesizers and the new sounds that appeal to me. I bring all those elements together and still try to play what I consider straight-ahead, innovative music."

Texto completo: President Trump has made contentious exchanges with reporters a feature of his daily coronavirus briefings, often using personal invective to bulldoze past questions about shortfalls with masks, ventilators and testing and his own past statements.
But he has shown an altogether different response to one lesser-known media outlet that he has turned to repeatedly as a safety net, frequently citing it by name:
"OAN, please."

At one recent briefing, Trump called on the outlet twice and elicited two versions of the same question -- or statement.
"Mr. President, your approval ratings have been the highest they've ever been, as well as the ratings on your handling of the virus," Jenn Pellegrino, the OAN correspondent seated among the press, said Sunday. "Yet there are some networks that are saying they're debating whether or not to carry these briefings live. Do you think there's a link between the two?"
"Well, I don't know. I know that -- boy, that's a nice question," Trump said. "Thank you very much."
Minutes later, after he harshly criticized two other reporters who asked about his past comments by reading them aloud -- he blasted Yamiche Alcindor of PBS for a "nasty question" and urged her to "be nice," and then reprimanded Jeremy Diamond of CNN as producing "fake news" -- he called on Pellegrino a second time.
She largely rephrased the same question she had asked moments before.
"What do you say to these detractors?" she asked.
Trump responded with a 463-word soliloquy in which he singled out three news organizations (CNN, the Washington Post and the New York Times) for criticism and insisted he wasn't interested in his television ratings, before noting that the New York Times had reported his ratings rivaled those of football games, and then portraying himself as a victim of media censorship.
"I think it's terrible. When they don't want the president of the United States to have a voice, you're not talking about democracy any longer," Trump said. "Thank you very much."
At Monday's news briefing, OAN's correspondent, Chanel Rion, seemingly went too far even for Trump, noting that the number of people who have died from the coronavirus was fewer than the number of fetuses killed in elective abortions and asking him to comment.
Trump demurred.
"What you're mentioning has been going on for a long time," he said. "It's a sad event -- lot of sad events in this country, but what we're doing now, we're working on the virus."
On Tuesday, Trump again called on Rion, who asked about one of the president's favorite subjects, the possible use of an existing drug as a remedy for COVID-19.
Rion was standing in the back of the briefing room. Under temporary rules implemented by the White House Correspondents' Assn. to handle the current health emergency, only 14 reporters are allowed to attend the briefing each day and are spaced out across the room's 49 seats, with others barred from standing in the aisles. News outlets rotate the assignment.
Before Tuesday's briefing began, a representative of the correspondents association asked Rion to leave the room because it wasn't her day to attend, but she refused, claiming she was there "as a guest of Stephanie Grisham," the White House press secretary, according to reporters familiar with the exchange.
Neither Grisham nor Rion responded to requests for comment.
On Wednesday, after Rion again attended the briefing and stood in the back of the room in violation of the social distancing rules, the board of the correspondents organization voted to remove OAN from the seat rotation.
"We do not take this action lightly," the board wrote in a statement announcing the decision, which did not name OAN. "This is a matter of public safety."
Rion had similarly flouted the rules in late October, when she showed up one Sunday morning in the press pool -- the rotating group of seven reporters given access, along with photographers, to the president's Oval Office appearances, bill signings and some meetings -- on a day when she was not in the rotation. Hours earlier, a U.S. special forces raid had killed the leader of Islamic State, Abu Bakr Baghdadi.
Trump made a point of complimenting Rion after she posed a question about whether his withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria weeks earlier was related to the raid.
"It's a great question," Trump responded. "And you're doing a great job, by the way. Your network is fantastic. They're really doing a great job. Please let them know."
Afterward, when other reporters inquired about Rion's presence, administration aides insisted that she had not been specially invited and was merely "confused" about how the pool rotations worked.
One America News, based in San Diego, was founded in 2013 by Robert Herring Sr., a businessman who made millions with a company that manufactures circuit boards before going into media. The network has considerably less reach than the major cable news networks -- appearing on many fewer cable systems.
According to five administration officials and outside allies of the president, Trump's elevation of it has much to do with the biggest organization in the conservative news ecosystem.
"He often gets upset with Fox when their coverage isn't as positive as he thinks it should be," one official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "Pumping up OAN sends a message to Fox to stay in line."
In an email, Charles Herring, the founder's son and the president of OAN, wrote that the mission of his network's White House coverage "is to provide fact-based coverage of the administration's latest and breaking news."
Asked about the network's perceived pro-Trump bent, he added: "We generally don't worry about or respond to media & advocacy critics. We focus on our mission. We value feedback from our audience and critique our coverage on an ongoing basis."
OAN, Herring said, has a reporter at the White House seven days a week. The network's persistent presence during a period when other organizations have stayed away because of health concerns has increased its visibility, especially now with Trump's daily coronavirus briefings.
Even before this, however, Trump had made a point of elevating OAN's visibility, sometimes at Fox's expense. At a November news conference in the East Room, for example, Trump appeared alongside Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The event was a "two and two" in press corps parlance, meaning that the leaders would each take questions from two U.S. journalists and two Turkish journalists.
Trump, the official noted, called on OAN first before calling on Fox. When it came time for Erdogan to select a reporter, the president urged him to choose "a friendly person from Turkey."
"Friendly," he riffed. "Only friendly reporters we like to see."
Rion lists OAN third on a bio page on her website that describes her as an author and political illustrator and features photographs of her socializing with the president and first lady, as well as the president's daughter Ivanka Trump.
Her cartoons have drawn attention for advancing conspiracies popular on the right fringe, including Pizzagate -- the belief that prominent Democrats ran a child-sex ring from the basement of a Washington, D.C., pizza parlor -- and the suggestion that Hillary Clinton was behind the killing of Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich, something that police have concluded was a botched robbery.

Texto completo: He transformed the university into a national institution and played a major civic role as the overseer of New York City's public campaign finance law.
The Rev. Joseph A. O'Hare, who as the longest-serving president of Fordham University transformed it into a national institution and applied the moral rectitude of his clerical collar to civic reform in New York City, died on Sunday in the Bronx. He was 89.
His nephew William Scesney said he died from complications of liver cancer at Murray-Weigel Hall, a Jesuit retirement home and infirmary on the Fordham campus.
A plain-spoken priest, Father O'Hare created a core curriculum at Fordham; integrated the campuses at Rose Hill in the Bronx and Lincoln Center in Manhattan; and increased the Jesuit-run university's endowment more than sevenfold.
He oversaw the construction of a $ 54 million neo-Gothic research library and transformed Fordham into a residential university by building four dormitories (including one now named O'Hare Hall) in the Bronx and a 20-story residence in Manhattan to house another 3,500 students.
Father O'Hare, who served from 1984 to 2003, was Fordham's 31st president. He was also the only one born in the Bronx since the university was founded in 1841.
His priestly status proved an asset for the mayors who recruited him to civic service.
He served on two commissions to revise the New York City Charter; a panel to expunge politics from mayoral appointments; and, most notably, the city's pioneering Campaign Finance Board, created in 1988 in the wake of municipal corruption scandals. Appointed the board's first chairman by Mayor Edward I. Koch to oversee the city's innovative program of public-campaign financing for municipal offices, he also served under three of Mr. Koch's successors before retiring in 2003.
"Joe O'Hare's unquestioned integrity, gravitas, nonpartisanship, intelligence, wit and, yes, the fact that he was a Jesuit priest, commanded instant respect for the board in an arena fraught with political challenges," Nicole Gordon, the board's longtime executive director, said in an email.
Father O'Hare publicly rebuffed challenges from Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's administration, Ms. Gordon said, and "set the standard for fair and impartial implementation of reform in government."
As Fordham's president, and as the only educator to serve as chairman of both the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities and the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities, Father O'Hare found himself, more often than he liked, refereeing rifts in the church over dogma and academic freedom, differences between American bishops and the Vatican, and ideological conflicts among an increasingly diverse student body about issues like abortion and gay rights.
While acknowledging his own orthodox moral position, he tolerated a decision by the student government to recognize groups that discussed or promoted an "enlightened understanding" of both those issues.
Similarly, he defended the right of American bishops to denounce abortion, just as they did racial injustice or the nuclear arms race.
"It is neither anti‐Catholic nor un-American to argue against the bishops in this debate," he wrote of abortion in a New York Times Op-Ed article in 1976, "but to question their right to be heard is a persistent form of bigotry."
Still, he said he bristled when some Catholic politicians who dissented from doctrine were threatened with excommunication.
"It's unfortunate for the bishops to equate pro-choice with pro-abortion," he told The New York Times in 1990. "That's too broad a label to apply to Catholic politicians."
That same year, he expressed relief when Pope John Paul II issued a document on education that urged Catholic universities to maintain their fidelity to Catholic education, but that also recognized the legitimacy of academic freedom, institutional autonomy and the latitude to hire non-Catholic faculty. (In 1984, the Fordham faculty included 70 Jesuits; today, about 24 Jesuits are teachers and administrators.)
In a meeting with Vatican officials, Father O'Hare said, Catholic educators stated "loud and clear that universities all around the world were concerned about not having universal prescriptions from Rome."
Father O'Hare melded amiability with common sense.
"Joe combined Jesuit humanism with Bronx street smarts," the author Peter Quinn, a Fordham graduate, said in an email. "He was a serious intellectual who refused to take himself too seriously. He never lost his New York accent or his Irish sense of humor. He knew how to laugh and how to lead."
Father O'Hare's common-sense approach became apparent to the public in his role on the finance board under Mr. Koch; David N. Dinkins, who was fined by the board for excessive spending and, at the end of his mayoralty, fired him; Mr. Giuliani, who reinstated him, but was later also fined; and Michael R. Bloomberg.
"In a city of legendary Irish pols," Mr. Bloomberg said of Father O'Hare in a statement this week, "one of the very best never ran for office -- but he left a mark on politics like no other."
Rectitude, however, did not necessarily denote reticence.
At a finance board meeting in 2001, the irascible political consultant Hank Morris insisted that he could volunteer his services to his friend Alan G. Hevesi, who was running for mayor, and that therefore the monetary value of those services should not be covered by the legal cap on campaign spending. A verbal tussle at a public hearing culminated in Mr. Morris's threat to take the case to court. Father O'Hare was unfazed.
"So sue me," he retorted. "Go ahead." Mr. Hevesi eventually paid for Mr. Morris's services.
Jack Newfield, writing in The New York Post, characterized Father O'Hare as "the conscience of campaign finance reform and walking gravitas."
Joseph Aloysius O'Hare Jr. was born on Feb. 12, 1931, in the West Bronx, a grandson of Irish immigrants. His father was a member of the New York City Police Department's mounted patrol. (His maternal grandfather, also a police officer, was shot dead in 1904 during the burglary of a Manhattan bakery.) His mother, Marie (Enright) O'Hare, was a public-school teacher and guidance counselor. He had a brother, Gerard, and a sister, Marie O'Hare Scesney, who both died before him.
"His native New York gave him a directness, a maturity and a no-nonsense wisdom," the Rev. J. Donald Monan, a former president of Boston College, said.
After graduating from Regis High School in Manhattan, Father O'Hare joined the Society of Jesus at 17.
"When I decided I wanted to be a Jesuit, the models that attracted me the most were the labor priests, like Father John Corridan," he told The Times in 1998, referring to the crusader against corruption on whom Karl Malden's character in the movie "On the Waterfront" was loosely based. "It's not an otherworldly kind of spirituality -- it's the kind very geared to involvement in the present time."
In 1954 he graduated with a bachelor's degree from Berchmans College in Cebu City, the Philippines, where he had been assigned by the Jesuits. He received a master's degree from the college the next year. He taught at Ateneo de Manila University, a Jesuit school there.
Father O'Hare also received licentiate degrees in philosophy and theology from Woodstock College in Maryland. In 1968 he received a doctorate in philosophy from Fordham.
From 1975 until he became president of Fordham, he was the editor in chief of America, the influential Jesuit magazine. (He returned there as associate editor after leaving Fordham and also briefly served as president of Regis.)
Inheriting an 85-acre campus in the Bronx, a borough that was then synonymous with crime and poverty, Father O'Hare added 1.1 million square feet of academic and residential space in the Bronx and Manhattan and merged Fordham with Marymount College, a traditionally Catholic women's institution in Tarrytown, N.Y., in 2002.
He wooed the Rev. Avery Dulles, an eminent theologian, to a new professorship in religion and society in the theology department. In February 2001, Pope John Paul II named Father Dulles a cardinal -- a rare appointment for a theologian and cleric who was not a bishop.
Before Father O'Hare became president, 70 percent or more of Fordham's students were commuters; when he left, 70 percent lived on campus. As recently as the 1970s, as many as 85 percent of the students came from New York City or nearby suburbs. Today, about 60 percent are from out of state.
"Father O'Hare leaves behind a record of expansion and building that any of his predecessors might envy," said Msgr. Thomas J. Shelley, emeritus professor of church history at Fordham and author of "Fordham, a History of the Jesuit University of New York: 1841-2003" (2016).
As Father O'Hare saw it, building for succeeding generations was integral to his conception of belief.
"You can betray your faith, religious faith, personal faith, academic faith," he once said, "by trying to hold on to some frozen moment of the past. You have to keep your faith alive by bringing it forward into the future."

Texto completo: Dr. Fauci has become a target of online conspiracy theorists after advocating social distancing rules.
WASHINGTON -- Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation's leading expert on infectious diseases, who has become a regular at President Trump's coronavirus briefings, will receive enhanced personal security after receiving threats following his repeated pleas for Americans to help slow the spread of the deadly pandemic, officials said on Wednesday.
Dr. Fauci has been the Trump administration's most outspoken advocate of social distancing rules that have shuttered the nation's schools, forced businesses to close, kept people in their homes and battered the United States economy.
That has made him a target of online conspiracy theorists who have accused Dr. Fauci, a longtime scientist and civil servant who has served presidents of both parties, of trying to undermine Mr. Trump during a year in which the president is fighting for re-election.
The Department of Health and Human Services granted the enhanced personal security for Dr. Fauci, 79, after the Justice Department signed off on a request for extra agents to guard him, officials said. Alex M. Azar II, the health and human services secretary, had grown worried that the threats against the doctor were increasing as more of the country shut down in response to the coronavirus.
"Yesterday, upon the recommendation of the U.S. Marshals Service, the department approved the special deputization request from H.H.S. for nine H.H.S.-O.I.G. special agents to provide protective services for Dr. Fauci," the Justice Department said in a statement, referring to the Office of the Inspector General at the health department. The Washington Post first reported the news of the enhanced security.
Caitlin Oakley, a spokeswoman for the health department, would not confirm Dr. Fauci's enhanced security but called him "an integral part of the U.S. government's response against Covid-19," referring to the disease caused by the coronavirus.
"Among other efforts," she added, "he is leading the development of a Covid-19 vaccine and he regularly appears at White House press briefings and media interviews."
The coronavirus could kill 100,000 to more than 200,000 Americans in the coming weeks. Dr. Fauci, along with a fellow task force member, Dr. Deborah L. Birx, encouraged Mr. Trump to extend the amount of time that the country would remain shuttered through the end of this month. Some states, like Virginia, have issued stay-at-home orders that do not expire until further into the spring.
The idea that Dr. Fauci is responsible for the country's hardship -- and for whatever political damage Mr. Trump might suffer as a result -- was fueled in part by a moment during a news briefing in which Dr. Fauci dropped his head and touched his forehead as the president was speaking. The image went viral online and right-wing supporters of Mr. Trump cited it as evidence that Dr. Fauci sought to undercut the president.
One anti-Fauci Twitter post last week said, "Sorry liberals but we don't trust Dr. Anthony Fauci."
The hashtag #FauciFraud has been used by more than 70 Twitter accounts, some posting hundreds of times a day, according to an analysis by The New York Times. Criticism of Dr. Fauci has also come from leading conservative voices and supporters of Mr. Trump, including Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, a conservative group; Bill Mitchell, the host of the far-right online talk show "YourVoice America"; and Shiva Ayyadurai, who has falsely claimed to be the inventor of email.
But Mr. Trump himself has praised the doctor. During Wednesday's briefing, when a reporter asked about Dr. Fauci's personal security, the president said: "He doesn't need security. Everybody loves him."
In fact, Dr. Fauci has earned plaudits from many medical experts and public health officials for his often grim assessment of the threats facing the United States from the coronavirus -- even sometimes contradicting the president's rosier outlook.
For weeks, Dr. Fauci's remarks on television and at the White House stood in sharp contrast to the commentary from Mr. Trump's fiercest supporters on Fox News, whose leading hosts repeatedly claimed that Democrats, the news media and public health experts were inflating the threat of the virus.
After the viral video of Dr. Fauci lowering his head, online attacks against him increased. A seven-year-old email that he wrote to an aide of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's was posted online by The American Thinker, a conservative blog. In the email, Dr. Fauci praised Mrs. Clinton for her stamina during hearings into the 2012 attacks on the American compound in Benghazi, Libya. The blog suggested falsely that the email proved that Dr. Fauci was part of a secret group who opposed Mr. Trump.
Ironically, in the past several days, the president has largely adopted Dr. Fauci's more dire warnings about the dangers of the rapidly spreading virus. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump called it a "great national trial unlike any we have ever faced before" and echoed Dr. Fauci's language about the need to minimize its spread.
"It's a matter of life and death, frankly," Mr. Trump said, offering a sober assessment of the pandemic's effect. "It's a matter of life and death."

Texto completo: The United Nations plans to postpone a pivotal climate conference scheduled for November amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, delaying an international effort to head off the worst consequences of climate change.
The gathering, scheduled to be hosted by the United Kingdom in November in Glasgow, was envisioned as a moment for nations to offer more ambitious plans to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and transition away from reliance on fossil fuels.
The arena where the massive event was to take place, the SEC Centre, is being converted into a field hospital for patients with COVID-19, the Scottish government said this week.
The postponement of the meeting comes as global emissions have continued to rise, although many specialists now think that trend will temporarily reverse due to the pandemic and its impact on global travel, energy use, and the economy. In 2019, emissions are estimated to have set a new all-time high of 36.8 billion tons of carbon dioxide.
Officials said the UN gathering is likely to be rescheduled for the middle of 2021, although no date has been set.

Iran says US sanctions are taking lives; US disagrees
As Iran struggles with a devastating coronavirus outbreak, a broken economy, and a severe shortage of medical equipment, it says that US trade sanctions are taking Iranian lives and has called for the United States to lift them on humanitarian grounds.
Iran's plea is gaining traction around the globe, winning support from allies like Russia and China, but also the European Union, the United Nations secretary-general, rights groups, and nearly three dozen members of Congress, who have appealed to the Trump administration to suspend the sanctions.
Iran, a global epicenter of the virus, has confirmed more than 47,000 cases and more than 3,000 deaths, although public health specialists estimate the real toll to be several times higher.
In a sign of desperation, Iran requested a $5 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund, the first time it has applied for such a loan since the 1960s. The European Union has said it would support the loan, but the United States is expected to block it.

What's known, not known about China's virus numbers
BEIJING — Every few days brings another grim milestone in the outbreak. First Italy and Spain surpassed China in reported deaths. Then, this week, the United States and France did.
But did they really?
Skepticism about China's numbers has swirled throughout the crisis, fueled by official efforts to quash bad news in the early days and a general distrust of the government. Long lines of people waiting to collect the ashes of loved ones at funeral homes last week revived the debate.
There is no smoking gun pointing to a coverup by China's ruling Communist Party. But intentional or not, there is reason to believe that more people died of COVID-19 than the official tally, which stood at 3,312 at the end of Tuesday. The same applies to the 81,554 confirmed cases.
“The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 by country appears like a grim league table and draws the attention of many," said Hsu Li Yang, who heads the infectious diseases program at the National University of Singapore. “However, it is important to understand that these numbers – be it from China, Italy, Singapore, or the USA – are all inaccurate, and they are all underestimates to varying degrees of the actual number of infections."

Saudi Arabia asks Muslims to put hajj plans on hold
Saudi Arabia asked Muslims to put on hold plans to perform the obligatory annual hajj pilgrimage this year as the kingdom grapples with the coronavirus.
"We have asked our Muslim brothers around the world to wait" on making hajj plans "until there is clarity," Mohammad Benten, the minister of hajj and umrah, told state-run Al Ekhbariya TV.
Saudi Arabia reported 110 cases of the virus on Tuesday, bringing the total to 1,563, including 10 deaths. Halting the hajj, which attracts millions of pilgrims to Islam's birthplace, would be unprecedented in recent history. The kingdom suspended the lesser, non-obligatory umrah pilgrimage last month.
The country has put the holy cities of Mecca and Medina on lockdown. The hajj is due begin in late July.

Weather forecasts are at risk from COVID-19 lockdowns
The coronavirus pandemic has brought global commerce to a near standstill. Now it's threatening to obscure the ability to even make forecasts based on weather data.
The World Meteorological Organization said it's concerned about the virus's impact on the quality and quantity of weather observations and forecasts. Maintenance on satellite systems and weather stations could be affected if lockdowns continue in the coming weeks.
Accurate weather predictions are critical for commodities markets including agriculture, natural gas, electricity, and coal. Farmers and food-crop traders rely on forecasts for planting schedules and prices. Gas markets are particularly sensitive to weather data to help predict demand.
The amount of weather-related information collected from commercial aircraft has already plummeted as airlines across the globe ground flights.
The Geneva-based organization is monitoring the situation and is working with member states to mitigate the impact, it said.

Edinburgh's summer fests canceled for the first time
LONDON — Every August, the Scottish capital of Edinburgh plays host to some of the funniest and most talented — not to forget strangest — performers from the UK and the wider world. Not this year. Organizers canceled the city's collection of late summer festivals Wednesday.
The decision marks the first cancellation since the Edinburgh International Festival launched in 1947 in the aftermath of World War II as an attempt to reconcile people and nations through the performing arts.
Now numbering five, including the wildly popular Fringe lineup of both obscure and mainstream acts, Edinburgh's annual August festivals draw 4.4 million people to more than 5,000 events involving over 25,000 artists, writers, and performers from 70 countries, according to organizers.
Collectively, the festivals are billed as the second-biggest cultural event in the world after the Olympic Games, which were set to take place in Tokyo before the pandemic forced a postponement last week.

Bolsonaro, isolated and defiant, dismisses threat to Brazil
RIO DE JANEIRO — As cases and deaths mount in Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro has remained defiant, the last notable holdout among major world leaders in denying the severity of the coronavirus.
Brazilians, he declared last week, are uniquely suited to weather the pandemic because they can be dunked in raw sewage and “don't catch a thing."
Defying guidelines issued by his own health ministry, the president on Sunday visited a busy commercial district in Brasília, the capital, where he called on all but elderly Brazilians to get back to work.
Then he insisted that an antimalaria pill of unproved efficacy would cure those who fall ill.
“God is Brazilian," he told a throng of supporters. “The cure is right there."
Several world leaders — among them President Trump — were slow to grasp the menace of the highly contagious virus, and reluctant to embrace disruptive and economically painful social distancing measures that have become the norm in much of the world.
But Bolsonaro remains the highest profile holdout in eschewing the scientific consensus on the lockdown measures required to keep health care systems from being overwhelmed.

Texto completo: The White House’s current goal is to prevent coronavirus-related deaths from numbering in the millions.

It is not the administration’s “goal” that somewhere between 100,000 and 240,000 die from this viral pandemic. That should be obvious, but some on social media took that message away from a viral tweet by a New York Times reporter this week.

President Trump and Drs. Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx held another press briefing Tuesday to discuss the White House’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. During the briefing, the White House displayed a chart titled “Goal of community mitigation.”

The chart, whose purpose was to explain the administration's efforts to “flatten the curve,” showed the difference between a pandemic outbreak with no intervention versus a pandemic outbreak with intervention. To underscore the contrast between the two approaches, the chart included projected death counts: 1.5 to 2.2 million deaths with no intervention and 100,000 to 240,000 deaths with intervention. The "goal" of "community mitigation," then, is to ensure that the death toll does not number in the millions, the chart explains.

New York Times national political reporter Shane Goldmacher captured the moment on social media, tweeting to his 58,000 social media followers: “This White House briefing room slide lists as ‘goals’ 100,000 to 240,000 deaths. Breathtaking.”
Tweet
Again, the White House graphic highlighted by Goldmacher was about the goal of “community mitigation.” The administration's operating model for deaths was not even introduced until later in the briefing by Birx.
For reference, that second chart outlining the White House’s operating model for deaths looked like this:
2.png
As of this writing, Goldmacher's tweet has been shared by more than 11,700 social media users, including New York Times White House correspondent Maggie Haberman, New York Times White House correspondent Katie Rogers, the New Yorker’s Susan Glasser, GQ’s Julia Ioffe, Vox’s Dylan Matthews, and NBC News’s Tom Winter.
Goldmacher’s emphasis on the word “goal” has left some with the impression that getting to 240,000 deaths is the White House’s objective, as opposed to preventing 2.2 million deaths.
“‘Goals.’ Stunning,” the New Yorker’s Paige Williams said in response to the viral tweet.
Ad Age’s Tam Nguyen said, “People dying should never be a ‘goal.’”
“Hashtag death goals,” quipped Vice’s Susan Rinkunas.
The more Goldmacher’s tweet is shared, the more the mischaracterization is shared, too, and journalists seem most apt to get it wrong. Almost as bad as people misunderstanding the graphic is that some in the press have gone beyond merely sharing the tweet. Some — including the New York Times’s Nikole Hannah-Jones, who only recently learned the difference between “some” and “all” — are defending Goldmacher’s presentation of the White House graphic even after questions have been raised about whether his remarks are misleading.
He “literally wrote what was on the slide that you can see with your own eyes," Hannah-Jones said in defense of her colleague.
Whatever Goldmacher’s intention, his tweet has gone viral, and the meaning of the White House’s “community mitigation” chart is being misinterpreted by reporters, pundits, politicians — you name it.
So, just to make sure there is no confusion: Death is not the White House’s “goal.” Community mitigation is.

Paul Krugman: This land of denial and death

Texto completo: Death comes at you fast. Just three weeks ago the official line at the White House and Fox News was that the coronavirus was no big deal, that claims to the contrary were a politically motivated hoax perpetrated by people out to get Donald Trump. Now we have a full-blown health crisis in New York, and all indications are that many other cities will soon find themselves in the same situation.
And it will almost certainly get much worse. The United States is on the worst trajectory of any advanced country — yes, worse than Italy at the same stage of the pandemic — with confirmed cases doubling every three days.
I’m not sure that people understand, even now, what that kind of exponential growth implies. But if cases kept growing at their current rate for a month, they would increase by a factor of a thousand, and almost half of Americans would be infected.
We hope that won’t happen. Many, although not all, states have gone into lockdown, and both epidemiological models and some early evidence suggest that this will “flatten the curve,” that is, substantially slow the virus’ spread. But as we wait to see just how bad our national nightmare will get, it’s worth stepping back for a few minutes to ask why America has handled this crisis so badly.
Incredibly bad leadership at the top is clearly an important factor. Thousands of Americans are dying, and the president is boasting about his TV ratings.
But this isn’t just about one man. Neither the scientific denial that crippled the initial response to this pandemic, nor the tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths that now seem likely, are unique to COVID-19. Among advanced countries, the U.S. has long stood out as the land of denial and death. It’s just that we’re now seeing these national character flaws play out at a vastly accelerated rate.
About denial: Epidemiologists trying to get a handle on the coronavirus threat appear to have been caught off guard by the immediate politicization of their work, the claims that they were perpetrating a hoax designed to hurt Trump, or promote socialism, or something. But they should have expected that reaction, since climate scientists have faced the same accusations for years.
And while climate-change denial is a worldwide phenomenon, its epicenter is clearly here in America: Republicans are the world’s only major climate-denialist party.
Nor is climate science the only thing they reject; not one of the candidates contending for the GOP’s 2016 nomination was willing to endorse the theory of evolution.
What lies behind Republican science denial? The answer seems to be a combination of fealty to special interests and fealty to evangelical Christian leaders like Jerry Falwell Jr., who dismissed the coronavirus as a plot against Trump, then reopened his university despite health officials’ warnings, and seems to have created his own personal viral hot spot.
The point, in any case, is that decades of science denial on multiple fronts set the stage for the virus denial that paralyzed U.S. policy during the crucial early weeks of the current pandemic.
About death: I still sometimes encounter people convinced that America has the world’s highest life expectancy. After all, aren’t we the world’s greatest nation? In fact, we have the lowest life expectancy among advanced countries, and the gap has been steadily widening for decades.
This widening gap, in turn, surely reflects both America’s unique lack of universal health insurance and its equally unique surge in “deaths of despair” — deaths from drugs, alcohol and suicide — among working-class whites who have seen economic opportunities disappear.
Is there a link between the hundreds of thousands of excess deaths we suffer every year compared with other rich countries and the tens of thousands of additional excess deaths we’re about to suffer from the coronavirus? The answer is surely yes.
In particular, when we conduct a post-mortem on this pandemic — a stock phrase that, in this case, isn’t a metaphor — we’ll probably find that the same hostility to government that routinely undermines efforts to help Americans in need played a crucial role in slowing an effective response to the current crisis.
What about the larger picture? Is there a link between the uniquely American prevalence of science denial and America’s uniquely high mortality? To be honest, I’m still trying to figure this out.
One possible story is that the U.S. political landscape gives special power to the anti-science religious right, which has lent its support to anti-government politicians. But I’m not sure whether this is the whole story, and the power of people like Falwell is itself a phenomenon that demands explanation.
In any case, the point is that while America is a great nation with a glorious history and much to be proud of — I consider myself very much a patriot — the rise of the hard right has, as I said, also turned it into a land of denial and death. This transformation has been taking place gradually over the past few decades; it’s just that now we’re watching the consequences on fast forward.

Michelle Goldberg: Trump says to governors, ‘I’d like you to do us a favor, though’

Texto completo: Last December, during a congressional hearing on impeachment, Stanford Law professor Pamela Karlan tried to explain the gravity of Donald Trump’s Ukraine quid pro quo by making a domestic analogy.
Members of Congress, she said, should imagine living in a state “prone to devastating hurricanes and flooding.” What would they think, she asked, if their governor requested a meeting with the president to talk about disaster assistance, and he replied, “I would like you to do us a favor”?
Karlan seemed to assume that the grotesquerie of this hypothetical would be obvious. Now, with American life upended by coronavirus, her flagrantly corrupt scenario has come close to reality.
True, Trump is not demanding that governors investigate Joe Biden in exchange for federal help. But he’s strongly suggested that if governors speak candidly about his monumental incompetence, he’ll penalize them and their states as they struggle to contain the coronavirus. Once again, he’s using his control of vital aid to extort assistance with his reelection.
“There are a lot of parallels between the president’s behavior now and during the whole Ukraine scandal,” Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who led Trump’s impeachment prosecution, told me. “Certainly the most apparent is his demand that the governors basically pay fealty to him, praise him, or they’ll suffer consequences.”
At a news conference last week, Trump said that he had instructed Vice President Mike Pence, whom he has placed in charge of the coronavirus response, not to call the governors of some blue states where the pandemic is raging. “I say: ‘Mike, don’t call the governor of Washington. You’re wasting your time with him. Don’t call the woman in Michigan,’” he said, adding, “If they don’t treat you right, I don’t call.”
“The woman in Michigan,” of course, is Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, whose state has one of the nation’s most brutal coronavirus outbreaks. Trump’s contempt for Whitmer isn’t surprising, given his well-documented disdain for female leaders. As he weighed a federal disaster declaration for Michigan, he told Sean Hannity, “We’ve had a big problem with the young, a woman governor from — you know who I’m talking about — from Michigan. We can’t — we don’t like to see the complaints.”
Despite Trump’s threats, we don’t yet know if political favoritism is affecting the distribution of lifesaving supplies. Trump ended up approving Michigan’s request for a disaster declaration, unlocking extra help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Washington Post reported that Florida, governed by Republican Trump sycophant Ron DeSantis, has had its requests for equipment from America’s emergency stockpile entirely fulfilled, while other states are receiving only a fraction of what they ask for. But federal officials insist that aid is being given out based on relative need, and there’s no evidence otherwise.
Nevertheless, there’s little doubt governors feel life-or-death pressure to flatter the president. “Several governors made clear they fear inadvertently harming their own citizens if they are too strident in demands for desperately needed medical supplies, or if they clash too publicly with Trump over pandemic policy as the contagion spreads,” reported the Los Angeles Times. A New York official told The Post that Gov. Andrew Cuomo and others in the state are “working under the assumption they will not get much help from the federal government, but that criticizing Trump could jeopardize any help they could receive.”
Trump isn’t just trying to feed his ego by coercing blue state governors into pretending that he’s doing a good job. He’s getting help with the November election. His campaign just rolled out a new ad, titled “Hope,” featuring appreciative quotes from Cuomo and Gov. Gavin Newsom of California. With the lives of their constituents at stake, they’ve given him the made-for-TV sound bites he was never able to extract from Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
For the many New Yorkers who loathe this president, it’s hard to imagine a more profound insult. Due in part to Trump’s failures, the United States has the world’s worst coronavirus outbreak, and New York state is its biggest hot spot, with more than 1,200 deaths as of Monday afternoon. There are ventilator shortages and makeshift morgues.
A little more than three years ago, Democrats gathered in Javits Center in Manhattan thinking they were going to celebrate Hillary Clinton’s election. Now it’s a temporary hospital. And to secure lifesaving assistance, our leaders have to grovel to the man who has helped create our tragedy.
Besides Ukraine, there is another precedent for Trump’s behavior: Puerto Rico. After Hurricane Maria, Trump grew incensed when the female mayor of San Juan called out the administration’s inadequate response, and he’s been punishing the island ever since, slowing the release of aid and slashing its Medicaid funding. No doubt, Trump’s racism and Puerto Rico’s lack of national political representation exacerbated his mistreatment of that beleaguered territory. But it was a preview of how he’d use his power.
“I don’t think anyone was that surprised when he was as vindictive as he was after the trial in firing people and having them marched out of the White House, and I don’t think anybody can be all that surprised now,” Schiff said of Trump. “Dismayed, horrified, appalled, yes. Their worst fears realized once again, yes. Surprised, probably not.”
Republican senators knew who Trump was and they refused to remove him. Now we’re all, as the president said of former Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, going to go through some things.

Texto completo: Restrictions are slowing coronavirus infections, new data suggest Data collected from the maker of internet-connected thermometers shows a rapid drop in the number of fevers reported in states across the country. Does this mean states’ stay-at-home orders are working to slow the spread of the virus? The New York Times has the story.
I just got out of the COVID-19 ICU. Here’s how I made it through.
In this first-person essay published by HuffPost, a Wisconsin-born New Yorker describes what life is like in the COVID-19 ICU.
Temperature Check: Tracking fever, a key symptom of Coronavirus A fever is one of the primary symptoms of COVID-19, and the CDC recommends those who have been exposed to coronavirus take their temperatures twice daily. Sounds straightforward, but it can be harder than you think. A New York Times reporter offers tips on how to track your temp, even if you don’t own a thermometer.

Texto completo: Social distancing may be having the intended effect of slowing the spread of the deadly new coronavirus, both nationwide and in Brevard County, according to data from an innovative company that tracks illnesses through a network of more than a million "smart thermometers."
The internet-connected thermometers automatically upload time, place and temperature data every time they are used. The company, Kinsa Health, uses the data to determine areas where there are a higher than expected number of people experiencing fevers, a key indicator of both the flu and the novel coronavirus.
Earlier in March, the numbers of fevers began to climb above expected levels nationwide. But later in the month after social distancing became heavily implemented, the number of fevers began dropping steadily. Now they are below expected levels both nationwide and in Brevard County.
"Due to widespread social distancing, school closures, stay-at-home orders, etc. feverish illness levels are dropping in many regions," according to Kinsa's website. "This does not mean that COVID-19 cases are declining. In fact, we expect to see reported cases continue to surge in the near term, but it may indicate these measures are starting to slow the spread."
The company typically uses the data to track "flu-like illnesses," and because its data is collected in real-time, Kinsa's estimates are often a few weeks or more ahead of the Centers for Disease Control, which compiles data collected by local health authorities.
Health officials are hopeful that Kinsa's data is as useful in tracking the coronavirus.
Based on its data, Kinsa says the number of people in Brevard experiencing flu-like illness began to increase above expected levels on March 8 and peaked March 19, when it estimated 7.08% of the people in the county were experiencing flu-like symptoms, nearly triple the expected rate on that date, which was 2.46%.
By March 30, that number had dropped to 1.66%, below the expected rate of 2.31% for that date.
Most of Brevard County government buildings, libraries, schools, public parks, bars and restaurants began closing their doors about the same time the fevers peaked in Brevard, suggesting that the social distancing efforts could be working.
The Florida Department of Health in Brevard County's office could not be reached for comment.
Brevard County isn't the only county to see a decline in fever levels. Nationally, the number of ill people peaked at 5.11% on March 16. As of Monday, that was down to 1.6%.
As of March 31, there were 34 confirmed cases of the coronavirus on the Space Coast with no deaths reported, but the actual number of COVID-19 cases are expected to be more than what official numbers show with the expectation of cases continuing to rise in the coming days, according to Maria Stahl, a Florida Department of Health representative.
Kinsa originally was using its data to track the spread of influenza and in 2018, its predictions were two to three weeks ahead of those of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which gathers flu data on patient symptoms from doctors' offices and hospitals, according to The New York Times.
Kinsa currently has "more than one million thermometers in circulation and has been getting up to 162,000 daily temperature readings since COVID-19 began spreading in the country," according to The New York Times' piece.
For those interested in purchasing their own Kinsa digital smart thermometer, you can do so through Kinsa's website, CVS Pharmacy, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, etc.

Texto completo: Delaware Online has launched a Facebook group to help assist readers and provide answers to questions you may have. Delaware coronavirus Q&A is a place for readers to discuss their concerns, tell us what we're not covering that you think we should be and talk about the issues you face during this difficult time.
Here are some questions and comments that have been received:
Multiple Facebook users have asked: What will the state do to stop out-of-state-drivers? Can I drive across the state line to get groceries? What about other necessities like the pharmacy? Will they pull over every car driving with an out-of-state tag?
By now you know that Delaware Gov. John Carney updated the state's policy on out-of-state visitors Sunday night.
"This order, which begins at 8 a.m. Monday, applies to anyone who has entered into Delaware in the last 14 days, but does not apply to travelers who 'are merely passing through' the state, according to a news release," our Meredith Newman wrote in the breaking story that night.
"Not complying with this declaration would be considered a criminal offense, according to the order. The Delaware Department of Justice has issued guidance to law enforcement, in which officers may conduct traffic stops – limited to public health and quarantine questions – on vehicles registered in other states, according to the order."
Out-of-state commuters to Delaware for essential work are "strongly encouraged" to work from home.
The new measure prompted some questions. How will it be enforced? Who will be enforcing it? Will every car get pulled over?
Newman asked Carney to provide some clarity to this policy Monday during a Facebook Live Q&A hosted by Delaware Online. Regarding enforcement, Carney pointed toward law enforcement.
The News Journal reached out to state police Monday morning to clarify the policy. There has not been a response as of this story posting.
According to WBOC, officers are authorized to pull over vehicles with out-of-state tags with the exception of those traveling on I-95, I-295 or I-495. Officers can then ask "limited questions related to the driver's recent travel."
There are some reports coming out now about when states will "peak" – report the highest number of cases and demand the highest numbers resources. How long does this peak typically last and then is there any data on the rate of decline after that?
This is a really interesting question that is really not easy to answer.
There is a website from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation tracking projected hospital resource use for each state. All projections for a rate of decline should come with the caveat that this is all new and it's really hard to predict scientifically what will happen.
You can, though, look at other countries to see rate declines after the peak. However, given the uncertainty about China's reporting, it's still difficult to figure this all out.
In Italy, the death rate is pretty high but the infection rate has been trending down after lockdown measures.
The New York Times wrote this week about how South Korea flattened the curve.
We'll all have a better understanding about the "peak" and a rate of decline in the coming weeks and months as more data becomes available. This was a long way of saying: It's probably still too early to conclude definitively.
Multiple Facebook users have asked about the rule of "6 feet" for social distancing.
Since we started the Facebook group, a large number of people have expressed fear about going outside and have asked for clarification about the risks of the virus being in the air around them. This morning, we published a story titled "6 feet enough for social distancing? MIT researcher says droplets carrying coronavirus can travel up to 27 feet." You can read that story here.
While the headline sounds pretty frightening, Dr. Paul Pottinger, an infectious disease professor at the University of Washington School of Medicine, said questions remain about the distances at which the virus is effective.
"The biggest threat – we think – with the coronavirus is actually the larger droplets," he said. "Droplets of saliva, snot, spit. Droplets that almost look like rain, if you will, when someone sneezes. Those droplets are large enough that gravity still acts on them. Usually, within about 6 feet of leaving somebody's body, those larger, more infectious droplets will drop to the ground. That's where the 6-foot rule comes from."
Later in the story is this: "If the coronavirus were effective at ranges of up to 27 feet, as Bourouiba contends in her research, Pottinger said he believes more people would be sick."
Long story short: Going outside seems to be safe, but continue to maintain distance from others, as infectious disease experts and government officials have suggested.
What should we do about our groceries? Is the virus on our food?
You may, at this point, have come across the YouTube video from Dr. Jeffrey VanWingen, a physician with Family Medicine Specialists in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
In it, VanWingen shows how to practice safe grocery shopping and how to go about unpacking and storing groceries with caution.
If you want more tips, The New York Times put together a guide to shopping during the coronavirus outbreak.

Texto completo: In 1978, a mischievous band of writers that included George Plimpton and Nora Ephron teamed to create a spoof of The New York Times. Turns out, Times journalists were among them.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
In September 1978, a living room full of New York writers hatched a scheme. For around a month, they put their lives on hold and devoted their imaginative powers to a secret.
During a strike by pressmen that shut down New York's major newspapers, this group wrote, designed and distributed a satirical replica of The New York Times. Newsstand shoppers were fooled into thinking it was the real thing before looking closely at its title: Not The New York Times.
In one parody column, the writer, walking past a pile of skulls to interview Genghis Khan, praised his ability to "get things done." It took a "six-month investigation by a team of 35 Not The Times reporters" to determine that cocaine "appears popular."
This paper caper featured writing by the likes of George Plimpton, Terry Southern, Nora Ephron and her then-husband, Carl Bernstein. Long before The Onion or "The Daily Show," it set the standard for news parody.
Yet in spite of the project's illustrious contributors and adoring readers, its inner workings have not been put on the record until now. Nor have former New York Times journalists publicly acknowledged their involvement.
The following oral history gathers reminiscences from the contributors who are still around 42 years later. These are edited excerpts from a series of interviews.
This 'genius gang'
Conversations among friends about the newspaper strike and the discovery by an acquaintance that The Toledo Blade used similar fonts to The Times put the project in motion.
Rusty Unger, 74, former film executive columnist for The Village Voice I was talking to my friend Chris Cerf, saying it would be so great to do a parody of The New York Times while it was on strike. He said, "My friend Tony Hendra [an editor at National Lampoon magazine] and I were just talking about the same thing."
Christopher Cerf, 78, former songwriter for "Sesame Street" I remember I'd been thinking of Victor Navasky's parodies of The New York Post and The Daily News ever since they came out. He took advantage of an opportunity that the world handed him of a newspaper strike [in the early '60s]. I always thought that was brilliant, and I just filed that fact away. I remember Victor saying that they couldn't do The Times because they couldn't match the typeface.
As we talked about this, we got quite excited. We thought, "I wonder if we could get some of our friends, writers that we know, involved."
Unger Between the three of us, we probably knew every writer in New York -- and, you know, all the funny people.
Frances FitzGerald, 79, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author Rusty would call people up and say, "We don't know what we're doing exactly, but come help us."
Cerf The real fun was when we began to find that all the people from The Times wanted to do it.
Steven Crist, 63, former Times horse racing writer I graduated in June of '78 and went to work at The Times as a copy boy, which was the lowest rung, entry-level job. After the paper went on strike, I started going to the racetrack and tried to make a living betting on the horses. And then along came Not The New York Times.
Richard Yeend, 75, former Times designer I had no food at the time. I figured this might be an opportunity to have a free meal. I learned that was exactly what this was.
Glenn Collins, 75, an editor and later a longtime reporter at The Times How could you not want to jump in with this genius gang of pranksters?
Cerf It only took a few meetings. The minute we had Nora [Ephron] and George [Plimpton] and [Carl] Bernstein, who wouldn't want to do that?
Unger We were turning people away -- I remember Scott Spencer, who I'd never heard of. I was very cavalier: "We don't need you." Later, he wrote that incredible novel, "Endless Love."
Crist A lot of those big literary names dropped off one piece. It wasn't like Jerzy Kosinski [the novelist whose books include "Being There"] was sitting there for a month. But everyone who was asked and heard about it was: "Oh, let me write something. I want to be a part of it."
Carl Bernstein, 76, renowned reporter and author It became a more disciplined operation -- if you can imagine such a thing -- when it moved into the offices and auspices of Plimpton.
Cerf We were all set up in George's living room. We had dozens of people there every day. We had lots of tables and set it up like a newsroom.
Collins The work environment in the Plimpton townhouse was spontaneous. We didn't check in. You just showed up. You find a typewriter. There are these old clunkers on exquisite desks. So we're all in our little universes, writing our own stories. .
FitzGerald People were kind of figuring out what to do, and how it should look, and dividing up the pieces, and sort of sitting on the floor. It was like a middle-grade school project.
Bernstein It caught fire through the spontaneity of the collaboration.
Crist I was sort of the baby of the staff. I was 21. I remember being holed up in Plimpton's townhouse for the better part of a month. You're three months out of college, and you're surrounded by these luminaries and idols. Simultaneously, it seemed there was always a cocktail party going on. You would have people in fancy clothes, hors d'oeuvres and Champagne. Meanwhile, you're sitting at a typewriter in the billiards room knocking out parodies of obituaries and classified ads. For a 21-year-old just out of college, it was pretty heady stuff.
Cerf I'd get up in the morning and go there and stay there till it was time to go to bed, day after day after day. I got very little sleep. Stings and silliness
Some articles poked fun at giants of The Times, like the editor and columnist James Reston, or elements of the paper itself, like The Living Section, which the group changed to The Having Section. Other pieces targeted the snobbery of New York's social world, lampooned journalistic clichés and concocted playful absurdities, such as the pope giving battle orders to the Swiss Guard.
Unger The first person I called was the New Yorker writer Veronica Geng. She said, "Oh, I think I have something in my drawer." She came over and handed me the piece on the front page, "Carter Forestalls Efforts to Defuse Discord Policy."
FitzGerald I wrote the James Reston column. It wasn't entirely about him, but it was about [the foreign correspondent and columnist] Cy Sulzberger and people like that who have this rather elevated view of the world, and were always meeting with princes and presidents, and giving the authoritative word on what's going on.
Unger One person who wrote some of the funniest things of all was Jeff Greenfield. He's a serious pundit now, but he was hilarious.
Jeff Greenfield, 76, Emmy Award-winning journalist and author One of the pieces I wrote was that Studio 54 burned down. When the firefighters show up, the owners say: "No, no. Bridge-and-tunnel people, you can't come in here."
Collins Chris [Cerf] had a list of articles they wanted to do. I saw one I thought was funny about the Vatican. I was thrilled that they ran it on Page 1.
Two years later, they gave me the incredible gift of being a reporter at The Times. From then on, for 30 years, I was always trying to get on Page 1. And in Not The New York Times, I had already been on Page 1 -- only it was Not Page 1.
Unger Nora [Ephron] wrote in The Having Section -- which is my title -- she wrote the one in that called "Private Lies." It was a take on that columnist John Leonard [who wrote about family and work life in "Private Lives"]. He used everything he could possibly use to make a column.
I wrote the food column, the Craig Claiborne. His recipes at the Times were so overly erudite. I just kind of copied his style.
Cerf The headline on the cocaine piece ["An Exotic Drug 'Cocaine' Appears Popular"] may have been the single best thing. That's just so Timesy.
Greenfield Part of it was, "We're onto you guys at The Times." But it was not hostile. There's a fair degree of affection. It was like, "These are some of the quirks of this newspaper."
The Times touch
The collective effort produced a robust paper -- three full sections. Times journalists gave it verisimilitude in tone and design.
Crist There was an air of secrecy about my involvement. I'm sure I told my parents, but not many other people. There was a great fear that The Times was going to hate this, and they would go off on some Trumpian purge of employees who'd had anything to do with it.
Yeend It sounds silly, but it was very secretive. I worked at The Times for another nine years, and I don't think I told anybody.
Collins It was not secretive. I never thought about that. The Times was not some sort of a Gestapo. I just wanted to play with the other witty kids.
Yeend I don't think we would have been fired. You'd end up in a corner, without an office, licking stamps.
Unger The art direction, the whole layout and design, came from a New York Times guy.
Yeend That was my job, to make it look like The Times. I think the most difficult thing was the lowercase 't' on the masthead. All the other characters were "The New York Times," but the lowercase "t" [in Not] had to be made up. I think we just photocopied it, blew it up, touched it up and shrank it back down again.
Cerf Al Siegal helped me a little. He was the assistant managing editor. I would call him. It was like, "I can't believe you're doing this, so you're not doing it." The whole joke was always that this wasn't happening.
Yeend It was written by satirists, but it was edited by Phil Drysdale, who was an assistant editor of the Op-Ed page. He was critical to it reading like The New York Times, and nobody knew he worked there.
Bernstein I hadn't dreamed it would look as brilliant as it did.
'It was a phenomenon'
Ringleaders of the project got copies on Oct. 14. It was distributed to newsstands in New York and sold hundreds of thousands of copies, according to contributors and media coverage from the time.
Greenfield So one day New Yorkers -- for whom The New York Times, as you know, is the drug of choice, for a lot of them -- they're seeing what looks like The New York Times on their newsstand. It's like, "Thank you, God."
People snatched it up, I think, in part for the sheer pleasure of holding something that felt like The New York Times. They'd been out. It was a fix.
FitzGerald It was a phenomenon. The reading public, the Times reading public, really enjoyed it.
Unger We were stars, and everyone wanted us to go on television, and all the rest of the media were calling, but we were so nervous about admitting who was involved, especially the people who worked for The Times.
Greenfield The fact that Not The New York Times became this event, starting from zero -- no publisher, no money and no focus group. No nothing. People said, "Let's just do this."
It was like all the old MGM musicals, where Mickey Rooney says, "Hey, my dad's got a barn, let's put on a show."
Unger It was the high point of my life. I used to be embarrassed to say that, but there was never anything as fun as doing Not The New York Times, and pulling it off.
Bernstein I can't imagine everybody's reaction not being the same as mine about what a joyous moment this was.
Cerf This group did not take themselves seriously. We didn't say: "We're doing an important parody. We want to make fun of the news and it will change the world." We said, "This is a hoot, and we hope everybody thinks it's funny."
Unger Nobody was being paid and nobody was going to get credit, and there was never a better atmosphere of creativity and freedom and camaraderie. Where are you going to find those parameters again?
Cerf Other things I've done have been really fun, but this one was perfect. I don't get to work with people of that talent as a group very often. To have all of them! There were dozens of them, scores of people, that aren't all famous, but all of them were brilliant and having the time of their lives.
The parody included three full sections, including "Busy busy Day," which spoofed The Times's "Business Day" and its bylines.; Richard Yeend, a designer who worked on the parody, said the team had to create a lowercase "t" for the paper's masthead.; Fake advertising dotted the pages. The paper was a hit, but for years no Times employee would publicly admit taking part in it.; Not The New York Times, published during the 1978 newspaper strike, eventually set up shop in George Plimpton's living room.; Chris Cerf revisited his notes for Not The New York Times on Monday. The paper included works by the city's leading writers. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY ANDREW SONDERN/THE NEW YORK TIMES)

Texto completo: The bank said it would make diversity training mandatory for all employees after a New York Times report about racism at its Arizona branches.
JPMorgan Chase is increasing its efforts to diversify its work force and customer base after a Dec. 11 New York Times report showed a black customer and a black employee each struggling to gain access to the same opportunities as their white peers at the country's largest bank.
In a memo to employees on Tuesday, Gordon Smith and Daniel Pinto, JPMorgan's acting co-chief executive officers, said the bank was making diversity training mandatory for all employees and would pay more attention to employee complaints. They said the bank would expand the recruiting team dedicated to hiring people of color, make a greater effort to hire vendors run by minorities and work harder to provide customers with access to its full range of products.
"We've identified a number of areas that, with enhanced, scaled or new programming or processes, would serve to improve our culture in important ways," the executives wrote.
In the Times report, a financial adviser recorded his boss disparaging a black customer as being "from Section 8" -- a reference to public housing -- and saying that she did not deserve to be in the bank's program for elite customers. Another black customer, the former National Football League player Jimmy Kennedy, struggled for months to get access to a package of perks for wealthy clients, a delay that an employee told him was connected to his race.
In the memo, the executives said they had decided to reassess how customers could qualify for perks after looking at how much discretion employees had in granting them.
The new policies, some of which were described only in the broadest terms, come after the bank faced pressure from lawmakers and philanthropic partners to make concrete changes following the Times report.
In late December, members of the House of Representatives and Senate wrote to Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's chief executive, who is recuperating from heart surgery, seeking detailed information about the diversity of the bank's work force and any regulatory actions related to discrimination. Two members of Congress later emailed the bank to say its response to the request was not detailed enough.
In January, two advocacy groups, Closing the Women's Wealth Gap and the Women's Foundation of California, informed JPMorgan that they would stop accepting philanthropic contributions until its executives could show that it was improving its treatment of black Americans.
Heather McCulloch, the executive director of Closing the Women's Wealth Gap, which focuses on economic inequality, called the announcement "underwhelming." She said the group wanted JPMorgan to hire a consultant to do a deep dive into the bank's diversity practices and come up with ways to improve them.
"Instead, the firm announced more of the same," she said.
A bank spokesman said in an email that Tuesday's announcement was an overview of the bank's plans and had no other details.

Texto completo: Former journalists at The New York Times describe a parody of the paper in 1978 and the secrecy surrounding it.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
In mid-October 1978, two months after a strike by pressmen shut down New York's major newspapers, a broadsheet bearing the words "New York Times" appeared on newsstands.
Newsstand shoppers found some peculiarities. "Sleepy Village's Dull Anecdote Is Grist for Reporters' Mill," read one headline. "Universe Very Old," read another.
The bylines, too, seemed off. "Joseph Toaster" was not quite the same as the foreign correspondent Joseph B. Treaster, and "William Satire" was one letter away from the columnist William Safire.
This was not The New York Times; and that, in fact, is exactly what the parody called itself: Not The New York Times.
Rapturous coverage in national magazines and on television credited celebrated writers of the time, including Nora Ephron and George Plimpton.
Yet an article in Time magazine gently suggested the parody's success came from more than the literary talent of its contributors. Brief tributes published every decade or so occasionally made the same allusion.
The fact has been hiding in plain sight: Not The New York Times was an inside job.
The parody featured three full sections, 24 joke advertisements, 73 spoof articles and 155 fake news briefs, all meticulously edited to mimic The Times's style. Even the thick curls of the font used on the front page and the neat spacing of the headlines exactly replicates those of the real paper.
Months of research and interviews led me to former editors, designers and a copy boy at The Times who had provided critical help to a parody of their own employer.
"All the Times people had to be available," said Christopher Cerf, one of the spoof's ringleaders.
After the strike ended and the Times journalists returned to work, they hid their satirical moonlighting from their colleagues. As the years went by, they kept quiet.
Steven Crist, 63, the former copy boy, who later covered horse-racing for The Times, wrote a memoir that discusses the 1978 strike but passes over in silence the weeks he spent working on the parody.
Mr. Crist said his fear in 1978 of a "purge" of employees who had contributed to the parody lingered into subsequent decades, even though he stopped working at the paper.
Contacted in Belgium, over 30 years after he left The Times, the designer Richard Yeend, 75, was taken by surprise.
"It was one of things I wanted to ask you," he said to me: "How on earth you found out that I was involved with Not The New York Times."
I found contributors like Mr. Yeend by scouring the accounts that have been written about the parody and by reaching out to a colorful array of sources, including a British comic book company, a news and betting service devoted to horse racing and The Santa Barbara Independent, a California newspaper.
The three former Times employees I interviewed seemed eager to speak on the record for the first time about their involvement.
"There's no code of omertà on something that's 40 years old," said Glenn Collins, 75, a longtime Metro, Business and Style reporter who started as an editor at The Times Magazine.
Though Mr. Collins, Mr. Yeend and Mr. Crist recalled details of their work, all spoke more vividly about the excitement of collaborating with others.
"We'd just all sit on the rug and ideas would get kicked around, and we read each other's stuff, and laughed or didn't laugh -- but we laughed a lot," Mr. Collins said.
A sense of urgency supercharged the banter.
"We were afraid it would all be for naught if the strike suddenly ended," Mr. Cerf said. "We were racing against time."
Somehow, the parody transformed from an amusing notion to a newsstand hit in just around a month.
I had hoped to learn which articles Times employees wrote and which were by luminaries like Ms. Ephron. But the frantic, ecstatic ensemble that produced Not The New York Times appears to defy conventional notions of writerly credit.
Fading memories and yellowing press clippings do connect certain writers with specific stories. Still, singular attributions miss how much everyone had a hand in everything.
How did New York writers, generally known for competitiveness, achieve such a high level of literary teamwork? Was it the fake bylines? The mad dash to the finish?
Reflecting on the freelancers, humorists and temporarily out-of-work Times employees who made up the staff, Mr. Yeend proposed a theory for what bound everyone together.
"We all had a lot of time on our hands," he said.

Texto completo: Chris Cuomo has been diagnosed with covid-19, the CNN anchor announced on Tuesday.
"In these difficult times that seem to get more difficult and complicated by the day, I just found out that I am positive for corona virus," he tweeted. "I have been exposed to people in recent days who have subsequently tested positive and I had fever, chills and shortness of breath."
Cuomo has been quarantined in the basement of his home, where continues to work, including anchoring "Cuomo Prime Time." He was last at the network's offices on Friday, CNN reported.
The 49-year-old tweeted his concern about infecting his family, writing "that would make me feel worse than this illness!"
Cuomo's profile has risen during the coronavirus crisis, owing to his sometimes affectionate, sometimes prickly interviews with his brother, New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. From his basement on Monday night, the CNN anchor kept pestering the governor about whether he'd ever consider running for president.
During his daily news briefing on Tuesday, Gov. Cuomo said the state's two-part battle against the pandemic involved expanding health-care capacity and making sure people stay home, prompting him to mention his younger brother's diagnosis.
"He is going to be fine. He's young, in good shape, strong. Not as strong as he thinks. But he will be fine," Gov. Cuomo said. "But there's a lesson in this: he's an essential worker, a member of the press, so he's been out there. If you go out there, the chances you get infected are high."
Cuomo is the latest CNN employee to contract covid-19. As of last week, news organizations such as the New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN and NBC all announced at least one employee had tested positive for the virus. In March, several major outlets based in New York City, which has become a hot spot for the pandemic, largely emptied their newsrooms to practice social distancing.
Another news anchor, BBC News's George Alagiah, said he tested positive on Tuesday; he's also a cancer patient and has characterized his covid-19 symptoms as mild.
Several people working at news organizations have died after becoming infected. NBC News's Larry Edgeworth, 61, and CBS News's Maria Mercader, 54, are among the causalities. Alan Finder, 72, a longtime New York Times journalist who retired in 2011 but continued to work part-time on the paper's international desk, died last week.
Two weeks ago, Gov. Cuomo signed an executive order dubbed "Matilda's Law," named after his mother, meant to protect people older than 70 and with underlying medical conditions. It requires New Yorkers to limit visiting family, among other directives.
On Tuesday, the governor called it "a mistake" for his mother to have visited Chris Cuomo's house two weeks ago.
"You could expose mom to the virus, and sometimes love needs to be a little be smarter than just reactive," the governor said. "If he was exposed, and she was exposed, and then we'd be looking at a very different situation than my brother sitting in his basement for two weeks."

Texto completo: NEW YORK — New York's governor issued an urgent appeal for medical volunteers Monday amid a “staggering" number of deaths from the coronavirus, as he and health officials warned that the crisis unfolding in New York City is just a preview of what other communities across the United States could soon face.
“Please come help us in New York now," Governor Andrew Cuomo said as the state's death toll climbed by more than 250 in a single day to a total of more than 1,200 victims, most of them in the city. He said an additional 1 million health care workers are needed to tackle the crisis.
“We've lost over 1,000 New Yorkers," Cuomo said. "To me, we're beyond staggering already. We've reached staggering."
Even before the governor's appeal, close to 80,000 former nurses, doctors, and other professionals in New York were stepping up to volunteer.
"Whatever it is that they need, I'm willing to do," said Jerry Kops, a musician and former nurse whose tour with the show Blue Man Group was abruptly halted by the outbreak.
He returned to his Long Island home, where he volunteered to be a nurse again. While waiting to be reinstated, Kops has been helping at an assisted-living home near his house in Shirley, N.Y.
The spike in deaths in New York was another sign of the long fight ahead against the global pandemic, which was filling Spain's intensive care beds to capacity and shutting millions of Americans inside even as the crisis in China, where the outbreak began in December, kept easing.
More than 235 million people — about two of every three Americans — live in the 33 states where governors have declared statewide orders or recommendations to stay home.
The United States reported more than 160,000 infections and over 3,000 deaths, with New York City the nation's worst hot spot, and New Orleans, Detroit, and other cities also seeing alarming clusters.

Hospital ship drops anchor in New York Harbor
WASHINGTON — The enormous hospital ship USNS Comfort arrived in New York Harbor on Monday morning, a gleaming white beacon of hope for a besieged city as it fights the novel coronavirus.
But in sending a Navy hospital ship to join the battle against a pandemic, military officials have taken a huge and calculated risk: Can a ship, the type of vessel where viruses have been shown to spread with frightening ease, actually remain safe from the infection raging just outside?
Navy officials do not plan to treat people with coronavirus aboard the Comfort. The mission is to take patients with other medical problems to relieve New York hospitals overrun by virus patients. But it is not as if the ship's medical personnel can quarantine patients for two weeks before they accept them on board for treatment.
Navy officials insist that they are doing everything short of Saran-wrapping the ship to try to keep it virus-free.
That has meant almost sequestering the ship's crew of 1,200 for the past two weeks to lessen their chances of contracting the virus, Captain Joseph O'Brien, commodore of Task Force New York City, said. The ship closed its workout rooms days ago, and the crew members have been practicing social distancing — at least, as much as they can in the confined quarters of a ship.
But there remain challenges.
Navy officials acknowledge that it will be extremely difficult to ensure no one with coronavirus gets on board. The ship's crew will not be allowed off the ship.
With 12 operating rooms, 1,000 hospital beds, radiology services, a laboratory, pharmacy, and CT scanner, the Comfort is its own fully-staffed hospital.

Virus hits Detroit, a city that has seen crisis before
DETROIT — It has seen its population plummet, houses fall to ruin, and the largest municipal bankruptcy in the nation. Now another crisis has descended on Detroit: the coronavirus.
In less than two weeks, 35 people with the coronavirus have died in Detroit. The police chief has tested positive for the virus, and more than 500 police officers are in quarantine. On Sunday morning, the city's downtown, a center of Detroit's post-bankruptcy resurgence, was quiet and mostly deserted.
The virus could place a unique burden on Detroit, a city of 670,000 people where 3 of 10 residents live in poverty, a large number have asthma and other chronic diseases, and hospitals are already overwhelmed.
By Monday afternoon, with more than 6,500 cases, Michigan was third in known cases among the states, behind New York and New Jersey. Across the state, at least 196 residents have died, placing Michigan fourth across the nation in deaths from the virus.

Outbreak at Marine Corps boot camp infects dozens
A coronavirus outbreak has infected dozens of Marine recruits and staff members at the service's East Coast recruit training center, prompting the suspension of additional arrivals for the foreseeable future, defense officials said Monday.
The cases at Parris Island, S.C., emerged following a "wave in testing" over the weekend, a defense official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. One official said there are at least 20 positive cases, and another said there are believed to be a few dozen but less than 50.
The outbreak could mark the Defense Department's largest yet. Defense officials have said that dozens of sailors aboard the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt have tested positive for the virus while on deployment in the Pacific, forcing a stop last week for treatment in Guam.
The Marine Corps acknowledged the suspension of new recruits arriving at Parris Island but did not detail how many cases have emerged following a Pentagon decision last week to not provide specific information about coronavirus cases from individual bases and units.
Marine officials said in a statement that the service is taking steps to "protect its recruits, recruit training personnel, their families, and the communities where they live and serve by temporarily suspending the shipping of new recruits" to Parris Island.

Federal officials investigate pandemic profiteering
A Brooklyn man was arrested for coughing on FBI agents who came to investigate whether he was selling medical supplies, including N95 masks, at inflated prices in what appears to be one of the first cases related to alleged profiteering from the coronavirus pandemic.
Baruch Feldheim, 43, was charged with assaulting federal officers and lying to them about his accumulation and sale of medical supplies, the US attorney's office in New Jersey said Monday. He wasn't charged with profiteering.
The agents had been staking out Feldheim's residence in Brooklyn, watching people leave with what looked like medical supplies. Prosecutors said that Feldheim sold supplies at as much as a 700 percent markup to doctors and nurses.
Hospitals in New York, New Jersey, and elsewhere are running so short on medical equipment that doctors and nurses are being forced to reuse disposable masks for days at a time. That's spurred a wave of brokers and hustlers who are bombarding purchasing departments with offers, claiming they've located sources of supplies. Even if the administrators are willing to pay high prices, they're having trouble telling who's legitimate. The Trump administration has said it will crack down on profiteering.
One doctor in New Jersey contacted Feldheim on March 18 through a WhatsApp chat group called “Virus2020!" and arranged to buy about 1,000 N95 masks and other goods for $12,000, prosecutors said. Feldheim sent the doctor to an auto repair shop in Irvington, N.J., to pick up his order, according to the statement. The doctor later said that the shop had enough hand sanitizer and surgical supplies to outfit a hospital, prosecutors said.

Coronavirus revisionism: When the media pretends their narrative is 'reality'

Texto completo: Left-leaning explainer site Vox, even while chastising the White House and Fox News for previously downplaying the threat from the novel coronavirus, tweeted this:Tweet
So, what was the old tweet, and what do they mean by the wordy phrase “no longer reflects the current reality of the coronavirus story”?
The old, deleted tweet read thus: “What is this #coronavirus? It’s part of a family of viruses that attack the respiratory system. Should I travel during the outbreak? The CDC and the State Department advise avoiding China for now. Is this going to be a deadly pandemic? No.”
Notably, the Jan. 31 tweet didn’t say that this wasn’t at the time a problem. It flatly stated that coronavirus was not “going to be a deadly pandemic.”
Rather than apologize for an incorrect prediction and the hubris behind it, precisely the sort of thing Vox and journalists have been loudly criticizing others for, this tweet suggests that the “current reality” had changed. But that isn't so. The reality is exactly the same. We were headed for a pandemic in late January, and now, we've got it. Now Vox is disappearing the evidence that it downplayed the coronavirus.
It starts to make sense if you realize the “reality of the coronavirus story” doesn’t mean “the truth of the matter.” It means “the narrative.”
That original Vox tweet downplaying the coronavirus was its arrogant response to conservative proposals to curb entry to the United States from China.
“Don’t Listen to Sen. Tom Cotton About the Coronavirus” was the HuffPost headline that same day. Cotton’s bad advice, as it happens, was in “calling for all Americans in China to ‘get out now.'” Cotton was “demanding the U.S. implement an extensive travel ban targeting China" and "proposing a ‘Manhattan Project-level effort to create a vaccine.’”
So, Cotton was the bad guy of the day. The narrative of the day, or, as Vox puts it, the “reality," was that conservatives were fearmongering on this disease in what had to be a racist way. (Those conservatives happened to be right.)
The “reality of the coronavirus story” on Jan. 31 was also apparently that “China has moved swiftly to get the outbreak under control,” in the words of the Vox article linked to by the since-deleted tweet.
Come March, though, the narrative — sorry, the “reality” — was that the virus was killing thousands of people, and President Trump, far from overreacting with his travel ban, had, in fact, not done enough.
This is how news pages cover the world. Rather than communicate "just the facts," they try to tell what they think is the deeper, truer story. This isn’t necessarily bad. We need context, after all, not just "facts.” There are 100,000 facts about the coronavirus every day, and most are useless to the average reader. (What would you do with the age distribution of recovered patients in hospitals in Madrid?)
So it’s up to reporters and editors to take in as many facts as possible and shape a story out of it. But the imperfect humans who assign, write, edit, and tweet these stories have biases and sometimes even a political agenda. More damning, some of them present their stories as objective “reality,” presuming to "explain" the whole picture to you, when all they really have is a set of somewhat-fact-based assertions from a particular perspective.
This helps you understand why so much of the media was happy to misrepresent what Trump said about states getting ventilators. Sure, they were distorting his remarks, but there was an underlying truth they wanted to get out. The federal government wasn’t taking a leading role, and in their mind, this was, first, a problem and second, a justification for misrepresenting what Trump actually said.
It's the fake-but-accurate problem, which one encounters constantly when doing media criticism.
When the New York Times ran a deeply flawed study purporting to count the lies of President Barack Obama and those of Trump, and chart them on a line graph, I pointed it out. I noted Obama lies that were omitted and pointed out the silly false precision of “counting lies.” The general response was, 'Come on, you KNOW Trump is more of a liar.'
In other words, the New York Times article made factual claims that were either false or faulty, but the story it was telling — that Trump is a big liar — was what really mattered.
Again, news stories will always be the curation of facts into a coherent narrative. We can't avoid that. But journalists and editors shouldn't be pretending their narrative is the "reality."

Texto completo: A top House Republican criticized the New York Times's coverage of a newly released Justice Department watchdog report finding widespread problems with the FBI's preparation of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants.
California Rep. Devin Nunes, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, highlighted the newspaper's write-up as an example of "mainstream" bias that he said should not be taken seriously.
Radio host Larry O'Connor read a passage from the report to Nunes during the Examining Politics podcast on Tuesday. It said DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz's report "helps the FBI politically because it undercuts the narrative among President Trump and his supporters that the bureau cut corners to surveil the adviser, Carter Page, as part of a politically motivated conspiracy."
"So, the good news for the FBI is that they trampled on people's rights all over the place, not just people who worked with Donald Trump's campaign," O'Connor said. "Is that the takeaway we should have here congressman?"
"The one thing you're doing really smart is, when you read the mainstream news, you need to look for the narratives, Larry. So, you're doing exactly what you should be doing," Nunes said. "The idea that any mainstream paper would make that argument just shows you how biased and out of control they've become and why Americans need to reject these types of skewed media outlets. That is just not productive."
As it was a breaking story on Tuesday, the New York Times published multiple updates to the report about the Horowitz memo, as shown by the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine. The most recent update, published Tuesday evening, contained different language:
"The finding of systemic incompetence is devastating for the FBI. But, in the Trump era, the discovery is leavened by an unusual side benefit for the bureau: It undercuts the narrative fostered by President Trump and his supporters that the botching of applications to surveil his campaign adviser Carter Page is evidence that the FBI engaged in a politically biased conspiracy."
Both versions stressed that Horowitz's report revealed the FBI's "pattern of sloppiness" up high.
Nunes, who was an early investigator working to root out FISA abuses against the 2016 Trump campaign, argued the older language in the New York Times report prejudges what happened in the effort to obtain these wiretaps for counterintelligence and counterterrorism reasons. In order to get a fuller picture, The congressman said further investigation by congressional overseers, including the House intelligence panel, would be needed. But he faulted Democrats, who are the majority in the House, for not committing to sufficient oversight in this matter.
"So, to come up with conclusions like the New York Times is doing is another good example of why people should reject these mainstream media outlets because all they are is, they're operatives, essentially, for the Democratic National Committee and party operatives," Nunes said.
Nunes is no stranger to speaking out about media reports he views as false and defamatory. The Republican has in recent months sued news outlets including CNN and the Washington Post for stories related about him.
Leading Republicans in the House and Senate are calling for Horowitz to testify about his new report, which uncovered a lack of properly documented verifications in dozens of electronic surveillance applications.

Texto completo: When professor Christine Blasey Ford accused then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of having sexually assaulted her, without substantial corroboration or evidence, the liberal media made it the biggest national story for an entire month. It culminated in a dramatic Senate hearing, nearly derailing the conservative judge’s nomination. Now, Joe Biden wants to be president. There won't be any hearings to force the issue, but he too faces a similar allegation of sexual assault.
In fact, the Democrats' presumptive 2020 nominee faces an allegation that would have taken place after his elevation to public life, and the specific details of the charge against him are both better corroborated and more serious than the ones Blasey Ford brought forward.
Surely, the New York Times, CNN, MSNBC, the Washington Post, and others would make a point of covering such a thing, wouldn't they? True, we are currently amid the coronavirus crisis, but surely there's room for more than one story?
Nope. They’ve pretty much ignored the story entirely.
Reason journalist Robby Soave investigated the matter in detail, only to find zero mention of Tara Reade or her accusation, which she detailed in a recent podcast, across many of the most prominent liberal media outlets. Soave reports that “CNN conducted a virtual townhall event with the candidate last Friday. Reade's name didn't come up, and it has never appeared at CNN.com. At NBC, it's the same story: Chuck Todd interviewed Biden but didn't ask about the allegation.”
Additionally, Soave found only two tangential mentions of her name at the Washington Post, and no mention of Reade’s latest accusation at all in the New York Times. Even the left-leaning Columbia Journalism Review noted this glaring omission in coverage.
To add to the list, I searched the Atlantic and came up empty. So, too, no search results concerning Reade’s new accusation come up at the New Yorker. Similarly, while their website’s search function is dysfunctional and confusing, I could find no reporting at the Los Angeles Times of the incident either.
There seems to be a pattern here.
Interestingly, some left-wing outlets such as the Intercept and Vox have covered the accusation, but major liberal national newspapers and networks have almost uniformly ignored it. (The Hill did cover it, in a television interview that’s worth watching.)
Check out these shocking findings from a Media Research Center study:
Since Reade went public, candidate Biden has given long interviews, including: an hour-long CNN town hall on March 27, where he faced 23 questions (13 from CNN’s Anderson Cooper, ten others submitted by audience members); nine minutes on NBC’s Meet the Press on March 29, where he faced nine questions from moderator Chuck Todd; and nearly a quarter-hour on Monday’s MSNBC Live with Katy Tur, where he faced an additional nine questions. Out of 41 total questions, Biden didn’t face a single one about his new accuser.
"Despite the sad fact that it's unsurprising the liberal media have refused to even offer a news brief about Reade, it's still astounding that Biden can be asked over three dozen questions between three major TV networks and not a single one involved her," MRC's Curtis Houck, managing editor of Newsbusters.org, told me. "Biden's well-documented history of making women uncomfortable should have been even more of a reason to ask, but ignoring these new claims is what passes as journalism in 2020."
It all serves to illustrate a hypocritical double standard. When a Republican is accused of sexual misconduct, the liberal media revels in it, immediately painting him as guilty. Journalists show little hesitation to report on the story, no matter how suspect it turns out to be. But when a Democrat is accused? Complete silence.
Biden deserves the presumption of innocence, and we should afford him due process even in the court of public opinion. But that entails actually covering the story.
Perhaps journalists feel they can't acknowledge or take Biden's accuser seriously because of the guilty-until-proven-innocent standard they all helped create during the Kavanaugh affair.

Texto completo: The U.S. Tried to Build a New Fleet of Ventilators. The Mission Failed.
U.S. public health officials have known for more than a decade that the lack of cheap, portable ventilators would be a major vulnerability in the case of a flu-like pandemic. So they came up with a plan and the federal government signed a contract with a small medical devices maker in California. The New York Times explains what went wrong.
Choir practice turns fatal. Airborne coronavirus strongly suspected On March 10, 60 members of the Skagit Valley Chorale attended rehearsal at a church in Skagit County, Washington, about an hour south of Seattle. Nearly three weeks later, 45 had tested positive for COVID-19 or were sick with symptoms, and two had died. This "super-spreading event" poses interesting questions about transmission via aerosols. The Los Angeles Times tells the story.
11 to 100,000: What went wrong with coronavirus testing in the U.S.
The Washington Post’s Fact Checker team reconstructs what went wrong with COVID-19 testing and how the missteps gave the U.S. a false sense of how widespread the virus was. Watch the video.
"What I Learned When My Husband Got Coronavirus" In Sunday’s special episode of The New York Time’s Daily, an editor for The New York Times Magazine describes in heart-wrenching detail how she has been caring for her husband, who has tested positive for COVID-19, while trying to keep herself and her teenage daughter safe and healthy. This essay is especially eye-opening for those of us whose greatest concerns have been what to binge-watch on Netflix. Listen here.
He’s 18 and wants to hang with ‘his boys.’ His mom hasn’t been able to stop him.
For many parents, getting teenagers to stay at home is easier said than done. The Washington Post shares their stories.

News Companies Lay Out Austerity Plans
Gannett, the largest newspaper publisher in the United States, The Los Angeles Times and Vice Media are the latest media companies to acknowledge that reader interest in the coronavirus pandemic has not made up for a sharp downturn in advertising revenue.
Gannett employees learned of the company's austerity plan through a memo sent by Paul Bascobert, the chief executive of Gannett's operating company. The memo was obtained by The New York Times.
Mr. Bascobert said in the memo that advertising had fallen off, despite an increase in web traffic and subscriptions. He said that company executives had agreed to 25 percent pay cuts and that he would not take a salary until the measures were reversed.
In a separate memo shared with the staff, Gannett said the moves would affect "the majority" of company employees, and that some would be furloughed one week each month in the months to come.
At Vice Media, staff members making more than $ 100,000 annually will be moved to four-day work weeks and their salaries will be cut by 10 or 20 percent for 90 days beginning early next month, Jesse Angelo, the company's president of global news and entertainment, said on a staff call, a recording of which was obtained by The New York Times.
He also said merit raises and promotions, scheduled for next month, would be delayed three months and that the company would cease matching 401(k) contributions for two months.
Executives have agreed to cut their salaries by 25 percent for a time, Mr. Angelo said, while the salary of Nancy Dubuc, the chief executive of Vice Media, will be halved.
Los Angeles Times executives said Monday that they would temporarily combine several sections of the print newspaper as "most of our advertisers are unable to continue advertising."
AUTOMAKERS
Ford to Make Ventilators With G.E.'s Health Care Unit
Ford Motor and General Electric's health care division said on Monday that they together planned to produce 50,000 ventilators over the next 100 days to help meet the needs of hospitals during the coronavirus pandemic.
Ford plans to continue making about 30,000 ventilators a month once the initial batch has been made. Ford will use a plant in Rawsonville, Mich., and about 500 workers to make the medical devices.
Ford's effort is the second-such initiative by a major automaker. General Motors has said it plans to make ventilators at one of its factories in Kokomo, Ind., with Ventec Life Systems, a ventilator manufacturer. Tesla, the electric car company, has also said that it intends to make ventilators with Medtronic at a factory in Buffalo.
G.E. has licensed the design of the ventilator from Airon Corporation of Melbourne, Fla. The device works on air pressure and does not need electricity, and the companies said it could be useful for most coronavirus patients who need help breathing.
Ford and G.E. said last week that Ford would help increase production of another ventilator based on a design from G.E. Healthcare.
ENTERTAINMENT
Disney Cuts Executive Pay
Disney joined other conglomerates in slashing salaries for executives.
Starting next week, all of the company's vice presidents will have their pay reduced by 20 percent, senior vice presidents by 25 percent and executive vice presidents and above by 30 percent.
Bob Chapek, Disney's new chief executive, said in a company-wide email that he would take a 50 percent reduction and that Robert A. Iger, executive chairman, would forgo all of his salary, which totals $ 3 million annually according to securities filings.
"This temporary action will remain in effect until we foresee a substantive recovery in our business," according to the email, a copy of which was forwarded to The New York Times.

Amid Clamor for Test Kits, Trump Sees No Problems

Texto completo: The president said on a conference call that he had not "heard about testing in weeks."
WASHINGTON -- President Trump told governors on a conference call on Monday that he had not "heard about testing in weeks," suggesting that a chronic lack of kits to screen people for the coronavirus was no longer a problem.
But governors painted a different picture on the ground.
Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana, a Democrat, said that officials in his state were trying to do "contact tracing" -- tracking down people who have come into contact with those who have tested positive -- but that they were struggling because "we don't have adequate tests," according to an audio recording of the conversation obtained by The New York Times.
"Literally we are one day away, if we don't get test kits from the C.D.C., that we wouldn't be able to do testing in Montana," Mr. Bullock said.
The midday call was one of a handful that Mr. Trump has held with governors, some of whom have sparred with the president over the federal government's response to the spread of the coronavirus. Others have calculated that it will be easier to get the needs of their states fulfilled by praising Mr. Trump, who seeks credit and affirmation in most interactions.
On the Monday call, Mr. Bullock -- whose state is heavily rural -- tried to stress the disparity Montana faces in trying to mitigate the spread of the virus because of the lack of testing.
Mr. Trump initially said that Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, could respond to the question, but then quickly offered a rejoinder. "I haven't heard about testing in weeks," the president said. "We've tested more now than any nation in the world. We've got these great tests and we're coming out with a faster one this week." Reiterating his point, Mr. Trump added, "I haven't heard about testing being a problem."
Many people who have symptoms of the virus are still finding it difficult to be tested, and many who have been tested are waiting more than a week to get results. The failures of the federal government to adequately develop testing supplies for the contagion have been well documented by The New York Times and other news outlets, reports that have rankled Mr. Trump.
Although testing has picked up since a series of setbacks left the United States behind, governors have continued to warn in recent days that their response is still hampered by shortages, including of basic supplies like swabs. Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, a Democrat, told CNN on Sunday that "we have a desperate need for the testing kits." And Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia, also a Democrat, warned last week that there was a shortage of testing materials in his state.
The president has recently taken to pointing to the volume of tests that have been administered -- a misleading figure because, according to health experts, the more relevant figure is how many people are being tested per capita. In that regard, the United States still lags well behind other nations like South Korea.
Other governors also made it clear to Mr. Trump that they needed more supplies, if somewhat more delicately. Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina, a Democrat, told Mr. Trump: "As much as you can send us is very much appreciated."
That prompted the president to note that "we have a lot of planes coming in" and that "Boeing gave us their big, monster cargo plane; it's the biggest cargo plane in the world."
At another point in the call, when someone asked if the governor of Utah was on the line, Mr. Trump cracked that he was probably visiting Mitt Romney, the state's junior senator who has been in quarantine after coming into contact with Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, who tested positive for the coronavirus.
A White House spokesman, Hogan Gidley, described the call this way: "The governors praised President Trump's leadership, assistance and quick action to address this national crisis, and the president told the governors he would make sure that whatever they may need, he would direct his team to provide."
And at the daily White House briefing on Monday afternoon, Mr. Trump described the call as an opportunity for the governors to thank his administration.
"I think for the most part, they were saying, Thank you for doing a great job," he said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Inslee said on Monday that he was shocked to hear the president convey a lack of awareness about testing concerns and that he was hopeful the president would look into the issue.
"It would be shocking to me that if anyone who has had access to any newspaper, radio, social networks or any other communication would not be knowledgeable about the need for test kits," Mr. Inslee said. "I can be assured that the White House knows very well about this desperate need for test kits."
Mr. Inslee said his state was facing a "dire" shortage of kits, leaving a choke point in an effort to ramp up testing. He described how, in one case, workers at the state's Health Department had to drive hours across Washington to pick up kits and bring them to the city of Yakima to help test during an outbreak there.
The state is looking everywhere it can to find test kits, Mr. Inslee said, but he would like to see the federal government order businesses around the country to manufacture them to help states get the supplies they need.
"This could really use federal leadership to get this job done," Mr. Inslee said.
While Washington has conducted tens of thousands of tests thus far, perhaps the most per capita behind New York, Mr. Inslee said officials needed much more to help guide decisions and containment strategies.

Texto completo: Though known from his TV role, he did much of his work on the stage, starting as an original Acting Company member.
David Schramm, an acclaimed stage and television actor best known for his role as the irascible owner of a small airline on the long-running sitcom "Wings" in the 1990s, has died. He was 73.
Margot Harley, a founder of the Acting Company, where Mr. Schramm was an original member, announced his death on Sunday. She did not give a cause or say where and when he died.
Though well known from his signature television role, Mr. Schramm was first and foremost a stage actor. He was drawing attention in New York while still a student at the Juilliard School, where he was a member of the first graduating class of the drama division.
That division was created in 1968 under John Houseman, and its first class of students, graduating in 1972, also included Kevin Kline, Patti LuPone and David Ogden Stiers.
The students' work was so well received that Mr. Houseman and Ms. Harley, the drama division's administrative director, formed the Acting Company, a professional troupe, in 1972, with the new graduates at its core. By 1973 the company was on Broadway with five plays in repertory, Mr. Schramm appearing in all of them.
He was often, as Mel Gussow put it in The New York Times in 1978, "the company's resident old character man." That year, at age 30, he was playing King Lear. Previously for the company, he had played an aging wanderer in Maxim Gorky's "The Lower Depths," the philosophical old doctor Chebutykin in Chekhov's "Three Sisters," and the father of one of the young lovers in Molière's "Scapin." After five years with the Acting Company, Mr. Schramm became a regular on regional stages as well as in New York theaters. A turning point in his career came in 1988, when he played the male lead in the Garson Kanin comedy "Born Yesterday" opposite Rebecca de Mornay at the Pasadena Playhouse in California. The production drew rave reviews.
"His portrayal is a true heir to Jackie Gleason: loud, blustery, swift, an ungrammatical ball of suet, as unaware of his arrogance as of his limitations," Sylvie Drake wrote in a review in The Los Angeles Times. "In spite of it all, Schramm succeeds in making Brock remarkably appealing -- a sort of disconnected large pussycat, with the roar and the timing of the lion that he's not."
The television industry took note.
"Because of those reviews, I landed in every casting office in town," Mr. Schramm told that newspaper in 1989. "I was the flavor of the month."
He had done little television before that -- his main credit had been playing Robert S. McNamara in the 1983 mini-series "Kennedy" -- but suddenly he was turning up in episodes of "Miami Vice," "Wiseguy" and other shows.
And then, in 1990, came "Wings." Mr. Schramm was cast as Roy Biggins, whose tiny airline shared a terminal on Nantucket Island in Massachusetts with one owned by two brothers, played by Tim Daly and Steven Weber. The cast also included Thomas Haden Church, Rebecca Schull and Crystal Bernard; Tony Shalhoub and Amy Yasbeck joined the ensemble later. The show ran for 172 episodes across seven seasons, a mainstay of the NBC schedule.
Biggins was a blustery, obnoxious fellow, who often played against Mr. Weber's laid-back character. On Twitter, Mr. Weber remembered the skill that Mr. Schramm had brought to the role.
"His timing was never less than perfect," Mr. Weber said, "his professionalism was always on display."
David Schramm was born on Aug. 14, 1946, in Louisville, Ky. In school he won trophies for public speaking, and at 17 he was an apprentice at the Actors Theater of Louisville.
"I got $ 25 a week to clean the toilets and be in a play," he told The Times of Trenton, N.J., in 2008, when he was in a production of Conor McPherson's "The Seafarer" at the George Street Playhouse in nearby New Brunswick. "My big line in my very first one was, 'I'm the station master, madam,' and on opening night I said, 'I'm the station madam, master.' People must have been thinking, 'Get this kid off the stage."'
He kept at it, though, taking acting classes at Western Kentucky University, where a speech and theater professor, Mildred Howard, read about the new drama division starting at Juilliard and urged him to try out.
"She worked on two audition pieces with me," he said, "arranged for the flight, packed a lunch, and said, 'Go!' I did and got accepted on the spot."
Mr. Schramm made occasional appearances on Broadway after his initial turns in the 1970s, most recently in 2009 as the bigoted Senator Rawkins in a revival of the musical comedy "Finian's Rainbow." (Charles Isherwood of The New York Times called his performance "boisterously oily.")
But the bulk of his stage work was in regional theaters. Critics praised his work in John Olive's "The Voice of the Prairie" at Hartford Stage in 1987, Beckett's "Waiting for Godot" at the Berkshire Theater Festival in 2008, John Patrick Shanley's "Outside Mullingar" at George Street in 2014, and many more.
"My specialty seems to be playing the loud, pompous, bombastic, verging-on-hysteria guy," Mr. Schramm told The Los Angeles Times in 1989. "But I'd rather establish a totally different persona each time. It's why I act."
Information on his survivors was not immediately available.
As for "Wings," Mr. Schramm told The Times of Trenton that he knew the show would be a success right from the start.
"When we sat around the table reading the first script," he recalled, "and I saw this buffoon they created for me, this pompous guy who said garish things to women, and all the other rich characters, I turned to Rebecca" -- Ms. Schull -- "and said, 'I think we've landed in a tub of butter.' And we did."

Texto completo: A proposal to retroactively lift a limit on state and local tax deductions would largely funnel money to relatively high earners in high-tax states.
WASHINGTON -- As lawmakers prepare for another round of fiscal stimulus to address economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested the next package include a retroactive rollback of a tax change that hurt high earners in states like New York and California.
A full rollback of the limit on the state and local tax deduction, or SALT, would provide a quick cash infusion in the form of increased tax rebates to an estimated 13 million American households -- nearly all of which earn at least $ 100,000 a year.
In an interview with The New York Times, Ms. Pelosi said the next phase of an economic rescue package should include additional measures to get more money directly to individuals -- like the $ 1,200 direct payments for low- and middle-income taxpayers that were authorized in the $ 2 trillion bill that President Trump signed on Friday.
That could be achieved, she said, by having Congress "retroactively undo SALT," a reference to a cap on the state and local tax deduction that Republicans included in their 2017 tax overhaul. That limit prevents households from deducting more than $ 10,000 a year in state and local tax expenses from their federal tax bills.
Henry Connelly, a spokesman for Ms. Pelosi, said on Monday evening that she was proposing something narrower than a full SALT rollback, and that any change would be "tailored to focus on middle-class earners and include limitations on the higher end."
"We could reverse that for 2018 and 2019 so that people could refile their taxes" and receive more money back from the government, Ms. Pelosi said in the interview. "They'd have more disposable income, which is the lifeblood of our economy, a consumer economy that we are."
In the 2018 midterm elections, Democrats wielded the SALT limits in House campaigns against Republicans in wealthy blue-state suburbs of cities like New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. Democrats voted last year to repeal the cap, but the effort died in the Republican-controlled Senate.
Republicans called the effort hypocritical, saying that it would primarily benefit wealthy households in high-tax states. Democrats had roundly denounced the 2017 law, which included rate cuts for businesses and individuals, as a handout to the rich. But the SALT deduction overwhelmingly benefits high earners.
"The ink is hardly dry on a $ 2 trillion-plus emergency package," said Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania. "It's far too soon to know whether and of what nature additional legislation is needed. If we determine that another measure is necessary, it should not be the vehicle for Speaker Pelosi's partisan, parochial wish list."
The congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimated last year that a full repeal of the SALT limit for 2019 alone would reduce federal revenues by about $ 77 billion. Americans earning $ 1 million a year or more would collectively reap $ 40 billion of those benefits. Most of the rest would go to households earning $ 200,000 or more.
That is a contrast with the bill Mr. Trump signed on Friday, which began to phase out direct payments for households earning $ 150,000 or more.
Ms. Pelosi's proposal represents "the way to get money into the hands of people who don't benefit from the $ 1,200 checks because they make too much money," said Kyle Pomerleau, a resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. "It certainly gets money into hands. But I'm not sure it's the correct hands."
Many liberal economic policy analysts also oppose lifting the SALT cap, calling it regressive tax policy. Seth Hanlon, a senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress, said the same logic was also a reason not to lift the limit in the next economic rescue bill. That is particularly true because consumption data show that low- and middle-income Americans are more likely than higher earners to spend benefits from the government immediately and stimulate economic activity.
To continue with direct assistance, Mr. Hanlon said, "there are ways you could target it to truly middle-class people. The problem is, relatively few middle-class people claim SALT."
The Tax Policy Center estimates that only 3 percent of households in the middle quintile of American taxpayers would receive any benefit at all from the SALT cap repeal.
"In and of itself," Mr. Hanlon said, "it doesn't strike me as the most effective way of targeting economic stimulus."

Your Bus Ride Risks a Driver's Life

Texto completo: Workers around the country are walking off the job to protest a lack of protective equipment, safety measures, even soap.
Millions of white-collar workers are telecommuting from home to stay safe as the coronavirus extends its terrifying reach across America. But millions of other workers -- supermarket cashiers, pharmacists, warehouse workers, bus drivers, meatpacking workers -- still have to report to work each day, and many are furious that their employers are not doing enough to protect them against the pandemic.
Some companies are not providing their workers with gloves or hand sanitizer, and some are even prohibiting employees from wearing masks for fear of frightening customers. Many workers feel they're putting their lives on the line each day by interacting with customers who might be infected and by working in places they're convinced have not been adequately sanitized against the virus.
Fearing retaliation, American workers are generally far more reluctant to stick their necks out and protest working conditions than are workers in other industrial countries. But with greater fear of the disease than of their bosses, workers have set off a burst of walkouts, sickouts and wildcat strikes.
With their employer's business booming, workers at Instacart, the grocery delivery service, have called for a strike on Monday, demanding that the company provide hazard pay and more personal protective supplies. Workers at an Amazon warehouse on Staten Island threatened a walkout on Monday if the company did not close the building and thoroughly clean it after several workers tested positive.
Last Tuesday, after a mechanic tested positive for the coronavirus, more than half the workers at Bath Iron Works, a shipyard in Maine, stayed home from work to pressure their employer to thoroughly clean the shipyard. Workers walked out at a Fiat Chrysler truck plant in Warren, Mich., because there was no hot water for washing up. Bus drivers in Birmingham, Ala., went on strike because they felt not enough was being done to protect them from contracting the coronavirus from infected passengers, and bus drivers in Detroit staged a sudden sickout for the same reason. Sanitation workers in Pittsburgh engaged in a work stoppage over their coronavirus worries.
"We want better equipment, protective gear. We have no masks," one of the sanitation workers told the television station WPXI. "We want hazard pay. Hazard pay is very important."
At a Kroger warehouse in Memphis, 200 workers walked out after learning that a co-worker had the virus.
"The ones that is here, they so tense they scared to touch the equipment," said Maurice Wiggins, a Kroger forklift driver and father of two. (He also said he is being forced to work a 97-hour, seven-day workweek.)
These workers are demanding what everyone else wants during the worst epidemic in a century -- safety. They feel their companies are taking them and their safety for granted, and they don't want to risk their lives for a paycheck, often a meager one. Many workers are angry that while their employers are doing a lively business, they haven't given them raises or hazard pay, which some other companies have provided.
"We're not getting nothing -- no type of compensation, no nothing, not even no cleanliness, no extra pay," said Kendaliyn Granville, who led a strike by 50 workers at a Perdue poultry processing plant in Kathleen, Ga. "We're up here risking our life for chicken."
Some of the strikers have said they resent risking their lives while chief executives earn millions and their companies' more highly paid white-collar employees are working safely at home.
Cooks and cashiers who walked out at a McDonald's restaurant in San Jose, Calif., said they didn't even have enough soap to clean their hands and were not provided with gloves, masks or hand sanitizers.
"They're not providing us with the simple necessities to combat the virus that is right in front of us," said Ana Martinez, a cook and drive-through worker at the San Jose McDonald's. "We feel underappreciated and undervalued, so my co-workers and I decided to take this step to fight back."
The anger behind these work actions is fed by the disregard and disrespect too many American employers show their workers by failing to provide fundamental protections that are universal in other industrial nations.
The United States is the only wealthy nation that doesn't have a national law guaranteeing workers paid parental leave and paid vacations. And until the recent passage of an emergency coronavirus law, it was one of the very few industrial nations not guaranteeing workers paid sick leave. The new law gives many American workers two weeks of paid leave if they need to take off work because of the virus, but in a stinging slap at workers, corporate America demanded and won an exemption for companies with more than 500 employees.
This month, 20 workers walked out at a McDonald's in Cicero, Ill., out of frustration that their restaurant's management was balking at giving them the paid sick days due to them under Illinois law.
Adriana Alvarez, a worker there, said some employees were going to work sick because they couldn't afford to go unpaid. The 30-minute walkout jolted management into agreeing to smooth the way for workers to obtain paid sick leave, Ms. Alvarez said.
Alexander Colvin, dean of the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, told me that the eruption of strikes "is a function of the American system where we get so much variation from employer to employer"
"We see some employers doing the right thing, standing by their employees during this crisis," he said, "and others not doing much at all."
As often happens when workers finally flex their collective muscles, their actions have gotten results. In Birmingham, the transportation authority limited the number of passengers allowed on a bus to 19, blocked off front seats, and had passengers enter and exit only by the rear entrance.
Perdue said it had stepped up its sanitation efforts. Those efforts included a more thorough cleaning of common areas, the cafeteria and locker rooms at the Georgia poultry plant. At the McDonald's in San Jose, Ms. Martinez said, restaurant management provided more gloves and soap, but not masks or hand sanitizer.
With the pandemic extending its reach, there certainly will be more walkouts. As consumers begin to have a hard time buying what they need, they should realize how many people are risking so much to keep them fed and safe, and they can demand that business and government do more to protect these essential workers.
"We are high-risk ticking time bombs for being exposed to someone with it," Scott Ryan, a 41-year-old bus driver from Everett, Wash., told co-workers in a Feb. 28 Facebook post. On Friday, Mr. Ryan, a father of three, died of Covid-19.

Texto completo: NEW YORK — New York's governor issued an urgent appeal for medical volunteers Monday amid a “staggering" number of deaths from the coronavirus, as he and health officials warned that the crisis unfolding in New York City is just a preview of what other communities across the United States could soon face.
“Please come help us in New York now," Governor Andrew Cuomo said as the state's death toll climbed by more than 250 in a single day to a total of more than 1,200 victims, most of them in the city. He said an additional 1 million health care workers are needed to tackle the crisis.
“We've lost over 1,000 New Yorkers," Cuomo said. "To me, we're beyond staggering already. We've reached staggering."
Even before the governor's appeal, close to 80,000 former nurses, doctors, and other professionals in New York were stepping up to volunteer.
"Whatever it is that they need, I'm willing to do," said Jerry Kops, a musician and former nurse whose tour with the show Blue Man Group was abruptly halted by the outbreak.
He returned to his Long Island home, where he volunteered to be a nurse again. While waiting to be reinstated, Kops has been helping at an assisted-living home near his house in Shirley, N.Y.
The spike in deaths in New York was another sign of the long fight ahead against the global pandemic, which was filling Spain's intensive care beds to capacity and shutting millions of Americans inside even as the crisis in China, where the outbreak began in December, kept easing.
More than 235 million people — about two of every three Americans — live in the 33 states where governors have declared statewide orders or recommendations to stay home.
The United States reported more than 160,000 infections and over 3,000 deaths, with New York City the nation's worst hot spot, and New Orleans, Detroit, and other cities also seeing alarming clusters.

Hospital ship drops anchor in New York Harbor
WASHINGTON — The enormous hospital ship USNS Comfort arrived in New York Harbor on Monday morning, a gleaming white beacon of hope for a besieged city as it fights the novel coronavirus.
But in sending a Navy hospital ship to join the battle against a pandemic, military officials have taken a huge and calculated risk: Can a ship, the type of vessel where viruses have been shown to spread with frightening ease, actually remain safe from the infection raging just outside?
Navy officials do not plan to treat people with coronavirus aboard the Comfort. The mission is to take patients with other medical problems to relieve New York hospitals overrun by virus patients. But it is not as if the ship's medical personnel can quarantine patients for two weeks before they accept them on board for treatment.
Navy officials insist that they are doing everything short of Saran-wrapping the ship to try to keep it virus-free.
That has meant almost sequestering the ship's crew of 1,200 for the past two weeks to lessen their chances of contracting the virus, Captain Joseph O'Brien, commodore of Task Force New York City, said. The ship closed its workout rooms days ago, and the crew members have been practicing social distancing — at least, as much as they can in the confined quarters of a ship.
But there remain challenges.
Navy officials acknowledge that it will be extremely difficult to ensure no one with coronavirus gets on board. The ship's crew will not be allowed off the ship.
With 12 operating rooms, 1,000 hospital beds, radiology services, a laboratory, pharmacy, and CT scanner, the Comfort is its own fully-staffed hospital.

Virus hits Detroit, a city that has seen crisis before
DETROIT — It has seen its population plummet, houses fall to ruin, and the largest municipal bankruptcy in the nation. Now another crisis has descended on Detroit: the coronavirus.
In less than two weeks, 35 people with the coronavirus have died in Detroit. The police chief has tested positive for the virus, and more than 500 police officers are in quarantine. On Sunday morning, the city's downtown, a center of Detroit's post-bankruptcy resurgence, was quiet and mostly deserted.
The virus could place a unique burden on Detroit, a city of 670,000 people where 3 of 10 residents live in poverty, a large number have asthma and other chronic diseases, and hospitals are already overwhelmed.
By Monday afternoon, with more than 6,500 cases, Michigan was third in known cases among the states, behind New York and New Jersey. Across the state, at least 196 residents have died, placing Michigan fourth across the nation in deaths from the virus.

Outbreak at Marine Corps boot camp infects dozens
A coronavirus outbreak has infected dozens of Marine recruits and staff members at the service's East Coast recruit training center, prompting the suspension of additional arrivals for the foreseeable future, defense officials said Monday.
The cases at Parris Island, S.C., emerged following a "wave in testing" over the weekend, a defense official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. One official said there are at least 20 positive cases, and another said there are believed to be a few dozen but less than 50.
The outbreak could mark the Defense Department's largest yet. Defense officials have said that dozens of sailors aboard the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt have tested positive for the virus while on deployment in the Pacific, forcing a stop last week for treatment in Guam.
The Marine Corps acknowledged the suspension of new recruits arriving at Parris Island but did not detail how many cases have emerged following a Pentagon decision last week to not provide specific information about coronavirus cases from individual bases and units.
Marine officials said in a statement that the service is taking steps to "protect its recruits, recruit training personnel, their families, and the communities where they live and serve by temporarily suspending the shipping of new recruits" to Parris Island.

Federal officials investigate pandemic profiteering
A Brooklyn man was arrested for coughing on FBI agents who came to investigate whether he was selling medical supplies, including N95 masks, at inflated prices in what appears to be one of the first cases related to alleged profiteering from the coronavirus pandemic.
Baruch Feldheim, 43, was charged with assaulting federal officers and lying to them about his accumulation and sale of medical supplies, the US attorney's office in New Jersey said Monday. He wasn't charged with profiteering.
The agents had been staking out Feldheim's residence in Brooklyn, watching people leave with what looked like medical supplies. Prosecutors said that Feldheim sold supplies at as much as a 700 percent markup to doctors and nurses.
Hospitals in New York, New Jersey, and elsewhere are running so short on medical equipment that doctors and nurses are being forced to reuse disposable masks for days at a time. That's spurred a wave of brokers and hustlers who are bombarding purchasing departments with offers, claiming they've located sources of supplies. Even if the administrators are willing to pay high prices, they're having trouble telling who's legitimate. The Trump administration has said it will crack down on profiteering.
One doctor in New Jersey contacted Feldheim on March 18 through a WhatsApp chat group called “Virus2020!" and arranged to buy about 1,000 N95 masks and other goods for $12,000, prosecutors said. Feldheim sent the doctor to an auto repair shop in Irvington, N.J., to pick up his order, according to the statement. The doctor later said that the shop had enough hand sanitizer and surgical supplies to outfit a hospital, prosecutors said.

Texto completo: Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. rejected a report that said nearly a dozen students are showing symptoms of the coronavirus after the Virginia school announced it was expecting thousands of students to return to campus following spring break.
The New York Times reported on Sunday that three of the students were told to go to a hospital, and another eight were told to self-quarantine. Falwell accused the newspaper of publishing a misleading report.
“The New York Times ambushed Liberty University to publish a false and misleading story claiming that, 'students started getting sick' after the University received students back after spring break. The Times attributed the reporter’s conclusion about the scope of the COVID-19 symptoms being about a dozen students to a local doctor who has consulted with LU. The truth is a far different story. Both the numbers and the sequencing are wrong,” he said in a lengthy statement.
Falwell disputed the number of students with symptoms, saying the school was not aware of any students in its residence halls who have tested positive for the coronavirus or have been tested at all. He said some students were asked to self-quarantine out of an abundance of caution.
“Liberty can confirm that, following the US Surgeon General’s recommendations concerning persons who had been in the New York City metropolitan area, Liberty University asked four students who had recently been in that area and who were living in campus residence hall rooms to self-quarantine for the recommended period in single rooms at Liberty’s otherwise unoccupied housing annex (a former hotel a few miles from campus). Two did and two opted to return to their permanent residence, instead. There were three students in close contact with these individuals and they were also asked to self-quarantine in separate rooms in the annex. They did,” he said.
“Liberty is also aware of one off-campus student who returned from an out-of-state county with a high number of cases who was running a fever and had a cough. He was tested and advised to self-isolate pending the results. He elected to return to his permanent residence instead. Another off-campus student came in for COVID-19 testing during spring break and her results came back negative,” he added.

Falwell said another student who recently graduated and lives off-campus was advised to self-isolate after he reported symptoms, and his test results are still being processed. That student visited the campus clinic, he said.
“So despite the Times’ sensational headline and story lead, Liberty is only aware of three off campus student who were sufficiently symptomatic to qualify for COVID-19 testing, two of which did not leave Lynchburg for Spring Break and one of which tested negative during Spring Break,” he said.

Falwell said this month he expected between several hundred and more than 5,000 students would return to on-campus housing to continue their studies. Classes have moved online, but some facilities, such as the fitness center and library, remained open.
“I think we have a responsibility to our students, who paid to be here, who want to be here, who love it here, to give them the ability to be with their friends, to continue their studies, enjoy the room and board they’ve already paid for and to not interrupt their college life,” Falwell said last week.
Falwell said more than 800 of the 1,900 students who returned to campus last week have since left. He said he had “no idea” how many students had returned to off-campus housing.
“If I were them, I’d be more nervous,” he said, because they live in more crowded conditions in off-campus rentals.

Annalee Newitz: What social distancing looked like in 1666

Texto completo: A lot of English people believed 1666 would be the year of the apocalypse. You can’t really blame them. In late spring 1665, bubonic plague began to eat away at London’s population. By fall, roughly 7,000 people were dying every week in the city. The plague lasted through most of 1666, ultimately killing about 100,000 people in London alone — and possibly as many as three-quarters of a million in England as a whole.
Perhaps the greatest chronicler of the Great Plague was Samuel Pepys, a well-connected English administrator and politician who kept a detailed personal diary during London’s darkest years. He reported stumbling across corpses in the street, and anxiously reading the weekly death tolls posted in public squares.
In August of 1665, Pepys described walking to Greenwich, “in my way seeing a coffin with a dead body therein, dead of the plague, lying in [a field] belonging to Coome farme, which was carried out last night, and the parish have not appointed any body to bury it, but only set a watch there day and night, that nobody should go thither or come thence, which is a most cruel thing.” To ensure that no one — not even the family of the dead person — would go near the corpse or bury it, the parish had stationed a guard. “This disease making us more cruel to one another than if we are doggs.”
It felt like Armageddon. And yet it was also the beginning of a scientific renaissance in England, when doctors experimented with quarantines, sterilization and social distancing. For those of us living through these stay-at-home days of Covid-19, it’s useful to look back and see how much has changed — and how much hasn’t. Humanity has been guarding against plagues and surviving them for thousands of years, and we have managed to learn a lot along the way.
[ Read complete coronavirus coverage here . ]
When a plague hit England during the summer of 1665, it was a time of tremendous political turmoil. The nation was deep into the Second Anglo-Dutch War, a nasty naval conflict that had torpedoed the British economy. But there were deeper sources of internal political conflict. Just five years earlier in 1660, King Charles II had wrested back control of the government from the Puritan members of Parliament led by Oliver Cromwell.
Though Cromwell had died in 1658, the king had him exhumed, his corpse put in chains and tried for treason. After the inevitable guilty verdict, the King’s henchmen mounted Cromwell’s severed head on a 20-foot spike over Westminster Hall, along with the heads of two co-conspirators. Cromwell’s rotting head stayed there, gazing at London, throughout the plague and for many years after.
War and social upheaval hastened the spread of the plague, which had broken out several years earlier in Holland. But when he wasn’t displaying the severed heads of his enemies, the king was invested in scientific progress. He sanctioned the founding of the Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge, a venerable scientific institution known today as The Royal Society.
It was most likely thanks to his interest in science that government representatives and doctors quickly used social distancing methods for containing the spread of bubonic plague. Charles II issued a formal order in 1666 that ordered a halt to all public gatherings, including funerals. Already, theaters had been shut down in London, and licensing curtailed for new pubs. Oxford and Cambridge closed.
Isaac Newton was one of the students sent home, and his family was among the wealthy who fled the cities so they could shelter in place at their country homes. He spent the plague year at his family estate, teasing out the foundational ideas for calculus.
Things were less cozy in London. Quarantining was invented during the first wave of bubonic plague in the 14th century, but it was deployed more systematically during the Great Plague. Public servants called searchers ferreted out new cases of plague, and quarantined sick people along with everyone who shared their homes. People called warders painted a red cross on the doors of quarantined homes, alongside a paper notice that read “LORD HAVE MERCY UPON US.” (Yes, the all-caps was mandatory).
The government supplied food to the housebound. After 40 days, warders painted over the red crosses with white crosses, ordering residents to sterilize their homes with lime. Doctors believed that the bubonic plague was caused by “smells” in the air, so cleaning was always recommended. They had no idea that it was also a good way to get rid of the ticks and fleas that actually spread the contagion.
Of course, not everyone was compliant. Legal documents at the U.K. National Archives show that in April 1665, Charles II ordered severe punishment for a group of people who took the cross and paper off their door “in a riotious manner,” so they could “goe abroad into the street promiscuously, with others.” It’s reminiscent of all those modern Americans who went to the beaches in Florida over spring break, despite what public health experts told them.
Pepys was a believer in science, and he tried to follow the most cutting-edge advice from his doctor friends. This included smoking tobacco as a precautionary measure, because smoke and fire would purify the “bad air.” In June of 1665, as the plague began, Pepys described seeing red crosses on doors for the first time. “It put me into an ill conception of myself and my smell,” he writes, “so that I was forced to buy some roll-tobacco to smell and chaw, which took away the apprehension.”
Quack medicine will always be with us. But there was some good advice, too. During the Great Plague, shopkeepers asked customers to drop their coins in dishes of vinegar to sterilize them, using the 1600s version of hand sanitizer.
Just as some American politicians blame the Chinese for the coronavirus, there were 17th century Brits who blamed the Dutch for spreading the plague. Others blamed Londoners. Mr. Pepys had relocated his family to a country home in Woolwich, and writes in his diary that the locals “are afeard of London, being doubtfull of anything that comes from thence, or that hath lately been there … I was forced to say that I lived wholly at Woolwich.”
By late 1666, the plague had begun its retreat from England, but one disaster led to another. In autumn, the Great Fire of London destroyed the city’s downtown in a weeklong conflagration. The damage was so extensive in part because city officials were slow to respond, having already spent over a year dealing with plague. The fire left 70,000 Londoners homeless and angry, threatening to riot.
While the mayor of London issued orders to evacuate the city, Pepys had more pedestrian concerns: He wrote about helping a friend dig a pit in his garden, where the two men buried “my Parmazan cheese, as well as my wine and some other things.” Even in the middle of a civilization-shaking event, people will still hoard odd things, like toilet paper — or cheese.
Despite the war, the plague and the fire, London survived. Urbanites rebuilt relatively quickly, using the same basic street layout. In 1667, Pepys was bustling around the healing city, putting his rooms back in order and turning his thoughts to new developments in politics.
Pepys survived. Scholars are still not sure whether he ever retrieved his cheese.

Texto completo: This is the moment to pray for the psychological welfare of our health care professionals. In the months ahead, many will witness unimaginable scenes of suffering and death, modern Pietàs without Marys, in which victims are escorted into hospitals by their loved ones and left to die alone.
I fear that these doctors and nurses and other first responders will burn out. I fear they will suffer from post-traumatic stress. And with the prospect of triage on the horizon, I fear they will soon be handed a devil’s kit of choices no healer should ever have to make. It’s a recipe for moral injury.
Succinctly put, moral injury is the trauma of violating your own conscience. It is an experience known to many combat veterans — the term was in fact popularized by Jonathan Shay, a longtime psychiatrist at a Department of Veterans Affairs outpatient clinic in Boston, in his book “Achilles in Vietnam.”
That this violation may be in the service of a larger, more defensible objective doesn’t matter — or rather, it does little to mitigate the guilt, self-reproach or spiritual crisis activated by making choices that feel so very wrong.
[ Read complete coronavirus coverage here . ]
Moral injury is now a looming reality for our front-line medical professionals, should they be forced to ration ventilators or other lifesaving resources. This is not why most of them went to medical and nursing school. “It’s something none of us have been trained for, except perhaps military physicians,” Dr. R. Sean Morrison, chair of geriatrics and palliative medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, told me. “There’s a tremendous amount of worry about what it’ll feel like in the moment.”
An article published on March 23 in The New England Journal of Medicine estimates that the number of U.S. patients who will require ventilation for the coronavirus could be as high as 31 per machine. A New York hospital, according to The Washington Post, is already putting two patients at a time on ventilators designed for one.
Triage, in other words, is probably inevitable.
Twenty-first century doctors in wealthy countries have no scripts for this. But there are resources emerging. Morrison pointed me to an astonishing website run by VitalTalk, an organization that under ordinary circumstances specializes in helping doctors communicate clearly and compassionately about serious illness.
It has a brand-new set of talking points for the coronavirus, including rationing. Morrison said it’s what the health care professionals at Mount Sinai will be referring to, should things get dire. And they’re utterly surreal.
Patient family : You’re playing God. You can’t do that.
Clinician response : I am sorry. I did not mean to give you that feeling. Across the city, every hospital is working together to try to use resources in a way that is fair for everyone. I realize that we don’t have enough. I wish we had more. Please understand that we are all working as hard as possible.
Patient family : Can’t you get 15 more ventilators from somewhere else?
Clinician response : Right now the hospital is operating over capacity. It is not possible for us to increase our capacity like that overnight. And I realize that must be disappointing to hear.
Patient family : How can you just take them off a ventilator when their life depends on it?
Clinician response : I’m so sorry that her condition has gotten worse, even though we are doing everything. Because we are in an extraordinary time, we are following special guidelines that apply to everyone here. We cannot continue to provide critical care to patients who are not getting better. This means that we need to accept that she will die, and that we need to take her off the ventilator. I wish things were different.
New York state does, in fact, have guidelines for ventilator allocation, written in 2015. They recommend that hospitals appoint triage officers or committees — made up of experts who do not have clinical responsibilities for the patients at issue — to make the difficult calls, thus easing the moral burden on the men and women on the ground. Who does and doesn’t get a ventilator, and for how long, will depend on a range of criteria, from the overall health of the patient to how well the patient is doing at that particular moment.
I’ve spoken to a number of doctors who said they’re comforted by these guidelines. There are clear rules to follow.
But Stephen Xenakis, a psychiatrist and retired brigadier general who has spent decades treating veterans, said rules aren’t sufficient to inoculate first responders from psychological suffering.
“We have rules, too, in the military,” he told me. “Rules of engagement. And you may follow the rules of engagement, and everyone around you may say that you followed the rules of engagement. But after the incident occurs, you ask yourself, ‘Did I make the right decision?’ Because the outcome was not acceptable, was not digestible.”
Or it’ll be something even more nuanced than that. The outcome may be acceptable — that is, reconcilable — in the moment. But not later on.
Xenakis gave an example of a doctor who removes a 70-year-old patient from a ventilator. The man’s children are pleading. But the if-then of the algorithm requires it. A decade later, that doctor’s own father is 70. And it hits her, hard: Did she really make that decision?
“The angst that clinicians may experience when asked to withdraw ventilators for reasons not related to the welfare of their patients should not be underestimated,” warns the authors of the article in The New England Journal of Medicine. “It may lead to debilitating and disabling distress.”
We look at veterans and thank them for their service, never being able to fully comprehend what they’ve been through. The same may soon be true of some of our health care professionals. We may think we know. But we don’t.

Texto completo: The strangest part of President Donald Trump’s coronavirus response is that it’s almost certainly damaging his chances of reelection.
I realize that may sound surprising, given that his approval rating has been rising. But when you look beyond day-to-day events — which Trump often struggles to do — you see that he is creating the conditions for a miserable summer and fall, with extended virus outbreaks and a deeper recession. The summer and fall, of course, are the crux of the presidential campaign.
Trump’s virus strategy revolves around trying to make the present seem as good as possible, without much concern for the future. He spent almost two months denying that the virus was a serious problem and falsely claiming that the number of cases was falling. He has spent the last two weeks alternately taking aggressive measures and refusing to do so, often against the advice of public-health experts. Some Republican governors, following Trump’s lead, are also rejecting those experts’ pleas: There are beaches open in Florida, restaurants open in Georgia and Missouri and many people out and about in Oklahoma and Texas.
Altogether, the United States seems to have engaged in the least aggressive response of any affected country. Sure enough, it also now has the world’s largest number of confirmed cases. The American caseload was initially following a similar path as the Chinese and Italian caseloads. But the number of American infections is now rising uniquely fast, with 96,000 new cases in the last week — more than twice as many as in any seven-day period in any other country.
[ Read complete coronavirus coverage here . ]
This surge doesn’t cause only more short-term deaths and overwhelmed hospitals. It also leads to more cases in later months, by creating a larger group of infected people who can spread the virus to others. As Tom Frieden, a former head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told me, “The higher the peak, the longer it lasts.”
And the longer that the country is gripped by the virus, the deeper that the economic downturn will be. Austan Goolsbee, a University of Chicago professor, refers to this as the first rule of “virus economics”: The only way to resuscitate the economy is to stop the virus. Premature attempts to restart business activity will lead to further outbreaks, which will cause more fear and new shutdowns.
A bipartisan group of business executives, government officials and others, including former Federal Reserve chairs Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen and four former Treasury secretaries, put it this way: “Saving lives and saving the economy are not in conflict right now; we will hasten the return to robust economic activity by taking steps to stem the spread of the virus and save lives.”
This idea isn’t just theoretical. There is now evidence, from places that have enacted a temporary shutdown of almost all nonessential activity. That’s how Wuhan, where the virus began, reduced new cases to nearly zero. It’s how the New York suburb of New Rochelle seems to have contained its outbreak.
Counterintuitively, these shutdowns also help the economy. A fascinating new study, from researchers at the Fed and MIT, has analyzed the social-distancing policies that various American cities enacted during the 1918 flu pandemic. Some cities, like Los Angeles, Seattle, Minneapolis and Cleveland, closed schools and banned public gatherings earlier and for longer periods. Others, like San Francisco, Philadelphia and St. Paul, Minnesota, were less aggressive.
The first group of cities suffered fewer deaths — and also enjoyed higher average employment and manufacturing output, as well as stronger bank balance sheets, in the following year. The title of the paper — by Sergio Correia, Stephan Luck and Emil Verner — says it all: “Pandemics Depress the Economy, Public Health Interventions Do Not.”
The economic costs are still severe. Today, the most effective response would probably be a two-month national shutdown, accompanied by a modestly larger stimulus bill than Congress just passed, both to pay many Americans’ salaries and to bolster the health care system. When the two months were over, healthy people could go back to work, and any new cases could be quickly isolated. That second phase would be similar to the strategy in Singapore and Taiwan.
Had Trump taken this approach in late February, a full month after the first American fell ill, he could have vastly reduced the human and economic toll. Even if he took it now, he could probably get the country functioning close to normally by early summer. Instead, he is talking about normalcy by Easter — and making it likely that things will still be abnormal on July Fourth.
What explains his response? Trump lives in the moment. He is impetuous. He is like a day trader, not a long-term investor. A shutdown sounds miserable to him. He doesn’t have much respect for scientists and their data, but he does pay close attention to his poll numbers. And they’re rising (along with, it’s worth noting, the approval rating of other world leaders). Trump’s approach seems to be working, for now.
I can’t tell you exactly what the future will bring, especially during a crisis unlike any the world has confronted in a century. It’s possible that Trump could somehow luck out and the virus will end up being less gruesome for all of us. But that’s not the likely outcome. And nobody should forget that he is choosing a path that endangers lives and jobs mostly because it feels better to him in the moment.

Texto completo: The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a global public health crisis. But here in the United States — as is likely true in other countries — the response to it is heavily overlaid with political calculations. It is both obvious and inevitable. The crisis is unfolding in the lead-up to the election.
Viewed strictly in a political light, the consequences and rewards of responses to this virus — good responses as well as bad ones — suggest a new political dynamic that has few predecessors.
There was an election in the midst of the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918, but that was a midterm election year, not a presidential one.
I would submit that in general, a national crisis benefits the incumbent, if the nation is perceived to be at war against an outside actor. In such cases, there is a predictable nationalistic rallying. Fear becomes an adhesive; heroism becomes an antidepressant. And the president’s bully pulpit is amplified, as networks carry his news conferences and announcements live and the American public tunes in.
[ Read complete coronavirus coverage here . ]
People need reassurance, stability and leadership, and changing the person in command in the middle of the process might not appeal to many.
As such, Donald Trump has tried in every way to make fighting the pandemic feel like fighting a war. As he tried to frame it: “We’re at war, in a true sense we’re at war, and we are fighting an invisible enemy.” But an invisible enemy doesn’t work as well as a visible one, so Trump now regularly refers to the virus as the “Chinese virus.”
The problem for Trump is that this actually isn’t a war. It’s a health crisis. The government may attempt to mobilize in some of the same ways it would if the country were actually at war, but a health crisis carries a different psychological freight than a combat war.
A virus is invisible, as Trump originally phrased it, so there isn’t a person or a people to vilify. An invisible army of submicroscopic infectious agents with no mind and no capacity for malice isn’t an enemy that calls up patriotic defensive cohesion.
Calling the virus “the Chinese virus” is the closest Trump can get to a target, to racist, cultural scapegoating. Regardless of where the first case of this virus was identified, the United States now has more confirmed cases than any country in the world.
Furthermore, the theater of battle is out of sight, due to patient privacy concerns and HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) regulations. This war is being waged in hospitals, and the closest most of us will truly get to understanding the gravity and human cost of the situation is from personal testimonials from health care providers.
Here again, the battle differs. In a traditional war, or even a terrorist attack, the front line combatants are public servants, extensions of the government: soldiers, police officers, firefighters.
In the case of a health care emergency, many of those on the front lines are private citizens in a for-profit industry. They may rise, and they have in this case, to true honor, nobility and service, but it is hard for a politician to take credit for their effort and sacrifice.
That is a thing that leaders like to do: Find a moment when they can declare a victory, even if the war still rages — George W. Bush on an aircraft carrier standing in front of a “Mission Accomplished” banner, or Barack Obama announcing the killing of Osama bin Laden. There is not likely to be such a dramatic moment with this virus unless a vaccine or treatment is quickly developed.
Still, Trump forecasts a victory moment, saying earlier this month, “Americans from every walk of life are coming together and thanks to the spirit of our people, we will win this war and we are, we’re winning and we’re going to win this war.”
Furthermore, it is nearly impossible to grasp the scope of the lethality of the crisis. We see numbers climb, but we rarely see the human representation of those numbers.
There is no battlefield to visit. There is no pile of rubble to climb. There is no communal gathering place. Even if there was a place to gather, gatherings are strictly discouraged during this crisis. There is no collective action, and therefore collective conscience, because we are isolated from one another.
The most we see is online concerts and convening, and people clapping or singing from balconies. There are no candlelight vigils. There are no massive quilts.
Trump needs America to view the fight against the virus as a war against an army unleashed by a foreign power — one over which we will emerge victorious. Only in that light can he emerge as a valiant leader.
Seen the other way, the way it truly is — as a national health emergency during which he has failed by downplaying its significance and lying about his response — it would be a disaster.

Those with disabilities have a right to survive the coronavirus pandemic

Texto completo: Predictions that up to 70 percent of the population will contract COVID-19 this year create a horrifying reality for me and the millions of other people with disabilities in this country. We live with the constant reminder that, on any given day, a silent killer could come knocking on our doors. And for those of us who are unable to self-isolate effectively during the coronavirus pandemic due to our dependence on caregivers, it seems as though it's only a matter of time before our killer gains entry.
Yet no one in leadership is talking about us — 790,000 people in Massachusetts alone and 61 million adults in the United States. We are simply looking for the hope necessary for our survival. Each day of this pandemic has become more terrifying than the last.
At 3, I was diagnosed with a progressive neuromuscular disorder called spinal muscular atrophy, and I lost the ability to walk at 11. With the use of a power wheelchair, I was able to live independently, become an attorney, and accomplish my dreams. That is, until everything collapsed with the onset of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. I went from trying cases to suffering through eight years of isolation, chronic illness, and unimaginable pain. To my further devastation, the SMA progressed, and I was forced to rely on caretakers for daily living, such as getting dressed and in and out of bed.
Thanks to hope, self-advocacy, and a supportive family, I was able to regain my health and reclaim my life. Last year, I was admitted to the Harvard Kennedy School on a full merit scholarship. Ever since, I have spent each day making a sharp U-turn toward a path to the American Dream. Then, in an instant, the COVID-19 pandemic catapulted me into yet another dead-end of isolation.
During the White House press briefing on March 17, Vice President Mike Pence announced, “You don't need the results of testing to know what you should do." While this might be true for most Americans, this is a gross misrepresentation for people with disabilities.
A few weeks before President Trump declared a national emergency, my part-time caretaker went abroad. She returned with symptoms of an upper respiratory infection and a dry cough. I asked her to stay home until she improved. But three weeks later, her condition still lingers. While the answer is to test her for COVID-19, she has been repeatedly denied.
Without her assistance, we must rely on volunteers to leave food and supplies in my apartment lobby. My mother then carefully retrieves them with gloves and disinfects each item with Clorox. I am forbidden to go outdoors due to the risk of inadvertently encountering the virus. My doctors are scrambling to provide my standard care at home even though a visiting nurse would also increase my risk exposure.
The isolation and uncertainty of this situation have been challenging, to say the least. The chances of infection have caused my mental health to erode. While everyone else hears the deafening silence of ghost towns and abandoned streets, I hear the loud rumbling of an impending tidal wave of contagion ready to carry me away to an untimely death.
Moreover, the existence of draconian laws that call for medical rationing during a public health emergency makes it clear that I will certainly be left to die if our hospitals reach capacity. For example, in Tennessee, people with SMA can be legally denied critical care if they require assistance with activities of daily living. As Ari Ne'eman points out in The New York Times, policies like this exist throughout the country, and a glance into our future will likely mimic Italy's current predicament, where they are sacrificing the medically fragile for the healthy.
Unfortunately, my situation is not unique. Twenty percent of American adults are disabled and at risk of contracting severe COVID-19 due to a disability. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have significant disabilities, rely on caretakers, and have a higher risk exposure than virtually any other community. Contrary to Pence's statement, we don't know what to do without access to testing, because we and our caretakers need regular testing to reduce that risk.
My experience with years of illness and isolation taught me one critical lesson about survival: Without hope, death is inevitable. Thus, our political leaders need to give us a glimmer of light in these dark times. Rather than minimizing the scarcity of tests, the government needs to provide regular in-home testing to Americans with disabilities, our caretakers, and home-health providers. And our government must guarantee life-saving care to every patient, regardless of age, disability or preexisting condition.
It must be clear to us and the nation that disabled lives matter. Anything less is an undeniable statement that our lives are expendable and our mental health is irrelevant. The real question is: Do our leaders, in Washington and across the country, have the moral integrity to recognize that these issues exist in the first place?

The Trump-CNN Consensus; Plus, a New York Times columnist discovers companies unworthy of subsidies.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump and CNN spend a lot of time saying nasty things about each other, but they have achieved consensus on the most important question of our time. They agree that suppressing large parts of the U.S. economy for at least several more weeks is the right response to the coronavirus. As for the costs and the benefits of this multi-trillion-dollar experiment, perhaps the President will provide more details on Tuesday night so that Americans can decide whether to join the Trump-media consensus.
With all due respect to the experienced government managers of infectious-disease programs who share the podium each day with Mr. Trump, do they understand the financial stress their recommendations are inflicting on a highly indebted society?
Marcus Walker writes in the Journal:
The coronavirus has produced something new in economic history. Never before have governments tried to put swaths of national economies in an induced coma, artificially maintain their vital organs, and awaken them gradually.
Some past societies, such as medieval Europe, abandoned economic activities as people tried to escape plagues, and suffered heavy disruptions to their social order. In other pandemics, such as the flu of 1918, economic interactions continued with only limited quarantine measures, as authorities accepted contagion and deaths as the price of continuity.
Today, many nations are more willing—or feel more able—to try to have it both ways. Their hope is to press pause on the economy, save lives, and then press play again. If it works cleanly, it will be a testament to the flexibility of modern capitalism and the ingenuity of modern government. More likely, much will go wrong.
Narrator: Much is going wrong. The fact that politicians are already talking about the next stimulus bill right after enacting the $2-trillion stimulus law is an indication. So is the flood of new proposals from various quarters on how to do instant massive wealth transfers from savers to borrowers by forgiving debts.
To be fair to Mr. Trump, limits on commerce in the U.S. are mainly the work of mayors and governors. But his federal guidelines also discourage a lot of business activity. On Sunday in the Rose Garden, Mr. Trump suggested that he had decided to continue the guidelines for another month based on warnings from his public health experts that failing to counter the virus could cost more than two million lives.
And according to the official White House transcript of his press conference, the President says his economic advisers are not objecting:
Q Thanks, Mr. President. You've talked a lot about concerns about leaving the economy shut down for so long. Was there any dissent from your top economic advisors in your decision to leave the guidelines in place until the end of April?
THE PRESIDENT: No. No. And this is before we heard the 2.2 million people. I mean, we had a lot of people who were saying, "Maybe we shouldn't do anything. Just ride it." They say, "Ride it like a cowboy. Just ride it. Ride that sucker right through."
But abstaining from broad government mandates doesn't mean doing nothing. Soaring sales of masks and hand sanitizer may represent panic in some cases but they clearly show that people are capable of voluntary action to keep clean hands and avoid touching their faces.
As Americans consider the appropriate actions, for the time being they can observe a concurrent experiment in Europe where government has restricted some mass gatherings but is relying on voluntary action to prevent infection more than other jurisdictions.
David Keyton reports for the Associated Press:
Swedish authorities have advised the public to practice social distancing and to work from home, if possible, and urged those over age 70 to self-isolate as a precaution. Yet compared to the lockdowns imposed elsewhere in the world, the government's response to the virus allows a liberal amount of personal freedom...
"Sweden is an outlier on the European scene, at least," said Johan Giesecke, the country's former chief epidemiologist and now adviser to the Swedish Health Agency, a government body. "And I think that's good."
...For now, the Swedish government maintains that citizens can be trusted to exercise responsibility for the greater good and will stay home if they experience any COVID-19 symptoms. Many Swedes are indeed keeping the recommended distance from others.
Holly Ellyat reports for CNBC:
Tom, an Englishman who works in construction in Stockholm, said he was impressed that the country remained so calm.
"Besides the obvious social media influences, I think if they would have enforced harsher initiatives like other countries there would have been more panic," he said.
"People have been good in accommodating small changes in their lives to help stop the spread, and have been very helpful to each other..."
This is the Swedish model but it sounds very American. In coming days and weeks, citizens of both countries will be able to view the results and respond accordingly.

Bottom Stories of the Day
New York Times Writer Deems Competitors Unworthy of Subsidies For news consumers who have been wondering if there's any scenario in which the New York Times could tolerate unfettered capitalism, we may finally have an answer. "Bail Out Journalists. Let Newspaper Chains Die," argues a Times media column.
The paper has a long tradition advocating on behalf of various claimants to federal assistance. But it seems that there's at least one corner of American life where the Gray Lady is ready to let capitalism's creative destruction work its magic. Timesman Ben Smith makes the case for going full Schumpeter on the paper's corporate competitors:
The news business, like every business, is looking for all the help it can get in this crisis. Analysts believe that the new federal aid package will help for a time and that the industry has a strong case to make...
But the advertising business that has sustained the local newspapers — the car dealers, retailers and movie theaters that for generations filled their pages with ads — has gone from slow decline to free fall.
Therefore Mr. Smith has judged that certain companies simply must be allowed to die. He notes that "the leaders trying to get the local news industry through this economic shock need to confront reality" and adds:
Many of the worthy suggestions for saving the news business dodge this central issue. Margaret Sullivan, at The Washington Post, suggested a broad "coronavirus stimulus plan," and a column in The Atlantic called for a huge government spending on public health ads. Without careful restrictions, a huge share of that government money will go to doomed newspaper chains for whom a major goal, as Gannett's chief executive said on his last earnings call in late February, is paying a dividend to shareholders unwise enough to invest in his doomed business. (Gannett executives declined to speak to me for this column.)
If the Times is ready to allow its newspaper competitors the freedom to fail, would the paper also consider this policy for giant financial firms?

Texto completo: Roosevelt's first inaugural cleared the way for action, pointing the country toward a singular goal. Where is that spirit now?
The coronavirus pandemic may plunge the United States into its worst social and economic crisis since the Great Depression. But our response -- from the president's blame-shifting rhetoric to the Senate's inadequate relief package -- has yet to rise to the scale and scope of the challenge.
I've written before about why Congress needs to do far more than it has if it wants to save the economy from disease-induced depression. Here, I want to focus on rhetoric. If the country needs a New Deal-esque effort to stop the pandemic, then it also needs New Deal-esque leadership to mobilize manpower and resources to that end.
It's with this in mind that I want to look to Franklin Roosevelt's first Inaugural Address. Elected in November 1932, Roosevelt was well aware of a deep national hunger for leadership -- for someone to bring energy to government and confront an economic crisis that threatened the entire social order.
Roosevelt was inaugurated on March 4, 1933. The day was gray and grim. "Though the city was gay with flags and lively with the music of bands and cheers for the marchers in the inaugural parade which followed the oath taking," Arthur Krock wrote in The New York Times, "the atmosphere which surrounded the change of government in the United States was comparable to that which might be found in a beleaguered capital in wartime."
For good reason. "In the agonizing interval between Roosevelt's election in November 1932 and his inauguration in March 1933, the American banking system shut down completely" and "the global economy slid even deeper into the trough of the Depression," the historian David M. Kennedy writes in "Freedom From Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945." In "The Crisis of the Old Order," the first of his three volumes on Roosevelt and the New Deal, Arthur Schlesinger Jr. described the situation as a "fog of despair."
"One out of every four American workers lacked a job," he wrote:
Factories that had once darkened the skies with smoke stood ghostly and silent, like extinct volcanoes. Families slept in tarpaper shacks and tin-lined caves and scavenged like dogs for food in the city dump.
Schlesinger continued:
Thousands of vagabond children were roaming the land, wild boys of the road. Hunger marchers, pinched and bitter, were parading cold streets in New York and Chicago.
Americans didn't just hurt in the present; they feared for the future. "Hope proved elusive," the historian Ira Katznelson writes in "Fear Itself: The New Deal and the Origins of Our Time:"
The rumble of deep uncertainty, a sense of proceeding without a map, remained relentless and enveloping. A climate of universal fear deeply affected political understandings and concerns. Nothing was sure.
Rather than avoid or ignore that fear, Roosevelt used his first words as president to face it head on. "A host of unemployed citizens face the grim problem of existence, and an equally great number toil with little return. Only a foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment," he said. And yet, he continued, the nation's distress "comes from no failure of substance," before adding, "We are stricken by no plague of locusts." Instead, Americans face poverty and deprivation because "the rulers of the exchange of mankind's goods have failed, through their own stubbornness and their own incompetence."
To be fair, Roosevelt said, these men "have tried." But their efforts "have been cast in the pattern of an outworn tradition." In the face of a devastating crisis, they did more of the same. "They have no vision, and where there is no vision the people perish."
Thankfully, those men were now gone from the scene. "The money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilization," Roosevelt said. "We may now restore that temple to the ancient truths." And what are those truths? It is the truth that "happiness lies not in the mere possession of money" but in the "joy of achievement, in the thrill of creative effort." It is the truth that "the joy and moral stimulation of work no longer must be forgotten in the mad chase of evanescent profits."
For Roosevelt, the nation needed a change in ethics: an "abandonment of the false belief that public office and high political position are to be valued only by the standards of pride of place and personal profit" and "an end to conduct in banking and in business which too often has given to a sacred trust the likeness of callous and selfish wrongdoing." At the same time, the country also needed immediate relief. To that end, he asked Americans to treat the challenge of unemployment and idle production "as we would treat the emergency of a war."
This meant an end to the timid policies of the past and the orthodoxy that constrained Washington in the face of crisis and the start of a new, energetic approach to wielding the powers of the federal government. Roosevelt called for "direct recruiting by the government itself" to relieve unemployment and "direct efforts to raise the values of agricultural products" to prevent "the tragedy of the growing loss through foreclosure of our small homes and farms." He called for "unifying of relief activities" and "national planning for and supervision of all forms of transportation and of communications and other utilities which have a definitely public character." And he insisted that all of this is "feasible under the form of government which we have inherited from our ancestors." The Republic was under stress, but it hadn't been broken.
As Roosevelt neared the end of his address, he returned to the language of ethics as well as the language of war:
If I read the temper of our people correctly, we now realize as we have never realized before our interdependence on each other; that we cannot merely take but we must give as well; that if we are to go forward, we must move as a trained and loyal army willing to sacrifice for the good of a common discipline.
The American people craved leadership and Roosevelt delivered it, taking center stage in the nation's political life and holding it for the next 12 years. Still, it would be another two years before his legislative program matched his rhetorical ambitions. It was the so-called second New Deal of the Social Security Act and the National Labor Relations Act that fundamentally altered the federal government's relationship to its citizens.
The larger point, however, is this: It took more than competence and ability to resolve the crisis of the 1930s. President Herbert Hoover was competent (in the early 1920s he spearheaded a relief effort that saved millions of Russians from starvation in the wake of famine and civil war); Hoover was able. But Hoover was committed to a failed orthodoxy, unable to think beyond the dogma of the past. Roosevelt wasn't a blank slate, but he was flexible. He could think creatively about government, and his allies were eager to experiment. They brought openness and imagination to Washington and helped save the country in the process.
As we face what may become the great crisis of our age, we need that Rooseveltian leadership: flexible, creative and deeply aware of the power of words. Roosevelt's first inaugural wasn't just an impressive speech; it was a harbinger of things to come. Like nearly all of the most memorable presidential rhetoric, it cleared the way for action, pointing the country toward a singular goal. Put another way, the Roosevelt of March 1933 did not know how the future would unfold, but he understood the power he had to shape the limits of what was possible -- and he didn't hesitate to put it to work.

Texto completo: President Trump took the lectern in the White House press briefing room with a somber face on the afternoon of March 19, the day the tally of confirmed U.S. coronavirus cases was expected to pass the 10,000 mark.
But about an hour into a briefing filled with bleak data, a correspondent for conservative One America News Network known for her pro-Trump advocacy asked him a question, and a smile crossed his lips.
She was asking about the treachery of the "left-wing media." One of his favorite subjects.
"It amazes me when I read the Wall Street Journal, which is always so negative," he began. "It amazes me when I read the New York Times, it's not even - I barely read it, you know, we don't even distribute it in the White House anymore, the same thing with The Washington Post . . ."
Behind him stood the surgeon general, the FDA commissioner and other officials waiting to field questions about the pandemic that experts fear could kill millions worldwide and crash the global economy. But not even the defining crisis of his presidency would permit a cease-fire in Team Trump's 24/7 multifaceted, asymmetrical war on the media.
In fact, Trump's initial playing down of the coronavirus was due in part to his belief, stoked by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, that the media was using the pandemic as yet another way to attack him, according to four Trump advisers who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk about internal discussions. A representative for Kushner did not reply to a request for comment.

The anti-media antagonism can manifest like an organized crusade in some cases but also more like a culture - a vernacular shared by the president and his allies on the right. Their battles are waged in the courts, on social media and at rallies where Trump's rants against the journalists who cover him goad his fans into taunting the camera crews and booing the press pens.
This war often seems intended to inoculate the president from criticism or scandal by undermining the public's confidence in the news they see reported by traditional media. The best-organized efforts include a blitz of defamation lawsuits, well-financed undercover stings to capture video evidence of media bias and troll-ish campaigns to embarrass individual reporters.
But the tone is set by the commander in chief, for whom it all often seems like a grand sport. Trump was just getting warmed up on his anti-media rant that day - a day when, as it would turn out, the tally of U.S. coronavirus infections would actually surge past 13,000. (By the time this story published, it had passed 136,000 cases, with more than 2,400 deaths.) He spent nearly three minutes regurgitating conspiracy theories and disses, streamed live on broadcast and cable news channels and websites of news organizations he considers the enemy.
"I think I came up with this term, 'Fake News' " he went on. "It's corrupt news. . . . They're saying we're doing a great job, everybody's saying, then you'll read this phony story. . . . The press is very dishonest - they are siding with China, they are doing things they shouldn't be doing."

Two years after Trump praised a congressional candidate for body-slamming a reporter, his increasingly aggressive verbal assaults on reporters - many of whom he calls out by name - have prompted concerned executives to post armed guards outside newsrooms, for fear that he could inspire deranged people to lash out at journalists.
"The president's way of personalizing these attacks - targeting particular journalists - is dangerous," Dean Baquet, executive editor of the New York Times, said in an email. Martin Baron, executive editor of The Washington Post, said in a statement in response to Trump's attacks on journalists that the attacks were "clearly for the purpose of subjecting them to harassment and threats." Both said the president's persistent jabs won't affect coverage, however.
But inside Trump circles, there's a sense that criticizing the media has served him well with his base, who see it as fair pushback against a journalism establishment they are convinced is unduly harsh on their leader. "There is no question," said Tim Murtaugh, communications director for Trump's 2020 campaign, "that the hostility of the mainstream media towards the president is something that gets the president's supporters fired up."
"I don't think it's good for democracy that we're branding an entire industry as an enemy," said Sean Spicer, Trump's first press secretary. "But is it effective? I think so. I'm not saying it's right."


Trump used to love the media. He courted reporters by giving them access and coaxing positive coverage. His path to celebrity was sprinkled with glowing profiles and glitzy magazine spreads that promoted a portrait of a self-made real estate savant, rather than the scion of a successful business built by his father.
"He is tall, lean and blond with dazzling white teeth, and he looks ever so much like Robert Redford," read a 1976 New York Times profile. By the 1980s, Trump had graduated to the cover of Newsweek, appearing with his hands on his hips, a smile that seemed to say he was on top of the world and the headline: "Trump: A billion-dollar empire and an ego to match."
As president, Trump has sometimes lamented the end of his love affair with the profile writers and headline stylists who used to find him so irresistible.
"I had a 45-year good relationship with the press, and what the hell happened?" Trump asked Anthony Scaramucci, the short-lived White House communications director, who recalled the moment in an interview with The Washington Post.
"I told him, 'You declared war! You had Steve Bannon declare war,' " recalled Scaramucci, referring to Trump's former campaign chief and White House adviser. (Scaramucci left the Trump administration after 11 days in office when a tape surfaced of him berating a reporter.)
Some in the White House tried to push back at his broad-brush "fake news" characterizations. Spicer recalled going over stories with the president that had displeased him, assessing them section by section. "We would talk about it," Spicer told The Post. "He then typically branded it fake."
Trump spent much of his 2016 campaign beating up on the media. But it wasn't until after he was inaugurated that he issued something like a formal declaration of war.
One afternoon in February 2017, ensconced at Mar-a-Lago, he deployed his Twitter account to declare with all-caps bombast that the "FAKE NEWS media" is "the enemy of the American people." He specifically cited the New York Times, CNN, NBC, ABC and CBS.
His statement on that day generated shock in the media world and among his critics. But it caught on with conservative fans who have long nurtured a belief that the mainstream media tilts to the left.
Three years later, the smear has taken hold on conservative websites and in the long lines of supporters outside Trump rallies, functioning like an Internet GIF that cycles endlessly on the screens of the national consciousness.
A master of catchphrases, Trump had created a rallying cry in "enemy of the people" that seems to have penetrated a large part of the national psyche. Already, according to a recent poll, one-third of Americans agree with him that the media is the people's enemy.


It was certainly a message that resonated with some industrious allies of the president.
Covering the New Hampshire primary in February, ABC News correspondent David Wright found himself in a candid conversation about the media business. "I don't think we're terribly interested in voters," he griped to his new acquaintance. He mused that the media doesn't do enough to hold Trump to account, but "we also don't give him credit for what things he does do."
Wright didn't realize his conversation was being recorded. Weeks later, the hidden-camera footage was released to the world as a scandal: "Senior ABC Reporter Reveals Top Bosses Spikes News Important to Voters . . . Network Refuses to Acknowledge Trump's Successes."
It was the work of Project Veritas, a group of conservative provocateurs that for a decade has run sting operations to embarrass left-leaning groups and seek evidence of political bias among top media organizations - with substantial financial support from a charity backed by the conservative oil baron Koch brothers.
The campaign is representative of the right's new willingness to tar not just an industry but its individual members, and it has put some newsrooms into a heightened state of wariness. Wright, who was also caught on tape criticizing ABC News for promoting the entertainment offerings of parent company Disney, was suspended after the Project Veritas release. "Any action that damages our reputation for fairness and impartiality or gives the appearance of compromising it harms ABC News and the individuals involved," the network said in a statement.
Another guerrilla offensive was mounted last year by Arthur Schwartz, a friend of Donald Trump Jr., who set out to find journalists' most deeply shameful social media posts. Schwartz, who declined to comment for this story, used an algorithm to scan for the posts, often going back as far as the journalists' teenage or college years, according to a person familiar with his efforts who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to reveal strategy.
Among Schwartz's efforts - a CNN photo editor who resigned after 2011 tweets about "Jewish pigs" surfaced (he apologized, saying he had been stupidly repeating slogans he'd heard as a teenager), and a New York Times editor, who apologized after the revelation of decade-old anti-Semitic tweets (which he chalked up to "lame attempts at edgy humor"). Schwartz vowed to unearth more embarrassing social media posts. "Lots more where this came from," he tweeted.
Schwartz and his allies at one point discussed raising money to expand the campaign, according to his associate. Instead, he has relied on his own energetic Twitter use and the amplification effect of right-wing media. "I'm basically a . . . troll," he told the Daily Beast last year.
For all their hype, the biggest scoops of both Schwartz's effort and Project Veritas have involved fairly obscure journalists and did little damage to the newsrooms in question - if anything, Wright's garden-variety griping about corporate bosses suggested a healthy diversity of newsroom thinking. In 2017, a Project Veritas operative approached The Washington Post in 2017 pitching a hoax story about conservative Alabama U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore, a Trump ally, but The Post's journalists instead spotted the holes in the story and exposed the Veritas ties. (Project Veritas head James O'Keefe later said the goal was not to plant a bogus story that would embarrass The Post but "to draw the reporter out in order to extract comments.")
But Project Veritas maintains friends in high places: The New York Times reported that Erik Prince, the security-contractor brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, has recruited ex-spies to help Project Veritas infiltrate Democratic groups. (Prince did not respond to a reporter's calls; asked to comment, Project Veritas did not address the Prince connections.) And a new Trump campaign lawsuit against CNN cited one of its undercover videos that captured a man described as a "CNN insider" - actually, a freelance satellite truck operator, according to the network - speculating that CNN President Jeff Zucker has a "vendetta" against the president.
"People need to understand the way this works," Zucker said in an email to The Post after the lawsuit was filed. "The president and his associates make deceptive statements and threats against the media only moments before his campaign blasts a fundraising email referencing those attacks. It's not a coincidence, it's an orchestrated PR stunt to intimidate the press, raise money and pander to an audience willing to accept fiction as fact."

It's hardly unusual for a president to clash with the press. Richard Nixon kept journalists on his enemies list, while his vice president, Spiro Agnew, dubbed them "nattering nabobs of negativism." Bill Clinton griped openly about coverage of his White House sex scandal, and candidate George W. Bush was caught on a hot mic calling a New York Times reporter a "major league asshole." Barack Obama's administration brought a record number of prosecutions against journalists' sources for leaking government information, according to the Freedom of the Press Foundation.
But on Feb. 26, Trump found a novel way to bedevil the media when his reelection campaign sued the New York Times. The suit claimed that an opinion piece published 11 months earlier had defamed the campaign by asserting that "the Trump campaign and Vladimir Putin's oligarchy . . . had an overarching deal." It demanded millions of dollars in damages.
The filing attorney was Charles Harder, the hard-charging lawyer who won the $115 million judgment that ran the Gawker website out of business for publishing a sex tape involving the wrestler Hulk Hogan.
Days later, Harder sued The Washington Post in federal court, taking issue with opinion pieces written last June by Greg Sargent and Paul Waldman, who both argued that the Trump campaign had signaled a willingness to accept assistance from foreign governments. The Post's publisher, Fred Ryan, called the suit "a shameful ploy designed to intimidate news organizations as they work to inform voters on the important issues at stake in this election."
Four days after the Post suit, Harder filed the suit against CNN, over an opinion column by Larry Noble, a former general counsel for the Federal Election Commission who also painted the Trump campaign as open to Russian assistance.
Katherine Bolger, a partner at the law firm of Davis Wright Tremaine specializing in First Amendment issues, called the lawsuits "bordering on frivolous" and likely to be dismissed. "These articles are critical of the president, not his campaign, so in some ways the wrong plaintiff sued," she said. And the articles "are largely opinion, based on disclosed facts," and thus are protected speech.
"We were founded on the ability to criticize our political leaders," Bolger said. "You are allowed to communicate truthful things that are critical of our government."
In a statement, the campaign's senior legal adviser, Jenna Ellis, maintained that while the articles in question were presented as opinion pieces, "the statements themselves are false factual assertions, not opinions, and as such are subject to defamation law."
But Ted Boutrous, a partner in the law firm of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher who specializes in First Amendment law, says the suits offer thin arguments to support a defamation claim and have little chance of prevailing. Instead, he said, they are more likely intended to inspire Trump fans to donate to his reelection campaign. Trump "has the greatest soapbox in the world but instead resorts to frivolous lawsuits," Boutrous said.
Bolger predicts that the eventual dismissal of the suits is part of the Trump camp's political strategy. "And then the president is going to be able to tweet about the Democratic judges who have dismissed the cases."
And some worry that the president's repeated public assaults on the media could eventually have a chilling effect in the courtroom - that "judges and juries are likely to be more skeptical of the case being made by publishers," said David McCraw, the deputy general counsel for the New York Times.


Indeed, the efforts by Trump's allies to attack the media may pale in impact next to the off-the-cuff onslaught from the president himself.
In recent months, Trump called Chris Wallace, the widely respected host of Fox News Sunday, "nasty and obnoxious," sniping that he will "never be his father, Mike," a legendary "60 Minutes" correspondent. He also tarred Peter Baker, a star Times reporter, as "an Obama lover." And as his Senate impeachment trial got underway, he took a break from the World Economic Forum in Davos to call The Washington Post's Pulitzer-winning reporters Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig "stone cold losers" on Twitter.
On March 20, NBC's Peter Alexander asked Trump if his administration had offered "a false sense of hope" in talking up the potential of untested drugs, but then segued to a softball: What would he say to citizens who are afraid of the coronavirus crisis?
"I say that you're a terrible reporter, that's what I say," the president responded. "I think it's a very nasty question."
The late Roger Ailes built a whole network in Fox News out of the conservative sense of grievance toward mainstream media. But Trump has taken that mind-set to even greater extremes. "He's now gotten everyone on the right to use the same terminology and that's the big change," Spicer noted.
Trump's quickness to label stories fake has created new peril for media organizations: Any journalistic misstep or factual error, even if it is speedily corrected, can become a talking point in service of the notion that the media is out to get the president.
"You can't afford to make mistakes because they will be weaponized against you," said Doug Heye, a longtime Republican strategist and Trump critic, who fears the president's rhetoric could imperil the lives of journalists.
The irony is that Trump himself makes false statements - more than 16,000 since taking office, according to a Washington Post Fact Checker tally - that he almost never corrects. Nonetheless, he and his friends and family are quick to pounce on any media stumble - even if the journalists involved have corrected it - and their scorn can ripple out in ever-expanding circles, repeated and re-repeated by his political allies and his 70 million-plus million Twitter followers.
One example was a much-criticized obituary headline in The Washington Post, which appeared online only briefly Oct. 27, but lives forever in the images taken by Post critics. It referred to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as an "austere religious scholar at helm of Islamic State" when he was killed. Conservatives blasted the headline for not specifically describing him as a terrorist, though the Islamic State is well-known in the United States as a terrorist organization.
A statement by The Post acknowledging that the headline was a misstep did little to quell the furor. In a profane tweet, Donald Trump Jr. accused The Post of producing "fawning headlines" about "a serial rapist and murderer," and of "literally doing PR for a terrorist scumbag."
"Screw you Wa Po!" Trump Jr. wrote.
Michael Caputo, who served as a communications official in Trump's 2016 campaign, believes the White House and its press corps "have reached a point of no return." But he finds what he calls the "defensive attacks" on individual reporters "unnerving. We understand that at some point this could go too far."
Yet attacking the media is now broadly regarded as a smart move by conservatives. In January, while rebuffing his questions about the impeachment proceedings against Trump, Sen. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) called CNN congressional reporter Manu Raju "a liberal hack" - for which the Trump reelection campaign hailed her as a hero ("THIS is how you handle FAKE NEWS") with a tweet linking to McSally's campaign fundraising page.
"All of those punches have landed," said Caputo, who has remained in touch with the president. "In an election cycle, the president will be able to touch some already softened skin."
Caputo says he has heard references to the term "Fake News" almost everywhere he goes - in Puerto Rico, Germany and Ukraine. An African diplomat recently used the phrase in a conversation with him. "I don't know if 'Make America Great Again' will last forever as a catch phrase," Caputo said. "But 'Fake News'? It will endure forever."

Texto completo: Less than a week after welcoming back nearly 2,000 students amid the nation’s coronavirus outbreak, Liberty University again finds itself in the middle of a controversy.
After the New York Times reported Sunday that multiple Liberty students had gotten sick after returning to campus, the Virginia university pushed back, labeling the report as "false. "
In an email to USA TODAY, Scott Lamb, the school's senior vice president of communications, said there have been “no cases of any on-campus student testing positive for coronavirus,” adding that four students were told to self-isolate not because they had symptoms but because they had just returned from New York.
Additionally, Lamb said, one online student, who does not live on campus, “who never left Lynchburg has tested positive from local contacts in the community. ”
“Contrary to the Times’ reporting, Liberty is not aware of any students in its residence halls testing positive for COVID-19 or, in fact, being tested at all, much less any residence hall students having sufficient symptoms of COVID-19 prompting the need to get tested based on current CDC guidelines,” Liberty said in a statement.
Liberty president Jerry Falwell, Jr. , was more blunt on Twitter: "Prime example of why you never believe anything @nytimes says about @LibertyU. Complete liars. ”
In its statement about The Times story, Liberty also wrote, "The University promptly provided the reporter detailed numbers on the student cases and requested corrections. No correction has been forthcoming so this statement is being issued. "
Tracking the outbreak: Coronavirus in the U. S. , by state
In defending his decision to reopen campus and order staff back to work last week, Falwell — an influential voice of the Christian right and a prominent supporter of President Donald Trump — said that because students were young, they weren’t vulnerable to contracting the virus. He caught criticism from both campus and the surrounding community.
Calum Best, a 21-year-old senior who was thrust into the spotlight after writing on Facebook that students should receive refunds from the university, told USA TODAY on Sunday night that he thinks Liberty has been "overplaying the effectiveness of their mitigation measures" and that university leadership, particularly Falwell, has "significantly downplayed the virus.

"They've been really clever from a legal sense," Best said. "They offered $1,000 rebates to students if they left by [Saturday]; that's a way to incentivize students to leave without directly saying, 'We made a bad decision, now you have to go home. ' Initially, they allowed students to make the choice about whether or not to come back and clarified they were neither encouraging or discouraging them one way or the other. They did that as a way to shield themselves legally. "
Best, who opted to return to campus instead of going home and potentially exposing his parents, said he's seen "many students who don't seem to care about social distancing" guidelines, despite warnings posted all over campus.
"It's not the bulk," Best said, "but it's some, and that’s enough to make it unsafe for everybody. "
Social distancing: It’s not about you, it’s about us
Falwell had re-opened campus despite Liberty moving to an online learning module after Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam banned gatherings of more than 100 people in the state earlier in March.
Across America, hundreds of campuses have closed their doors, leaving students — especially international students — scrambling.
On Sunday afternoon, Liberty updated its website and said that as of midnight March 29, “any students who have not yet elected to check into campus residence halls for the first time since Spring Break, will be self-quarantined for two weeks at the annex in single rooms with meals and other essentials delivered. ”
In its statement, Liberty said it wasn’t sure how many students would return to campus. It planned for “as many as 5,000” and had “approximately 1,900 in the residence halls at the start of the week, and is now down to about 1,045 with additional checkouts this week. ”

Texto completo: For far too long, America’s response to the coronavirus lacked what you might call rational panic. From the experts to the markets to the president and his cable-television court, an irrational calm prevailed when a general freak-out might have prepared us for the crisis.
Today, at last, we have panic in surplus — however unevenly distributed and still-insufficient in some places. But now we need something else to leaven it: Along with rational panic, we need sources of rational hope.
Rational hope is not the same as reckless optimism. It doesn’t require, for instance, quickly lifting quarantines based on outlying projections of low fatality rates, as some return-to-normalcy conservatives have been urging in the last week. Rational hope accepts that the situation is genuinely dark, but then it still looks around for signposts leading up and out. It recognizes that things are likely to get worse, but keeps itself alert to the contexts in which they seem to be getting better — or at the very least, getting worse more slowly. It doesn’t expect miracles, but it rejects a grim helplessness, a spirit of inevitable doom.
Here are three sources of rational hope, three patterns where I’m finding optimism right now.
First, there is modest hope in data compiled by smart-thermometer company Kinsa, which claims to be able to identify anomalous, unseasonal fever rates using data from its nationwide user base. Kinsa’s data show a clear February-and-March anomaly across the U.S., especially in areas known to be affected by the coronavirus. But it also shows that anomaly diminishing as lockdowns and social distancing began — to the point where fever rates are now below the expected trend nationally, and returning toward seasonal norms even in some COVID-19 hot spots.
The company is careful to note that this probably doesn’t reflect declining coronavirus infections alone, since many illnesses decline under social-distancing conditions. But the sharp turn suggests that general infection curves can be changed quickly even during a pandemic, and that the policies of the last two weeks might be having a real epidemiological effect.
Second, there is hope in the differing course of the pandemic so far in Greater New York versus the Pacific Coast. Both regions are urbanized, diverse and international, both were seeded with coronavirus cases around the same time, and Seattle had the first major (observed) outbreak. But Washington state bent its curve after the initial surge and California’s case rate and death rate trends are a gentle incline — nothing like the New York area’s terrifying spike.
In the most optimistic case, the spike reflects New York’s unique density and heavy reliance on mass transit — and one could hope that America as a whole, with our exurbs and sprawling cities and wide-aisled supermarkets and car-based commutes, is more like California than like Gotham.
This might be too optimistic; there is plenty of Bay Area and SoCal density, and coronavirus clusters have popped up in plenty of less-dense locales. So maybe some of the divide reflects policy — the fact that West Coast leaders acted ever-so-slightly more swiftly and with more seriousness of purpose than the feckless Bill de Blasio in New York City.
But even that is grounds for reasonable hope, since it suggests that even if you initially fail to spot an outbreak, you can still hope to imitate South Korea rather than northern Italy.
Finally, there is hope in the fact that the impressive containment achieved so far in East Asia has been accomplished with a variety of different policies, different degrees of lockdown and distancing, but one major commonality: the widespread use of masks. Fearing shortages and panic, Western experts have downplayed the effectiveness of masking. But the circumstantial evidence of Western versus Asian epidemic curves and the direct evidence of multiple studies suggest that masking works, and that its widespread adoption can change an epidemic’s course.
That path can’t be taken until American mask production outstrips shortages — although even homemade masks are reasonably effective — and I wouldn’t expect a masking norm to ever become universal in America. (During the Spanish Flu, a Bay Area mask ordinance was eventually repealed under the influence of the “Anti-Mask League of San Francisco.”) But you could see masks becoming ubiquitous in the densest areas, essentially required of air travelers and commuters, and normalized for supermarket and mall trips even in exurbia.
These three hopeful signs together hint at a path back toward quasi-normalcy. The current shutdown bends infection curves relatively quickly, outside a few major urban outbreaks. That policy response combines with America’s social-distancing sprawl and car culture and younger-than-Europe age profile to compensate for our initial incompetence and natural insubordination. And then the cheapest, lightest-weight means of slowing transmission becomes ubiquitous in U.S. cities by Memorial or Independence Day.
I’m sure it won’t be that easy. But this column also hasn’t exhausted the list of reasonable hopes. And in a dark moment we should all be looking for them.

Paul Krugman: COVID-19 virus brings out all the usual zombies

Texto completo: Let me summarize the Trump administration/right-wing media view on the coronavirus: It’s a hoax, or anyway no big deal. Besides, trying to do anything about it would destroy the economy. And it’s China’s fault, which is why we should call it the “Chinese virus.”
Oh, and epidemiologists who have been modeling the virus’s future spread have come under sustained attack, accused of being part of a “deep state” plot against Donald Trump, or maybe free markets.
Does all this give you a sense of déjà vu? It should. After all, it’s very similar to the Trump/right-wing line on climate change. Here’s what Trump tweeted back in 2012: “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive.” It’s all there: it’s a hoax, doing anything about it will destroy the economy, and let’s blame China.
And epidemiologists startled to find their best scientific efforts denounced as politically motivated fraud should have known what was coming. After all, exactly the same thing happened to climate scientists, who have faced constant harassment for decades.
So the right-wing response to COVID-19 has been almost identical to the right-wing response to climate change, albeit on a vastly accelerated time scale. But what lies behind this kind of denialism?
Well, I recently published a book about the prevalence in our politics of “zombie ideas” — ideas that have been proved wrong by overwhelming evidence and should be dead but somehow keep shambling along, eating people’s brains. The most prevalent zombie in U.S. politics is the insistence that tax cuts for the rich produce economic miracles, indeed pay for themselves; but the most consequential zombie, the one that poses an existential threat, is climate change denial. And COVID-19 has brought out all the usual zombies.
But why, exactly, is the right treating a pandemic the same way it treats tax cuts and climate change?
The force that usually keeps zombie ideas shambling along is naked financial self-interest. Paeans to the virtues of tax cuts are more or less directly paid for by billionaires who benefit from these cuts. Climate denial is an industry supported almost entirely by fossil-fuel interests. As Upton Sinclair put it, “It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it.”
However, it’s less obvious who gains from minimizing the dangers of a pandemic. Among other things, the time scale is vastly compressed compared with climate change: The consequences of global warming will take many decades to play out, giving fossil-fuel interests plenty of time to take the money and run, but we’re already seeing catastrophic consequences of virus denial after just a few weeks.
True, there may be some billionaires who imagine that denying the crisis will work to their financial advantage. Just before Trump made his terrifying call for reopening the nation by Easter, he had a conference call with a group of money managers who may have told him that ending social distancing would be good for the market. That’s insane, but you should never underestimate the cupidity of these people. Remember, Blackstone’s Steve Schwarzman, one of the men on the call, once compared proposals to close a tax loophole to Adolf Hitler’s invasion of Poland.
Also, billionaires have done very well by Trump’s tax cuts and may fear that the economic damage from the coronavirus will bring about Trump’s defeat, and hence tax increases for people like them.
But I suspect that the disastrous response to COVID-19 has been shaped less by direct self-interest than by two indirect ways in which pandemic policy gets linked to the general prevalence of zombie ideas in right-wing thought.
First, when you have a political movement almost entirely built around assertions than any expert can tell you are false, you have to cultivate an attitude of disdain toward expertise, one that spills over into everything. Once you dismiss people who look at evidence on the effects of tax cuts and the effects of greenhouse gas emissions, you’re already primed to dismiss people who look at evidence on disease transmission.
This also helps explain the centrality of science-hating religious conservatives to modern conservatism, which has played an important role in Trump’s failure to respond.
Second, conservatives do hold one true belief: namely, that there is a kind of halo effect around successful government policies. If public intervention can be effective in one area, they fear — probably rightly — that voters might look more favorably on government intervention in other areas. In principle, public health measures to limit the spread of coronavirus needn’t have much implication for the future of social programs like Medicaid. In practice, the first tends to increase support for the second.
As a result, the right often opposes government interventions even when they clearly serve the public good and have nothing to do with redistributing income simply because they don’t want voters to see government doing anything well.
The bottom line is that as with so many things Trump, the awfulness of the man in the White House isn’t the whole story behind terrible policy. Yes, he’s ignorant, incompetent, vindictive and utterly lacking in empathy. But his failures on pandemic policy owe as much to the nature of the movement he serves as they do to his personal inadequacies.

Jim Robbins: Yellowstone becomes a natural classroom, run by wolves

Texto completo: Twenty-five years ago this month, 14 wolves from Canada were released into an ocean of elk on the rugged sweep of sagebrush steppe and pine forest of Yellowstone National Park to see what would happen.
The new wolves immediately set to out doing what they do best, hunting prey. What has unfolded since is a remarkable, continuing ecological and social drama that has changed the way biologists think about predators and the animals they stalk. It has also transformed parts of the nation’s oldest national park, redeemed the image of wolves in the popular imagination and inspired similar wildlife experiments around the world.
Wolves were erased from the park and the rest of the Northern Rockies in a sustained campaign of shooting, poisoning and trapping in the early 20th century. They were regarded as vermin, hated by ranchers fearful for their livestock and by hunters and outfitters worried about deer, elk and other quarry. Some of that enmity remains.
But, thanks largely to the wolf’s reintroduction into Yellowstone, their reputation has swung from scourge to savior, at least among some, as biologists came to understand its role in maintaining the park’s ecological balance.
What distinguishes the return of the wolf to Yellowstone more than anything else, though, and came as a surprise to researchers and park managers, is that the daily lives of the wolf packs here are on full display for scientists and visitors alike from the main road that crosses through the park’s northern range in the wildlife-rich Lamar Valley.
Wolves can be seen loping through sagebrush forest filled with elk, or surrounding a stubborn bison standing its ground for hours in knee deep snow. The personalities of some of the wolves have proved magnetic, and their exploits widely shared on social media by legions of wolf watchers who congregate in the park, cameras and binoculars in hand.
“It’s a huge National Park Service success story,” said Douglas W. Smith, who came to Yellowstone in 1994 to oversee the return of the wolf and has been here since. “It’s carrying out our most fundamental goal: restoring and preserving nature. Without wolves it’s not restored, nor is it nature.”
Reintroducing the wolf to Yellowstone is arguably the world’s greatest wildlife experiment. Their progress has been documented meticulously by a team of hiking, driving and flying biologists and passionate volunteers — so much so that no wolf study comes close to yielding its abundance of information. The research generated has been distilled into a new book, “Yellowstone Wolves: Science and Discovery, ” assembled by three of the biologists who studied the wolves’ return.
“It’s the best place on the planet to view wolves,” said Dr. Smith. Elsewhere, wolf biologists must fly and canoe and hike into remote areas and sneak through forests to spy on wolves. In Yellowstone, says Dr. Smith, “I can drive out to watch wolves with a cup of coffee in my hand.”
At the time the first 14 wolves were released in 1995 (followed by another 27 wolves over the next two years), some 20,000 elk populated the park’s northern range, known as the Serengeti of North America for its profusion of wildlife. With few predators, elk had for decades gobbled up anything green that poked above ground. Today, the elk population totals 6,000 to 8,000. Wolves, at the same time, have made a full-scale return to the Northern Rockies. They now number about 1,500 in Montana, Idaho (where another group was released) and Wyoming, with 350 to 400 in and around Yellowstone. Outside Yellowstone, they can be hunted.
Some believe allowing wolves to be hunted makes their presence more acceptable. “A little blood satisfies a lot of anger,” said Edward Bangs, the retired U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist who was in charge of reintroducing the wolves in 1995.
One theory that has emerged from studies here, though disputed by some biologists, is the “ecology of fear.” Research suggested that with the return of wolves, wary elk began avoiding places where they didn’t feel safe. Willow, aspen and cottonwood trees responded to their absence with a growth surge, benefiting beaver, grizzly bears, songbirds and other wildlife. Other biologists, including Dr. Smith, said that while vegetation has returned in some places, it’s not because of fearful elk, but because their numbers have been reduced. And he said the idea that wolves have somehow saved the park’s ecosystems has been exaggerated.
While wolves may not quite be the park’s savior, far healthier numbers of predator and prey have resulted from their presence.
The wolves also brought a raft of surprises, adding important truths about the lives of an animal that probably engenders more hate and love — and mythology — than any other.
Gone is the guesswork about the private lives of wolves. “A road goes through the middle of the best wolf habitat,” said Dr. Smith. “People can see them make kills, they can see them mate, they see them interact with grizzly bears. People see them coming out of their holes as puppies for the first time, and watch them till the day they die. That’s unheard-of anywhere else.”
Among the discoveries here: Yellowstone wolf researchers believe wolf packs, previously thought to be overseen by an alpha male, are actually matriarchies. Also, wolf personalities play a biological role. When a different alpha female takes over a pack, hunting and other dynamics change.
Biologists have also watched as packs raid the dens of rivals and kill their pups. “All the work done before has never turned up anything like that,” said L. David Mech, a research scientist for the U.S. Geological Survey who has studied wolves for 60 years. The wolf biologist Kira Cassidy has studied pack warfare and believes older wolves have wisdom that plays a critical role in deciding whether their pack attacks another.
Wolves also changed the lives of other wildlife. Dead elk are a jackpot, not only for the packs, but myriad species. A wolf pack kills an elk every three days or so — biologists have documented 5,000 wolf kills — and the benefits of several hundred pounds of meat on the ground ripples through the ecosystem, feeding species from grizzlies to mice and ravens. The big bears, at the top of the predator hierarchy, appropriate many wolf-dropped carcasses as their own, feeding on them and commonly sleeping atop them for days, rousing to eat until they are meat drunk and then sleeping again.
The 10 packs in Yellowstone, among them the Crystal Creek, Rose Creek and the famed Druid pack, are canine empires, fighting for turf and vanquishing their enemies or being vanquished themselves. Like their human counterparts, they thrive for a while and then collapse, allowing a new pack to form.
Stories of some wolves are well known. “We’ve seen some remarkable personalities,” Dr. Smith said. Take the story of Wolf 21, who hooked up with Wolf 42. They mated and hung out in full view of the watchers.
“People thought 21 was a tremendous physical specimen and that he also had great wisdom and compassion,” said Dr. Smith. When 42 was killed by a rival pack, he said, 21 “went back to the place where he was last with her and howled and howled. No one thought that wolves mourned.”
Twenty-one was shot and killed in 2015 by a hunter outside the park
For people who gather along the road here to watch the wolves and Shakespearean dramas unfold, it is an unparalleled glimpse into a wild world. Wolf watchers spend some $35 million a year in the Yellowstone area.
“This has been nothing short of a sensation for the public,” said Dr. Smith. “Wolves are real in a contrived world of stores, cars, roads and buildings. Wolves are real and people crave it, they love it. It touches them deeply.”
Yellowstone is “red in tooth and claw,” so real it is sometimes breath-stealing. Dr. Mech, the veteran wolf researcher, was taken aback one day as he and his students stood in a parking lot along the Lama Valley road just before a class on wolves, chatting. A pack of wolves suddenly topped a nearby ridge, launching a surprise attack on a knot of quietly grazing of elk, quickly dropping and killing three of them.
“Class dismissed,” Dr. Mech told the class facetiously. “What could I possibly tell them after that?”

Texto completo: Around a dozen students at Liberty University in Virginia have reported being sick with symptoms that are consistent with covid-19, according to the New York Times.
School President Jerry Falwell Jr. asked students to return to campus last week after spring break.
Students returning to campus are now reportedly being directed to self-quarantine for two weeks, while Falwell told the Times that about 800 of the 1,900 students who initially returned to on-campus housing for spring semester had voluntarily returned home.
The physician who runs the evangelical school's student-health service, Dr. Thomas Eppes Jr., told the newspaper that three students were referred to local hospitals while eight more were instructed to self-isolate.
"We've lost the ability to corral this thing," Eppes said he told Falwell.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump’s suggestion that Americans could be returning to work in large numbers and even packing churches on Easter could charitably be described as aspirational. Easter, after all, is the most significant holy day for Christians as it represents rebirth and renewal.
But wishful thinking might be a more appropriate descriptor given the continual rise in the COVID-19 infection rate, death totals and hospitalizations that threaten to overwhelm the nation’s health care system. Places like New York City are already near the breaking point, and we are bombarded with stories about shortages in medical protective gear, ventilators and intensive care beds.
As of Friday, New Mexico had 191 cases and one death.
But the president – who does say he will listen to advisers like Dr. Deborah Birx and Dr. Anthony Fauci before deciding whether to extend the current “15 Days to Slow the Spread” – is on the right track when he says we need as a nation to assess how and when we can smartly bring people back to work while using strategies beyond “shelter in place” and business shutdowns to slow the virus.
Trump says we can’t let the cure be worse than the disease, but that can’t mean throw caution to the winds and simply let the elderly and other at-risk populations die. The message has to be to find that sweet spot that protects people but doesn’t lock down the economy for so long we fundamentally destroy it.
There are serious people thinking along the same lines.
Columnist Thomas L. Friedman in the New York Times reported on Dr. John P.A. Ioannidis, an epidemiologist and co-director of Stanford’s Meta-Research Innovation Center. Ionnidis wrote in a March 17 essay that we still don’t have a firm grasp of the population-wide fatality rate of coronavirus, but the best evidence suggests it may be 1% or lower. “If that is the true rate,” he wrote, “locking down the world with potentially tremendous social and financial consequences may be totally irrational. It’s like an elephant being attacked by a house cat. Frustrated and trying to avoid the cat, the elephant accidentally jumps off a cliff and dies.”
Dr. Steven Woolf, director emeritus of the Center on Society and Health at Virginia Commonwealth University, told Friedman that closing businesses and locking down companies may be necessary to curb community spread but could harm health in other ways. “Income is one of the stronger predictors of health outcomes,” he said. “Lost wages and job layoffs are leaving many workers without health insurance and forcing many families to forego health care and medications to pay for food, housing and other basic needs.” People of color and the poor will suffer the most.
Dr. David L. Katz of Yale University’s Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center is an expert in public health and preventive medicine. He said in an op-ed published in the New York Times that we have three goals now: save as many lives as we can, make sure our medical system does not get overwhelmed – and make sure that in achieving the first two goals we don’t destroy our economy, and as a result even more lives.
Katz argues we need to pivot from horizontally restricting movement and commerce of the entire population without considering varying risks for severe infection to a more surgical, vertical strategy that would focus on protecting and sequestering those most likely to die or suffer long-term damage by exposure to coronavirus. We would basically treat the rest of society as we have done with familiar threats like the flu.
“Risk would not be zero,” but the “rejuvenating effect on spirits, and the economy, of knowing where there’s light at the end of this tunnel would be hard to overstate,” Katz told Friedman.
Of course people would need to continue to practice social distancing and handwashing. Hopefully, we have learned some lessons. A vaccine would be wonderful, and effective medical treatments for the virus would be as well. Widespread, immediate testing capabilities so those coming up positive could isolate would help.
But for now, we play the cards we have.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, at the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S., is giving serious thought to next steps. “What we did is, we just closed everything down as quickly as we could. Shut all the doors and boarded all the windows. There was no art to what we did. No nuance. …”
Cuomo said in his briefing on Thursday we will need a modified health strategy coupled with a get-back-to-work strategy that could see younger people and people who have already had the virus back on the front lines while targeting resources to the vulnerable and sheltering them. “It’s not right to do public health or economic development,” he said. “You have to do both.”
And be smart about it.
Our leaders at the national, state and local levels are facing difficult situations where lives are at stake. There is no roadmap for how to do this. But even though we haven’t seen the worst of this pandemic, it’s time to start thinking how we reboot in a smart, “surgical” way. If we don’t, the nation we leave for the 99% of people who survive COVID-19, and the next generations, will be a bleak and desolate place.
Keep in mind, there is a limit to the number of multi-trillion-dollar bailouts we can expect from Uncle Sam. In fact, the one that cleared Congress on Friday is borrowed money.

North Idaho's gun shops see surge in business Washington sales banned under governor's stay-at-home order

Texto completo: Some North Idaho gun retailers have noticed a marked increase in business during the last few weeks, in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak, and that trend could continue with Gov. Brad Little's declaration that they're essential businesses in his three-week stay-home order.
That's in opposition to Washington, where Gov. Jay Inslee determined gun retailers should close under his "Stay Home, Stay Healthy" order. Before that, Spokane retailers reported higher gun sales and their stocks of ammunition running dry.
Other states are split on the decision as well. In Ohio, Illinois and Michigan, gun stores were deemed essential but not in New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts, the New York Times reported.
"Everyone has been overwhelmed with the demand for firearms and ammunition across the country," said Ed Santos, a national shooting range consultant who owns Center Target Sports in Post Falls with his wife, Peggy Santos.
FBI background checks rose 36% in February compared to last year, for a total of 2.8 million nationally and the largest year-over-year increase since the last election year, the New York Times reported.
"In Idaho it has been no different," Santos said. "We continue to see aggressive activity in the retail area for firearms and ammunition."
Santos said his business - which has an indoor range that is not operational due to COVID-19 measures - was already stocking up on ammunition in preparation for an election year, when people tend to buy up a surplus of their own in fear of stricter gun control regulations.
"And we still have plenty today," said Santos, despite a 30-40% increase in firearm and ammunition sales.
Coeur d'Alene gunsmith Ty Buck, who owns Elkingham Armory, said his phone has been ringing an unusual amount with people seeking guns and ammo. He doesn't sell ammo and rarely sells guns but has heard from two nearby gun shops that sales have increased.
"All these people are getting scared to death," Buck said.
At Sportsmen's Warehouse in Meridian, Idaho, some shelves of handgun ammunition were close to empty, the Associated Press reported. The store also limited sales to two handguns and one AR- or AK-platform rifle per person each day, in addition to ammo purchase limits.
At least 50 guns went out the door last week alone at Center Target Sports, Santos estimated. And he noticed almost all of the people purchasing those guns were first-time owners, with some of them reporting they'd been resistant to owning guns in the past.
"But yet they were in the store purchasing them," Santos said.
Santos said a spike in new gun ownerships doesn't concern him in terms of safety because Center Target Sports offers one-on-one orientations for new gun owners. And once his range is back open, he plans to offer a free clinic to any first-time gun owners who made purchases in North Idaho this spring.
A number of the people purchasing their first guns have also been Washingtonians, according to Santos. But retailers in Idaho can only sell them shotguns and rifles that aren't considered assault-style weapons because those have to be shipped to a Washington shop for the necessary paperwork to be processed.
Santos and Buck both say that's a problem and that gun retailers in Washington should be considered essential as well.
"There's no reason for restricting firearms," Santos said.
Buck said it's infringing on people's rights.
"In Idaho and Spokane, firearms are a pretty essential part of our day-to-day lives. Always have been," Buck said. "I feel really bad for the people of Spokane because there are only certain things (retailers are) able to do."
Robin Ball, owner of Sharp Shooting Indoor Range and Gun Shop in Spokane, told KHQ she filed to be included as an essential business with the state last week.
"I hope Washington will recognize they're not doing anyone a service," Santos said. "We're selling guns daily to Idahoans."

Back from the Brink Executives find critic- and fan-favorite 'One Day at a Time' a new home after cancellation

Texto completo: PASADENA, Calif. - To say the cast of "One Day at a Time" was knocked sideways when Netflix canceled the show in March 2019 is an understatement.
Like the rest of the cast, Stephen Tobolowsky, who plays Dr. Leslie Berkowitz on the comedy, heard the news not long before it became public (and began trending on Twitter). He was about to film a scene of the ABC sitcom "The Goldbergs," and he was so sure "One Day at a Time" was about to get a fourth season that he cheerfully answered the phone when the showrunners, Gloria Calderón Kellett and Mike Royce, called him.
"I picked it up, and Gloria said, 'Our little show - they pulled the plug,' " he said.
Then there was a knock on the door: "Stephen, we're ready for you." Tobolowsky struggled to make the transition from receiving that gut punch to being funny on camera.
"I was like, 'I'm traumatized, and I'm going to need a lot of professional help just to get through this moment,' " he recalled.
Justina Machado, who plays nurse, Army veteran and mother Penelope Alvarez on the comedy, said that when her friends heard the news, they were "so mad. They were emotional."
Part of the anger, Machado said, was over what that news represented. As journalist Vanessa Erazo noted in a New York Times op-ed shortly after "One Day" was canceled, Hispanic people made up an estimated 18% of the population, but Hispanic roles constituted just 7.2% of all roles in scripted streaming series - even less on broadcast and cable.
"It's the stories that we're telling and how they're seeing themselves represented on the screen" that made this more than just another cancellation, Machado said in an interview during the Television Critics Association press tour, in January.
Todd Grinnell, who plays the show's affable landlord, Schneider, noted the irony of being canceled by Netflix, "the place that usually saves the show that the network has cast aside."
The social media outcry at the time was intense, as was the response from TV critics, who wrote dozens of pieces about the show's cancellation and why it deserved to be rescued. But the most important reaction was the one from Sony Pictures Television, which produces the series.
The day the showrunners found out Netflix didn't want a fourth season, Royce said, Sony executives "called us, and they're like, 'We're getting this show on somewhere.' "
That somewhere ended up being Pop TV, the cable channel owned by ViacomCBS that is best known for quirky Canadian comedy "Schitt's Creek." On Tuesday, "One Day at a Time" debuted at its new home just over a year after Netflix cut it loose. The fourth season picks up as the family answers questions from a census worker played by Ray Romano.
The fact that "One Day at a Time" was canceled at all still seems surprising given its devoted audience and versatile premise.
Netflix, which declined to comment for this article, indicated at the time that whatever the audience's devotion, its size was just too small. But where Netflix saw an underperforming show, David Nevins, chief creative officer of CBS and chief executive of Showtime Networks, saw opportunity. He had gained oversight over Pop TV just days before the cancellation was announced.
"I think Netflix clearly has a model where they feel they're getting value out of (shows) in the first couple of seasons, and they don't have that much incentive to go the long haul," he said.
That may be the right decision in many cases, but "the programmer in me thought it had untapped potential."
As its fate hung in the balance, "One Day at a Time" had a lot of things going for it: an active and dedicated fan base, reporters and critics invested in the show's survival, and media-savvy creators and cast members. And at a time when audiences - and many executives - value nuanced representations of historically marginalized groups, the series was one of few shows with a predominantly Hispanic cast, as well as several LGBTQ characters.
For all the show's admirable qualities, its survival is also a product of a confluence of industry circumstances. In March 2019, Pop TV was in the market for a high-profile acquisition to replace "Schitt's Creek."
It also helped that Sony was more motivated than many studios to keep its programs alive. Increasingly, TV studios belong to companies that also operate networks or streaming platforms, and those studios can usually rely upon their corporate parents or siblings to acquire and renew much of their output. Sony has become a rarity: a television studio without those kinds of corporate connections.
The original version of "One Day at a Time" told the story of a white family in Indianapolis headed by a single mother, one of a string of iconic Norman Lear-produced comedies - including "All in the Family" and "Good Times" - that debuted in the 1970s.
The new incarnation, which counts Lear as an executive producer, revolves around the tight-knit Cuban American Alvarez clan in Los Angeles. Despite the changes, "One Day at a Time" hews to the traditions of the best multicamera comedies: It is shot on a soundstage, the soundtrack includes laughter from a live audience, and the writers and cast expertly blend deft jokes and sincere sentiment.
Now that "One Day" has completed its highly unusual journey from streaming to basic cable, are more big transformations coming? Not really.
The revival will continue to stay true to the show's roots in socially conscious comedy, the showrunners said. Although "One Day at a Time" regularly provides belly laughs and warm moments, there are times when Penelope wonders how she'll pay her bills. Characters have also grappled with mental illness, immigration concerns and LGBTQ acceptance.
As Schwartz said his first email to Calderón Kellett and Royce after the Pop deal was official: "Keep doing what you're doing. We're making this show because we love it."

Texto completo: The albatross hanging from every arts reporter' neck is the stack of untouched books sitting on their desk, on a shelf, or shamefully hidden away in the closet farthest from them. Sent in from authors, agents and publishers it is the combined weight of all these unwritten about books that (I assume) will one day drag my soul to the depth of the River Styx.
I'm not saying it's a silver lining, far from it, but with the coronavirus forcing most events to shut down or cancel, we are all now going to have a lot more time on our hands for literary pursuits. With no upcoming festivals or performances to profile, now is the perfect time to let readers know what is on the reading agenda for the next week, or month or longer interval before society as we know it returns to some semblance of normalcy.
Some of these books I've read most or all of, others I haven't read at all. But none of them have been covered in depth by the Press-Citizen heretofore.
'Afterlife' by Julia Alvarez Genre: Fiction
Length: ~250 pages
From the author of "In the Time of Butterflies" is a new novel for adults. "Afterlife" is a novel about immigrant and English teacher Antonia Vega who is hit with a trio of problems at once. Her husband dies, her sister goes missing and an undocumented and pregnant teenager appears at her doorstep.
This is the kind of book I'd love to cover, but Alvarez's scheduled tour dates and tours sent with the book will not bring her through Iowa City. The book, a roughly 250-page affair, is scheduled for release on April 7, 2020.
'All the Flowers in Paris' by Sarah Jio Genre: Fiction
Length: ~ 300 pages
A novel that switches between a pair of perspectives, one of which is Caroline, who wakes up with no memory in a Paris hospital in 2009. The other is Celine, a woman in Nazi-occupied Paris in 1943. The story follows both women as they try to make sense of their respective situations: Caroline who gradually pieces together who she is and Celine who needs to try to
Not necessarily the kind of book I myself would be on the edge of my seat to read, but I can think of a half dozen friends I'd recommend this to by description alone. Plus, an aspect of Caroline's character is discovering she's had a "reclusive life in a sprawling apartment on the rue Cler," which — at this moment —sounds like the exact situation I'd like to be living in (at least for the next few weeks).
'An American Bum in China' by Tom Carter Genre: Biography
Length: ~125 pages
A brief biography following five years with Muscatine native Matthew Evans as he finds himself in China in 2014 as the Hong Kong protests were just beginning. Evans' tale is told by Tom Carter who previously published "Unsavory Elements: Stories of Foreigners on the Loose in China."
Initially, I'd planned to run a review of the book back in December that didn't end up finding its way to print. It was a topical read at the time with the Hong Kong protests in the news cycle and — while Hong Kong hasn't been the focus of recent coverage — China's arguably in the news cycle even more now than it was then.
'Bedlam' by Kenneth Paul Rosenberg, MD Genre: Nonfiction
Length: ~200 pages
The full title of the text is "Bedlam: An Intimate Journey Into America's Mental Health Crisis." Rosenberg's book is intended to give readers an inside look at the American mental health system and its failings. After seven years of interviews, the book uses those accounts to shine a light on the criminalization of individuals with mental health issues among other topics.
This book and the author behind it are the exact kinds of things I love to cover. When it was first delivered to our office I showed it to everyone in the newsroom. The only reason why it's not pending on my personal reading list is I'm not sure I have the emotional fortitude to read about institutional, systemic failure, especially at this particular moment.
'Bloody Genius' by John Sanford Genre: Mystery
Length: ~375 pages
This is the most recent Virgil Flowers novel from New York Times bestselling author John Sanford, marking the 12th novel in a series that started in 2007 with "Dark of the Moon." In this particular book, a culture war on a state campus between the science and medical departments is interrupted when a scholar turns up dead. Enter the series investigator Virgil Flowers, tasked with finding the killer.
While this title was briefly alluded to in my write-up on the 2019 Iowa City Book Festival, it didn't end up receiving full coverage, even though Sanford is a Cedar Rapids native and University of Iowa grad. This fell by the wayside for me at the time partly because of my own ignorance of Sanford being a local name and the sheer volume of events surrounding the book festival.
'Deacon King Kong' by James McBride Genre: Historical Fiction
Length: ~375 pages
Set in September of 1969, "Deacon King Kong" starts with the deacon of Five Ends Baptist Church shooting a 19-year-old-drug dealer in the face in South Brooklyn. The release that came with the book touts it as being infused with "humor and compassion" as it explores the lives of the fictional characters around this incident.
I've had a copy of this book so long and I've wanted to read it so bad! As if to taunt me Penguin Random House sent me a second copy which I also have not read.
I'm positive I'll get around to this once I work through my personal pending backlog of unread books, but like Entertainment Weekly and The New York Times, this book is high on my to-read list and can make it to yours too since it was released on March 3.
'The Dearly Beloved' by Cara Wall Genre: Fiction
Length: ~350 pages
The story of this novel spent 15 years coming into focus for its author, Iowa Writers' Workshop graduate Cara Wall, who first conceived of the novel during her 2004 pregnancy. The book focuses on a pair of couples, each of which includes an individual drawn to the Christian faith and another who is skeptical of it.
This is another novel I had planned to write a review of. First, before it's Aug. 13, 2019 publication and then before Wall's Sept. 23 visit to Prairie Lights. Though outside my general area of interest, it's one I feel strangely drawn to and would like to pick up and finish someday.
'Everywhere You Don't Belong' by Gabriel Bump Genre: Fiction
Length: ~250 pages
This is the first novel from the Chicago originating author Gabriel Bump, an experience explored in this novel through the character of Claude McKay, a young black man growing up on the South Side.
This is another book on my personal reading list and comes recommended by numerous other publications. it represents yet another instance of not enough local connections for me to cover.
'Hey Grandude!' by Paul McCartney, Illustrated by Kathryn Durst Genre: Picture Book
Length: ~ 30 pages
I think there are only two reasons I haven't read or reviewed this book: First, world-renowned singer/songwriter Paul McCartney has not had a book tour through Iowa City promoting it. Second, I don't know that I could justify a picture book review to my editor as the 4- to 6-year-old age range does not make up a huge amount of our readership.
But now I can, so here's my one-paragraph review:
As a book about a bunch of kids stuck inside who turn to their grandude to entertain them, I think this book will resonate with kids in this very specific moment in time. While the plot is somewhat aimless, it's a fun read with pretty illustrations that takes its characters to the beach, to the American West and to the mountainside. All through the aid of a magic compass.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Donna Shalala compared pandemics to hurricanes: recurring disasters that require politics to take the back seat to a unified national response, reliance on science-based messaging and an organized distribution of aid.
It was an apt analogy for Ms. Shalala, a Democratic congresswoman representing South Florida who served as Health and Human Services secretary during all eight years of President Bill Clinton's administration.
As the COVID-19 outbreak sweeps the country, it has prompted perhaps the biggest scare in America's psyche in modern times, echoing the 2008 financial downturn and Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.
Ms. Shalala, 79, brings a unique perspective in such a moment, having spent her career in leadership roles in academia and public service, overseeing both health care and fiscal crises. She now finds herself in Congress - winning election in 2018 in a district long held by a Republican - at a moment of both.
And she made it clear, in a phone interview with the Post-Gazette last week, she wishes the health experts were more at the forefront of the White House Coronavirus Task Force.
"We've got a variety of scientists who are articulate who could explain where we are," Ms. Shalala said.
She praised a few that had been present at task force press briefings: Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health; Deborah Birx, a physician and diplomat who serves as task force's response coordinator; Anne Schuchat, a doctor serving as the principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Francis Collins, a physician and director of the National Institutes of Health.
Ms. Shalala said those health experts could share the load of public messaging.
While Dr. Fauci has garnered the most media attention in recent weeks for his decades of experience and statements that correct President Donald Trump, she said, "The idea of tying Fauci up for daily press conferences is not an appropriate use of his skills. He's got to go back to his office and get some work done."
The briefings should also include administration officials who are directly involved in getting the supplies out - like the Federal Emergency Management Agency - should provide specific numbers on medical supplies and any shortages of masks, ventilators and emergency equipment.
"You have to have both," she said. "This is not only about medicine and science. This is about the pipeline and distribution system. You have to have those reports."
Ms. Shalala, who after leaving the White House in 2001 served as president of the University of Miami, was early to lay out what she viewed as a proper response plan.
In a March 2 op-ed published by the New York Times - accompanied by a graphic of politicians and doctors yelling over each other - she called for disciplined political leadership in which elected officials "stick to the facts and allow the experts, for the most part, to be the communicators."
Responding to the pandemic "will take more than ad hoc political messaging and emergency funding," Ms. Shalala wrote. "It will take professional competence and a continuing commitment of financial resources toward public health."
She wrote that Democrats as well as Republicans were trying to score political points "rather than treating this situation with the gravity and unity it deserves."
More than three weeks after that piece ran, Ms. Shalala said in the interview she was horrified by Mr. Trump's infusion of politics into the public health crisis.
The interview came hours after Mr. Trump suggested the economy could reopen by Easter Sunday - April 12 - which defied guidance by his own health experts. (Indeed, after Mr. Trump's comments, Dr. Birx, the team's response coordinator, took the podium to promise the administration would "look at the data.")
Shortly after Mr. Trump's comments, Jerry Falwall, Jr., president of Liberty University and a vocal supporter of the president, announced the private Christian school in Lynchburg, Va., will reopen this week.
"The president, who has been dangerous to our health care system, is now dangerous to our health," Ms. Shalala said. "He is literally beginning to scare me with his positions."
"You have world-class scientists standing next to him, and he steps all over their message," she said.
Ms. Shalala pointed to Hong Kong as an example of the risk in letting up too soon - despite the economic hardships and whatever the political fallout may be.
Hong Kong, a city of 7.5 million people, took aggressive measures and was considered a model for how to contain the virus while its neighbors like China and South Korea experienced a spike in cases. When the territory eased its quarantine measures and allowed work to resume on March 2, the city had just 100 reported COVID-19 cases.
Last week, however, a new wave of cases in the territory has prompted a return of those measures: Workers were again sent home, all non-residents were barred and anyone arriving in the city will have to undergo testing, regardless of their origin.
"Hong Kong sent its workers back too soon," Ms. Shalala said. "The mere suggestion that [Mr. Trump] is willing to risk human lives to get the economy back is inconsistent with our core values."
Yet Ms. Shalala struck an optimistic tone. Congress, despite all the public arguing last week over a $2.2 trillion stimulus plan, has come to a remarkable agreement, in the matter of days, on the biggest rescue package in American history, she said.
And she believes Congress will play a role to ensure the country won't be caught flat-footed again.
"The next time, we're going to be ready," Ms. Shalala said. "Because we're going to invest in redundant systems, and make sure we have the supplies on hand to deal with the next pandemic."
"We're going to have to be over-prepared, so that we are not catching up," she said. Because, much like bracing for hurricane season in Florida, "people die when we're not prepared."

Texto completo: Dear readers, I'm typing this note to you from home, from where I will need to work for the foreseeable future because of the rapidly spreading coronavirus. Nearly everyone at The New York Times is now working from home -- your parents may be, too, and maybe a sibling has been sent home from college, or your own school has closed, and now you have remote classes. There's so much changing so quickly that it probably feels scary and overwhelming. We've had this Dogs and Cats issue in the works for a long time (severalof you have asked for it!), and we decided to go ahead with it, because we hope it will be a welcome distraction. Whether you're a dog person or a cat person, it's a good time to appreciate our furry friends. And we'll be back next month with more news, including coverage of the coronavirus. Enjoy! -- Amber Williams, editor of The New York Times for Kids
The cute cats above represent the staff members who put this issue together and consider themselves cat people. Meow meow! The New York Times for Kids appears in the paper on the last Sunday of every month. The next issue will be on April 26.

Texto completo: As much of the world adjusts to a new normal of restricted living, our readers share tips for finding everyday joys.
Many of us are now entering the second, third or fourth week of restrictions on our movements, and it is becoming ever clearer that overcoming this crisis will be a marathon, not a sprint. As we all collectively adjust to our unique situations, we asked New York Times readers to share their ideas for pursuing the traveler's spirit of discovery, curiosity and delight within their new limitations at home. Following are their responses, which have been edited for clarity and length.
An artistic exercise in patience
As a child, I was taught ink drawing and I rediscovered my love for it. It requires a lot of concentration and patience. It helped me through a difficult time in life where I felt very anxious about not understanding what's happening around me. This resonates so strongly today.
-- Andre Williams, Montreal, Canada
Journey through French music
My Spotify playlist can take me around the world and my personal favorite is definitely French music. The music opens a whole new feeling with a country, which is the perfect "vacation" while studying or being stuck in quarantine.
Some of my favorite French songs are:
These are all kind of basic, but they all remind me of great holidays and the language is, in my opinion, very beautiful.
-- Hanneke Bezemer, Brummen, the Netherlands
Support small businesses where you can
Please remember that there are so many people for whom this isn't a staycation, but unemployment. My husband and I own a small craft chocolate company and we don't have work or wages for the seven people we've had to tell to file for unemployment. We have no sense right now of whether our small business will make it through or not. For those of you who are able to be on staycation, please consider doing some online shopping at independent stores and ordering take out from independent restaurants.
-- Elaine, Atlanta
Beethoven, via Berlin
Concert halls may have been closed to the public, but that doesn't stop me from "attending" one. The Berlin Philharmonic, for instance, kindly offers concerts on their Digital Concert Hall website free of charge. This year is Beethoven's 250th birthday, and listening to the composer's struggle hidden within his music really rejuvenates my mind and drives me forward. Music makes us happier and more optimistic, and staying at home with some music, especially by Beethoven, puts us in another world.
-- Neo Hung, Hong Kong
Look to the stars
Download the SkyView app to your phone to view distant constellations, nearby planetary objects and more! I love gazing at Jupiter, which is 513 million miles from Earth, in the sky we all share. It reminds me of Earth's extraordinary beauty and the unity of life.
-- Caroline Pedro, Seattle
Take stock. Breathe.
What is worse right now? Being alone or getting cabin fever (and irritable) with your partner? Since I have no choice -- my darling husband died a year and a half ago, after 54 years (not nearly enough!) of marriage -- I am thinking hard about the coming weeks and months.
1. Finally edit the zillions of photos on my computer. Consider actually making photo albums for myself or my loved ones.
2. Do some creative writing, especially some short "memoir" pieces my grandchildren would enjoy.
3. Attack my files. Get rid of unnecessary paper and create a better filing system.
4. Take a daily walk and notice the beauty.
5. Deep breathing before getting up and before going to bed.
6. This will last a long time, but not forever.
-- Robin Weintraub, Rochester, New York

For Future Generations, It's Time to Reflect on Black Art

Texto completo: Shifts in politics, performance and protest have all altered our culture in a way not seen in years.
I grew up in Southern California neighborhoods that were overwhelmingly white -- white schools, white teachers, white curriculum. I remember visiting the Los Angeles County Museum of Art where a cast of Auguste Rodin's monumental sculpture of Balzac towered over me. My friends and I immersed ourselves in the works of white authors, and I can still recite vast sections of T.S. Eliot's "The Hollow Men," William Butler Yeats's "The Second Coming," and, if I squeeze my eyes real tight, the final luxurious paragraphs of "The Dead," James Joyce's masterful short story.
But I am black -- African-American, if you will -- and unambiguously of African heritage. Thanks to my father, the rhythms and melodies of Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis and John Coltrane flowed through our household during my childhood. Yet, as an adolescent, Led Zeppelin, Cream and the Who were favored by my friends and me. (My enthusiasm for bluesmen such as Sonny Terry, Brownie McGhee, Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters was rooted in my rock 'n' roll fandom.) In short, I felt only incidentally "black," despite being harassed by the local police, who frequently stopped me as I walked home from school or rode my bike to the grocery store.
That feeling slowly changed, of course, as I became an adult. But I didn't feel I became fully black until the birth of my first child. His arrival brought into focus the usual parental responsibilities of providing food, shelter and moral support. But I also felt a special duty to imbue my son -- and later my daughter -- with a sense of what it means to be of African heritage in America. Not "the talk" about navigating encounters with the police. I felt the need to address meta-questions pertaining to the frame of mind that would help my children prosper in the world, not only survive.
So, I wrote a cookbook whose recipes from the African diaspora were anchored by stories from the black cooks who contributed them, as well as the wit and wisdom from black cultures around the world and across time. Then came a series of what I call "affirmative action" books -- collections of pithy proverbs and quotes from prominent historical and contemporary black people meant to inspire the desire to implement concrete positive action.
More recently, my thoughts turned to internalizing black culture in a more formal way, especially after seeing Jacob Lawrence's "The Migration Series" at the Museum of Modern Art in 2015. The 60 small panel paintings illustrating the movement of black Southerners to the North had affected me tremendously. The formal beauty of the work and the message of black agency felt like an oasis of pride and inspiration in a world of stop and frisks, police killings of black men and women, and the general denigration of "black culture."

Then, in 2018, there was "Black Panther," the first major superhero movie with an African protagonist; Beyoncé's Coachella performance, during which she presented over a century of black musical traditions; and, performing as Childish Gambino, Donald Glover's violent, darkly comic video, "This Is America." These works seemed to amount to encyclopedias of black cultural touchstones, resources of strength in racially fraught times.
I began to wonder: What particular pieces of music, film, sculpture, dance or other artistic expression do some of today's best and brightest black creators find important? What aspects of the kaleidoscopic collective black soul as expressed in the arts would they want to emphasize and remember 25 or 50 years from now? Should such a list include Public Enemy's 1990 album "Fear of a Black Planet"? The "Wade in the Water" segment of Alvin Ailey's "Revelations"?
That's a lot to bite off when talking about centuries of global black artistic expression, but what about narrowing it to black arts created over these first two decades of the 21st century? Shifts in politics, performance and protest have all altered our culture in a way not seen in years. The beauty of this exercise in reflection is not only to celebrate black cultural contributions to art but also record a pivotal time for our country -- indeed the world. It's a starting place for further exploration for my 18-month-old granddaughter and many future generations after hers.
To play on the words, but not the meaning, of John Milton's "Paradise Lost": Such a survey would be the latest hopeful sally to make darkness not just visible, but aspirational. Works that bear witness to what black people went through and still endure; works that reveal past and continuing struggles and successes.

Texto completo: The two powers amplify discredited conspiracy theories and sow division as they look to undermine the United States.
WASHINGTON -- China and Russia have both seized on the novel coronavirus to wage disinformation campaigns that seek to sow doubts about the United States' handling of the crisis and deflect attention from their own struggles with the pandemic, according to American intelligence officials and diplomats.
Kremlin-aligned websites aimed at Western audiences have trafficked in conspiracy theories to spread fear in Europe and political division in the United States, the officials said, noting that Russia's diplomats and state-run news media have arguably been more restrained.
China has been more overtly aggressive. It has used a network of government-linked social media accounts to spread discredited, and sometimes contradictory, theories. And China has adopted Russia's playbook for more covert operations, mimicking Kremlin disinformation campaigns and even using and amplifying some of the same conspiracy sites.
The propaganda campaigns show how both countries turned to a typical authoritarian tactic of spreading propaganda to undermine their shared adversary, the United States, rather than addressing public criticism of their own problems.
In the days to come, China is likely to back off the public spread of disinformation through its Foreign Ministry and network of embassies and to further embrace the more subtle Russian-style approach, relying on its intelligence services to spread misinformation about the origins of the virus and China's handling of it, senior American intelligence officials assessed.
Washington and Beijing have reached a tentative détente, other American officials said, that calls for both sides to halt public attacks on each other about the virus, but officials are skeptical that the uneasy truce will hold.
One senior American official said China had signaled to the United States that it would throttle its disinformation in the face of criticism from European countries and the U.S. State Department. Other officials said China was merely shifting tactics, finding its disinformation campaign was less effective than it had hoped. And President Trump has moved toward conciliation, holding a telephone call with President Xi Jinping of China on Thursday night in which the two leaders "agreed to work together to defeat the coronavirus pandemic," according to a White House summary of the conversation.
Russia and China as well as Iran have sharply increased their dissemination of disinformation about the coronavirus since January, even repeating and amplifying one another's propaganda and falsehoods, including anti-American conspiracy theories, said Lea Gabrielle, a special envoy and coordinator of the Global Engagement Center at the State Department.
"The Covid-19 crisis has really provided an opportunity for malign actors to exploit the information space for harmful purposes," Ms. Gabrielle told reporters on Friday, referring to the disease caused by the virus. Teams at the department are working on countering the messages, she said.
Speaking at the White House on March 20, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo denounced China, Russia and Iran for "coordinated efforts" at spreading disinformation.
China has a long history of propaganda and efforts to cajole the world into following its own narrative on geopolitical issues like Taiwan, Tibet or Hong Kong. While it pushes its policies and views, some openly anti-American, it rarely puts enormous resources behind fringe conspiracy theories.
But that has changed during the pandemic, intelligence officials and outside experts said. In a highly coordinated campaign, Chinese officials and institutions have spread talking points centered on two narratives: that the United States is to blame for the origins of the virus and that the Communist Party has successfully contained the virus after a hard-fought campaign, affirming the superiority of its system.
As part of the information war, China is also expelling journalists from three major American newspapers, including The New York Times.
After remaining relatively quiet early in the year, Chinese Foreign Ministry officials have in recent weeks amplified conspiratorial stories as the coronavirus outbreak has spread globally while China has claimed to have wrested it under control in the city of Wuhan where it originated.
Chinese officials appeared to have relied on borrowing falsehoods pushed by anti-American organizations cultivated by the Kremlin that already have an audience in Western countries. Some of the sites have received Russian money, according to experts.
On March 12, for instance, Zhao Lijian, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, posted a link on Twitter to what he described as a "very much important" article that falsely described American origins of the coronavirus.
The article was from Global Research, a group based in Montreal that presents itself as a think tank but largely traffics in conspiracy theories, many of them pro-Russian and anti-American.
At least a dozen other Chinese Embassies around the world retweeted Mr. Zhao's post. All told, more than 12,000 accounts have retweeted it and more than 20,000 users have liked it.
Other outlets that routinely push out disinformation subsequently picked up the theory and added their own twists. One of the main contributors to the far-right financial site ZeroHedge, who goes by the pseudonym "Tyler Durden" -- the name of Brad Pitt's character in the 1999 movie "Fight Club" -- referred to Mr. Zhao's tweet in a lengthy post on a lesser-known site and presented the new coronavirus as the "black swan that the globalists were waiting for (or planning) all along."
Another site, Veterans Today, which traffics in conspiracy theories, many of them anti-American, claimed to "break" the untrue story of how an American sports team had brought the coronavirus to Wuhan in October. "No video or photos exist of the U.S. team, no records were kept," the outlet asserted, adding that many athletes from the purported team did not even compete and instead hung around the open-air market where the virus is believed to have first emerged in humans.
The tactics are "a significant departure from how the Chinese have operated in the past," said Laura Rosenberger, the director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a project of the nonpartisan German Marshall Fund of the United States.
"Russia has long spread multiple, seemingly contradictory disinformation narratives and then said, 'How can we know for sure what happened, how can we know the truth?"' she added. "We have never really seen China do that externally before. But now we see Chinese officials and media trying out those typically Russian tactics."
On Monday, the Alliance for Securing Democracy will unveil a tool to track the Chinese disinformation and give a sense of the narrative Beijing is pushing. The group's Hamilton dashboard has long monitored Russian Twitter accounts and broadcast feeds.
In recent days, Chinese officials have refined their messaging to move away from outright lies or falsehoods, Ms. Gabrielle said.
"I will say that the information space is ever-evolving," she said. "It's been very fluid, and China's approach to it has been as well."
In Africa, for example, Beijing's diplomatic accounts tried for a couple of days to amplify the conspiracy theories pushed by Mr. Zhao. But since March 15, the propaganda in Africa has mainly praised Chinese efforts. Ms. Gabrielle said her teams had seen similar shifting patterns in China's messaging in Italy and elsewhere in the West.
China's own initial failures in fighting the virus prevented its government from mounting a propaganda campaign of simply promoting its own achievements, forcing it to embrace Russian-style disinformation, said Matthew Kroenig, a former C.I.A. official and the author of a new book on the growing competition between China and the United States, "The Return of Great Power Rivalry."
"Part of the reason the Chinese are copying the Russian playbook is because they mismanaged the crisis," Mr. Kroenig said. "But they are also learning from the Russians."
Russia's public messaging about the coronavirus has been reserved, prompting some American officials and experts to conclude that Moscow, uncertain of how the pandemic will play out, had decided to hedge its public message by avoiding conspiracy theories that could blow back on the Russian government.
Still, Russia has shifted its propaganda efforts in Europe and elsewhere to focus on the virus, spreading conspiracy theories about it, according to the European Union's disinformation unit, which has tracked it.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has been a target of the Russian effort. The Lithuanian government believes Moscow was behind a falsified account that an American soldier serving in the NATO force in Lithuania had tested positive for coronavirus, a Lithuanian official said. Since then, Russia has spread other disinformation in Lithuania and in other countries in the Atlantic alliance.
The Russians' tactics have a canny circularity, Ms. Gabrielle said. They push out a false message, which the Chinese and Iranians pick up and promote, and then Russian actors will repost the Chinese or Iranian versions of the message to make it seem like new information that had originated independently elsewhere.

Texto completo: The journalist's new thriller is eerily prescient. Too bad our leaders lack his foresight.
The epidemic begins in a teeming country in Asia, but despite the efforts of the government to contain it, it soon spreads throughout the world. Some victims experience an uncontrolled immune response called a cytokine storm, causing them to drown in their own fluids. In America, schools close as citizens shelter at home. Grocery store shelves empty, and the United States is plunged into the worst depression since the 1930s.
"We've had plans for years, at the C.D.C. and N.I.H. and Johns Hopkins and Walter Reed, we've had lots of plans," a federal public health official tells an administration that is slow to comprehend what is happening. "We just haven't ever been given the resources and personnel to carry them out. Like ventilators."
She describes a national shortfall of essential equipment: "We're running out of syringes, diagnostic test kits, gloves, respirators, antiseptics, all the stuff we need to treat patients and protect ourselves."
The vice president, a former governor and radio host who's been made point man on the crisis, demands "deliverables" that he can offer to an impatient president. She can't give him any.
These could be scenes from our current calamity, but they're taken from "The End of October," a thriller by the journalist Lawrence Wright that comes out next month. The book is about a devastating illness that races around the globe, leading to apocalyptic upheaval.
Wright's pandemic doesn't exactly track the new coronavirus -- his imaginary plague, the Kongoli flu, emerges in Indonesia, not China, and it is far deadlier than our own. And while the social fallout from the coronavirus has been ruinous and will likely get worse, there's no reason to think it will cause the violent civilizational implosion and global war Wright envisions.
Still, reading "The End of October" while under lockdown from the coronavirus is an eerie experience. At first, I marveled at Wright's literary divination. But as the news has unfolded over recent days, it's become clear that for those paying attention, there have been plenty of warnings that a pandemic was coming. Wright, a perceptive generalist, picked up on them. The president and his circle did not.
"The End of October" is not the first time that Wright, a staff writer for The New Yorker and a Pulitzer Prize winner, has made a prescient foray into fiction. He co-wrote the screenplay for "The Siege," the 1998 thriller in which America, hit by a wave of Islamist terrorism, jettisons civil liberties and becomes increasingly militarized. As Wright wrote in a recent New York Times essay, "It was a box office bust, but after 9/11 it became one of the most rented movies in America."
How does he do it? He's not psychic -- he's just a superb reporter. In a note to booksellers about "The End of October," Wright described researching it as he would a piece of journalism.
"I have interviewed many scientists and epidemiologists at the heart of America's effort to prevent a catastrophic pandemic," he wrote. "I've spoken to top government officials. I've been briefed by military experts. They all share the concerns I've presented -- that something like this could happen."
Indeed, for years now, a whole chorus of Cassandras has tried to make society take seriously the possibility of a world-altering illness. It's been 26 years since award-winning science journalist Laurie Garrett wrote "The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance."
In 2015, Bill Gates gave a TED Talk -- now viewed over 20 million times -- titled, "The Next Outbreak? We're Not Ready." The greatest risk of global catastrophe is no longer nuclear war, he said, but "a highly infectious virus."
In Foreign Policy, Micah Zenko wrote that last year he spoke to a vice president for risk at a Fortune 100 company who laid out the threat of "a highly contagious virus that begins somewhere in China and spreads rapidly."
President Trump's own Department of Health and Human Services ran a series of simulations last year in which a respiratory virus from China spreads worldwide, sickening 110 million Americans. Despite Trump's refrain that no one could have predicted something like the new coronavirus, many have.
A minor character in "The End of October" is Richard Clarke, the real-life former counterterrorism czar who tried but failed to get George W. Bush's administration to focus on the threat posed by Osama bin Laden. It's as if Wright were trying to signal -- too late -- that our government was poised for yet another spectacular intelligence failure.
Yet even Wright's catastrophic imagination has its limits. In the novel, Wright writes, "The president had been almost entirely absent in the debate about how to deal with the contagion, except to blame the opposing party for ignoring public health needs before he took office."
We should be so lucky. The nameless leader in "The End of October" is grotesque, but he doesn't give daily press briefings full of dangerous misinformation, or expect governors to flatter him in exchange for disaster aid. Some horrors would seem too absurd for fiction if they didn't appear first in fact.

Texto completo: Millions of older Americans make an annual migration between the North and the South. The coronavirus pandemic has them questioning their plans to return home.
Travel and travel planning are being disrupted by the worldwide spread of the coronavirus. For the latest updates, read The New York Times's Covid-19 coverage here .
Laurie and Rick Vant Hoff have spent the last six winters in a rented property in Cape San Blas, Fla. This year, the retired couple, who live in Wisconsin, intended to stay until the end of March -- their longest stint as so-called snowbirds, Ms. Vant Hoff, 64, said.
At least that was the plan until several weeks ago, when the news of the coronavirus pandemic began spreading in the United States. First, friends who were supposed to join them called to cancel, then restaurants gradually switched to only offering takeout or deliveries, and finally, Cape San Blas closed its beaches.
"That's when we really started thinking, boy, should we be staying?" said Ms. Vant Hoff, a retired accounting assistant.
[Facing the snowbirds' dilemma? Here is experts' advice on whether to return North. ]
Millions of Americans -- mostly over the age of 60, many of them retired -- take part in an annual migration from the cold North to the balmy South each winter. Now, many of them are faced with a travel dilemma amid the outbreak: Should they stay or should they go? Many miss their families and wish they could be closer to home in case of an emergency. Others worry about being far away from their health care providers. Some just had plans, and want to know if they should keep them.
"We don't know what's better," Ms. Vant Hoff said. "Is it better for us to stay here for a whole month or is it better to go home?"
Some people had no choice but to return.
Christine and Paul Lauster, a retired couple from Clyde, a small town in upstate New York, take their camping trailer on an annual winter trip, and were staying in a Florida state park when news of the virus began spreading. In late March, Florida announced it was closing its state parks to contain the spread of the coronavirus.
With their reservations canceled, the trip had come to an end, said Ms. Lauster, 68, a retired school librarian. They watched as friends packed their belongings within hours and hit the road the following day. Then they started planning their own drive home.
It took them about three days to get to upstate New York. Hours into their drive, one of the camper's wheels came off, which forced them to stop in Virginia for a "Band-Aid fix," Ms. Lauster said. The following day, after driving for about 11 hours, they made it to Clyde a little after midnight. They plan to remain under self-quarantine for two weeks.
"It was a relief to be home," Ms. Lauster said. "There's no longer the pressure of what happens if they close roads, if they close gas stations?"
In Texas, another popular state for snowbirds (though they are called winter Texans there), private campgrounds remain open and largely full, said Brian Schaeffer, the executive director and chief executive of the Texas Association of Campground Owners. His 400 members, made up of private campgrounds and R.V. parks, have only seen about a five percent decline in reservations and will continue to operate as essential businesses. The majority of the parks' visitors usually stay for an entire season.
Mr. Schaeffer said he thought it was better for visitors to shelter in place in South Texas. "Better to do that than risk traveling through multiple states to get back home. Once things settle down, then you can go back."
As precautions, he said, many of the parks have closed common areas like recreation halls and pools to prevent guests from gathering.
Luanne Thielke, 77, a retired business owner, spends the winters in Palm Desert, Calif., with her husband and has an early April flight scheduled back to Oregon.
Her husband, 78, has a follow-up doctor's appointment he cannot miss, Ms. Thielke said, and both of them have underlying health conditions.
So far, they are sticking with their plan to ship their car and board the plane, she said.
"We think it's better to fly," Ms. Thielke said. "We made the plans and it's just in God's hands."
Adina Schorr, a retired interior designer who spends her winters in a gated community in Boca Raton, Fla., initially wanted to fly back to her apartment in New York City.
"I wanted to be much closer to my children, even if I would be locked up in my apartment," said Ms. Schorr, 81, whose husband died last year.
But her three children convinced her that staying where she was, even by herself, was the safest option for her, Ms. Schorr said.
To make her feel less alone, one of her three children, his wife and her grandchild temporarily moved to the same gated community where they are living with their in-laws. They still practice social distancing, Ms. Schorr said, but at least they can go out for a walk together or spend some time outside as a family.
"I'll wait because there is no reason for me to rush back," Ms. Schorr said. "It really doesn't matter where you are because you cannot come close to each other."
Part of the debate about whether to stay or go involves the trip home, often a long drive, usually made over several days. Will hotels be open -- and safe -- or will domestic travel be restricted?
The Abingdon Manor, a 10,000-square-foot boutique hotel in the town of Latta, S.C., regularly hosts snowbirds because of its convenient location -- halfway between New York and Palm Beach, Fla., and just off Interstate 95. It has seen about an 85 percent decline in bookings in the past two weeks, said the hotel's owner, Michael Griffey.
As of Wednesday evening, the manor had none of its seven bedrooms booked, Mr. Griffey, 72, said.
"We had lots of cancellations," Mr. Griffey said. "What we're seeing now is people who are trying to get home. A lot of our regular guests are staying put in Florida."
Mr. Griffey added: "We are just sort of an emergency stop."
In the end, the Vant Hoffs decided they would go home and are going to start their 18-hour drive home on Sunday, their regularly scheduled departure date. They chose to stay until the end of their booking to enjoy the pool, walks in the woods, birding and puzzles.
"We just absolutely fell in love with the area, Mr. Vant Hoff said. "Very quiet and very laid back. There's no better place I'd rather get stuck. "

Texto completo: The coronavirus pandemic may plunge the United States into its worst social and economic crisis since the Great Depression. But our response — from the president’s blame-shifting rhetoric to the Senate’s inadequate relief package — has yet to rise to the scale and scope of the challenge.
I’ve written before about why Congress needs to do far more than it has if it wants to save the economy from disease-induced depression. Here, I want to focus on rhetoric. If the country needs a New Deal-esque effort to stop the pandemic, then it also needs New Deal-esque leadership to mobilize manpower and resources to that end.
It’s with this in mind that I want to look to Franklin Roosevelt’s first inaugural address. Elected in November 1932, Roosevelt was well aware of a deep national hunger for leadership — for someone to bring energy to government and confront an economic crisis that threatened the entire social order.
Roosevelt was inaugurated on March 4, 1933. The day was gray and grim. “Though the city was gay with flags and lively with the music of bands and cheers for the marchers in the inaugural parade which followed the oath taking,” Arthur Krock wrote in The New York Times, “the atmosphere which surrounded the change of government in the United States was comparable to that which might be found in a beleaguered capital in wartime.”
For good reason. “In the agonizing interval between Roosevelt’s election in November 1932 and his inauguration in March 1933, the American banking system shut down completely” and “the global economy slid even deeper into the trough of the Depression,” historian David M. Kennedy writes in “Freedom From Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945.” In “The Crisis of the Old Order,” the first of his three volumes on Roosevelt and the New Deal, Arthur Schlesinger Jr. described the situation as a “fog of despair.”
“One out of every four American workers lacked a job,” he wrote.
“Factories that had once darkened the skies with smoke stood ghostly and silent, like extinct volcanoes. Families slept in tarpaper shacks and tin-lined caves and scavenged like dogs for food in the city dump.”
Schlesinger continued: “Thousands of vagabond children were roaming the land, wild boys of the road. Hunger marchers, pinched and bitter, were parading cold streets in New York and Chicago.”
Americans didn’t just hurt in the present; they feared for the future. “Hope proved elusive,” historian Ira Katznelson writes in “Fear Itself: The New Deal and the Origins of Our Time.”
“The rumble of deep uncertainty, a sense of proceeding without a map, remained relentless and enveloping. A climate of universal fear deeply affected political understandings and concerns. Nothing was sure.”
Rather than avoid or ignore that fear, Roosevelt used his first words as president to face it head on. “A host of unemployed citizens face the grim problem of existence, and an equally great number toil with little return. Only a foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment,” he said. And yet, he continued, the nation’s distress “comes from no failure of substance,” before adding, “We are stricken by no plague of locusts.” Instead, Americans face poverty and deprivation because “the rulers of the exchange of mankind’s goods have failed, through their own stubbornness and their own incompetence.”
To be fair, Roosevelt said, these men “have tried.” But their efforts “have been cast in the pattern of an outworn tradition.” In the face of a devastating crisis, they did more of the same. “They have no vision, and where there is no vision the people perish.”
Thankfully, those men were now gone from the scene. “The money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilization,” Roosevelt said. “We may now restore that temple to the ancient truths.” And what are those truths? It is the truth that “happiness lies not in the mere possession of money” but in the “joy of achievement, in the thrill of creative effort.” It is the truth that “the joy and moral stimulation of work no longer must be forgotten in the mad chase of evanescent profits.”
For Roosevelt, the nation needed a change in ethics: an “abandonment of the false belief that public office and high political position are to be valued only by the standards of pride of place and personal profit” and “an end to conduct in banking and in business which too often has given to a sacred trust the likeness of callous and selfish wrongdoing.” At the same time, the country also needed immediate relief. To that end, he asked Americans to treat the challenge of unemployment and idle production “as we would treat the emergency of a war.”
This meant an end to the timid policies of the past and the orthodoxy that constrained Washington in the face of crisis and the start of a new, energetic approach to wielding the powers of the federal government. Roosevelt called for “direct recruiting by the government itself” to relieve unemployment and “direct efforts to raise the values of agricultural products” to prevent “the tragedy of the growing loss through foreclosure of our small homes and farms.” He called for “unifying of relief activities” and “national planning for and supervision of all forms of transportation and of communications and other utilities which have a definitely public character.” And he insisted that all of this is “feasible under the form of government which we have inherited from our ancestors.” The Republic was under stress, but it hadn’t been broken.
As Roosevelt neared the end of his address, he returned to the language of ethics as well as the language of war: “If I read the temper of our people correctly, we now realize as we have never realized before our interdependence on each other; that we cannot merely take but we must give as well; that if we are to go forward, we must move as a trained and loyal army willing to sacrifice for the good of a common discipline.”
The American people craved leadership and Roosevelt delivered it, taking center stage in the nation’s political life and holding it for the next 12 years. Still, it would be another two years before his legislative program matched his rhetorical ambitions. It was the so-called second New Deal of the Social Security Act and the National Labor Relations Act that fundamentally altered the federal government’s relationship to its citizens.
The larger point, however, is this: It took more than competence and ability to resolve the crisis of the 1930s. President Herbert Hoover was competent (in the early 1920s he spearheaded a relief effort that saved millions of Russians from starvation in the wake of famine and civil war); Hoover was able . But Hoover was committed to a failed orthodoxy, unable to think beyond the dogma of the past. Roosevelt wasn’t a blank slate, but he was flexible. He could think creatively about government, and his allies were eager to experiment. They brought openness and imagination to Washington and helped save the country in the process.
As we face what may become the great crisis of our age, we need that Rooseveltian leadership: flexible, creative and deeply aware of the power of words. Roosevelt’s first inaugural wasn’t just an impressive speech; it was a harbinger of things to come. Like nearly all of the most memorable presidential rhetoric, it cleared the way for action, pointing the country toward a singular goal. Put another way, the Roosevelt of March 1933 did not know how the future would unfold, but he understood the power he had to shape the limits of what was possible — and he didn’t hesitate to put it to work.

Tokyo Olympics committee president says spring 2021 is unlikely timeframe for rescheduled Games

Texto completo: Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics organizing committee president Yoshiro Mori said Saturday it is unlikely the rescheduled 2020 Summer Games will take place in the spring of 2021.
The Tokyo Olympics were officially postponed earlier this week as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
"I want to offer some conclusions by the end of next week after we've mulled it over," Mori said during an appearance on Nippon Television. "The Games are meant to be in summer, so we should be thinking of a time between June and September. "
The New York Times and Japanese broadcaster NHK each reported Saturday that the Games are likely to begin July 23, 2021 — nearly a year to the day after their initially-scheduled window this summer.
International Olympic Committee spokesperson Mark Adams told USA TODAY Sports in an email early Sunday that the reported dates are "speculation. "
The possibility of the Olympics taking place in the spring arose after IOC president Thomas Bach said earlier in the week that "all options are on the table," as an IOC task force planned to meet with 33 international sports federations to determine new dates.
Mori noted that logistical complications would also stand in the way of the Games being held in the spring. He said with the Games taking place in the summer, there's a longer timetable for rearranging qualifying events and securing volunteers.
"It's better for preparation time to be kept as long as possible," he said.
The original 2020 Olympics schedule was July 24-Aug. 9 before the Games were postponed. The Paralympics were slated to run Aug. 25-Sept. 6.
“It’s a huge jigsaw puzzle and every piece has to fit," Bach said earlier in the week. "If one piece is taken out, it can destroy it. The Games have never been postponed before. There is no blueprint. ”

Texto completo: He played with color, creating scenes both calming and arresting. He said he wanted his colors "to be surprising to people without being offensive."
Wolf Kahn, a landscape painter who applied a vibrant, adventurous palette to studies of tangled forests and fog-shrouded mornings, quiet brooks and solitary barns, died on March 15 at his home in Manhattan. He was 92.
Diana Urbaska, his longtime studio manager, said the cause was congestive heart failure.
Mr. Kahn, who divided his time between New York and Brattleboro, Vt., was part of a family of artists. His mother-in-law, who died in 1971, was the painter Alice Trumbull Mason, and his wife was Emily Mason, whose abstract paintings made striking use of color.
Ms. Mason, whom he married in 1957, died on Dec. 10.
Mr. Kahn, who emigrated from Germany as a child, studied with the influential artist and teacher Hans Hofmann, who had himself emigrated from Germany, and in 1952 he was among several former Hofmann students who organized the Hansa Gallery, a cooperative named for their teacher. Mr. Kahn had his first solo show there in 1953, a collection of indoor and outdoor scenes, and made a strong impression.
"The paint spills and runs," The New York Times wrote of that show, "color crackles with vivacity and the brush might just as well have been guided by a tornado as by hand. Yet this is no manner for manner's sake. Kahn is a high-spirited, lyrical artist who paints the way he does because a leonine manner seems to fit exactly his response to what he sees."
It was the first of many solo exhibitions, in New York and around the country. Mr. Kahn came to focus on landscapes, especially once he and Ms. Mason bought a hillside farm in Vermont in 1968. They would spend summers and falls there, and Mr. Kahn found inspiration in the bucolic scenes.
"I am attracted by the light, by the shifting horizons, by the variety and gentleness of the landscapes," he told The San Diego Union-Tribune in 1983, when he had his first major West Coast solo exhibition at the San Diego Museum of Art.
His works seemed to radiate light, an intensity created by building up layers with intensive brushwork. The luminosity could be simultaneously comforting and assertive.
"It's the idea of the iron fist in the velvet glove," he said. "I want maximum strength along with maximum delicacy."
Mr. Kahn was especially admired in Vermont, where he and Ms. Mason were strong supporters of the Brattleboro Museum and Art Center. Danny Lichtenfeld, the museum's director, summed up Mr. Kahn's influence in an interview with the website VTDigger in 2017, when the institution mounted a major Kahn exhibition.
"Wolf Kahn," he said, "is to southern Vermont what Winslow Homer is to the coast of Maine, Georgia O'Keeffe to the New Mexico high desert and Claude Monet to the French countryside."
Hans Wolfgang Kahn was born on Oct. 4, 1927, in Stuttgart, Germany. His father, Emil, was a conductor who led the Stuttgart Philharmonic and other orchestras. His mother, Nellie Budge Kahn, died when he was a young boy, and he was sent to live with his paternal grandmother in Hamburg.
The family was well off, and Mr. Kahn spent his childhood in a house full of art; at 10 he began taking art lessons. But his father was Jewish, and the rise of Hitler put the family in jeopardy; in 1939 his grandmother arranged for him to be sent to England in the Kindertransport program, which spirited thousands of children out of Germany.
His father had left Germany earlier, and in 1940 young Hans (who later changed his first name to Wolf) joined him in New Jersey. In 1943 the family moved to New York.
After graduating from the High School of Music and Art and serving in the United States Navy, Mr. Kahn began studying at the New School in 1946, but he dropped out the next year to study with Mr. Hofmann, also working as his studio assistant. New York art aficionados got their first look at Mr. Kahn's paintings in 1947 when he was part of a group show at the Seligmann Gallery featuring Mr. Hofmann's students.
In 1950 Mr. Kahn enrolled at the University of Chicago on the G.I. Bill. He earned a bachelor's degree there the next year before returning to New York.
Mr. Kahn exhibited frequently in the ensuing decades, drawing attention for his technique and his unusual use of color.
"He is an artist concerned primarily with the direct, sensual experience of color, in the tradition of Bonnard more than of Monet," Peter Schjeldahl wrote in The New York Times in reviewing an exhibition at the Grace Borgenicht Gallery in 1972. "His colors are brilliant and often searing -- hot magenta shadows and grass of acidic yellow‐green. These are not colors that sunlight finds in nature; they are colors that an aroused sensibility finds, with joy, in the act of painting."
In a 1999 interview with The Richmond Times-Dispatch of Virginia on the occasion of an exhibition at the Reynolds Gallery in Richmond, Mr. Kahn talked about what he was trying to achieve with color.
"My choice of color is dictated by tact and decorum stretched by an unholy desire to be outrageous," he said. "I'm trying to get color to the danger point where it's too sweet or too noisy without actually making it too sweet or too noisy."
The ground in one of his scenes might be green or bright yellow. Trees in his forestscapes might be brown or black or orange or pink.
"I want the color to be surprising to people without being offensive," he said. "By offensive, I mean something that makes the teeth grind. I like shock effect, but shock that settles into a harmonious whole."
Mr. Kahn is survived by two daughters, Cecily Kahn and Melany Kahn; four grandchildren; and two step-grandchildren. The Miles McEnery Gallery in Manhattan, which represented him, has an exhibition of his work scheduled for January 2021.
Mr. Kahn's paintings didn't often include figures. In his interview with The Richmond Times-Dispatch, he talked about his affinity for painting trees rather than people.
"Trees have a terrific attribute in a landscape," he explained. "You can add a branch or another tree, and nobody is the wiser. If you paint a figure and add a third leg, everybody wonders what the artist is doing."
In an interview with the gallerist Jerald Melberg in 2011, he described working on a painting in Italy in 1963, trying to create a modern-day version of van Gogh walking through an Italian landscape.
"I kept moving the figure," Mr. Kahn said. "First it was here. Then it was there. And then finally I put it over here. Then finally I painted it out altogether."
"As soon as I painted the figure out, I was happy," he added. "Because I felt free."

Mark Blum, 69, a Familiar Face on Stage and Screen

Texto completo: Mr. Blum, who died of coronavirus complications, was also seen on Broadway; in "Crocodile Dundee" and other movies; and on numerous television shows.
Mark Blum, an Obie Award-winning New York stage and screen actor whose roles ranged from highly flawed husbands to overconfident blowhards, died on Wednesday in Manhattan. He was 69.
The actor Lee Wilkof, a close family friend, said the cause was complications of the coronavirus. Mr. Blum also had asthma.
Mr. Blum was an omnipresent figure in the Off Broadway world for decades, but his biggest moment in the spotlight came in 1989 after he played a time-traveling 20th-century playwright who befriends Gustav Mahler, in the Playwrights Horizons production of Albert Innaurato's "Gus and Al."
Frank Rich, in his review in The New York Times, referred to Mr. Blum's "appealing, weary-eyed portrayal" and saw Al's self-martyrdom as a form of "rueful hypersensitivity to the modern world."
At the Obie ceremony, Mr. Blum was given one of 13 uncategorized Off Broadway performance awards for that season. His fellow winners included Nancy Marchand and Fyvush Finkel.
He had a notable Broadway career as well, appearing in nine productions over three and a half decades. He made his Broadway debut as a particularly versatile theater professional -- playing an unnamed Venetian (one of four), understudying two roles and acting as assistant stage manager in "The Merchant" (1977), set in 16th-century Venice and inspired by a certain Shakespearean classic.
Other Broadway roles included Eddie, the young main character's recently widowed and debt-ridden father, in Neil Simon's "Lost in Yonkers" (1991), with Irene Worth; Spalding Gray's campaign manager in "Gore Vidal's The Best Man" (2000), a role he reprised as a replacement in the 2012 revival; Leo Herman, a.k.a. Chuckles the Chipmunk, the detestable host of a children's television show, in "A Thousand Clowns" (2001); and Juror No. 1, the reasonable foreman, in "Twelve Angry Men" (2004).
At his death, he was an acting teacher at HB Studio in New York, where he headed the yearlong core training program named for Uta Hagen, and a faculty member at Brooklyn College.
In a video for HB, he reflected on one aspect of the study of acting.
"What is the journey of self-discovery that you begin on that allows you to join your own curiosity about who you are with your curiosity about what the human race is -- and how to channel that into the work?"
Mark Jeffrey Blum was born on May 14, 1950, in Newark, to Morton Joseph Blum, an insurance executive, and Lorraine Pearl (Fink) Blum.
Growing up in nearby Maplewood, N.J., Mark thought casually about becoming a lawyer or an engineer; he was also something of a math prodigy. So when he entered the University of Pennsylvania, it was as a general liberal arts student with no particular goal. But he soon found his calling.
"Theater somehow enabled me to bring all the things that mattered into focus," Mr. Blum told The New York Times in 1980. There was no formal theater program at Penn, but the administration helped him shape a curriculum, and he graduated as a theater major in 1972.
Two years later, he received a master of fine arts degree from the University of Minnesota in a special program in association with the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis.
He made his New York stage debut as a post office clerk in a 1976 production of "The Cherry Orchard" at a theater on West 23rd Street.
While continuing to work onstage, he made his feature film debut in "Lovesick" (1983), Marshall Brickman's romantic comedy about an unfaithful psychiatrist, and his television series debut as a doctor on "St. Elsewhere" in 1984.
He appeared in almost 30 films, including "Desperately Seeking Susan" (1985), as a married hot-tub salesman; "Crocodile Dundee" (1986); and "Shattered Glass" (2003). His most recent, "The Pleasure of Your Presence," a romantic comedy about a wedding in the Hamptons, has been completed but not yet scheduled for release.
Over the decades he appeared on dozens of prime-time series -- among them "Miami Vice," "Roseanne," "Frasier" and three shows in the "Law & Order" franchise -- and he remained active into 2020. He appeared in 30 episodes of the Amazon series "Mozart in the Jungle" as Union Bob, a rules-obsessed symphony orchestra piccolo player. His most recent roles were on the drama series "You," as a mysterious bookstore owner and stroke victim; "Succession" (2018-19); and "Billions," in an episode scheduled to air in May.
His final Broadway appearance was in 2013 in "The Assembled Parties," as Judith Light's combative Upper West Side husband. His last Off Broadway productions were "Amy and the Orphans" (2018), at the Laura Pels Theater, in which he played an autistic woman's generally oblivious brother; and "Fern Hill," a comic drama about retirement-age baby boomers considering a commune, at 59E59 Theaters in September.
He is survived by his wife, the actress Janet Zarish; his mother; and his sister, Nancy Blum Litt.
Mr. Blum always had a special feeling for theater environments beyond Broadway. When he was appearing in Amy Herzog's "After the Revolution" at the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts in 2010, he explained in a video interview that the place made him feel part of an artistic community "but also makes you feel enveloped by it in a way that supports you and elevates you."
He added, "It's like a little cushion underneath to prevent us from crashing to the earth."

Texto completo: Headnote Confirmed numbers surpass China
Scientists warned that the United States someday would become the country hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic. That moment arrived Thursday.
In the United States, at least 81,321 people are known to have been infected with the coronavirus, including more than 1,000 deaths - more cases than China, Italy or any other country has seen, according to data gathered by The New York Times.
With 330 million residents, the United States is the world's thirdmost populous nation, meaning it provides a vast pool of people who can potentially get COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.
And it is a sprawling, cacophonous democracy, where states set their own policies and President Donald Trump has sent mixed messages about the scale of the danger and how to fight it, ensuring there was no coherent, unified response to a grave public health threat.
Although the American medical system is unsurpassed and its public health system has a reputation as one of the finest in the world, a series of missteps and lost opportunities dogged the nations response.
Among them: a failure to take the pandemic seriously even as it engulfed China, a deeply flawed effort to provide broad testing for the virus that left the country blind to the extent of the crisis, and a dire shortage of masks and protective gear to protect doctors and nurses on the front lines, as well as ventilators to keep the critically ill alive.
Chinas leaders, stung by the SARS epidemic in 2003 and several bird flu scares since then, had a deeply flawed early response to the outbreak that began in the city of Wuhan, with local officials suppressing news of the outbreak.
But China's autocratic government acted with ferocious intensity after the belated start. Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan quickly began preparing for the worst.
The United States instead remained preoccupied with business as usual. Impeachment. Harvey Weinstein. Brexit and the Oscars.
Only a few virologists recognized the threat for what it was. The virus was not influenza, but it had the hallmarks of the Spanish flu: relatively low lethality, but relentlessly transmissible.
Cellphone videos leaking out of China showed what was happening as it spread in Wuhan: dead bodies on hospital floors, doctors crying in frustration, rows of unattended coffins outside the crematories.
What the cameras missed - in part because Beijing made Western journalists' lives difficult by withholding visas and imposing quarantines - was the slow, relentless way China's public health system was hunting down the virus, case by case, cluster by cluster, city by city.
For now, at least, China i containing the coronavirus with draconian measures. But the pathogen had embarked on a Grand Tour of most countries on Earth, with devastating epidemics in Iran, Italy, France. More videos emerged of prostrate victims, exhausted nurses and lines of coffins.
The United States, which should have been ready, was not.
There was no Pentagon ready to fight the war on this pandemic, no wartime draft law. There was eventually a White House Coronavirus Task Force, but it has been led by politicians, not medical experts.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is one of the great disease-detective agencies in the world, and its doctors have contributed mightily in skirmishes against Ebola, Zika and any number of other health threats.
But the agency retreated into silence, its director, Dr. Robert Redfield, almost invisible - humbled by a fiasco in the failure to produce basic diagnostic testing.
Now at least 160 million Americans have been ordered to stay home in states from California to New York. Schools are closed, often along with bars, restaurants and many other businesses. Hospitals are coping with soaring numbers of patients in NewYork City, even as supplies of essential protective gear and equipment dwindle.
Other hospitals, other communities fear what may be coming.
The world will be a different place when the pandemic is over. India may surpass the United States as the country with the most deaths. Like the United States, it, too, is a vast, democracy with deep internal divisions. But its population, 1.3 billion, is far larger, and its people are crowded even more tightly into megacities.
China could still stumble into a new round of contagion as its economy restarts, and be forced to do it all again.
In the meantime, with the virus loose in the streets while millions of Americans huddle indoors, when will it be safe to come out and go back to work?
"The virus will tell us," said Dr. William Schaffner, a preventive medicine specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical School.
When a baseline of daily testing is established across the country, a drop in the percentage of positive tests will signal that the virus has found as many hosts as it can for the moment, and is beginning to recede.
When hospital admissions have hit a clear peak and begun to plateau, "we can feel optimistic," Schaffner said. "And when they begin to drop, we can begin to smile."
That moment may arrive this summer. But as soon as the first of Americans begin venturing cautiously out, we will have to start planning for the second wave.

New York Times falsely smears DOJ religious liberty training as bigoted

Texto completo: In an article covering the recent training the Department of Justice held for its attorneys on religious liberty issues, the New York Times claimed with a blaring headline that the event spurned “concern among lawyers” because the workshops supposedly taught ways to “blunt civil rights protections for gay and transgender people.” This liberal spin on the topic chooses to paint the department as bigoted and discriminatory and overlooks the progress it's made to bolster religious liberty protections. It’s also a blatant attempt to diminish the importance of religious liberty and mislead the public.
Per usual, the newspaper embellishes its thesis with thin evidence to support it.
There are no specifics about which trainings harmed transgender rights, who thought so, why, or what purpose these trainings might have served. The “reporter” writes only that per some emails and messages she obtained, career lawyers had concerns that the DOJ “was working to further the use of religious freedom in ways that would push back efforts to protect gay and transgender people from discrimination.”
For additional proof, the New York Times report cites Vanita Gupta, former head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division under President Barack Obama and former deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union. She is a hyperpartisan source if there ever was one.
The paper does mention some other important cases the Civil Rights Division has taken on, such as tackling religious liberty violations that are inherently driven by anti-Semitism or racism. The article also acknowledges that the training sessions focused on other important religious liberty-related topics.
There has been a disturbing rise in anti-Semitism in just the last year, and the DOJ has tried to tackle it head-on. At least one training focused specifically on protecting the religious liberties of those affected by hate crimes.
The Civil Rights Division’s Criminal Section prosecutes hate crimes that are based on religion and religious practice. Right now, it is working on the prosecution of the Tree of Life synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh and the Poway synagogue shooting in California, two notorious hate crimes driven by anti-Semitism. Yet, for some reason, this apparently did not earn a mention in the New York Times article.
Another training focused on the enforcement of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act in our nation’s prisons, an overlooked segment of society. Recently, the DOJ reached an agreement resolving an investigation into the Virginia Department of Corrections to make sure men and women in custody there still retain their rights to worship and engage in religious activities, as is their constitutional right.
A senior Department of Justice official described to me in an email what the trainings were about and how important they were:
The Department of Justice routinely provides training to personnel to help them stay current on the law and to promote best practices — that’s part of what makes us the best law firm in the world. Last week, the Department offered training on religious liberty for all Department employees. This initiative was designed to improve employees’ understanding of their own free-exercise rights in the workplace; of the Department’s resources for protecting synagogues, mosques, and other places of worship around the country; and of the federal laws that protect religious exercise, including the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act. The training is the Department’s latest initiative in its ongoing campaign to bolster efforts to protect the First Amendment rights of all Americans.
Does that sound somehow bigoted and evil to you?
Religious liberty issues are foundational to our nation’s core values. They’re a source of hope and freedom in times of struggle — even a time like this, with the coronavirus crisis pushing the United States into a shutdown.
Even amid a crisis, it’s still important to remember that the DOJ has supported religious liberty for all. It has fought for religious rights to be enforced for an Islamic cemetery, fought for students not to be barred from utilizing state funds to attend private schools when no public schools are nearby, and supported an Indiana archdiocese’s First Amendment rights to fire a teacher who didn’t abide by Catholic teachings.
The DOJ is not perfect, but I’m glad to see it is prioritizing religious liberty for all Americans. This is the true meaning of the First Amendment. Freedom of religion remains vital, no matter how hard the New York Times tries to spin its stories to suggest otherwise.

New York Times op-ed blames coronavirus on conservative Christians

Texto completo: You simply knew this opinion piece was going to come out sooner or later.
The argument appeared in any Twitter thread that touched on religion and the coronavirus: Mike Pence put in charge of the coronavirus task force? He’s anti-science! Will he try to pray it away?! A Christian kindergarten teacher dies of the virus? I guess the prayers didn’t work!
It showed up in second-rate left-of-center media such as Salon.com. (“Is the Christian right now in charge of public health,” they ask, because “Redfield and Birx are both evangelical Christians”?)
Through this lens, a certain portion of the Left gets to see our current crisis in the most self-congratulatory way. Blaming anti-science evangelicals for this all satisfies the vanity and ideological appetites of a certain type of liberal.
Simply hating evangelicals isn’t good enough. No, it’s far better to look down on them as self-deluded, anti-science rubes (because certain liberals really love science) who offer up prayers instead of scientifically proven scientific solutions!
And now this trope has bubbled to the very top, to the opinion pages of the New York Times.
“The Road to Coronavirus Hell Was Paved by Evangelicals,” a New York Times article tells us in the headline.
The piece is by Katherine Stewart, an author whose recent book fits in a broad category of paranoid literature that is basically the Left's version of the “Sharia law is coming” conspiracy theory. Hers is about the 1000th book in the past 20 years to warn that America is about to become a theocracy.
“Trump’s response to the pandemic has been haunted by the science denialism of his ultraconservative religious allies,” the subheadline reads.
“Science Denialism!”
“Ultraconservative religious!”
Perfect catchphrases!
But the giveaway is the weasel phrase there: “haunted by.” She's trying to imply causality that she knows she cannot assert.
She’s trying to imply that evangelical conservatives caused this plague, even though it began in Wuhan, China, where less than 3 percent of the country is Christian.
Globally, the greatest concentrations of the virus are in Northern Italy and in Spain, which are not hubs of conservative evangelicalism. In the United States, the hubs are New York City and New Orleans — also not packed to the gills with white, conservative evangelicals.
So, how does this author pin this plague on the specific set of believers she wants to demonize?
By asserting the broad prejudices of her intended audience:
“Donald Trump rose to power with the determined assistance of a movement that denies science, bashes government and prioritized loyalty over professional expertise. In the current crisis, we are all reaping what that movement has sown.”
She then absurdly pins slavery on American Christianity. Then, she accuses Christians of denying critical thinking. She then cites two evangelical leaders who spoke about having services despite the outbreak (at least one immediately decided to cancel services).
She also points out that Secretary of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar is a pro-life Christian. She points to no actions by Azar that caused the coronavirus, much less a nexus with Christianity. She levels basically the same attack against Ben Carson, secretary of housing and urban development.
A great tell is this sentence:
"By all accounts, President Trump’s tendency to trust his gut over the experts on issues like vaccines and climate change does not come from any deep-seated religious conviction."
Yes. Right there we have an explanation for the shortcomings of Trump's handling of this outbreak. It's simple. It comports with everything we know about Trump — he is not deeply religious, he does not deeply consider hard evidence, he does trust his gut.
Yet that obvious and simple story isn't so satisfying because it doesn't denigrate religious people. Ms. Stewart somehow says that this example of Trump being Trump is actually a product of anti-science Bible thumpers.
You won't be surprised to learn that this is among the New York Times articles most emailed today and most shared on Facebook.

Farhad Manjoo: How the world’s richest country ran out of facemasks

Texto completo: Why is the United States running out of face masks for medical workers? How does the world’s wealthiest country find itself in such a tragic and avoidable mess? And how long will it take to get enough protective gear, if that’s even possible now?
I’ve spent the last few days digging into these questions, because the shortages of protective gear, particularly face masks, has struck me as one of the more disturbing absurdities in America’s response to this pandemic.
Yes, it would have been nice to have had early, widespread testing for the coronavirus, the strategy South Korea used to contain its outbreak. It would be amazing if we can avoid running out of ventilators and hospital space, the catastrophe that has befallen parts of Italy. But neither matters much — in fact, no significant intervention is possible — if health care workers cannot even come into contact with coronavirus patients without getting sick themselves.
That’s where cheap, disposable face masks, eye protection, gloves and gowns come in. That we failed to procure enough safety gear for medical workers — not to mention for sick people and for the public, as some health experts might have recommended if masks were not in such low supply — seems astoundingly negligent.
What a small, shameful way for a strong nation to falter: For want of a 75-cent face mask, the kingdom was lost.
I am sorry to say that digging into the mask shortage does little to assuage one’s sense of outrage. The answer to why we’re running out of protective gear involves a very American set of capitalist pathologies — the rise and inevitable lure of low-cost overseas manufacturing, and a strategic failure, at the national level and in the health care industry, to consider seriously the cascading vulnerabilities that flowed from the incentives to reduce costs.
Perhaps the only way to address the shortfall now is to recognize that the market is broken, and to have the government step in to immediately spur global and domestic production. President Donald Trump, bizarrely, has so far resisted ordering companies to produce more supplies and equipment. In the case of masks, manufacturers say they are moving mountains to ramp up production, and some large companies are donating millions of masks from their own reserves.
But given the vast global need for masks — in the United States alone, fighting the coronavirus will consume 3.5 billion face masks, according to an estimate by the Department of Health and Human Services — corporate generosity will fall short. People in the mask business say it will take a few months, at a minimum, to significantly expand production.
“We are at full capacity today, and increased production by building another factory or extending further will take anywhere between three to four months,” said Guillaume Laverdure, the chief operating officer of Medicom, a Canadian company that makes masks and other protective equipment in factories around the world.
And though some nontraditional manufacturers like T-shirt factories and other apparel-makers have announced plans to rush-produce masks, it’s unclear that they will be able to meet required safety standards or shift over production in time to answer demand.
Few in the protective equipment industry are surprised by the shortages, because they’ve been predicted for years. In 2005, the George W. Bush administration called for the coordination of domestic production and stockpiling of protective gear in preparation for pandemic influenza. In 2006, Congress approved funds to add protective gear to a national strategic stockpile — among other things, the stockpile collected 52 million surgical face masks and 104 million N95 respirator masks.
But about 100 million masks in the stockpile were deployed in 2009 in the fight against the H1N1 flu pandemic and the government never bothered to replace them. This month, Alex Azar, secretary of health and human services, testified that there are only about 40 million masks in the stockpile — around 1% of the projected national need.
As the coronavirus began to spread in China early this year, a global shortage of protective equipment began to look inevitable. But by then it was too late for the U.S. government to do much about the problem. Two decades ago, most hospital protective gear was made domestically. But like much of the rest of the apparel and consumer products business, face mask manufacturing has since shifted nearly entirely overseas. “China is a producer of 80% of masks worldwide,” Laverdure said.
Hospitals began to run out of masks for the same reason that supermarkets ran out of toilet paper — because their “just-in-time” supply chains, which call for holding as little inventory as possible to meet demand, are built to optimize efficiency, not resiliency.
“You’re talking about a commodity item,” said Michael J. Alkire, president of Premier, a company that purchases medical supplies for hospitals and health systems. In the supply chain, he said, “by definition, there’s not going to be a lot of redundancy, because everyone wants the low cost.”
In January, the brittle supply chain began to crack under pressure. To deal with its own outbreak, China began to restrict exports of protective equipment. Then other countries did as well — Taiwan, Germany, France and India took steps to stop exports of medical equipment. That left American hospitals to seek more and more masks from fewer and fewer producers.
People in the industry assured me they would prepare better next time. “We are laserlike focused to ensure that our health care systems are never in this scenario again,” Alkire told me. “There will be a lot more domestic manufacturing of these products going forward.”
I don’t doubt it — but that we did not plan, as a nation, for this entirely predictable shortage makes me wonder what other inevitable pothole is lurking out there for all to trip over. Getting enough protective gear was among the cheapest, most effective things we could have done to slow down the pandemic. That we failed on such an obvious thing reveals an alarming national incapacity to imagine and prepare for the worst.
We will get enough masks in time for the next disaster. But wouldn’t it be nice, for once, if we prepared for trouble before it hit us in the face?

Texto completo: You relish the little things here in Seattle: Toilet paper is back on some shelves, the hoarders sated for the moment. Instead of making vodka, distilleries are rolling out hand sanitizer. The dreaded daily number of new coronavirus cases shows that while the curve is not yet flat, the rate has gone both down and up on different days this week, carrying our hopes on the bumpy ride.
As for the tally of the dead: Instead of doubling every five days in Washington state, as it was just two weeks ago, now it doubles roughly every nine — a horrific number still, but that movement is in the right direction.
We are not necessarily your city’s future, but a likely version of your future if you do the right thing. Washington state had the first known case of COVID-19 in the United States, on Jan. 19; the known first death, more than a month after that, and the first full-blown outbreak. We’re well ahead of the rest of the nation in our cycle of denial, panic, action.
Social distancing started early. Testing has been broad, although more help from the federal government is needed. A communal fight or flight instinct has moved into something more settled. Even as the president floats an idea that could sacrifice the elderly to keep Wall Street happy, we take care of our own. We will not throw Grandma from the train.
“There really is no middle ground,” said Bill Gates, whose foundation has put up $100 million to blunt the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. “It’s very tough to say to people, ‘Hey, keep going to restaurants, go buy new houses, ignore that pile of bodies in the corner.’ ”
About those bodies: it’s the suddenness that gets to you. I remember talking to people who’d lived through the Dust Bowl, for a book whose title, “The Worst Hard Time,” may not hold up. What they remembered was how swiftly death took a loved one.
And now, a parent you thought might live another 10 years may not make it another 10 days.
My neighborhood grocer, Steve Shulman, was giving wine tips and turning out fresh-made sausage one day, and now he’s gone — dead at 67 from the coronavirus. I lost another friend, Peter Jackson, a writer, a fierce defender of the natural world, and son of former Sen. Henry M. Jackson, to pancreatic cancer in the same time.
Peter was 53. His loss is compounded by our inability to mourn him in a group setting. We need to touch, to hug, to come together, but with one-third of humanity under lockdown, intimacy outside of our domestic unit is not an option.
People say this is our World War II, our Great Depression, our London under the Nazi blitz. It’s none of those, for this misery may be without an apt historical match. There’s plenty of food. And more than 99% of the population is free of the virus, for now. But if just 1% were to die because we let our guard down, the United States would lose more than 3 million people.
President Donald Trump’s talk of opening the United States for business by Easter is greeted in this precinct of sanity as the heartless bluster of a career con man. The public radio station in Seattle, KUOW, has stopped airing Trump’s live briefings because the volume of misinformation he puts out cannot be corrected in real time.
In the states that have been hardest hit — New York, New Jersey, Washington, California — we’re lucky to have leaders trying to translate science into action.
Last week, researchers in Seattle gave the first shot to a person in a test of an experimental coronavirus vaccine. And Gov. Jay Inslee has warned that a mandatory stay-at-home order — halting all but essential business — may be extended well past April 6.
There is “some hopeful news,” Inslee said Thursday, pointing to the slowing rate of new cases in Washington for several days this week. Still, he stressed, “We cannot let up on this virus.” He has deployed the full tool kit for success: vigilance, massive testing, rapid response, forced isolation: “We’ve got to pound it and pound it till it’s done.”
We could use some help from a certain billionaire who made his pile in our city, Jeff Bezos. His cranes are frozen in place in downtown Seattle, the empire on hold. His employees are at risk, some getting sick at his warehouses. And the world’s richest man had the gall to ask the public to donate to a relief fund for his contract employees. After an uproar, the company changed the language on public donations.
When everything is settled, Amazon’s reach into everyday lives will be deeper and more institutionalized than ever. But if Bezos wants to be remembered as something other than a monopolist who took advantage of a pandemic, he could throw some billions in the right direction — now.
For the rest of us, the change has been startling. You realize that we’re remarkably adaptable. You learn to cut hair. You tell people you love them, or risk forever holding your peace. You relish quarantinis at Zoom happy hours. You keep telling yourself that every tickle of the throat is not … it.

Texto completo: Obsessed with the news, people? Perfectly reasonable, given our terrible health crisis. Still, it may be possible to go overboard. For instance, nobody really needed to be counting the number of times coronavirus czar Mike Pence dropped the name of his boss the president during that town hall meeting on Fox News.
OK, it was 45. But you’re going off the edge if you also counted Donald Trump saying “I” 149 times.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, a member of the Coronavirus Task Force we’ve gotten to know awfully well lately, had everybody wondering when he briefly disappeared from the White House press conferences. His absence occurred shortly after …
A) He told an interviewer he’d learned a lot listening to Donald Trump’s theories on hydroxychloroquine.
B) He told an interviewer that when Trump starts playing medical expert, “I can’t jump in front of the microphone and push him down.”
C) He signed a very lucrative contract to be a Lipitor TV spokesman.
Yes! It’s B. Dr. Deborah Birx stepped in for Fauci briefly, repeatedly responding to queries with, “That’s a great question!” Birx never challenged the president’s scientific expertise, but some people did notice that when he began talking about medical issues, her eyes blinked rapid-fire.
Anyhow, if you got that right, you get an A for achievement. Or at least Aching Desire For Distraction. Let’s see what else you’ve picked up with a quick quiz:
1. At one of his press conferences, Trump did admit there were indications in advance that a pandemic was coming. When asked why the United States wasn’t better prepared, he said: “The only thing we weren’t prepared for was …
A) The fact that it would make people sick.”
B) The fact that it’s catching.”
C) The media.”
2. After observing Trump’s handling of the coronavirus crisis, Hillary Clinton tweeted …
A) “I guess it’s possible to be germaphobic without getting rid of any germs.”
B) “Frightened? Blame the Electoral College.”
C) “Please do not take medical advice from a man who looked directly at a solar eclipse.”
3. Come Easter, Trump says he wants to see …
A) Kids hunting for eggs wrapped in face masks.
B) “Packed” churches.
C) Coronavirus Cottontail.
4. When Trump learned that Mitt Romney had self-quarantined after possible exposure to the virus, the president seemed sort of, um, amused. That drew a certain amount of criticism — especially since Romney’s wife has a preexisting condition. When the senator’s result came back negative, Trump tweeted …
A) “This is really great news! I am so happy I can barely speak.”
B) “God is still going to punish him for that impeachment vote.”
C) “Romney should have used a new test I’ve discovered which is based on grapefruit and panda blood.”
5. Discussing the congressional stimulus bill, Trump tried to clarify his position on stock buybacks, explaining …
A) “When stock rises, sadness falls.”
B) “I don’t actually know — damn it, I’ve got a virus to worry about.”
C) “Maybe I view that as a little bit differently than somebody that didn’t and somebody that built plants all over the United States — of which there were plenty of them, too.”
6. One Cabinet official on prominent display at the coronavirus press conferences has been Ben Carson. The secretary of housing and urban development didn’t necessarily inspire conference when he …
A) Suggested curing the virus “is a job for us brain surgeons.”
B) Occasionally appeared to be falling asleep.
C) Recommended that Americans who are nervous “might find this is a good time to relax on a cruise.”
7. Meanwhile in Texas, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said that in order to jump-start the economy, older people like himself should be willing to …
A) Go Christmas shopping very, very early.
B) Volunteer to bring meals to the needy.
C) Die.
8. Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt has deleted a tweet he posted recently, when the state was announcing its eighth coronavirus case …
A) “If I ever have to choose between Dr. Fauci and Donald Trump, I’m going with the guy with the medical degree.”
B) “Hey, did anybody hear anything about grapefruit and panda blood?”
C) “Eating with my kids and all my fellow Oklahomans at the @CollectiveOKC. It’s packed tonight!”
9. Brady Sluder, 22, became briefly famous for telling a TV reporter he wouldn’t let self-distancing get between him and a good time on spring break. (“If I get corona, I get corona. At the end of the day, I’m not gonna let it stop me from partying.”)
Now Sluder has recanted, saying he will use the experience …
A) “As motivation to become a better person.”
B) “As a warning I will share with every single girl I meet at the bar tonight.”
C) “In my new job as a consultant to Jared Kushner.”
10. The president still has media favorites he’s paying attention to. Just the other day he told a press conference he’d heard “one of the networks” reporting that no other president had ever been able to …
A) “Look straight into a solar eclipse without sunglasses.”
B) “Do what I’ve done in slashing all of the red tape and everything.”
C) “Scare so many people without using any weapons.”
ANSWERS: 1-C; 2-C; 3-B; 4-A; 5-C; 6-B; 7-C; 8-C; 9-A; 10-B.

Paul Krugman: On coronavirus, America is No. 1

Texto completo: It’s hard to believe, but just a month ago Donald Trump and his henchmen were dismissing the coronavirus as a nonevent. On Feb. 26, Trump declared that “You have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be close to zero.” His remark came a day after Larry Kudlow, his administration’s chief economist, declared that the virus was almost completely contained, and that the economy was “holding up nicely.”
There are now more than 82,000 cases in the U.S. — we don’t know how many more, because we’re still lagging far behind on testing. And the U.S. trajectory is worse than that in other countries, so that we’ll be the world’s coronavirus epicenter in a matter of days, if we aren’t already.
As for the economy: Last week more than 3 million workers filed for unemployment insurance, a number that is completely off the scale even as many others who are suddenly out of work aren’t eligible for unemployment benefits. We’re clearly losing jobs even faster than at the worst moments of the 2008-09 financial crisis, when we were losing “only” 800,000 per month.
Trump’s dismissal and denial played a large role in getting us to this point. And he should be held accountable. But the crucial question now is whether we’re doing enough to cope with the catastrophe.
And the answer is no. We’re doing some of what we should be doing, mainly thanks to the efforts of Democratic governors and Democratic members of Congress — a statement that may sound partisan, but is the simple truth. But we’re still falling down on crucial fronts, mainly because even now Trump and his party aren’t taking the threat seriously.
What should we be doing? Three main things.
First, we need an all-out push to get essential medical equipment to where it’s needed. This means everything from face masks and other personal protective equipment for health care workers to ventilators for critical patients. It also, of course, means a vast expansion of testing.
The multiple weeks we wasted thanks to Trump’s virus denial have put us far behind the curve, and thousands of Americans will die unnecessarily as a result. But a full-court press could still make a huge difference.
Unfortunately, that’s still not happening. Trump has the power to mobilize industry to produce crucial equipment, but he has refused to use that power, airily declaring that “we’re not a shipping clerk.”
Actually, we don’t want him to be a shipping clerk. We want him to be a traffic cop, directing resources to where they’re needed most — a role the federal government has always played in wartime, which the current crisis most resembles.
But he won’t take responsibility, so we’re now seeing a chaotic scramble that will surely kill thousands more.
Second, we need to slow the virus’s spread, by reducing personal contacts that might lead to new infections — “social distancing.” The good news is that a number of states have taken strong action, closing nonessential businesses, banning almost all gatherings and issuing shelter-in-place orders to stop people from going out. And early indications are that these actions are working.
The bad news is that Trump is calling for the United States to “reopen” by Easter, a move nearly all public health experts believe would be catastrophic. Clearly he still doesn’t take the pandemic seriously. And some Republican governors share his fecklessness. For example, Ron DeSantis, Florida’s governor, is still refusing to close the state’s beaches.
So crucial measures to slow the pandemic’s spread are partial, and the president is offering the opposite of leadership. But much of the country is doing the right thing despite Trump.
Which brings me to the third thing we need to do: Provide financial aid to families and businesses in the face of an unavoidable economic contraction. What we’re seeing in those surging unemployment claims isn’t a conventional recession; it’s more like a medically induced coma, done for the patient’s own good — which is why Trump’s desire to get people back to work is lethally misguided. But people need to eat even while they can’t work.
So two cheers for the $2 trillion legislation the Senate just passed. People keep calling it a “stimulus” bill, but that’s not what it really is. Instead, it’s mainly disaster relief: checks to families, enhanced unemployment benefits, aid to hospitals and hard-pressed states, and loans to help small businesses survive.
It’s a highly imperfect bill, with plenty of potential for abuse by special interests. But it’s infinitely better than the ideas Trump and other Republicans were floating just a few days ago, mainly because Democrats insisted that the legislation actually help people in need.
What the bill won’t do, however, is prevent a huge death toll if, as seems all too likely, the rapid spread of the coronavirus overwhelms hospitals that still aren’t getting the equipment they need. And the tragedy is that many of those deaths will be the direct result of bad leadership — Trump’s disdain for expertise and refusal to take the threat seriously, a refusal that continues to cripple our response even now.

STAY IN AND READ

Texto completo: The albatross hanging from every arts reporter' neck is the stack of untouched books sitting on their desk, on a shelf, or shamefully hidden away in the closet farthest from them. Sent in from authors, agents and publishers it is the combined weight of all these unwritten about books that (I assume) will one day drag my soul to the depth of the River Styx.
I'm not saying it's a silver lining, far from it, but with the coronavirus forcing most events to shut down or cancel, we have a lot more time on our hands for literary pursuits. With no upcoming festivals or performances to profile, now is the perfect time to let readers know what is on the reading agenda for the next week, or month or longer interval before society as we know it returns to some semblance of normalcy.
Some of these books I've read most or all of, others I haven't read at all.
'All the Flowers in Paris' by Sarah Jio Genre: Fiction. Length: ~ 300 pages. A novel that switches between a pair of perspectives, one of which is Caroline, who wakes up with no memory in a Paris hospital in 2009. The other is Celine, a woman in Nazi-occupied Paris in 1943. The story follows both women as they try to make sense of their respective situations: Caroline who gradually pieces together who she is and Celine who needs to try to
Not necessarily the kind of book I myself would be on the edge of my seat to read, but I can think of a half dozen friends I'd recommend this to by description alone. Plus, an aspect of Caroline's character is discovering she's had a "reclusive life in a sprawling apartment on the rue Cler," which — at this moment —sounds like the exact situation I'd like to be living in (at least for the next few weeks).
'An American Bum in China' by Tom Carter Genre: Biography. Length: ~125 pages. A brief biography following five years with Muscatine native Matthew Evans as he finds himself in China in 2014 as the Hong Kong protests were just beginning. Evans' tale is told by Tom Carter who previously published "Unsavory Elements: Stories of Foreigners on the Loose in China."
'Bedlam' by Kenneth Paul Rosenberg, MD Genre: Nonfiction. Length: ~200 pages. The full title of the text is "Bedlam: An Intimate Journey Into America's Mental Health Crisis." Rosenberg's book is intended to give readers an inside look at the American mental health system and its failings. After seven years of interviews, the book uses those accounts to shine a light on the criminalization of individuals with mental health issues among other topics.
This book and the author behind it are the exact kinds of things I love to cover. The only reason why it's not pending on my personal reading list is I'm not sure I have the emotional fortitude to read about institutional, systemic failure, especially at this particular moment.
'Bloody Genius' by John Sanford Genre: Mystery. Length: ~375 pages. This is the most recent Virgil Flowers novel from New York Times bestselling author John Sanford, marking the 12th novel in a series that started in 2007 with "Dark of the Moon." In this particular book, a culture war on a state campus between the science and medical departments is interrupted when a scholar turns up dead. Enter the series investigator Virgil Flowers, tasked with finding the killer.
'Deacon King Kong' by James McBride Genre: Historical Fiction. Length: ~375 pages. Set in September of 1969, "Deacon King Kong" starts with the deacon of Five Ends Baptist Church shooting a 19-year-old-drug dealer in the face in South Brooklyn. The release that came with the book touts it as being infused with "humor and compassion" as it explores the lives of the fictional characters around this incident.
I've had a copy of this book so long and I've wanted to read it so bad! I'm positive I'll get around to this once I work through my personal pending backlog of unread books, but like Entertainment Weekly and The New York Times, this book is high on my to-read list and can make it to yours too since it was released on March 3.
'The Dearly Beloved' by Cara Wall Genre: Fiction. Length: ~350 pages. The story of this novel spent 15 years coming into focus for its author, Iowa Writers' Workshop graduate Cara Wall, who first conceived of the novel during her 2004 pregnancy. The book focuses on a pair of couples, each of which includes an individual drawn to the Christian faith and another who is skeptical of it.
Though outside my general area of interest, it's one I feel strangely drawn to and would like to pick up and finish someday.
'Everywhere You Don't Belong' by Gabriel Bump Genre: Fiction. Length: ~250 pages. This is the first novel from the Chicago originating author Gabriel Bump, an experience explored in this novel through the character of Claude McKay, a young black man growing up on the South Side.
This is another book on my personal reading list and comes recommended by numerous other publications.
'The Mountains Sing' by Nguyen Phan Que Mail Genre: Historical Fiction. Length: ~350 pages. The 11th book from Nguyen Phan Que Mai, "The Mountains Sing" follow the Tran family as they navigate their way through a Vietnam wrapped in War. The most recent addition to my ever-growing work shelf of unread books, "The Mountains Sing" will have been published just before this article runs. I have never read this book, but, for what it's worth, it comes with my highest recommendation.
'One Night At the Lake' by Bethany Chase Genre: Fiction. Length: ~275 pages. The jacket description of this book pitches two straight forward premises. The first: Leah has been dating Ollie for four years and, upon being invited to his family's lake house, she suspects he's going to propose. The second: June is visiting her fiance's Ollie's lake house, "a house haunted by long-buried memories of her lost friend" Leah.
It's not usually the kind of thing I'd go for, but if the description appeals to you, it strikes me as the kind of book that would be a pleasant distraction during turbulent times.
'Pitty the Reader' by Kurt Vonnegut and Suzanne McConnel Genre: Nonfiction. Length: ~375 pages. Half of this book's authorship is renowned author Kurt Vonnegut, the other half is Suzanne McConnell who was a student of Vonnegut's at the Iowa Writers' Workshop. The latter has collected everything she can about what Vonnegut as a teacher regarding the craft of writing.
I seem to have a problem with not reading books by Kurt Vonnegut. I've been told I'd love "Slaughterhouse-Five," which has nonetheless been gathering dust on my personal shelf for ages. Of all the books on my P-C shelf though, this is maybe the one I was most hoping to read most of all, and was only reminded of as I started to put together this list.
'Surfside Sisters' by Nancy Thayer Genre: Fiction. Length: ~300 pages. Protagonist Keely Green grew up in Nantucket with her best friend, Isabelle, with dreams of becoming a novelist. Years later she's achieved those dreams and is living the glamorous big city life of a successful New York novelist. Her dream life is interrupted by the one-two punch of her editor passing on her novel and her mom's health declining, forcing her to return to Nantucket to things she thought she'd put behind her.

Texto completo: I cover a wide range of topics in Rearview Mirror: people, places, organizations, sports, the military, schools and even food. But I never thought I’d write a column on toilet paper!
However, these are difficult times, and in difficult times, islanders flock to the markets and buy up all the TP they can find.
It makes no sense on a practical level. Matson and Pasha are not going to stop coming, and the stores will stay open.
But on a psychological or historical level, it makes perfect sense. Dock strikes in the 1940s and 1970s have cut us off from mainland sources of that soft, powder room paper our okole crave.
When I was going to the University of Hawaii in the early 1970s, my housemates reminded me to secure my own supply and that if I ran out, I couldn’t count on them!
Between 1946 and 1952 four major maritime union strikes closed West Coast and Hawaii ports for 390 days.
As Matson moved to containerizing ocean cargo in 1969, a 35-day strike by the Marine Firemen’s Union took place. The International Longshore and Warehouse Union launched strikes in 1971 and 1972 that lasted 135 days.
Toilet paper, rice, salt and many other basics were hard to come by. Just the possibility of a strike sent islanders to the stores, leaving shelves empty.
In 1974 one retailer was overstocked in toilet paper. In a reverse psychology move, it announced it was limiting sales to one package per customer. There was plenty of TP all over town, but this one store created a panic and sold four containers of it in five days, at full price.
Jim Kelly told me his daughter, a teacher at Waiakea High in Hilo, found a 1971 article about the toilet paper crisis in Hawaii that ran in The New York Times!
“As I recall,” Kelly said, “a radio station dispatched a Rolls-Royce, complete with then Waikiki star John Rowles, to deliver necessary toilet paper rolls to some lucky listener.”
New Zealand entertainer John Rowles (“Cheryl Moana Marie”) did in fact deliver rolls of TP to contest winners in his Rolls-Royce.
Rowles delivers rolls in his Rolls. Got that?
Steve Miura said that during the 1971 ILWU strike, which lasted from July 1 to Oct. 6, K-POI radio held a popular “roll-a-thon” contest.
“Every time that they played the song ‘Roll On’ by the New Colony Six, the first caller to get through on the contest telephone line would win a roll of toilet paper.
“In his book, ‘Showman of the Pacific,’ Tom Moffatt said that one day a Cadillac drove up to K-POI. The chauffeur got out of the car and went into the station office to pick up the free roll of toilet paper that his Kahala boss had won in the radio contest.”
HYGIENIC STORE
The New York Times article had a few other interesting TP tidbits. It said, “When Mr. and Mrs. Lenn Curley of San Francisco (she’s the former Marcella Gump of the retail chain Gumps) recently purchased an apartment in Waikiki, Kinau Wilder, who comes from a family of missionaries, dropped in for a visit.
“Her housewarming present consisted of two rolls of tissue and a six-pack of Morton’s tiny salt shakers.”
Cynthia Eyre said she was out in the country looking for papayas, which also had vanished from Honolulu shelves because of a drought, and stopped at the Hygienic Store in Kahaluu. There on the shelves were rows and rows of toilet tissue in pink, green, yellow, blue and white.
Eyre forgot all about the papayas and asked the storekeeper, “Would you consider me piggish if I bought six rolls?”
“Oh, no — help yourself,” the saleswoman, seemingly unaware of the shortage that had hit the islands, told her. So Eyre selected six white rolls.
“White, eh?” said the woman as she rang up the sale. “You must be one of those ecology types!”
Edwyna Fong Spiegel recalled, “At a TransAmerica staff party during the Matson strike, I won a case of toilet paper! I thought it was marvelous!”
Ken Takeya was a manager at Beretania Foodland. During the dock strike he got a call from the mayor. “Hello, Mayor Fasi,” Takeya said.
“Frank,” the voice on the line insisted he be called.
“What can I do for you, Frank?” Takeya asked.
“I need a case of toilet paper and three bags of rice,” he said.
“OK. Come by at midnight,” Takeya instructed. Like two spies meeting in the dark, he showed up, paid and loaded it in his car.
“Is there anything I can do for you?” he asked.
Takeya mentioned he had a problem with a road behind the store that was not technically city property and was not maintained by it. It had potholes and hindered customers and deliveries.
Fasi said he’d look into it, and within two days it was paved.
PAPER CAPER
“Way back in my childhood we had a Matson shipping strike, and the shortage of everything everywhere was a big problem,” Kimo Sutton told me.
“Ike, my pop (former state legislator), had a small 10-unit hotel on Saratoga Road (which is now the Trump hotel), and the rooms used about one roll a day. Despite being the wise operator, he could not keep up with demand, but nearby big hotels could.
“The Edgewater, a Kelley hotel, had lots, and public restrooms,” Sutton continued. “I was sent over and collected three rolls a day for several days from the men’s room until security was stationed there.
“I switched to the ladies’ room and had no problem escaping with even more TP! It just was a time when we got desperate and other sources had dried up.
“Thinking back, the Kelleys could have stopped the pilfering but probably knew that they were helping the industry, and we were not selling it on the black market.”
TP ISSUE POINT
Territorial Tavern owner Bob Hampton was on the other end of that equation.
“In the early 1970s Honolulu had a toilet paper shortage. It was so bad that local folks were taking TP from restaurants, hotels and other public luas.
“In order to provide TP for our wahine and kane luas in the Territorial Tavern downtown, we had to take all TP out of the luas and only issue a maximum of six sheets to customers before they entered. The cashier at the bar was the TP Issue Point,” Hampton says.
“We called the cashier the ‘kukae manager.’ It seems the role of kukae manager lasted for a few months before the supply increased in the stores.”
And now the TP panic has spread to the mainland, and some of their shelves are running low. Hopefully, this crisis will be over soon.
I have every reason to think we will have electricity and water during this pandemic. Stores will stay open and have food on their shelves. Panic buying is not necessary.
So please, leave some TP for the rest of us. You don’t need two years’ supply. One year is enough! (I’m joking!)

Texto completo: A popular technology company that has helped launch thousands of online retail sites has become a favorite tool for fly-by-night businesses looking to cash in on the coronavirus pandemic.
New e-commerce sites that use the company's services are filled with wildly exaggerated claims about virus-fighting products that may not even exist.
The New York Times analyzed registrations with the company, Shopify, which allows just about anyone with an email address and a credit card to create retail websites in short order. The company, which in the past helped build such successful e-commerce sites as Kylie Cosmetics, the $1.2 billion beauty brand founded by Kylie Jenner, has registered nearly 500 new sites over the past two months with names that include "corona" or "covid," The Times found. Untold others have been started using other names.
One of the new sites marketed an "oxygen concentration" machine for $3,080. Another had the "Corona Necklace Air Purifier," which for $59 claimed to provide "All Day Protection." A third offered a $299 pill that promised "Anti-Viral Protection" for 30 days. And sites such as CoronavirusGetHelp.com and test-for-covid19.com marketed home test kits for $29.99 to $79, none of which have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
Many of the sellers do not actually possess the goods, nor have they verified that the products are legitimate. Often, the sites' operators are middlemen who fulfill customers' orders by buying items on other websites -- a kind of digital arbitrage known as "drop-shipping." Shopify is attractive to these new businesses because its software can integrate the sites with the distant vendors, mostly in China.
Amy Hufft, a Shopify spokeswoman, said the company last week closed more than 4,500 sites related to the virus. She said sites that did not back up the medical claims they made were suspended from the platform. By Monday, nearly all the sites identified by The Times had been removed.
"Our teams continue to actively review COVID-19 related products and businesses, and stores that violate our policies will be immediately taken down," she said in an email.
Gibril Bachouchi, a 20-year-old Canadian engineering student in Algiers, told the Times in a video call how he started his Shopify site, killcoronavirus19.com.
Bachouchi said he created the store to raise money for a hospital where his aunt works as a doctor, after hearing it was short on face masks and other equipment. His site advertised the $3,080 oxygen machine last week, and a COVID-19 testing kit for $30.40, among other products.
"I was just like, 'I'm a 20-year-old kid -- what can I do to help a bit?' " Bachouchi said.
Bachouchi said he used Shopify's algorithm to set competitive prices and choose a markup. As of last week, he had made no sales.
"Shopify pushes you to spend as much as you can on marketing," Bachouchi said. "I just don't have the money."
Though Shopify has been policing the new sites, it also encourages its customers to go into the drop-shipping business. It offers a guide for starting such a business and makes money from them by charging a monthly fee and a percentage of sales. The Canadian company is one of the largest turnkey e-commerce sites in the world, bringing in $1.5 billion last year.

COVID-19 trial drugs supplies tighten

Texto completo: If Randy McDonough filled the new prescriptions he's getting for hydroxychloroquine, the Iowa City pharmacist wouldn't be able to take care of chronically ill customers he's had for years who need the drug for rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.
As it is, McDonough will run out of his supply of the medication at Towncrest Pharmacy in just a couple months if wholesalers can't deliver more. So he and his staff have decided Towncrest will not fill new prescriptions for the drug for those who want it in connection with COVID-19 — at least until they are assured more will be available.
Like shoppers clamoring to find toilet paper, some doctors and hospitals around the country have been pre-emptively prescribing and stockpiling hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, two medications being used in trials in fighting COVID-19, for those who might need them.
Demand for the drugs rose after President Donald Trump touted them repeatedly on Twitter and in televised briefings as "game-changing" treatments in the war against the coronavirus and the disease it causes.
Though experts say that, contrary to Trump's statements, the drugs have not been proven effective yet, The New York Times, ProPublica and other news organizations have interviewed pharmacists who said some doctors were hoarding the medications for themselves and their families.
"We are starting to see prescriptions written to have on hand just in case," McDonough said. "But until we can verify we can get more access to it ... we are not going to be dispensing it even for a COVID-19 diagnosis."
Earlier this month, the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy and the American Medical Association pushed state boards and associations to get involved in trying to curb inappropriate prescribing. Iowa's Board of Pharmacy encouraged pharmacies to develop their own policies in response.
On Thursday, the American Medical Association, American Pharmacists Association and American Society of Health-System Pharmacists issued a joint statement against stockpiling, saying it could have grave consequences for patients.
Later in the day, the Iowa Boards of Medicine, Nursing, Physician Assistants, Dentistry and Pharmacy acknowledged increased reports of prescriptions being issued for hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and the antibiotic azithromycin
The groups issued guidance for prescribers and pharmacies to protect the public, saying they should refrain from using the drugs for "prophylactic reasons."
"Prescribing hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and azithromycin for yourself, family, friends and co-workers in anticipation of a COVID-19 related illness can significantly impact drug supplies, which may negatively impact the health of existing patients," the statement said.
Physicians were told to include the diagnosis code or diagnosis with prescriptions issued and limit the amounts.
Pharmacists were told to use their professional judgment and take appropriate steps to verify that new prescriptions were for a legitimate medical purpose.
"While all Boards are recommending caution, licensees should avoid interruptions in care for patients previously established on these medications that have an appropriate diagnosis," the statement said.
The boards stopped short of issuing emergency rules, other states have done.
Lindsey Ludwig, who heads the 114-member Community Pharmacy Enhanced Service Network in Iowa, whose members strive for a mix of best practices in the field, said she hasn't heard any evidence of hoarding by doctors in Iowa, but there may be physicians experimenting with the drugs to treat the virus.
"Most of them are trying to use these medications for a legitimate reason," she said. "But overwhelmingly, there is not a large supply, so pharmacists are conserving it for current patients, then considering it for those being treated for COVID-19."
At Bedford Drug in Bedford, which serves more than 1,000 patients in southern Iowa, pharmacist Mike Schweitzer said hydroxychloroquine is one of many things in short supply since the pandemic hit the state.
"I have a little bit — maybe enough to keep patients going for 30 days," he said.
Schweitzer said the pharmacy is out of, or nearly out of, isopropyl alcohol, masks, protective gloves, hand sanitzer, disinfecting wipes, thermometers and aloe vera.
He said the county's emergency management team has been told it won't be able to get new supplies from government sources because it is "so low on the totem pole," so those items will have to found online or through wholesalers, if at all.
Schweitzer, like many pharmacists, has been discouraging customers from ordering 90-day supplies of some medications because they get depleted faster than others as residents have hunkered down.
"But hydroxychloroquine was in short supply before the pandemic," he said. "We'd had difficulty ordering it for the past year, maybe longer."
Fortunately, he said, his county has not had any diagnoses of the coronavirus, so new prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine have not been on the rise.
He said new prescriptions for use of the drug in connection with COVID-19 would call for a higher dosage, so they would "stick out like a sore thumb."
Seeking more action Some pharmacists have wanted the board or Gov. Reynolds to go further and issue emergency restrictions to ensure the drugs are used appropriately.
"As more patients are diagnosed, they are going to need those drugs," said Kate Gainer, chief executive officer of the Iowa Pharmacy Association.
Pharmacists say few doctors prescribed chloroquine, used to treat malaria since the 1930s, before the pandemic because it has harsh side effects. Hydroxychloroquine, which came later, is widely used for malaria, arthritis, lupus and several other illnesses.
McDonough said he doesn't know if physicians around the state realize how low existing supplies of hydroxychloroquine are.
"I don't think they are doing it maliciously," he said. "Heck yes, I want to provide it ... but when you've got a shortage, you've got to make some hard decisions."
No drugs have been approved in the United States for the treatment of the coronavirus, but hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are being used in clinical trials in New York, site of roughly half of all U.S. coronavirus cases.
This week, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced the procurement of 70,000 doses of hydroxychloroquine and 750,000 doses of chloroquine for trials.
Bayer, the drug maker, donated 3 million doses of Resochin, its brand-name version of chloroquine, to the federal government.
But pharmacists say there's no proof yet the drugs are effective in fighting the coronavirus and that they can have serious side effects, such as difficulty breathing, chest tightness and nausea.
The New York Times reported that an Arizona man died and his wife was hospitalized after they dosed themselves with chloroquine phosphate, a related fish tank additive.
"They're not something everybody can take," Ludwig said. "Patients need to be monitored for safety and toxicity."
Research of a small pool of patients in France suggested a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, a commonly used antibiotic, could be effective in treating COVID-19.
But a study released recently in China found no statistical difference in those treated with the drugs and those who weren't.
Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said there is only anecdotal evidence that the drugs may be effective.
Said Ludwig: "I think the jury is still out on whether hydroxychloroquine is really effective. It's hopeful, and I think we need to have hope ... but there are so many medications that could be of help."
She said pharmacists risk destabilizing patients if they withhold the drugs only for those who have tested positive for coronavirus.
"For people who have chronic disease ... taking them off of these medications exacerbates their disease," she said.
Some major chains like Walgreens have said they are limiting new prescriptions of the drugs to 14-day supplies.
In Idaho, the first state to initiate restrictions, the state pharmacy board imposed a temporary rule barring pharmacies from dispensing the medications unless the prescription includes a written diagnosis of a condition that the drugs have been proven to treat.
The rule also limits prescriptions to a 14-day supply unless a patient has taken the medication previously.
According to Stat, a pharmaceutical industry publication, manufacturers Mylan and Teva Pharmaceuticals are stepping up production of millions of hydroxychloroquine tablets.
Mylan expects to donate more than 6 million doses through wholesalers to U.S. hospitals to meet "urgent demand," the company said in a statement. The doses will be shipped by March 31, and more than 10 million within a month, it said.
Officials at University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics would not say Thursday whether physicians were prescribing the medications for those diagnosed with the virus.
A.J. Ellingson, a spokesperson at UnityPoint Health in Des Moines, said physicians are prescribing medications including hydroxychloroquine, that are "clinically appropriate" for each patient.
"Our teams are reviewing the latest clinical literature on COVID-19 daily to ensure our treatment protocols are as effective as possible," he said in a statement.
The University of Minnesota is using hydroxychloroquine in a study of around 1,500 people who were exposed to COVID-19 within three days but were not symptomatic.

Texto completo: This week, Orange County issued a stay-at-home order and many other counties are expected to soon follow suit. You might be wondering: How can they enforce that?
In some ways, policing the whereabouts of every one of Orange County's 1.3 million residents would be impossible. But one technology company is grading how well each state and county in the United States is doing when it comes to social distancing.
Tech firm Unacast collects location data from more than 127 million smartphones that have installed certain apps in categories from games to shopping to utilities. Normally, they sell that data to retailers, real estate companies and marketers.
Now, they've launched a new tool in light of the COVID-19 pandemic: the "Social Distancing Scoreboard."
Based on data updated March 21, Florida received the grade of B, with people traveling an average distance of almost 39 percent less when compared with pre-COVID-19 data. The state's top counties exercising social distancing, all earning As, are also some that have been hardest hit by the virus: Broward, Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, Orange, Osceola and Seminole.
According to Unacast's data, Florida's worst counties when it comes to social distancing are those in the Panhandle that have been least impacted by known cases of COVID-19: Gadsden, Columbia, Jefferson, Madison and Hamilton. In those places, traveling behavior is largely unchanged, or in some cases, increased.
Overall, the U.S. also received a B, with Americans traveling, on average, a distance of almost 40 percent less than during a normal time period. States that ranked highest in social distancing scores, all receiving As, included Alaska, Nevada, New Jersey, Rhode Island and the District of Columbia. Those places all saw a 50-to-60 percent decrease in average distance traveled.
Some of the hardest-hit locales are also experiencing less movement. In New York City, which now has more than 15,000 positive cases, residents are now traveling an average distance that's up to 70 percent less than before the pandemic arrived in the city. Many California counties, now under a statewide "shelter in place" order, received As with residents traveling an average distance of more than 40 percent less than compared with normal times.
Unacast put together the free tool with the goal of enabling "governments, institutions, and organizations fighting the virus to understand the efficacy of social distancing initiatives," according to their website, also adding: "The more we all understand, the more lives we can save together."
The New York Times recently conducted a similar analysis using smartphone movement data from Descartes Labs. Their results shed a different perspective that contrasts with what Unacast's data shows.
In the Times' examination published March 23, which also used average distance traveled as the primary metric, the South and Midwest lag behind other parts of the country in social distancing practices. The data shows that while Florida's mobility has lessened, it falls behind 30 other states when it comes to how much people's movement has slowed in recent weeks.
It's worth remembering that Unacast's grading scale, while somewhat reflective of social distancing success, is also subjective.
The counties that lead Florida's social distancing efforts are similar in the Times' data, with Osceola, Broward, Miami-Dade, Seminole and Orange counties showing the biggest decrease in average distance traveled. However, the movement data from both sources could change in the coming weeks as the state's confirmed cases grow and local shelter-in-place orders are enacted.
Unacast isn't alone in collecting location data: While the fact that a single firm is tracking location data from more than 127 million smartphones might seem astonishing, Unacast certainly isn't alone in its approach.
Google also collects anonymous location data from millions of phones to update traffic on its maps platform and inform people of how busy certain stores and restaurants are in real-time. That's something people can also use to determine the crowds at their local Publix or Walmart during the crisis to plan shopping trips accordingly.
Certain apps for weather, games and more will also collect location data that they can later sell to companies, a legal practice that's often stipulated in the fine print of privacy agreements. Companies from Apple to Facebook have also been known to collect such anonymous data.
This kind of data collection, scary though it may be, can also aid public information efforts, such as a recent New York Times interactive piece about "how the virus got out."
What does this mean for your privacy? In the case of Unacast's Social Distancing Scoreboard and other similar tools, the company disclaims that it doesn't "identify any individual person, device, or household."
"However, to calculate the actual underlying social indexing score we combine tens of millions of anonymous mobile phones and their interactions with each other each day - and then extrapolate the results to the population level," reads the company's website.
While Unacast is looking to expand the datasets and layers in its COVID-19 toolkit, it also has yet to pick up on whether people are staying at least six feet apart, one of the main tenets of social distancing.
In theory, such data could also be used to enforce stay-at-home orders or track patients, but there's no such evidence that the U.S. government is doing that, according to The Washington Post.
However, the Post reported last week that the U.S. government is talking with large tech companies about using anonymous location data to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, including tracking whether people are keeping safe distances from one another. The data would be managed by industry and health officials, who could use it for research.
If all of this still has you feeling rattled, it's worth vetting smartphone apps to see which ones are collecting location data and how often. Location permissions can be revoked through settings or turned off altogether.
Guides from the New York Times help show how to prevent location tracking and tune-up privacy settings on your smartphone. Consumer Reports also offers a comprehensive guide on digital security and privacy.

Texto completo: A popular technology company that has helped launch thousands of online retail sites has become a favorite tool for fly-by-night businesses looking to cash in on the coronavirus pandemic.
New e-commerce sites that use the company's services are filled with wildly exaggerated claims about virus-fighting products that may not even exist.
The New York Times analyzed registrations with the company, Shopify, which allows just about anyone with an email address and a credit card to create retail websites in short order. The company, which in the past helped build such successful e-commerce sites as Kylie Cosmetics, the $1.2 billion beauty brand founded by Kylie Jenner, has registered nearly 500 new sites over the past two months with names that include "corona" or "covid," The Times found. Untold others have been started using other names.
One of the new sites marketed an "oxygen concentration" machine for $3,080. Another had the "Corona Necklace Air Purifier," which for $59 claimed to provide "All Day Protection." A third offered a $299 pill that promised "Anti-Viral Protection" for 30 days. And sites such as CoronavirusGetHelp.com and test-for-covid19.com marketed home test kits for $29.99 to $79, none of which have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
Many of the sellers do not actually possess the goods, nor have they verified that the products are legitimate. Often, the sites' operators are middlemen who fulfill customers' orders by buying items on other websites - a kind of digital arbitrage known as "drop-shipping." Shopify is attractive to these new businesses because its software can integrate the sites with the distant vendors, mostly in China.
Amy Hufft, a Shopify spokeswoman, said the company last week closed more than 4,500 sites related to the virus. She said sites that did not back up the medical claims they made were suspended from the platform. By Monday, nearly all the sites identified by The Times had been removed.
"Our teams continue to actively review COVID-19 related products and businesses, and stores that violate our policies will be immediately taken down," she said in an email.
Gibril Bachouchi, a 20-year-old Canadian engineering student in Algiers, told the Times in a video call how he started his Shopify site, killcoronavirus19.com.
Bachouchi said he created the store to raise money for a hospital where his aunt works as a doctor, after hearing it was short on face masks and other equipment. His site advertised the $3,080 oxygen machine last week, and a COVID-19 testing kit for $30.40, among other products.
"I was just like, 'I'm a 20-year-old kid - what can I do to help a bit?' " Bachouchi said.
Bachouchi said he used Shopify's algorithm to set competitive prices and choose a markup. As of last week, he had made no sales.
"Shopify pushes you to spend as much as you can on marketing," Bachouchi said. "I just don't have the money."
Though Shopify has been policing the new sites, it also encourages its customers to go into the drop-shipping business. It offers a guide for starting such a business and makes money from them by charging a monthly fee and a percentage of sales. The Canadian company is one of the largest turnkey e-commerce sites in the world, bringing in $1.5 billion last year.

Like the rest of the cast, Stephen Tobolowsky, who plays Dr. Leslie Berkowitz on the comedy, heard the news not long before it became public (and began trending on Twitter). He was about to film a scene of the ABC sitcom "The Goldbergs," and he was so sure "One Day at a Time" was about to get a fourth season that he cheerfully answered the phone when the showrunners, Gloria Calderón Kellett and Mike Royce, called him.
"I picked it up, and Gloria said, 'Our little show - they pulled the plug,' " he said.
Then there was a knock on the door: "Stephen, we're ready for you." Tobolowsky struggled to make the transition from receiving that gut punch to being funny on camera.
"I was like, 'I'm traumatized, and I'm going to need a lot of professional help just to get through this moment,' " he recalled.
Justina Machado, who plays nurse, Army veteran and mother Penelope Alvarez on the comedy, said that when her friends heard the news, they were "so mad. They were emotional."
Part of the anger, Machado said, was over what that news represented. As journalist Vanessa Erazo noted in a New York Times op-ed shortly after "One Day" was canceled, Hispanic people made up an estimated 18% of the population, but Hispanic roles constituted just 7.2% of all roles in scripted streaming series - even less on broadcast and cable.
"It's the stories that we're telling and how they're seeing themselves represented on the screen" that made this more than just another cancellation, Machado said in an interview during the Television Critics Association press tour, in January.
Todd Grinnell, who plays the show's affable landlord, Schneider, noted the irony of being canceled by Netflix, "the place that usually saves the show that the network has cast aside."
The social media outcry at the time was intense, as was the response from TV critics, who wrote dozens of pieces about the show's cancellation and why it deserved to be rescued. But the most important reaction was the one from Sony Pictures Television, which produces the series.
The day the showrunners found out Netflix didn't want a fourth season, Royce said, Sony executives "called us, and they're like, 'We're getting this show on somewhere.' "
That somewhere ended up being Pop TV, the cable channel owned by ViacomCBS that is best known for quirky Canadian comedy "Schitt's Creek." On Tuesday, "One Day at a Time" debuted at its new home just over a year after Netflix cut it loose. The fourth season picks up as the family answers questions from a census worker played by Ray Romano.
The fact that "One Day at a Time" was canceled at all still seems surprising given its devoted audience and versatile premise.
Netflix, which declined to comment for this article, indicated at the time that whatever the audience's devotion, its size was just too small. But where Netflix saw an underperforming show, David Nevins, chief creative officer of CBS and chief executive of Showtime Networks, saw opportunity. He had gained oversight over Pop TV just days before the cancellation was announced.
"I think Netflix clearly has a model where they feel they're getting value out of (shows) in the first couple of seasons, and they don't have that much incentive to go the long haul," he said.
That may be the right decision in many cases, but "the programmer in me thought it had untapped potential."
As its fate hung in the balance, "One Day at a Time" had a lot of things going for it: an active and dedicated fan base, reporters and critics invested in the show's survival, and media-savvy creators and cast members. And at a time when audiences - and many executives - value nuanced representations of historically marginalized groups, the series was one of few shows with a predominantly Hispanic cast, as well as several LGBTQ characters.
For all the show's admirable qualities, its survival is also a product of a confluence of industry circumstances. In March 2019, Pop TV was in the market for a high-profile acquisition to replace "Schitt's Creek."
It also helped that Sony was more motivated than many studios to keep its programs alive. Increasingly, TV studios belong to companies that also operate networks or streaming platforms, and those studios can usually rely upon their corporate parents or siblings to acquire and renew much of their output. Sony has become a rarity: a television studio without those kinds of corporate connections.
The original version of "One Day at a Time" told the story of a white family in Indianapolis headed by a single mother, one of a string of iconic Norman Lear-produced comedies - including "All in the Family" and "Good Times" - that debuted in the 1970s.
The new incarnation, which counts Lear as an executive producer, revolves around the tight-knit Cuban American Alvarez clan in Los Angeles. Despite the changes, "One Day at a Time" hews to the traditions of the best multicamera comedies: It is shot on a soundstage, the soundtrack includes laughter from a live audience, and the writers and cast expertly blend deft jokes and sincere sentiment.
Now that "One Day" has completed its highly unusual journey from streaming to basic cable, are more big transformations coming? Not really.
The revival will continue to stay true to the show's roots in socially conscious comedy, the showrunners said. Although "One Day at a Time" regularly provides belly laughs and warm moments, there are times when Penelope wonders how she'll pay her bills. Characters have also grappled with mental illness, immigration concerns and LGBTQ acceptance.
As Schwartz said his first email to Calderón Kellett and Royce after the Pop deal was official: "Keep doing what you're doing. We're making this show because we love it."

CORONAVIRUS; Stimulus benefits special interests; $2-trillion rescue plan includes long-sought boons for businesses

Texto completo: In the days before the Senate unanimously passed a roughly $2-trillion bailout bill for the nation's nosediving economy, lobbyists and special-interest groups flooded Congress with long-standing wishes and wants -- though couched as urgent needs in a time of crisis.
The 880-page bill that emerged -- and that the House is expected to approve Friday -- did not give everyone everything they sought.
But it does include provisions plucked from the wish lists of hotels, restaurants, retailers and over-the-counter drug manufacturers, among others. Some measures will last only as long as the coronavirus crisis and its economic fallout last. Others are permanent.

One of the biggest winners could be a company whose name doesn't show up anywhere in the relief package. Aerospace giant Boeing Co., which had struggled long before the coronavirus pandemic, appears the chief beneficiary of a $17-billion loan program intended for "businesses critical to maintaining the national security."
Small banks won lower requirements for capital reserves, a longtime goal for their lobbyists, on the theory that it would allow them lend more money to struggling businesses.
Similarly, restaurants, grocery stores and other retailers won a tax break that would let them write off renovations to their business they would otherwise have had to spread out over years.
And a little-noticed provision would speed up the Food and Drug Administration's review of over-the-counter drugs and sunscreen products.
The provision, which has been on the Senate's to-do list for over a year, has the backing of both physicians' groups and makers of nonprescription drugs. But even the Public Access to SunScreens Coalition, an industry group, said protection from sunburn is not tied to the coronavirus crisis.
"It's not controversial but it certainly caught a ride on this train," said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a Washington-based group that highlights wasteful government spending. "People are arguing about various treatments for COVID-19, but sunscreen isn't one of them."
Easing the FDA's approval process for sunscreen has been a priority for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who represents Kentucky, where the cosmetics company L'Oreal has a factory. McConnell's office did not respond to a request for comment.
Democrats also attached measures that are not directly tied to the outbreak.
The bill includes $75 million each for the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. It also provides $7.5 million for the Smithsonian Institution and $25 million for the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.
And the long-troubled U.S. Postal Service will get a $10-billion loan, though Democrats have warned it will need more to stay afloat.
Businesses owned by President Trump and his immediate family, or by the vice president, top federal officials and members of Congress, are barred from obtaining loans under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, known as the CARES Act. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin is not empowered to lift those bans.
Still, the bill could allow the Trump Organization, the private holding company for the president's businesses, to benefit from two provisions that help restaurants and hotels, according to the New York Times.
Other tax provisions could provide a bonanza for wealthy real estate investors, potentially including the president and members of his family.
Senate Republicans inserted a provision that lets wealthy investors use real estate losses to minimize their taxes. The estimated cost of the change over 10 years is $170 billion, according to the New York Times.
It's not too late for industries whose requests didn't make it into the final bill.
If signed into law, the bill will provide $500 billion in loans to distressed businesses, states and local governments. The Federal Reserve, the country's central bank, would oversee the program, an arrangement that initially worried Democrats, who pressed for stronger oversight.
The loans now come with strings attached, such as disclosure requirements and oversight by a special inspector general and a congressionally appointed review board to look for waste, fraud and abuse.
Companies that borrow money under the legislation can't engage in stock buybacks, and there are limits on how much they can increase a CEO's pay.
Even with those efforts, the potential remains for certain industries or business owners to receive preferential treatment.
Lisa Gilbert, vice president of legislative affairs for the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, said the legislation grants Mnuchin broad power to remove bans on profiteering.
Prohibitions on stock buybacks, dividends or compensation limits can be lifted. The only caveat, she said, is Mnuchin would have to appear before Congress to explain his decision.
"The single largest line item in the stimulus is the nearly $500-billion slush fund for corporations," Gilbert said. "This money has some guardrails attached but these can be waived if Secretary Mnuchin simply chooses to."
The bill includes funding for an inspector general to monitor the Treasury's lending, but it's unclear whether the office would have subpoena power, so another federal agency could refuse to hand over documents, she said.
Also noteworthy: The prohibition against generous severance packages for CEOs may be limited to double their 2019 compensation. That could still allow a firm to increase an executive's pay by millions of dollars.
Gilbert said her organization supports the relief bill despite its flaws because it provides funding urgently needed for healthcare workers to get personal protective equipment, including masks, and much of the money will go to families as direct payments or unemployment insurance.
Reed Hundt, who led a review of economic policies during President Obama's transition in 2008, lauded the legislation for beefing up unemployment compensation and commended Congress for not being hamstrung by fears of the deficit.
But he said the lack of transparency in the legislative process is troublesome. In the rush to deal with the crisis, there were no public hearings and little formal process. "There is a big risk of secret favoritism," he said. "The Treasury Department has to be completely transparent about everything it does."
To some critics, the billions of dollars set aside to bail out Boeing, the world's largest aircraft manufacturer, suggest the Trump administration is already playing favorites.
Aviation authorities grounded the Boeing 737 Max fleet a year ago after two deadly crashes in five months, and Boeing was in financial distress long before the coronavirus slammed the brakes on international air travel.
Partly as a result, Boeing lobbied for a bailout equivalent to the GDP of a small country. It sought $60 billion in loans, and while the Senate package set aside $17 billion for the company, Boeing could potentially receive more.
It did not hurt that Boeing has a supporter in the Oval Office. "We're not letting Boeing go out of business," Trump told Fox News on Tuesday.
"Certainly this administration has not been shy about picking winners and losers and rewarding friends and punishing enemies," Ellis said. "Once this gets in the hands of the executive, who knows how they're going to allocate the funding."

Real Estate Investors Poised To Get Boon in Stimulus Bill

Texto completo: A small change to tax policy could hand $ 170 billion in tax savings to real estate tycoons.
The federal government's planned $ 2 trillion economic rescue package includes financial aid for individuals and industries that are struggling to survive the coronavirus pandemic.
It also includes a potential bonanza for America's richest real estate investors.
Senate Republicans inserted an easy-to-overlook provision on page 203 of the 880-page bill that would permit wealthy investors to use losses generated by real estate to minimize their taxes on profits from things like investments in the stock market. The estimated cost of the change over 10 years is $ 170 billion.
Under the existing tax code, when real estate investors generate losses from gradually writing down the value of their properties, a process known as depreciation, they can use some of those losses to offset other taxes. The result is that people can enjoy big tax breaks stemming from only-on-paper losses, even if they enjoy big cash profits in the real world.
But the use of those losses was limited by the 2017 tax-cut package. The losses could be used only to shelter the first $ 500,000 of a married couple's nonbusiness income, such as capital gains from investments. Any leftover losses got rolled over to future years.
The new stimulus bill lifts that restriction for three years -- this year, and two retroactive years -- a boon for couples with more than $ 500,000 in annual capital gains or income from sources other than their business. That group comprises the top 1 percent of taxpayers, according to Internal Revenue Service data.
A draft congressional analysis this week found that the change is the second-biggest tax giveaway in the $ 2 trillion stimulus package. That cost analysis also includes the impact of some smaller technical changes to the law. Other industries, like oil and gas and commodities trading, also stand to benefit from the change.
"It's a pretty big deal," said Peter Buell, who runs tax services for the real estate practice of the accounting firm Marcum. A separate provision in the stimulus bill, which removes restrictions on losses that people can carry over from previous years, would make the tax break even more lucrative.
A spokesman for the Real Estate Roundtable, a lobbying group, played down the importance of the provision. He said that under the 2017 law, some real estate developers simply spread their losses over multiple years, potentially avoiding the $ 500,000 ceiling.
Among the possible beneficiaries of the change are real estate investors in President Trump's inner circle.
In 2018, The New York Times reported that Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump's son-in-law and adviser, likely didn't pay federal income taxes for several years because of paper losses generated by depreciating his companies' properties, despite his significant wealth and earnings from other sources, according to confidential financial documents.
Mr. Trump has also reported significant losses on his tax return. Portions of a 1995 tax return published by The Times showed nearly $ 916 million in losses, which could have permitted him to avoid paying any federal income taxes for almost two decades.
The 2017 law restricted both men's abilities to reap tax savings through only-on-paper losses; now, with those limits likely to be lifted, Mr. Trump and Mr. Kushner, as well as other wealthy real estate developers, have the potential to score big tax savings.
The Senate unanimously approved the $ 2 trillion aid package late Wednesday night. The House is expected to vote on the measure on Friday to deal with the economic damage wrought by the coronavirus pandemic; it would be the largest fiscal stimulus package in modern American history. It would then be sent to Mr. Trump for his signature.

U.S. Weighs More Chinese Media Expulsions

Texto completo: Trump administration officials are discussing taking action after China said it would expel almost all American journalists for The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal.
WASHINGTON -- As China moves forward with expelling almost all American journalists from three major American newspapers, Trump administration officials have intensified discussions over whether to evict employees of Chinese media outlets who they say mainly act as spies.
The action is under consideration because some U.S. officials want to retaliate against China in a new conflict that has revolved around news organizations and is being fueled by hostility over the coronavirus pandemic.
Since the virus began spreading across the United States, Washington and Beijing have waged a global information war over the outbreak. President Trump and his aides are trying to pin responsibility on China, where Communist Party officials initially covered up the dangers of the virus as it was first discovered. Mr. Trump, though, has been criticized for vast failures in the American response.
Some American intelligence officials have pushed for years to expel employees of Chinese media organizations who they say mainly file intelligence reports. The officials now see an opening to make a strong case after Beijing abruptly announced this month that it would expel almost all American citizens who report from mainland China for The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal.
China also demanded those organizations, as well as Voice of America and Time magazine, turn over information on employees, budgets, assets and other operational details.
American officials view the state-run outlets in China as a potent threat in the growing strategic rivalry between the two superpowers, both because it disseminates propaganda around the world and because of its ability to provide cover for intelligence operatives.
"Propaganda outlets that report to the Chinese Communist Party are foreign agents, not 'journalists,"' the State Department spokeswoman, Morgan Ortagus, said on Twitter on Thursday.
"Even General Secretary Xi says they 'must speak for the Party,"' she added, referring to remarks that President Xi Jinping of China made in 2016 as he toured the headquarters of state-run media organizations. In recent days, Ms. Ortagus and Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, have engaged in an information duel on Twitter.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has insisted on using the term "Wuhan virus" to refer to the coronavirus, which ignited tensions at an online meeting Wednesday of foreign ministers of the Group of 7 nations. Mr. Trump has used the term "Chinese virus" despite widespread criticism that the label is racist and encourages attacks on Asian-Americans. Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Zhao Lijian, has pushed the conspiracy theory that the U.S. Army might have taken the virus to Wuhan, where the pandemic began.
Against that backdrop, some American officials want to move quickly against Chinese intelligence operatives. American counterintelligence officials have more closely scrutinized the work of Chinese diplomats, journalists, scientists and others in the United States, though some critics have denounced this as a new "red scare." In September, the United States secretly expelled two employees of the Chinese Embassy in Washington who had been caught driving on a sensitive military base in Virginia with their wives; it appeared to be the first expulsion of Chinese diplomats accused of espionage in more than 30 years.
Any expulsion of Chinese employees at media outlets accused of conducting intelligence work could include ones based at the United Nations, where China has a permanent seat on the Security Council, according to an intelligence official familiar with the plans. Most Chinese employees of state-run organizations work in Washington for large organizations.
Some Chinese intelligence operatives pose as journalists at those agencies and at smaller state-run outlets, using "nonofficial cover," in the parlance of spies, experts on Chinese espionage say. Some American officials have spoken of entirely shutting down those small outfits as well as any Chinese organization or company accused of being a front for intelligence work.
American officials declined to estimate the number of Chinese intelligence operatives in the United States they say use journalism employment as a cover or the number they would like to expel.
The F.B.I. referred questions to the State Department, which said it does not comment on intelligence matters. The Chinese Embassy did not reply to a request for comment.
American intelligence officials have long asserted that many Chinese journalists abroad play a hybrid role in which they not only provide reports for publications and broadcasters in China, but also give information to Beijing's intelligence apparatus.
The action now under consideration would try to avoid evicting most of those who play a hybrid role and focus more on people the U.S. government believes are mainly spies, according to intelligence officials. The journalistic reports filed by those Chinese citizens are simply a screen for covertly collecting intelligence, the officials said.
The United States is scrutinizing most closely China Central Television, the main state-run network that has extensive operations overseas, the intelligence official said. It has an arm, China Global Television Network, that runs its own operations and broadcasts in foreign languages.
The main Chinese overseas spy agency, the Ministry of State Security, has operatives at various media outlets, say intelligence officials and experts on Chinese espionage. The People's Liberation Army also has intelligence operatives overseas with media cover.
American officials were infuriated by China's announcement of the new wave of expulsions of American journalists, who are not spies. The officials saw the action as part of Beijing's attempts to censor reporting about the government's missteps over the coronavirus outbreak.
The officials are now seeking a way to retaliate beyond continuing a cycle of retribution that harms people who practice actual journalism. Taking the fight to the intelligence services would do that, they say, as well as allowing the Americans to avoid criticism that they are clamping down on press freedoms.
One option that some officials have discussed that does not involve spies is limiting the reach and distribution of the Chinese outlets in the United States, whether those are television networks or newspapers. But that runs into the thorny issue of press freedoms. For years, the Chinese government has blocked online access to major foreign news websites and apps, and it often censors broadcasts by international television networks.
The wave of expulsions of journalists in the two countries began when China announced on Feb. 19 it would evict three Wall Street Journal reporters, the first outright expulsions of foreign journalists since 1998.
After that announcement, which came a day after the Trump administration imposed new rules on five Chinese state-run media organizations, American officials grappled with how to respond. Some raised the idea of expelling Chinese state media employees who did intelligence work. Matthew Pottinger, the deputy national security adviser and a former Wall Street Journal reporter based in China, led a meeting on Feb. 24 to discuss options.
The administration announced on March 2 it was issuing new visa quotas on Chinese citizens working at five Chinese media organizations. In total, they could employ only 100 Chinese citizens in their American operations. That would result in the de facto expulsion of about 60.
A senior State Department official said last week that the "Chinese government" had met a deadline of March 13 to identify employees who would remain at the organizations. It was unlikely that Chinese officials had selected intelligence operatives to send back to China, American officials said.
China retaliated against the new quotas by expelling journalists at The Times, The Journal and The Post, affecting at least 13 Americans, even though those newspapers are not tied to the U.S. government.
"Did they really believe they can silence a country like China without any consequences?" Hua Chunying, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, wrote on Twitter on Tuesday.
"China clearly no longer sees Western journalists as useful or critical to getting its message out," said Daniel M. Kliman, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security and a former Asia policy official in the Pentagon. "With the expansion of state-run organizations globally, it seems they don't need Western journalists around."
On Tuesday, the publishers of the three newspapers issued an open letter to China.
The decision by Beijing to expel the journalists during a pandemic, they said, was "uniquely damaging and reckless as the world continues the struggle to control this disease, a struggle that will require the free flow of reliable news and information."

Texto completo: The claim: People who suffered from a round of illness in November and December likely had the coronavirus
A handful of widely circulated Facebook posts have asserted that people in the United States likely contracted the coronavirus as early as last fall.
“Who got sick in November or December and it lasted 10 to 14 days, with the worst cough that wouldn’t go away?” the posts say. “If you can answer, yes, then you probably had the coronavirus. There were no tests and the flu test would come back negative anyway. They called it a severe upper respiratory infection. ”
Many of the posts currently circulating include the profile photo of a Facebook user named Donna Lee Collier. Collier did not respond to a USA TODAY request for comment on the origin of the posts.

Bonnie Powell, of Waynesboro, Georgia, copied the status and received more than 230 shares. She said the post reflects her opinion, not necessarily scientific proof. But she said she had heard from friends about sickness at the end of last year, which makes her suspicious.
"Our area has had a very virulent 'flu' season with many of my friends testing negative for flu," she said in a Facebook message.
Coronavirus likely originated in November, was first in U. S. in January
Researchers have tied the origin of the virus to a live animal market in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization first received a report of the outbreak on Dec. 31, but the virus originated in China more than a month earlier than that. A study published in early March by researchers at ETH Zurich puts the origin of the virus in the first half of November.
Fact check: Coronavirus originated in China, not elsewhere, researchers and studies say
Rumors surrounding the origins of the novel coronavirus have swirled as it spreads around the globe. Theories that the virus originated in a Chinese laboratory, or that it originated outside of China and was brought over by the U. S. Army, are not supported by evidence, according to medical experts. The virus is believed to have animal origins, likely in bats.
Fact check: Is COVID-19 caused by human consumption of animals?
On Jan. 21, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced the first case of novel coronavirus in the United States from a person who had recently returned to Washington from Wuhan. The United States has since surpassed China and Italy to become the most infected country in the world, according to a tracker from Johns Hopkins University.
Symptoms of the novel coronavirus include a fever, cough and shortness of breath. Reported illnesses range from mild symptoms to severe symptoms and death.
Could the coronavirus have been in the U. S. before January?
Experts say it's plausible that coronavirus came over to the U. S. from China before that first January case, but more testing is needed to be sure.
"Anecdotally, we've heard about some influenza-like illnesses in December and January that were a little bit atypical," said Dr. Luis Ostrosky, a professor of infectious diseases at McGovern Medical School at UTHealth in Houston. "But the thing we need to solve that puzzle is when we actually start doing testing of antibodies, not just detecting the virus. "
Ostrosky said that would include taking a look at blood samples from December and January to see if the virus was already in circulation.
Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said he believes when researchers do more testing, they will probably find the disease was in the U. S. earlier than first believed.
"I believe at the end of this, when we do look back – and we will – we will probably find that this disease was here earlier than we thought," he said. "We also know that when we closed our borders, it was very, very leaky. "
However, Benjamin said it's "plausible but not likely" that the coronavirus was in the United States in November and December. If it were in the U. S. before the end of the year, the case would also have likely been connected to travel from China, he said, and likely not widespread.
Dr. Josh Petrie, assistant research professor at the University of Michigan School of Public Health, said it's important to remember that multiple existing viruses can cause severe upper respiratory symptoms and circulated late last year. Among them was Influenza B, which grew in intensity around November and December, as well as RSV and Influenza A.
He said it's possible there were "sporadic" travel-related cases earlier than the discovery of the first case but agreed it was likely not widespread as far back as November or December.
"There's a lot of surveillance that goes on for influenza every year, and so if we were seeing a lot of coronavirus activity at that time – even if you couldn't test for it – you would see signals in that influenza surveillance," he said.
Would already having the coronavirus make someone immune to further infection by it? That's also still under investigation. Ostrosky said that, in general terms, other coronaviruses do result in built-up immunity.
A New York Times article published Wednesday about research efforts underway to study antibodies characterized the answer to the immunity question as "a qualified yes, with some significant unknowns. " Dr. Vineet D. Menachery, a virologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, told the Times that people who are infected may have one to two years of immunity, with any longer time span hard to predict.
Our ruling: More information needed
At this point, experts contacted by USA TODAY say it's unlikely that just because someone had a cough or other symptoms of an upper respiratory infection that they "probably had the coronavirus," especially as far back as November.
But it's also plausible that some cases did arrive in the U. S. earlier than the first reported case in January. Experts say additional testing and research is needed to get an exact picture.

Warmth, humidity might slow coronaviruses; But early studies have not been peer-reviewed

Texto completo: Several new studies give credence to the hope that the coronavirus pandemic will finally begin to peter out as temperatures rise and summer's thick blanket of humidity sets in, though scientists warn against putting too much faith in such predictions until more is known about this particular virus strain.

Warm-weather states such as Louisiana and Florida, though, continue to be among the nation's leaders for the outbreak so far.

The most recent wave of weather-tolerance studies began with one in late February headed by a Hong Kong pathologist named John Nicholls.

He and his research team from Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, the capital of south China's Guangdong province, grew one of the world's first laboratory-grown samples of SARS-Cov-2, which is what the National Institutes of Health says causes COVID-19 disease - that is, what most of us now call simply coronavirus.

That team's research concluded that its sample did not hold up well to sunlight, warmth, and humidity; conversely, it performed better under cold and dry conditions.

Results of the preliminary Hong Kong study have not been peer-reviewed.

But they are mirrored in the conclusions of other studies also awaiting peer review, including one released in early March by a team of six experts.

Four are from the University of Maryland and two are from overseas. None of the four University of Maryland authors would comment. Two said they have no time because of rapidly occurring coronavirus developments.

Another study offering similar conclusions is one from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Though not yet peer-reviewed either, co-author Qasim Bukhari told the New York Times that cases appear to be increasing fastest in populous regions of the world with cool temperatures now.

Warmer temperatures may make this virus less effective, but less effective transmission does not mean there is no transmission, he said.

There are likely dozens of strains of coronavirus, and they've been around for decades.

The one terrorizing the world today is three times as contagious and 20 times as deadly as the ordinary flu. It is called a novel coronavirus because it's exactly that: unique.

The fact that the weather-related studies are still awaiting to be peer-reviewed by teams of other experts is a big deal in the scientific community.

If it's not peer-reviewed, you should be critical of the data, according to Linda Saif, an Ohio State University researcher who was described by a university spokesman as OSU's top coronavirus expert. There's a lot being deposited now [for various publications] that's not peer-reviewed.

But Ms. Saif, a Fulbright Scholar and member of the National Academy of Sciences, said other strains of coronavirus were shown to be less active under sunlight, warmth, and humidity years ago.

She declined to comment on the studies specific to the emerging strain, explaining she has not had time to keep up with all of them.

Ms. Saif, 73, is a coronavirus research pioneer, having studied other strains for more than four decades.

The first ones were discovered in 1966. One type of coronavirus was behind a 2003 epidemic known as SARS, which stands for sudden acute respiratory syndrome. Another coronavirus was behind a subsequent epidemic called MERS, which stands for Middle East respiratory syndrome.

An AccuWeather meteorologist, Jesse Ferrell, questioned the methodology of the Hong Kong pathologist's study and whether his team's results, at best, showed some correlation. He said in his analysis it did not appear to be indisputable, direct causation.

Jennifer Hanrahan, University of Toledo Medical Center's chief of infectious diseases and an associate professor there, cautioned against putting too much faith in laboratory test results. UTMC is the former Medical College of Ohio Hospital.

Although they can be a useful guide for doing more research, lab experiments can't replicate what happens inside of the human body, she said.

Ms. Hanrahan also cautioned against society letting down its guard if the outbreak slows down during the summer.

The Spanish flu of 1918, one of the world's most deadly pandemics of the last 150 years, began in the spring of that year, tapered off in the summer, then came back with a vengeance in the fall of 1918, she noted.

Ms. Hanrahan said she fully supports the steps that Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine and Ohio Department of Health Director Amy Acton have taken thus far in an attempt to slow transmissions through social distancing, calling the new strain of coronavirus absolutely one of the worst to confront mankind in recent centuries.

Ms. Acton was not available for comment. But her press secretary, Melanie Amato, said she is cautious about putting too much faith in such studies too.

Transmission will still occur, but it's possible that warmer temperatures will help 'bend the curve' along with continued social distancing, Ms. Amato said. Unfortunately, we are several weeks away from continuously warm weather in Ohio.

Ms. Amato also questioned why coronavirus is spreading all over Florida now too despite its warmth.

Warm weather might help some, but it won't stop it completely, she said.

On Tuesday, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said during a news conference that his state now has the world's fastest rate of growth in coronavirus cases. He cited a University of Louisiana Lafayette study, according to CNN.

The network said the Louisiana governor's office had provided it with graphics that show the rate of growth there similar to hard-hit Italy and Spain.

The World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have cautioned against assuming relief will come with summerlike weather.

One of the big perils in assuming that the virus is less dangerous in warmer temperatures, among particular ages or for any specific group is complacency, Julio Frenk, a physician who served as Mexico's health minister and is now the University of Miami's president, told the New York Times.

Mr. Frenk also said results will be disastrous for people who fail to heed warnings and recommendations.

In a competing study, epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch of Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health told the South China Morning Post, an English-language newspaper in Hong Kong, that sustained transmission and rapid growth of infections appears possible in a range of humidity conditions - and that warmer weather cannot be counted on for relief.

Weather alone, [such as an] increase of temperature and humidity as the spring and summer months arrive in the Northern Hemisphere, will not necessarily lead to declines in case counts without the implementation of extensive public health interventions, according to his team's study, which also has not yet been peer reviewed.

Joel N. Myers, AccuWeather founder and chief executive officer, said in a column posted on the company's website that the world is probably 30 to 60 days away from seeing for itself if weather really helps break up this particular virus.

Past viruses, he wrote, have been negatively impacted - to the benefit of humanity - by the intensity and amount of hours of sunshine as well as by heat and humidity, which tend to go hand in hand.

Mr. Myers said he believes there's less than a 5 percent chance this strain of coronavirus will continue to ravage this part of the world as temperatures heat up. He said he is hoping the warm weather months will buy time for an antidote to be developed.

He said he expects this strain of coronavirus to come on strong again this October or November, as temperatures cool heading into next winter.

The virus will provide the answer, but ultimately the weather may be a determining factor, Mr. Myers wrote.

Identity politics is the purveyor of real racism during coronavirus pandemic

Texto completo: Being on the receiving end of racism is not fun. For those of us who have experienced it, we know that it can be enraging and humiliating all at once.
It makes no difference what color or ethnicity the racist is, but this seemingly uncontroversial assertion has long been rejected, dismissed, or ignored by mainstream society and the liberal media. After all, the Left has taught that racism means prejudice plus power, and only white people, who hold the power in this country, can be racist.
Then the coronavirus outbreak took over daily life. All of a sudden, the media is open to reporting that Chinese Americans, along with other Asians who are mistaken as being of Chinese descent, are facing racism not just from white people but also racial and ethnic minorities.
On March 7, the New York Times published an op-ed by a young Chinese American woman who encountered racism from a Vietnamese nail technician at a salon. The technician, making an apparent reference to the origins of the coronavirus at a market in China where exotic animals were slaughtered and sold, said that Chinese people ate “weird” food and brought it to the United States. “Chinese people, I don’t like you. You are so bad, so bad, and so gross,” the Vietnamese nail technician added.
Upon reading the op-ed, a friend of mine observed, “I’ve seen the menus at Vietnamese restaurants. Vietnamese people have no business accusing anyone else of being ‘gross.’” Yes, many Vietnamese restaurants offer a panoply of entrails and similar items on the menu. Some might call it “weird.”
But food humor aside, those of us who hate identity politics have known for a long time that white people are not the sole source of racism. I have pointed out that some of the people who harbor the most hostility toward Asians are other Asian people. The story shared by the New York Times op-ed shows just how ugly that racism can be.
At the same time, those dishing out racism toward Asian Americans often include other people of color, such as African Americans.
Asian Americans who are familiar with urban settings know well that racism from other minorities such as African Americans is commonplace. I have even written a book, Chinese Girl in the Ghetto, talking about precisely the ugliness of such racism and the cravenness with which society and the media often avoid the subject. Shedding light on these incidents of racism is not an act of racism against the minority groups involved but a public way of bringing accountability to all for behavior that is unacceptable in modern society.
Of course, leftists who are now acknowledging that the perpetrators of coronavirus-inspired racism against Asian Americans include other people of color find it far easier to blame the entire phenomenon on President Trump and Republicans. Their logic supposes that because Trump and Republicans have used the term “Chinese virus” to describe the COVID-19 pandemic, they are fanning racism.
In reality, Trump and various Republicans began using the term to hold the communist Chinese government accountable for unleashing this horrible, infectious disease on the world and then lying to shirk responsibility. To Republicans, “Chinese” means China. They are not trying to malign their fellow Americans who did nothing wrong.
Certainly, to Asian Americans who are now facing racist attacks and unfairly shouldering the blame for the coronavirus, they do not believe their tormentors see a difference between “China” and “Chinese.” Understandably, they want their political leaders to use more responsible rhetoric.
Trump has done exactly that. Upon hearing about hate crimes and increased racism directed at Asian Americans due to the pandemic, he tweeted:
Tweet
He reiterated these sentiments at the White House coronavirus briefing on Monday and said:
“It seems that there could be a little bit of nasty language toward the Asian Americans in our country and I don’t like that at all ... so, I just wanted to make that point because they’re blaming China, and they are making statements to great American citizens that happened to be of Asian heritage, and I’m not gonna let that happen.”
It was, in some ways, a moment of high comedy, because Trump-haters had been feverishly labeling him as the person using “nasty language.” Trump appeared altogether oblivious to their complaints. After all, the president wholeheartedly says he is the “least racist person” anywhere in the world, no irony intended.
Chinese Americans who have no innate animus toward the president and who might otherwise applaud his policies ranging from strengthening border security to delivering a booming economy are glad that he has ceased using the term “Chinese virus.”
Yet, Trump haters and the worshipers of identity politics will find every opportunity to label him a racist. After all, their morally bankrupt ideology is based on the premise that America is a racist country. It is one reason why they have been so enamored and animated by reports of racism (real or imagined) against Asian Americans during the pandemic.
Identity politics has brought endless dishonesty and division to this country and continues to do so. When the coronavirus pandemic subsides, America must try to rid itself of this tumor from within.

Mainememory.net is an extraordinary website. The Maine Historical Society and communities, museums and societies across Maine collaborate to put images and ideas online. Understand Maine’s Bicentenary; go millennia further back and begin to study the Wabanaki; explore local history; view photographs of everything Maine; look at stuff (yes, that’s what museum professionals call historic objects); read stories of and by old and new Mainers.
Google Osher Map Library. They’ve been offering exciting exhibits for years, and here they are, beautifully digitized. Ancient maps, railroading maps, pictorial maps, school maps (including great ones made by students, etc., etc. Look for and learn about home; about places you’ve been; places you’d like to go, or to have gone to in the past.
Off line or on, there’s The New York Times for Kids. It appears on the last Sunday of each month, sandwiched into the massive Sunday Times. There’s something for everyone. It says: “This section should not be read by grown-ups” but what the hell. I learned a lot from February’s issue. And had fun.
The editor is excited about how people get their jobs: articles on a courtroom sketch artist (who portrayed Trump’s impeachment trial); an infectious disease researcher (topical); an economist (making big decisions for the World Bank); the poet laureate of the United States; a baker (who started out as an applied mathematician). There were more and less rarefied possibilities. A double page spread asked “What should you be when you grow up?” and offered 70 plus possibilities, sorted into categories: “Help people and get your hands dirty”; “”Learn how the world works and create new things”; Move your body and travel”; etc.
There are options before you grow up. Amsterdam’s Junior Bike Mayor, age 11, got the job by suggesting lighted bike paths, solar powered. He’s a public advocate for bicycling in a country where cycling is very important.
There’s other world news: Harry and Meghan, sensibly discussed; the Australian bushfires clearly explained. Not to mention Baby Yoda, Coronavirus, leap years, and Kabuki theatre (with anime and manga). And crossword puzzles, easy, medium, and hard.
There was even a chance for us Mainers to feel superior; most of a page on how to make and use maple syrup. We know! What will be in this month’s issue?

Texto completo: La ciudad informó anoche de 81 muertes adicionales por coronavirus, elevando a 280 el número de fatalidades por coronavirus en los cinco condados.
La cifra de contagios también se disparó en el transcurso de ocho horas ayer, de 17,856 a 20,011 pacientes, dijo el Ayuntamiento.
El alcalde Bill de Blasio advirtió anoche que la mitad de la población de la ciudad, es decir más de 4 millones de personas, contraerá el coronavirus.
Queen es el condado con más casos: al menos 6,420 contagios. Seguido por Brooklyn (5,232); Manhattan (3,616); El Bronx (3,542) y Staten Island (1,166).
“Es apocalíptico”, dijo la doctora Ashley Bray al diario The New York Times, al comentar la muerte de 13 contagiados en apenas 24 horas en Elmhurst Hospital, centro de 545 camas ubicado en Queens (NYC).
Según ese diario, algunas personas murieron dentro de la sala de emergencias mientras esperaban una cama.
La cifra de muertes registradas en esas instalaciones entre el martes y el miércoles fue “consistente con la cantidad de pacientes de la ICU (Unidas de Cuidados Intensivos) que fueron tratados allí”, dijo un portavoz de los sistemas de hospitales públicos de la ciudad en un comunicado.
“Elmhurst está en el centro de esta crisis”, afirmó Christopher Miller. “Es la prioridad número uno de nuestro sistema de hospitales públicos en este momento”.
“El personal está haciendo todo lo que está a nuestro alcance para salvar a cada persona con COVID-19”, dijo Miller. “Pero desafortunadamente este virus continúa teniendo un costo especialmente terrible en los ancianos y las personas con condiciones preexistentes “.
Las autoridades dicen que el hospital está desbordado y necesita urgentemente suministros. Actualmente está operando a más del 125% de capacidad, en comparación con su tasa de ocupación típica del 80%, dijo una fuente a Patch.
“Es como trabajar en un hospital de campaña en medio de una zona de guerra “, comentó una enfermera de urgencias a New York Post.
“Los nuevos pacientes están alineados en las puertas y no hay suficientes camas para sostenerlos. El equipo se está agotando más rápido de lo que podemos reabastecerlo. Nunca he visto algo así”.
También en un hogar en Queens, se reportó la muerte de un paciente hispano, aparentemente víctima del coronavirus: José Tenezaca, de 51 años, fue encontrado inconsciente por su hermano en un apartamento en Jackson Heights alrededor de la 1:30 a.m. del martes y fue declarado muerto.
Tenezaca se había estado quejando de fiebre alta y dolor de cabeza, pero no se le llegaron a realizar pruebas para detectar COVID-19 antes de fallecer , según New York Post.
Murió de “probable COVID-19”, según fuentes policiales, pero ni el médico forense de la ciudad ni el Departamento de Salud pudieron decir si le realizarían la prueba del virus al cadáver para advertir a otros que interactuaron con él los últimos días.

“I want people to know that this is bad,” one doctor said. "People are dying." https://t.co/TleylM6QOn

A lifeline could soon be on the way to help every American weather the economic crisis spurred by the coronavirus outbreak.
The U.S. Senate on Wednesday passed a bill that authorizes the Treasury Department to make direct payments to every American as part of a historic $2 trillion stimulus package that also includes money to help the airlines, hospitals and other industries.
[Our COVID-19 tracker contains the most recent information on Maine cases by county]
That still awaits a Friday vote in the House of Representatives before it goes onto the president's desk. But here's what you can expect before those payments come through.
How much?
The bill, HR 748, sets three tiers for payments based on each person's income. Individual filers with an adjusted gross income of less than $75,000 will receive $1,200. Heads of households making less than $112,500 also will receive $1,200. Joint filers making less than a combined $150,000 will receive $2,400.
On top of that, the bill includes an additional $500 payment for each child under age 16 in a household.
Those payments will be reduced for 5 cents on each dollar a filer makes over the above thresholds until the payment reaches $0.
How will that be determined?
That will be based on 2019 tax returns for those who have filed them. If you haven't filed your 2019 taxes, the government will use information on file from your 2018 return, according to The New York Times.
When will the checks arrive?
The bill sets no timetable for when those payments must be made, but Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC on Thursday morning that he intends for those checks to be deposited by mid-April. That's slightly later than Mnuchin proposed in a memo last week, according to the Associated Press.
Mnuchin said those payments will likely be made through direct deposit if the IRS has the tax filer's bank account information on file. If the IRS doesn't have your bank account information, the checks will likely come through the mail, which would take longer to receive them, according to Business Insider.
A letter will arrive in the mail within a few weeks of the disbursements confirming how the payment was made. Anyone who didn't receive a payment should contact the IRS after receiving the notice.
How many payments?
Just one. Future legislation, though, could authorize additional payments, according to The New York Times. Mnuchin had proposed last week making multiple payments, but that will require an additional act of Congress.

PANIC BUYING CORONAVIRUS FEAR COMES TO RESCUE GUN INDUSTRY

Texto completo: The National Rifle Association, which traffics in hysteria to juice both its membership ranks and gun sales, has actually done the right thing when confronted by a genuine threat: Citing the coronavirus, the NRA canceled its annual convention, which was scheduled for next month in Nashville, Tenn.
Many NRA members are older and likely more vulnerable to the virus. Still, the decision is bound to be unpopular with the sorts of NRA members who are behind the hairpin curves in right-wing talking points about the pandemic, which have had a bumpy tour of duty.
There is always a silver lining in disaster for the gun industry. Paranoia stemming from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, appears to be easing the "Trump slump" in gun sales just as the economy at large falls off a viral cliff, with Goldman Sachs projecting negative 5% growth in the second quarter and others contending that it will be far worse. Some Americans are rushing grocery stores, for reasons that are simultaneously comprehensible and nonsensical: There is no shortage of food, food distributors, food manufacturers, grocery stores, plants or animals.
While food flies off shelves, others with a survivalist bent pursue a mad quest for firearms. Background checks on gun purchases have risen this year, and there have been reports of the pandemic increasing demand for firearms and ammunition.
Like the panic over food supplies, the rush for guns is at once understandable and bonkers. One first-time buyer of a semi-automatic rifle and a semi-automatic pistol told The New York Times that he "fears that the virus could lead to a breakdown of public order, with looting and robberies and 'everything shutting down, like in a zombie movie.' "
As it happens, NRA leader Wayne LaPierre, in a zombie-influenced speech delivered six years ago, offered an eerie premonition of the apocalypse, citing "vicious waves of chemicals or disease that could collapse a society" among the many reasons why every American needs a semi-automatic arsenal.
That arsenal does not come cheap, of course. Prices of AR-15 models run from several hundred to thousands of dollars. With the economy under enormous strain, and restaurants and stores shutting down across the nation, unemployment is sure to spike. It seems likely that some of the same consumers lining up for expensive guns this week - there were lines outside some gun shops - may be lining up for benefits in the weeks ahead.
In other words, spending money on a semi-automatic rifle at a time when disease is ascendant and economic activity is plummeting may not be an example of homo economicus at his most rational. That's especially true given that government first responders, including police officers and other law enforcement agents, along with members of the armed forces, are precisely the employees most likely to remain on the payroll, and on the job.
Of course, the gun industry has many accomplices in fomenting hysteria. The infrastructure of right-wing propaganda is vast and varied, reaching millions of people through social media, podcasts, radio, YouTube and Fox News (not to mention Russian television and bots). As the disease becomes more visible in society, and the recent "hoax" propaganda about it is conveniently forgotten, there will be many opportunities to exploit the pandemic for financial and political gain. The lines outside gun stores suggest there will be no shortage of marks either.

Voices to Give You a Good Shot at Distraction

Texto completo: A crowdsourced selection of podcast episodes for this time, from the people who love them and make them.
As you shelter in place or take other measures to help stop the spread of the coronavirus, you may find yourself with silence to fill. And though podcasts are famously calibrated for a commuter's journey, there are plenty out there to help pass the time and calm you at home, too.
To find the most distracting of them, I turned to the super listeners on social media, like The New York Times Podcast Club, a Facebook group of more than 32,000 members who often debate and recommend podcasts. Here are the podcast community's top episode recommendations to lift your spirits or distract you during this time.
From mandatory lockdown in Milan, Jonathan Zenti, a Times Podcast Club member, found some comfort in the "Patient Zero" episode of "Radiolab," which first aired in 2014. "I think it helps to calm down, believe in maths and data, and make reasonable choices (even when it's hard to make one)," he wrote.
But if that's a little too close to the headlines, try hearing an old song in a new way. Seth Lind, a creator of the sci-fi improv podcast "Mission to Zyxx," found the "Semisonic" episode of "Song Exploder" surprisingly touching. Each episode of the podcast features an artist taking apart a song to explain how it was made, and the band Semisonic breaks down the end of the dive-bar standard "Closing Time." "I admittedly went into it thinking, 'So you're going to try to tell me this song means something?' And I was kind of blown away," Lind tweeted.
For another examination of an underappreciated song, Jakob Lewis recommended "Rumble Strip," which weaves extraordinary narratives out of interviews with ordinary people. Lewis says the episode "Fifty. A Phoenix Moment" is a can't miss: "Erica's radio making is among the most human I've ever encountered," Lewis tweeted, referring to the show's creator Erica Heilman. "It's rough, raw, unpolished, yet crafted and utterly true. This story is about confronting the truth of our mortality (turning 50) and rising above -- by singing Total Eclipse of The Heart."
Many club members recommended the recent earworm episode of "Reply All," which is certainly worth the hype. PJ Vogt, one of the show's hosts, offered some recommendations to distract you: the "20 Acts in 60 Minutes" episode of "This American Life"; the first episode of "Analyze Phish" by Scott Aukerman and Harris Wittels ("Phish 101"); and "Gregor" from "Heavyweight," an unload-your-personal-baggage show that helps Jennifer Ramming of the Times Podcast Club "love my fellow people more."
Another episode that might help you appreciate that we're all in this together comes from "The Science of Happiness" podcast. José Claudio Treviño, a Podcast Club member, suggests the episode "Who Would You Be Without Them," for introducing the gratitude practice of "mental subtraction": an imagination exercise that may help you tap into a newfound appreciation for overlooked blessings. "It helps to be appreciative of all the wonderful things one has," Treviño shared. "Especially our loved ones."
Perhaps you've braved the grocery stores and stocked as much food as your home can hold, but now you're uninspired by the task of having to cook it all? If so, Arielle Vetro in London suggests you tune into the James Beard Award-winning podcast "The Sporkful," specifically the episode "Where All The Chefs Are Grandmas." It's a tender listen that will inspire you to actually use all that pasta you've stockpiled. A bonus, Vetro said, is it "will remind you to check in on the elderly folks in your community who need support right now."
For home bakers, the Podcast Club member Mary Beth Martini-Lyons recommended "Preheated." "The hosts seem to enjoy each other and their baking hobby so much, it totally puts my mind in a different, happier place," she said. "And the recipes are a bonus."
If you're feeling socially starved, Melissa Nelson Gonzales recommended "Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend" for the entertaining conversations. "The tone is slightly different than his show, which I like," Gonzales shared in the group. "I get a sense of genuine respect between Conan and his guests." Her go-to episode? The Keegan-Michael Key interview. And Joanna Solotaroff (a WNYC producer behind "2 Dope Queens," and "Scattered") recommended Conan's Tig Notaro interview for "pure joy."
Another way to feel as though you're hanging out with friends is by tuning in to the pop culture podcasting duo Crissle and Kid Fury on "The Read." Linette Lopez shared on Twitter that their chatter "can make you feel as funny, fierce and unapologetically black/queer as they are, even if you're not." Their latest episode, "Running From Rona," opens with a Squarespace ad for your newfound apocalypse readiness website (it's a joke, mostly). The comedians, who aren't afraid to swear, will make you laugh at your own situation as they compare their end-of-days skills and resources, as well as dish advice for keeping the peace at home.
Sometimes the best audio accompaniment is the kind you don't have to pay close attention to. For that, the podcast club member Elizabeth Ellers turns to "No Such Thing as a Fish" for informative, funny entertainment. "If your mind drifts (whose doesn't these days), you've just missed a fact or two, not the whole thread of the episode," she said.
Need some laughs? Mara Severin of the Podcast Club said "Judge John Hodgman" will not fail you. "Judge John decides low-stakes (usually) disputes between friends and family with the help of bailiff Jesse Thorn," she said. "The rivalries are always gentle, funny and loving. The advice is always thoughtful, often hilarious and occasionally touching." No doubt some of the humorist's verdicts can offer perspective on whatever pet peeves your partner is pushing by your eighth day inside together.
Jen Robinson, a podcast fan on Twitter, says her 9-year-old likes "Story Seeds," in which children suggest story ideas and authors write about them. Robinson said her daughter laughed in the car to "Pants on Fire," a media literacy game show about misinformation in which children have to decide which seemingly honest "expert" is telling the truth. For younger listeners, here's a list of podcasts to distract 2- through 6-year-olds and their caretakers.
While live sports may have dried up elsewhere, up in Alaska, there is still a great race to follow. This month, sled dogs race across 938 miles in the Iditarod, and Alaska Public Media is reporting race updates to the finish line on the "Iditapod." Penny Gage, a Podcast Club member, says there's "nothing better than thinking about and hearing about doggos during this time."
Though not necessarily lighthearted, the history podcast "Throughline" from NPR is always eye-opening for Allison Brown, a Podcast Club member. A recent episode about the Public Universal Friend left her smiling, because it was something that as a Canadian, she had never heard before, she said. Though I'm sure the average American has also never heard of this pre-revolutionary self-proclaimed genderless prophet.
New from the team behind the calming, introspective interview show "On Being With Krista Tippett" comes "Poetry Unbound." Audie Alcorn, a longtime Podcast Club member, said he loved the refreshing brevity of each roughly 10-minute episode, featuring wonderful poems, chosen, read and interpreted by the soothingly voiced Irish poet and theologian Pádraig Ó Tuama. Sandhya Nankani, a fellow club member, seconded the recommendation, calling it "the perfect antidote to the anxiety we're all feeling right now."
Another short, soothing meditation on an underexamined piece of history comes from the perennial Podcast Club favorite, "The Memory Palace," which Valentina Tonidandel recommended from her quarantine in Trentino, Italy. Tonidandel said the episode "If You Have to Be a Floor" "always manages to lift my spirits so much -- by the time the episode gets to the end, I just want to dance!"
Finally, for an audio experience that proves that your ears can also appreciate art, Sara Brooke Curtis recommends a recent episode of "Short Cuts" called "Call Me." A triptych of short, beautifully sound-designed documentaries about the sounds of phones and what they contain. Curtis tweeted that the stories dug into her in unexpectedly healing ways. "Catharsis, deep delight and a surprising love story that had me saying 'no way' so loud in my car, I almost woke up my sleeping son."
Come chat with us in The New York Times Podcast Club on Facebook . And tell me what your ears are loving lately. I'm always listening. @phoebelett

Texto completo: NEW DELHI — India's prime minister ordered all 1.3 billion people in the country to stay inside their homes for three weeks starting Wednesday — the biggest and most severe action undertaken anywhere to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
“There will be a total ban of coming out of your homes," the prime minister, Narendra Modi, announced on television Tuesday night, giving Indians less than four hours' notice before the order took effect at 12:01 a.m.
“Every district, every lane, every village will be under lockdown," Modi said.
“If you can't handle these 21 days, this country will go back 21 years," he said. “The only option is social distancing, to remain away from each other. There is no way out to escape from coronavirus besides this."
Modi did not make clear how people would get food, water, and other necessities during the lockdown, or how they would maintain a safe distance from one another in the cramped spaces many now live. Nor did the prime minister make clear whether exceptions would be made for workers deemed critical to keep the country — the world's most populous nation after China — functioning.
The breadth and depth of such a challenge is staggering in a country where hundreds of millions of citizens are destitute and countless millions live in packed urban areas with poor sanitation and weak public health care.
Though India's number of reported coronavirus cases remains relatively low — around 500 — the fear is that, should the virus hit as it has in the United States, Europe, or China, the consequences would lead to a disaster far bigger than anywhere else.

Egypt announces 2-week nightly curfew to slow virus
CAIRO — Egypt will impose a two-week, nightly curfew in the Arab world's most populous country in an effort to stop the spread of the new coronavirus, its prime minister announced Tuesday as the International Monetary Fund warned that a shortage of medical supplies could affect the Mideast's poorest nations.
There are more than 31,000 confirmed cases of the virus across the Mideast, the vast majority in the hard-hit nation of Iran. While most recover from the COVID-19 illness that the virus causes, bottoming crude oil prices have put additional strain on even the wealthiest countries of the region. That in turn could affect their ability to spend on needed supplies as the virus challenges medical systems worldwide.
Egyptian Prime Minister Moustafa Madbouly told a news conference that the 11-hour curfew from 7 p.m. until 6 a.m. would go into effect Wednesday across the country. He said many kinds of transportation will be halted during the curfew.
Egypt has 366 confirmed cases and 21 fatalities, including two senior military officers.
Madbouly also announced the continued closure of airports, schools, and universities until April 12. He said shops and malls will be closed Fridays and Saturdays, the weekend in Egypt, and will be open from 7 a.m. till 5 p.m. the rest of the week. Groceries, bakeries, and pharmacies would be excluded from the closure order.

Confusion reigns, as Britain clamps down to fight spread
LONDON — Confusion rippled through Britain Tuesday, a day after Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered a three-week halt to all nonessential activity to fight the spread of the new coronavirus.
Streets were empty but some subways were full. Hairdressers were closed, but construction sites were open. Divorced parents wondered whether their children could continue to see them both.
The government has ordered most stores to close, banned gatherings of three or more people who don't live together, and told everyone apart from essential workers to leave home only to buy food and medicines or to exercise.
“You must stay at home," Johnson said in a somber address to the nation on Monday evening.
But photos showed crowded trains on some London subway lines Tuesday morning amid confusion about who was still allowed to go to work.
Many families were also confused by the new rules.
After Johnson said people should not mingle outside of their household units, separated parents asked whether their children could still travel between their homes. In a series of television and radio interviews, Cabinet minister Michael Gove initially said children should not move between households, before clarifying that it was permitted.

Antarctica only continent to be untouched by COVID-19
One continent has not yet confirmed a case of the novel coronavirus. It's a place of barren ice, where the all-consuming cold and darkness of winter is fast approaching.
Over the past few months, some 4,000 people from around the world have watched from Antarctica as the coronavirus pandemic, which began in Wuhan, China, swept around the globe, reaching all but its southernmost reaches.
"You'd better stay there; you're safer there," Alberto Della Rovere, leader of the 35th Italian expedition to Antarctica, said his colleagues at home told him via WhatsApp.
For now, they appear to be right. Even in normal times, only a limited number of people are allowed in and out of Antarctica, with medical workers screening for signs of influenza and other illnesses before arrival.
"Right now, this, Antarctica, is the safest place in the world," Della Rovere said. "There are no outside contacts, and we're far away from any settlement."

Two months later, China to ease lockdown on Hubei
HONG KONG — The Chinese province of Hubei, where the coronavirus first emerged, on Wednesday will begin allowing most of its 60 million residents to leave after nearly two months of lockdown, in a sign of the government's confidence that its tough measures have worked to control the outbreak.
Wuhan, the provincial capital and the city hardest hit by the epidemic, will remain sealed off until April 8, although public transportation there will start running again, the government said.
But even as authorities announced the eased restrictions, new questions were being raised about the virus's toll in China and whether the threat had fully passed. Hours before the loosening was announced, officials in Wuhan, after several days of reporting zero new local infections, said a doctor there had tested positive for the virus.
News reports have also claimed that health officials are finding a number of people with asymptomatic infections but not publicizing those figures, raising fears that the virus is still silently spreading. In addition, cases continue to climb among people newly arriving in China.

Bodies of virus victims found in nursing homes in Spain
MADRID — Spanish army troops disinfecting nursing homes have found, to their horror, some residents living in squalor among the infectious bodies of people that authorities suspect have died from the new coronavirus. Prosecutors have launched a judicial probe.
Defense Minister Margarita Robles said the elderly were “completely left to fend for themselves, or even dead, in their beds." She said the discovery included several nursing homes and several bodies but did not give exact locations for the nursing homes or exactly how many bodies were found.
The news came as Spain on Tuesday announced a record daily rise of 6,584 new coronavirus infections, bringing the overall total to 39,673. The number of deaths also jumped by a record number of 514 to 2,696.
Madrid took over a public skating rink Tuesday after the city morgue overflowed. To date, 1,535 people have died in the hard-hit Spanish capital, more than half of the national total. The region has over 12,350 infections.

Cuomo warns spiraling cases set to swamp ICUs

Texto completo: NEW YORK — Federal and state officials expressed growing alarm Tuesday about the coronavirus outbreak in New York City, warning that it could reach its peak much sooner than expected and advising people who have passed through or left the city that they should place themselves in a 14-day quarantine.
Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the White House's coronavirus response coordinator, indicated that the health authorities were now treating the New York City region as a coronavirus hot zone, akin to areas of China and Europe overwhelmed by the virus.
Birx said that about 60 percent of all the new cases in the United States were in the New York City metropolitan area, adding that a surge in cases on Long Island showed that people leaving the city were spreading the virus.
“Everybody who was in New York should be self-quarantining for the next 14 days to ensure that the virus doesn't spread to others no matter where they have gone, whether it's Florida, North Carolina, or out to far reaches of Long Island," she said.
The White House warning came as Governor Andrew Cuomo offered a grim forecast for the outbreak in New York, saying it would overwhelm the state's strained hospitals with as many as 140,000 stricken patients, including 40,000 needing intensive care, in the next few weeks.
The state's hospitals now have just 3,000 intensive care unit beds.
Cuomo said that in New York City, new cases appeared to be doubling every three days. The crisis has already claimed the lives of more than 200 people statewide, and 131 in the city.
Despite the city's draconian efforts to slow the spread of the virus, Cuomo said the number of infections could reach its peak by mid-April, far outrunning earlier projections.
“We are not slowing it. And it is accelerating on its own," he said during a briefing at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. “One of the forecasters said to me we were looking at a freight train coming across the country. We're now looking at a bullet train."
Vice President Mike Pence made it clear that New York City was now the nation's coronavirus epicenter: “We have to deal with the New York metropolitan area as a high-risk area," he said, telling New Yorkers, “We are with you."

Governor wants Florida to be declared a disaster area
TALLAHASSEE — Governor Ron DeSantis asked President Trump to declare Florida a disaster area, saying the coronavirus outbreak is having a “drastic effect" on the state's economy and medical providers.
DeSantis wrote in a letter to Trump released late Monday that Florida's “hospitals, medical facilities, and first responders are facing challenges rarely experienced before," and the state has already spent $208 million on related unemployment assistance, food stamps, disaster loans, and mental health counseling.
Such a declaration would make Florida eligible for federal aid. This is no hurricane, but DeSantis wrote that the state's medical system is already burdened and the situation will get worse, with limited testing showing more than 1,400 people infected and 17 deaths.
“The process of triaging and isolating affected individuals is significantly disrupting lifesaving and life sustaining services," DeSantis wrote. "Additionally, the insufficient medical resources and capacities of medical facilities, and the already limited number of qualified medical personnel, will only continue to rapidly deplete as the impacts of COVID-19 continue to spread."
Trump has not yet acted on the request.
Meanwhile, some of Florida's harder-hit municipalities ordered all their residents to shelter-in-place on Tuesday after DeSantis argued against a statewide order and blamed people flying in from New York and New Jersey for potentially spreading the coronavirus.
Officials are restricting travel on the only two roads leading into the Florida Keys from the mainland. Monroe County announced Tuesday that southbound traffic stops will be in place near the county line on US 1 and on State Road 905 by early Friday. The stations are meant to reinforce the island chain's previous closure to visitors and non-residents.
The "Safer at Home" order went into effect Tuesday morning for Miami Beach residents. Other Miami-Dade County municipalities, including Bay Harbor Islands and Bal Harbour Village, issued similar orders Monday night.
Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings said Tuesday he is issuing a stay-at-home order for the county that includes Orlando. The order goes into effect on Thursday.
Florida schools are closed.
“People should only be outside for exercise and attending to their necessities like shopping for groceries or visiting a pharmacy," Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber said in a statement. “It won't be like this forever, but for now in a community like ours this makes the most sense."

Yellowstone, two other national parks closed
CHEYENNE, Wyo. — Three of America's most well-known national parks — Yellowstone, Grand Teton, and Great Smoky Mountains — closed their gates Tuesday as people shut in because of the coronavirus lost more options for recreation. They join a growing list of national parks sites from New York to California that have closed, including the Statue of Liberty and Alcatraz.
Yellowstone, the world's first national park, and neighboring Grand Teton, announced their closures hours after Great Smoky Mountains in Tennessee.
They follow closures at Yosemite in California and Rocky Mountain in Colorado in recent days.
Interior Secretary David Bernhardt had promised last week that at parks that were still open, entrance fees would be temporarily waived to make it easier for people to get outdoors and “implement some social distancing."
The decision to close Yellowstone came after Montana Governor Steve Bullock, Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon, and local officials urged the park to keep visitors out to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

Texas official backs Trump's 'get back to work' call
HOUSTON — President Trump's message that he wants the country to get back to work sooner rather than later has hit home with at least one senior state official — Dan Patrick, the Texas lieutenant governor.
Patrick, the Texas chairman of the president's campaign, appeared on Fox News on Monday and said he was not only ready for the country and the economy to get moving again amid the coronavirus pandemic but also he and other grandparents might be willing to die for that to happen.
“My message is that let's get back to work," Patrick, 69, said on “Tucker Carlson Tonight." “Let's get back to living. Let's be smart about it, and those of us who are 70-plus, we'll take care of ourselves, but don't sacrifice the country."
He added: “I'm not living in fear of COVID-19. What I'm living in fear of is what's happening to this country. And you know, Tucker, no one reached out to me and said, 'As a senior citizen, are you willing to take a chance on your survival, in exchange for keeping the America that all America loves for your children and grandchildren?' And if that's the exchange, I'm all in."
Patrick's comments set off a backlash online but were also met with some approval, with the reaction often splitting along Democratic and Republican lines.
On social media, humorous GIFs about whether the old should sacrifice themselves for the young quickly spread.

Our medical professionals are lions

Texto completo: British soldiers in World War I were widely believed to have sacrificed their lives needlessly in futile offensives ordered by incompetent generals ensconced in comfortable chateaux far from the front. They were said to be “lions led by donkeys.”
Today, the lions are the medical professionals risking their lives to fight the worst pandemic in a century. They are worthy successors to the first responders who rushed into the collapsing towers on 9/​11 and the soldiers who stormed the beaches of Normandy. But, like the Tommies in the Great War, they are being betrayed by many of their political leaders. They are being asked to go into harm’s way without an adequate supply of protective masks, gowns and gloves — or enough ventilators to treat patients.
One doctor treating COVID-19 patients in New Jersey emailed me: “I am furious, terrified, exhausted, and sad. I have been trying to reach the president, the governor, the CDC, anyone I thought might help, for over a month, knowing what was coming. I couldn’t break through. And now I don’t know how many patients we can save, or if I’ll survive this awful crisis.”
His anger and despair are widely shared. “We are at war with no ammo,” a surgeon in Fresno, California, told The New York Times, which explained that “she had no access to even the most basic surgical masks in her outpatient clinic.” “We’re getting pounded,” a doctor at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New York told The Wall Street Journal. “I’ve been in ICU care for 15 years, and this is the worst I have ever seen things.”
The number of cases has not yet crested, and already the situation has become so dire that hospitals are reusing masks, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are advising nurses and doctors to make do with bandannas or scarves. Yet President Donald Trump still refuses to invoke the Defense Production Act to order manufacture of supplies, apparently because it conflicts with his selective application of free-market ideology. Trump has tried to save selected industries (agriculture, coal, steel) from market forces - but he won’t act to save lives now.
Last week, Trump told states that they are on their own: “The Federal government is not supposed to be out there buying vast amounts of items and then shipping. You know, we’re not a shipping clerk.” Governors are doing the best they can, but as New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D, said on Sunday, it’s counterproductive to force them to “get into this mad bidding war” for supplies.
Trump is now contemplating making life for medical providers much more difficult by hinting that he may lift social-distancing restrictions next week, even as the virus rages out of control. (The number of cases in the United States doubled between Saturday and Monday.) This would be directly contrary to the advice of epidemiologists, who are saying it’s imperative to shut down the entire country for 14 days to stop the pandemic.
Trump is hearing the unvarnished truth from experts such as Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Predictably, though, the president can’t handle the truth. The New York Times reports that Trump “has become frustrated with Dr. Fauci’s blunt approach at the briefing lectern, which often contradicts things the president has just said.” Fauci is the leader of the lions, and he may be sacrificed to keep the head donkey happy.
Trump is the worst leader we could possibly have at a time like this, but there are, alas, plenty of other profiles in ignominy in our capital. They include Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who myopically boasted that the coronavirus would be good for American jobs; Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who visited the Senate offices, pool and gym while waiting for the results of a coronavirus test (it was positive); and Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., who sold stocks before the stock market crash after receiving top-secret briefings on the chaos the virus was likely to cause.
The country’s governors and mayors have generally performed far better than the politicos in Washington. Cuomo, in particular, has become a shadow president - his crisp, calm, clear televised briefings, reminiscent of President Franklin Roosevelt’s “fireside chats,” are far removed from Trump’s preening, self-pitying, fact-free performances at the White House. The governors of states such as California, Washington, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, and Maryland - both Republicans and Democrats - have also shown true leadership in a crisis. But even at the state level there are plenty of donkeys such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, who refuses to close all the state beaches that have been mobbed during Spring Break. “Asked to explain,” the Miami Herald noted in a scorching editorial, “the governor delivered a rambling, incoherent monologue that went on for too long.”
We expect medical professionals to risk their lives to save ours, and they are fully meeting our elevated expectations. They are the heroes of the hour. If only we had more political leaders who would act in ways worthy of their service and sacrifice.

New York Times Editorial: Coronavirus Is Advancing. All Americans Need to Shelter in Place.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump needs to call for a two-week shelter-in-place order, now, as part of a coherent national strategy for the coronavirus to protect Americans and their livelihoods.
Once he does, and governors follow his request, there will be time to debate how soon some controls might be lifted, or how soon certain people, like those under a particular age, might be free to resume something like normal life.
There will be more time then to develop palliative treatments, and more time for the federal government to order up the test kits and ventilators needed nationwide. There will be more time to gather data about which regions, and which people, are most at risk.
But the United States has passed the point where aggressive, targeted efforts at tracking and containment, like those pursued by South Korea, have a realistic chance of success. And calls for voluntary social distancing have had mixed results, as the photos of spring breakers crammed together on the Florida beaches last week made clear.
We are not suggesting that Trump has the authority to order a national lockdown, much less advocating that he attempt to enforce one. Instead, we are urging him to use the bully pulpit to put pressure on, and provide political cover for, governors to take the hard steps that are needed.
As the president’s own health advisers warn, the worst of the coronavirus pandemic is yet to come. The nation’s slow and spotty response has allowed the virus to spread to every state. Modeling by researchers at the Imperial College London indicates that upward of 2 million lives could be lost to the pandemic unless America somehow manages to “flatten the curve.”
Some cities and states, and even entire nations, already have lockdowns in place. On Tuesday, India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, ordered a “total ban” on leaving home for the population of 1.3 billion, for the next three weeks. He warned, “If you can’t handle these 21 days, this country will go back 21 years.”
Other countries have opted for narrower restrictions, and enforcement has varied. But patchwork approaches, like the one the United States defaulted to in the absence of a national plan, have proved inadequate.
The coronavirus can spread so quickly that to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed, the restrictions need to be sweeping, they need to be uniform across jurisdictions and they need to be put in place now. It may already be too late for New York, despite the urgent efforts of state and local governments.
Everyone shares Trump’s concern for the economy. But this is not a moment for mere salesmanship, for conjuring a cheerful vision rather than facing reality. It’s a moment for providing a plan. On Tuesday, Trump said he’d “love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter,” which falls this year on April 12. Who wouldn’t? But wishing will not make it so. This crisis has not turned a corner — it hasn’t even hit yet.
Rather than raising false expectations of a rapid and full return to business as usual, the president needs to be pursuing even more drastic measures. He should announce that, within 24 hours, all nonessential businesses should be shut and residents directed to remain in their homes except for vital trips out, such as to obtain food or medical care. Provisions can be made for people to walk in outdoor public spaces, so long as they maintain a distance of at least 6 feet.
Two weeks from now, with more testing, we will also have a far better sense of where infections are clustered if more people confine their movements to a limited number of places.
Trump has proclaimed himself a “war president.” Why, then, won’t he rally Americans around this cause? Winning this war will require shared sacrifice, and tremendous short-term hardship for Americans. But failure would mean devastating loss of life and prolonged, widespread economic pain.
Of course, even extreme social distancing and withdrawal is no panacea. The Trump administration will need to take other steps to stop the spread of this disease.
Lines of authority and policy aims need to be clarified within the White House. Vice President Mike Pence is the official crisis czar, but Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, has his own response team working on, among other things, outreach to the private sector. Certain senior aides, with business leaders whispering in their ears, are at odds with some health advisers about what restrictions are needed and how heavy the government’s hand should be. There has been much grumbling among people both inside and outside the administration that it’s hard to tell who’s running the show. That is complicating decision-making at all levels.
Federalism is integral to American government, but the administration needs to get serious about running a coordinated national response. When Trump effectively told governors, You’re on your own. Go find your own supplies in the marketplace , he at least gave states greater purchasing flexibility. But he also set up a free-for-all in which states are now bidding against one another — as well as against municipalities, the federal government and other nations — for scarce resources such as protective equipment and ventilators. This causes not only price competition but also misallocation of resources, as each state scrambles to amass its own stockpile, regardless of relative need.
This editorial board is reluctant to grant any White House more executive power, much less this one, given its track record. But in this case, there is no one else to coordinate at the national level. It is the federal government’s job to look at the big picture, tracking where needed resources are available and deciding where they should go. Systems must be set up to provide for quickly shifting equipment and workers from areas with low levels of infection toward those in dire need.
There are encouraging signs that the White House is moving in this direction, albeit belatedly. On Tuesday, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Peter Gaynor, announced that his agency would make its first use of the Defense Production Act to speed procurement of test kits, protective masks and other equipment needed to fight the virus. Later in the day, Vice President Mike Pence said that 2,000 ventilators were en route to New York state from the national emergency stockpile, with another 2,000 being dispatched on Wednesday. The state estimates it will need 30,000 of the machines.
There remains a drastic shortage of not only protective gear and other equipment but also hospital capacity in hard-hit areas. The administration should use the Defense Production Act to ramp up assembly and distribution of much-needed medical supplies where it makes sense. The president also should fully mobilize the National Guard, with an assist from active-duty military and reserves, to tackle projects such as erecting field hospitals and setting up drive-through testing centers.
It’s time to put an end to the free-form daily task force briefings featuring the president, the vice president and a rotating cast of other officials. They are a poor use of time for most of the participants and, worse, have repeatedly served up confusing and even false information. The president should tap a respected figure, preferably someone apolitical and with experience in crisis management, to serve as the point person for these briefings. When developments merit, other officials can be brought in to address specific topics.
All this may seem like an overreaction to a health crisis that many Americans aren’t yet feeling. But though it has already wasted time and opportunities to contain the coronavirus, the United States still has a chance to apply hard lessons learned by China, Italy and other nations. A nationwide lockdown is the only tactic left to parry a viral adversary that is constantly on the move, and to buy the time for medical workers to prepare for what comes next.

Texto completo: Listening to our marginally articulate president the other night, I suddenly understood: The economy wasn’t merely his pride. It was more like his lover. He can’t get enough of it. He won’t be kept from it.
Ain’t no mountain high enough. Ain’t no pandemic grim enough.
Briefing after briefing, I see it, sense it: how he itches to feel that rush again. He digresses from the terrifying present and uncertain future to revisit the heady past, when he lavished trinkets on the Dow and it purred on cue, telling him how potent he was.
Having it turn on him is more than he can bear. It has addled him — I mean even further. “Our country wasn’t built to be shut down,” he said during the White House briefing Monday evening, as if other countries planned their own obsolescence. He repeated those words — “this is not a country that was built for this; it was not built to be shut down” — and then trotted them out yet again at a town hall on Fox News on Tuesday, apparently convinced that their profundity demanded it.
He also boasted — for the zillionth time — about how the economy just before the pandemic was the best economy ever . Those lips! Those eyes! They’d be reunited, he and his amour. They’d be together again when the credits rolled.
My metaphor may be lighthearted, but my concern sure as hell isn’t. There are tough choices ahead, because what’s necessary to save lives and what’s necessary to salvage livelihoods are in tension. Our leaders have to figure out how much disruption is too much disruption.
That’s the calculus that Trump is signaling with his and his allies’ new favorite refrain: “We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem.”
That’s what was on his mind when, during the Monday briefing, he insisted that the health and economic threats of the coronavirus were separable. “We are not going to let it turn into a long-lasting financial problem,” he said. “It started out as a purely medical problem, and it’s not going to go beyond that.”
News flash: It already has. But that aside, the president is acknowledging a genuine and intensifying debate over whether social distancing, if enforced too rigidly and for too long, could leave so many people destitute, isolated and despairing that what America sacrifices rivals what it gains.
“Look, you’re going to lose a number of people to the flu,” he said during the town hall. “But you’re going to lose more people by putting a country into a massive recession or depression.”
That unease is hardly confined to the president and to glib conservative supporters of his like Dan Patrick, the 69-year-old lieutenant governor of Texas, who said in an interview on Fox News on Monday night: “I’m not living in fear of COVID-19. What I’m living in fear of is what’s happening to this country. And you know, Tucker, no one reached out to me and said, ‘As a senior citizen, are you willing to take a chance on your survival, in exchange for keeping the America that all America loves for your children and grandchildren?’ And if that’s the exchange, I’m all in.”
The issue of trade-offs and of how best to balance epidemiological and economic concerns has informed many articles in the Opinion pages of The New York Times, receiving more measured consideration from my colleague Tom Friedman, from two academic titans and from a public-health expert, David Katz, who recently wrote, “I am deeply concerned that the social, economic and public health consequences of this near total meltdown of normal life — schools and businesses closed, gatherings banned — will be long lasting and calamitous, possibly graver than the direct toll of the virus itself.”
That perspective transcends political party. A prominent Democrat, for instance, said to me, “Will we lose more Americans to suicide than to the coronavirus?” That was days before Trump, during the town hall, said that if the country is locked down for long, “you’re going to have suicides by the thousands.”
This is excruciatingly tough stuff, and yet Trump is preempting the thorough and thoughtful deliberation that it demands — and painting himself into a corner — with pledges that the economy will roar back and that America will “be open for business very soon, a lot sooner than three or four months that somebody was suggesting — a lot sooner,” as he said Monday. If you’re an enemy of “soon,” you’re on thin ice with him. I can hear it cracking under Anthony Fauci even as I type.
The president’s obsession with the economy is an extension of his obsession with wealth. He has only two lenses through which he sees the world, two yardsticks by which he measures everyone and everything: money and celebrity. He can’t pretend otherwise because he doesn’t bother to try.
During Sunday evening’s briefing, when he was supposed to be comforting Americans on the precipice of financial ruin, he instead lamented the billions of dollars he had supposedly forgone to be president. Our self-glorifying “wartime president” morphed into a self-pitying Daddy Warbucks.
“I think it’s very hard for rich people to run for office,” he said. “It’s far more costly. It’s a very tough thing. Now, with all of that being said, I’m so glad I’ve done it. Because, you know, there are a lot rich people around. I’ve got a lot of rich friends, but they can’t help and they can’t do what I’ve done, in terms of helping this country.” I’m glad he’s glad. Scratch that. I’m dumbfounded.
It has been observed, accurately, that he’s exactly the wrong leader for this crisis because he has thinned the ranks of responsible professionals in government, because he has hollowed out relevant departments and agencies, because he devalues science, because he degrades information and because he parted ways with credibility years ago.
But it’s worse than that. He’s facing judgment calls that require an emotional depth and moral finesse that simply don’t exist in him. America is relying on him, of all presidents, to care as much about vital signs as about dollar signs.
He did that when he asked the nation to stand still for 15 days, but can he continue to do it? I’d have doubts if the economy were merely the biggest of many bragging points for him, if it were just a major part of his political profile.
But it’s all-defining and all-consuming, the repository of his vanity and an expression of his virility. And clear thinking is sometimes impossible — and conscience inaccessible — when you’re this crazy in love.

Texto completo: Restaurant dining rooms, as well as many entire restaurants, have closed. We're staying home, doing the right thing to prevent the rapid spread of COVID-19.
In short, it's time to cook.
Introducing the Cap Times Quarantine Cookbook Club. Every week, we'll bring you recipe ideas drawn from our personal cookbook collections for weeknight suppers, simple lunches and longer-term projects if you're feeling ambitious.
Please submit your own thoughts, ideas and favorite recipes to us at lchristians@madison.com. Tell us why you love them! Chris Lay and I will be talking about this on The Corner Table, Cap Times' food and drink podcast (available wherever you get your podcasts and at omny.fm/shows/the-corner-table).
Things are tough. Let's cook up some comfort.
Week One
Harvest roast chicken with grapes, olives and shallots from Smitten Kitchen by Deb Perelman - Made with bone-in chicken thighs, this dish is sweet, salty and utterly comforting. It's easiest with pitted kalamatas, but I also love it with Castelvetrano olives. The herbs-on-top thing doesn't work as well if your rosemary is tough and stemmy from being in the fridge; use your judgment or it's like chewing on pine needles.
Freezer chocolate chip cookies, by David Leite in the New York Times - Make a big batch of these, freeze them in balls for an hour or two, and then put them in a bag in a freezer. Bake at 350 degrees for 14-16 minutes and you've got cookies anytime. I've used all purpose flour in place of bread flour and it's fine, but the flaky (Maldon) salt on top is essential.
Pork chops with snow peas, mint and feta from Melissa Clark in the New York Times - For me, few recipe writers are as reliable as Melissa Clark, and I've already dubbed her the culinary angel of my self quarantine. Searing meat inside the house can get smoky, so we adapted this for the grill on a nice evening. I also added radishes, because I am trying to think spring.
Shrimp pad Thai with sugar snap peas and basil from "Dinner: Changing the Game" by Melissa Clark - If you buy one cookbook this week to help you through, let it be this 2017 gem from our friend Melissa. I have easily cooked three dozen recipes out of this book, from tofu and lentils to marinated steak, seared pork chops and fish tacos. She makes use of flavor boosters like kimchi, harissa and miso. If she can use one pot instead of three, she does. When I made this shrimp recipe (from the book) I used five ounces of bean thread noodles - soak 10 minutes in warm water - and added red bell pepper. I love this cookbook so much that when I lent it to a friend recently, I considered buying a new copy instead of asking her for it back. I want everyone to have it!
Black pepper steak and Caesar salad from "The Home Cook: Recipes to know by heart" by Alex Guarnaschelli - I've checked out this cookbook three times from the library already, so clearly I need to buy it. Guarnaschelli is known for her work on The Food Network, and her cookbook is full of updated classics and reliable comfort food. Among my favorite chapters are "Supermarket Mushrooms Made Sexy" and "Salads for Every Season." Anchovies and capers make this dressing something I can't stop dunking veggies into.
Pancetta, white bean and Swiss chard pot pie from "Smitten Kitchen" - So long as I'm making pie dough and my Instant Pot is in heavy rotation, I figured I should do some pot pies, that classic comfort food. I sent my partner out for Tuscan kale to sub in for the chard, but stores were out (Madison does love kale) so I'm using rainbow chard and collard greens, as well as small white beans from Rancho Gordo called Alubia Blanca.
Olive oil-roasted chicken with caramelized carrots by Alison Roman for the New York Times - I've been in a pretty serious Alison Roman phase for the last year or so. I have both her cookbooks ("Dining In" and "Nothing Fancy") and I'd be hard pressed to recommend one over the other; they're both excellent. This recipe for bone-in whole chicken legs with slow-cooked carrots was part of a special section NYT did in February of one pot recipes. I'm leaning on it a lot these first few weeks. (I also recommend Roman's vinegar chicken with crushed olive dressing. Excellent!)
Non-recipe recipes - For quick at-home lunches this week, I steamed red and golden beets and picked up some Hook's Blue Paradise to top spinach salads, adding chickpeas, shaved celery and cherry tomatoes. I've been doing a Dijon red wine vinaigrette with a clove of garlic, because my cats don't care what my breath smells like.
Delicata squash, caramelized onion and sage hand pies from "Sister Pie" by Lisa Ludwinski - Right before the world closed its doors on gatherings of food-lovers, Ludwinski flew to Madison from Michigan to show an eager group of folks at Madison College how to make her all-butter pie dough. Her cookbook, subtitled "The Recipes and Stories of a Big-Hearted Bakery in Detroit," is full of amazing looking recipes I should not bake until I'm allowed to see my coworkers again. These hand pies, small and savory, are a lunch-friendly exception.
Spiced chickpea stew with coconut and turmeric by Alison Roman for the New York Times - I am not sure how common it is for recipes to go viral if your last name isn't "Ottolenghi" or "Child." Alison Roman's chickpea stew did, though, and it just goes by "The Stew" now. Watch her make it on YouTube. I plan to break her rules, one of which is don't lighten it - the recipe calls for two whole cans of full-fat coconut milk. I'm going to use one can of light coconut milk and one can's worth of homemade chicken broth. News at 11.
Chana masala from the Indian Instant Pot Cookbook by Urvashi Pitre - I'm usually nonplussed by recipes with a lot of subrecipes (make the chutney and the dressing and the garnish and THEN you can make the dish). For this, though, I was happy to pre-make the onion masala - a mix of caramelized onion, spices and tomatoes - which makes Indian meals at home so much faster. Also on my list? Aloo gobi (cauliflower and potatoes) and chicken vindaloo, which involved a spicy, saucy marinade. For a taste of Petri's work, check out her keto/low carb-friendly blog, twosleevers.com.

Texto completo: What is the price of normalcy: 100,000 deaths, or 1.1 million?
How many lives should we put at risk to prevent the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression?
This the central question President Trump put on the table Tuesday when he said that he'd like the country “opened up and just raring to go" by Easter. It's the stuff of Philosophy 101, except real lives — and livelihoods — are on the line.
His wrongheaded fixation on a specific date has turned attention away from discussing ways to improve our coronavirus strategy — starting with getting a better handle on the fight we're in.
A model developed by experts at Imperial College in London suggests that as many as 1.1 million people in the United States could die within year if authorities don't move quickly and more aggressively than they have to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. Conversely, a Beijing-style national home confinement could sharply limit the death toll, but last into the summer.
“If the United States intervenes immediately on the scale that China did, our death toll could be under 100,000," Ezekiel J. Emanuel, vice provost of global initiatives at the University of Pennsylvania," wrote Monday in The New York Times. “Within three to four months we might be able to begin a return to more normal lives."
For Trump, the trade-off to the economy is too costly. Otherwise, he said, a “massive recession or depression" that would cost even more lives and lead to “instability."
Public health experts dismissed Trump's Easter deadline as reckless. It would require cities and states to lift drastic but necessary restrictions they put into place to slow the spread of the coronavirus while the pandemic was still raging. Surging deaths and an overwhelmed health system would wreak economic havoc.
Even Trump's coronavirus advisers tried to walk back his comments.
But no one dismisses the severe economic damage already being caused by the stay-in-place and social-distancing measures ordered by states including Massachusetts, New York, and California. Yes, Wall Street is getting pummeled, but so is Main Street, and millions of Americans could soon be out of work.
Is three or four months of home confinement across the country our only option?
Perhaps not, even if Trump's Easter rebellion is doomed to fail.
The fight against coronavirus has been hampered by the lack of comprehensive data. Experts are still not sure how fast it may spread through the country and how many deaths it will cause. That has left political leaders and public health officials little choice but to err on the side of extreme caution.
“We need really good data on who has the disease — their ages, their gender, their conditions, morbidity rates," said Brad Cornell, a consultant and emeritus professor of finance at the University of California Los Angeles. “And we need all the testing we can get and data on who has recovered and could go back to work."
That data could be available, and the number-crunching started, in a matter of weeks, not months, Cornell said. Then mayors and governors could within weeks begin making informed trade-offs between choking off the virus and giving the economy some breathing room.
“I am sure it will be somewhere in the middle" he said. “The million-dollar question is where in the middle."
Cornell is a business guy, not an epidemiologist. What do the medical pros say?
Respected Trump adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci said Tuesday that blanket restrictions across the country aren't necessarily the only approach. Parts of the country with relatively minor outbreaks could return to normal faster than hot spots such as New York City.
“You may not want to essentially treat it as just one force for the entire country, but look at flexibility in different areas," Fauci said at the White House. “So I think people might get the misinterpretation you're just going to lift everything up. … That's not going to happen. It's going to be looking at the data. And what we don't have right now that we really do need, is we need to know what's going on in those areas of the country where there isn't an obvious outbreak."
But, Fauci has yet to commit to a timetable.
Fauci has become adept at maneuvering around his boss's blunders, but his comments are more than damage control. They suggest that containing the COVID-19 isn't necessarily a one-size-fits-all-the-country solution. What worked in China isn't the perfect model for the United States.
“Every sector of society would like to hasten the easing of the current restrictions, and for many good reasons," said Dr. Robert W. Amler, dean of the School of Health Sciences and Practice at New York Medical College. “It seems too early to tell how much longer the rising tide of cases will obligate us to continue these restrictions ... but I do believe it is vital to reassess the situation on a daily basis and consider the pros and cons of alternate strategies at every juncture."
Pretending the worst is over by throwing a national Easter party would only deepen the human and financial toll of the pandemic. But that doesn't mean it's inevitable that we will all be stuck at home until July 4.

Texto completo: The claim: Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, human environmental impact has decreased
As COVID-19 infections climb beyond 400,000 cases globally, and as countries have increasingly responded with lockdowns and shelter-in-place directives, social media users are pointing to signs of environmental progress as a hopeful prospect amid the viral pandemic.
One March 17 Facebook post with nearly 200,000 comments claims “The Earth has already began showing signs of amazing things that are happening from the absence of human pollution. "
“This really shouldn’t be seen as a silver lining,” McGill University associate professor and epidemiologist Jill Baumgartner told the New York Times. “It’s not a sustainable way to reduce air pollution, and the long-term economic and well-being impacts of this crisis are going to be devastating for many people. ”
Although air pollution has decreased, experts say the effects are only temporary. And, viral social media posts of wildlife retaking developed areas are misrepresenting the facts.
Social distancing because of COVID-19 has temporarily decreased air pollution
Since social distancing practices have been enacted across the U. S. , cities are showing decreased air pollution. Using emissions-detecting satellite images, the New York Times reported "huge declines in pollution over major metropolitan areas, including Los Angeles, Seattle, New York, Chicago and Atlanta. "
The satellite images detect atmospheric levels of nitrogen dioxide, a gas released into the air when fuel is burned. The Environmental Protection Agency explains, “NO2 forms from emissions from cars, trucks and buses, power plants, and off-road equipment. ”
The New York Times attributes the cities’ low NO2 levels to decreased transportation due to social distancing practices.
During the COVID-19 outbreak, China saw drastic reductions in NO2 levels that began near Wuhan and spread across the county. The March 17 Facebook post pointed to these levels as evidence of decreased human environmental impact.
“In (January and February) of 2020, NO2 values in eastern and central China were significantly lower (from 10 to 30 percent lower) than what is normally observed for this time period,” according to NASA.
NASA Goddard Space Flight Center air quality researcher Dr. Fei Liu also said in the post by NASA on its website that, “This year, the reduction rate is more significant than in past years and it has lasted longer… I am not surprised because many cities nationwide have taken measures to minimize spread of the virus. ”
The European Space Agency's early March data shows that NO2 levels have increased since normal activity has begun to resume in China.
Canals in Venice are visibly clearer, but not cleaner
The March 17 Facebook post also pointed to recent clarity of the trademark canals in Venice as evidence of decreased pollution.
But on March 16, the Venice Mayor’s Office told CNN that was not the case.
"The water now looks clearer because there is less traffic on the canals, allowing the sediment to stay at the bottom," the Venice mayor’s office said. "It's because there is less boat traffic that usually brings sediment to the top of the water's surface. "
The mayor’s office did report decreased air pollution, similar to that seen in China and U. S. cities.
Animals aren’t retaking Italian waterways; they were already there
The Facebook post also described dolphin sightings off Italy as an environmental improvement. Other social media users have reported swan and dolphin sightings as evidence of decreased human impact during the viral pandemic.
National Geographic and Snopes recently debunked those claims.
One tweet with more than a million views showed a video of a dolphin swimming along an embankment and was captioned, “Venice hasn't seen clear canal water in a very long time. Dolphins showing up too. Nature just hit the reset button on us. ”
National Geographic reported, “The 'Venetian' dolphins were filmed at a port in Sardinia, in the Mediterranean Sea, hundreds of miles away. ”
Dolphins are not a rare sight in Sardinia, an Italian island in the Mediterranean Sea, where dolphin-watching is a common tourist attraction.
Another tweet with a million likes claimed swans returned to Venice as “an unexpected side effect of the pandemic. ”
National Geographic reported, “The swans in the viral posts regularly appear in the canals of Burano, a small island in the greater Venice metropolitan area. ”
The Twitter user later told National Geographic that she lived in New Delhi, India, saw the swan photos online and mistakenly claimed they had “returned” to Venice. She hasn’t deleted her tweet and says she does not plan to because it got so many likes.
The Facebook user that posted the March 17 post has not responded to USA TODAY’s request for comment.
Our ruling: Partly False
We rate this claim PARTLY FALSE because some of the assertions about pollution and the environment were not supported by our research. There is decreased air pollution in areas practicing social distancing, however, air quality will likely revert to its previous state once normal activity resumes as cities and countries manage to quell the virus outbreak as has been the case in China. The Venice canals are clearer, but they are not cleaner. And social media users are mistakenly identifying normal wildlife activity as an abnormal effect of reduced human activity during the viral pandemic.
As National Geographic explained, “The phenomenon highlights how quickly eye-popping, too-good-to-be-true rumors can spread in times of crisis. People are compelled to share posts that make them emotional. ”

Texto completo: The coronavirus has infected far more people in the United States than testing has shown so far, and stringent measures to limit social contact in parts of the country not yet seeing many cases are needed to significantly stem the tide of illness and death in the coming months.
Those are the conclusions of Columbia University researchers who used a New York Times database of known cases and Census Bureau transportation data to model how the outbreak could evolve based on what is known about the virus. The estimates are inherently uncertain, and they could change as the U.S. adopts unprecedented measures to control the outbreak.
But they offer a stark warning: Even if the country managed to cut its rate of transmission in half - a tall order - about 650,000 people might become infected in the next two months.
The growth is driven by Americans with mild symptoms who are carrying and spreading the virus without being aware that they have it, the researchers say. The number of undetected cases - 11 times the total that has been officially reported, they estimate - reflects how far behind the U.S. has fallen in testing for the virus.
New York City, Seattle, Boston and parts of California already have such large outbreaks that they will probably see significant growth even after taking extraordinary measures over the past week, the researchers say. New York City's outbreak, the nation's largest, grew to more than 4,000 known cases Friday and is likely to increase many times over even in a favorable scenario.
On the other hand, parts of the country without large clusters of cases could still avoid the worst of the outbreak - if they impose measures like closing schools, banning mass gatherings and testing and quarantining sick people and their contacts. The epidemic would then spread inland at a much slower pace and strike with less severity, the estimates say.
But controls would need to be put in place immediately and everywhere.
"We're looking at something that's catastrophic on a level that we have not seen for an infectious disease since 1918," said Jeffrey Shaman, a professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia and the leader of the research team, referring to the Spanish flu. "And it's requiring sacrifices we haven't seen since World War II. There are going to be enormous disruptions. There's no easy way out."
Controls in many places have already changed the fabric of American life. Restaurants and schools have closed, people are working from home, and travelers have put off trips - all changes that should reduce the rate of infection.
In California, New York and Illinois, officials have announced more stringent directives aimed at stopping the spread. That means that at least 1 in 5 Americans will be under orders to stay home in the coming days, and more states are expected to follow suit.
But other places have resisted. Bars and restaurants remain open in Wichita, Kansas, in a county that reported its first case Thursday, and in Knoxville, Tennessee, where reports of the virus have been scarce. Some malls' recreational marijuana shops in Oregon and some retail chains nationwide remained open. Many businesses are still requiring workers to come into the office.
The scenarios do not estimate what effect individual local actions will have on the outbreak. But if the country as a whole does not take collective action, they suggest that Sedgwick County in Kansas, could see a significant proportion of its population - hundreds of thousands of people - infected with the virus in the next two months. If the country, as a whole, can reduce rates of transmission by 50%, Sedgwick County could instead see fewer than 1,000 cases in that time.
Several researchers not involved in the Columbia University analysis who reviewed the findings said they made sense and broadly agreed with their own thinking. Even in places that now appear to have few cases, they said, officials should act sooner rather than later.
"You have to think of this as an insurance for the future: The earlier you do it, the greater effect you have on the virus," said Alessandro Vespignani, director of the Network Science Institute at Northeastern University, who said the estimates were in line with his own projections. "It's better to take excessive precautions than not."
The Columbia researchers' model works by observing the behavior of the outbreak in the U.S. up until March 13, based on case records compiled by The New York Times, commuting patterns and other data.
The researchers use those observations to infer key features of the outbreak. One is how many people each infected person has tended to infect so far, about 2.2.
Another is how many people may pass on the virus without knowing that they have it. The disease is spreading far too fast to be explained by known cases alone, and only about 1 in 11 infections have been reported, they found.
Those factors allow the researchers to simulate the spread of a virus in the future. They adjust those simulations under different scenarios in which the nation imposes a range of control measures to stop the spread.
The estimates are imperfect, but they are consistent with available data. It is impossible to know the exact number of cases a week ago or to predict the future. It is also impossible to model the precise effect of unprecedented measures that the U.S. has already put in place to control the outbreak.
But the research estimates that if measures to slow the disease are not effective, the virus could sicken millions of people or more, losing steam on the coasts in May before spreading to the rest of the country over the summer.
A model estimates how many people could get the virus in each county in the United States by two months from now. Two scenarios envision what might happen if overall transmission is cut by 50% and by 25% from what it has been so far. A third scenario - which is unlikely - simulates what could happen without any intervention.
New York City, the model indicates, could count tens of thousands of new cases every day by late spring or early summer. But if the city remains vigilant about maintaining the stringent measures recently put in place, the peak could be delayed by weeks or longer and be significantly lower, the model suggests. Shaman cautioned that the model is designed to capture national trends, and local projections should be viewed as broad estimates.
"This is serious, and this is real. We have to act now and act aggressive," Vespignani said. "We have to mobilize all the resources that we have. None of us has a single solution. But we have to try all of them."

The researchers use those observations to infer key features of the outbreak. One is how many people each infected person has tended to infect so far, about 2.2.
Another is how many people may pass on the virus without knowing that they have it. The disease is spreading far too fast to be explained by known cases alone, and only about 1 in 11 infections have been reported, they found.
Those factors allow the researchers to simulate the spread of a virus in the future. They adjust those simulations under different scenarios in which the nation imposes a range of control measures to stop the spread.
The estimates are imperfect, but they are consistent with available data. It is impossible to know the exact number of cases a week ago or to predict the future. It is also impossible to model the precise effect of unprecedented measures that the U.S. has already put in place to control the outbreak.
But the research estimates that if measures to slow the disease are not effective, the virus could sicken millions of people or more, losing steam on the coasts in May before spreading to the rest of the country over the summer.
A model estimates how many people could get the virus in each county in the United States by two months from now. Two scenarios envision what might happen if overall transmission is cut by 50% and by 25% from what it has been so far. A third scenario - which is unlikely - simulates what could happen without any intervention.
New York City, the model indicates, could count tens of thousands of new cases every day by late spring or early summer. But if the city remains vigilant about maintaining the stringent measures recently put in place, the peak could be delayed by weeks or longer and be significantly lower, the model suggests. Shaman cautioned that the model is designed to capture national trends, and local projections should be viewed as broad estimates.
"This is serious, and this is real. We have to act now and act aggressive," Vespignani said. "We have to mobilize all the resources that we have. None of us has a single solution. But we have to try all of them."

Texto completo: Journalist Alan A. Finder, who worked for Newsday and spent the bulk of his diverse career as a reporter and editor for The New York Times, died Tuesday after testing positive earlier this month for the novel coronavirus COVID-19, Times executive editor Dean Baquet said in a statement. He was 72.
Baquet called Finder, who retired in December 2011 after more than 28 years of service,  "a generous and patient colleague." "He was one of Metro's stars in the 1980s and 1990s, a big writer in a big, hugely competitive era for New York City news," Baquet said.
Finder, of Ridgewood, New Jersey, also worked at The Record in Hackensack.
Newsday assistant managing editor for investigations Martin Gottlieb, who worked with Finder at The Record and brought him to Newsday as a freelance editor on "Pathway to Power," which became an award-winning investigation of the rise of Oheka Castle owner Gary Melius through "Long Island's cozy political system," recalled Finder Tuesday as "unflappable" and "masterful."
"He had a tremendous amount of humility, too, and he never felt he was better than anyone else," Gottlieb said. 
"He was just a good soul."
Born Feb. 19, 1948, in Brooklyn, Finder grew up in Nassau County, colleagues said, then received a BA degree in history from the University of Rochester in 1969 and a master's in American Studies from Yale University in 1972. He went to work for The Record from 1974 to 1979, covering local news and projects and serving as Sunday city editor.
Finder then joined Newsday as a reporter, covering local news, politics, energy and projects between 1979 and 1983, before leaving the paper for the Times.
During a career that spanned decades, Finder covered news-side beats that included City Hall, housing, labor and transportation, Baquet said, and served as acting bureau chief at the Times' City Hall bureau from June 1986 into 1987. Among notable projects was a nine-part series on Mayor Ed Koch, as well as 1987, 1990 and 1991 projects on assessments in New York City, a two-part series on affirmative action in city contracting, and a 1995 look at modern-day sweatshops in the city. 
He also served as a Metro enterprise reporter from 1994 to 1999, sports enterprise editor from 1999 to 2005, and an education reporter from May 2005 to April 2008, when he became an assistant editor on the foreign desk, according to his bio on LinkedIn.
Gottlieb and Newsday reporter Sandra Peddie said Finder played a key role on the Melius project. Finder was initially slated to be an extra set of eyes on the complex 2018 project but ended up as the main editor when Gottlieb was sidelined by a medical emergency.
"Alan was asked to take on a huge, somewhat controversial project with reporters he didn't know, and he handled it with extraordinary aplomb," Peddie recalled Tuesday, adding: "We all came to appreciate his intelligence, his journalistic smarts and his sense of humor. He really didn't let much rattle him, even the long commute he made from New Jersey to get to Long Island."
The series won the Society of Silurians President's Choice Medallion, the New York News Publishers Association award for distinguished investigative reporting, the New York Press Club Golden Keyboard Award, first place in the New York State Associated Press Association investigative watchdog reporting category, and the Long Island Press Club Robert W. Greene public service award.
"He was so down to earth - he never got caught up in the pretentiousness some journalists have about their important work - and yet he really understood what a difference we made every day," Peddie said. Most important, she noted, was this simple postscript: "The world is a much sadder place without him."
Finder is survived by his wife, Elaine Isaacson, as well as daughter Lauren Elizabeth Drucker and son Jason Finder.

Texto completo: The thinning ranks of doctors and nurses, particularly in Spain, are hampering the ability to fight the epidemic, straining hospitals and raising fears that health workers are spreading the coronavirus.
MADRID -- Across Western Europe, health care professionals have used the language of war to describe the struggle against the coronavirus, which has left some hospitals on the brink of collapse.
And health care workers are the soldiers on the front lines.
Out of Spain's 40,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, 5,400 -- nearly 14 percent -- are medical professionals, the health ministry said on Tuesday. No other country has reported health care staff accounting for a double-digit percentage of total infections.
But the problem is widespread throughout Europe. In Italy, France and Spain, more than 30 health care professionals have died of the coronavirus, and thousands of others have had to self-isolate.
In Brescia province, the center of Italy's outbreak, 10 to 15 percent of doctors and nurses have been infected and put out of commission, according to a doctor there.
In France, the public hospital system in Paris has tallied 490 infected staff members, a small but growing proportion of the system's 100,000 or so employees.
The same dynamics are starting to take hold in Britain and the United States, where the contagion is bearing down but has yet to fully bite.
At the La Paz hospital in Madrid, one of the largest in Spain's capital, 426 employees -- 6 percent of the medical staff -- are isolated at home, after testing positive or showing possible symptoms of the coronavirus, according to internal numbers provided by a labor union that represents doctors in Madrid.
At the smaller Igualada hospital in Catalonia, a third of the 1,000 hospital staff has been sent home.
"The virus was already among us when we were really only testing those who came from Wuhan and then from Italy," said Ángela Hernández Puente, a doctor who is the deputy secretary general of the doctors' union. "Some of our doctors unfortunately worked without adequate protection and acted as vectors."
As doctors, nurses and other practitioners fall sick, the burdens increase on health care systems already groaning under the strain of an expanding epidemic. And infected workers and their hospitals are increasingly being recognized as vectors for the spread of the virus.
The number of cases in Spain has been doubling every four days, and the country is fast shaping up as Europe's next epicenter of the contagion. On Tuesday, Spain's coronavirus toll reached 2,700 dead, the second-highest in Europe after Italy.
In Madrid, the focus of Spain's outbreak, so many are dying that bodies are being placed in an Olympic-sized ice skating rink that has been converted into an emergency morgue.
In some retirement homes, soldiers deployed to disinfect the premises found elderly people abandoned, or dead in their beds, prompting Spain's public prosecutors to open an investigation.
It has not helped that Spain's population, on average, is among the world's oldest. But the government was also late to impose restrictions on the movement of people.
Even as a tragedy unfolded in northern Italy, mass events went ahead earlier this month in Madrid, and the government waited until March 14 to declare a state of emergency that has since forced people to stay indoors, barring exceptional circumstances.
Spain also did not shore up its stock of medical equipment early on. Doctors and nurses have had to work with a dangerous shortage of masks, gloves and other essential gear that has proved disastrous for them.
The grim situation has left many of Spain's health care professionals overwhelmed and pleading for more equipment, doctors, nurses and ambulance crews have told The New York Times. For those who have been infected, a feeling of powerlessness has sunk in.
"You are used to taking care of others and now you're being asked to stay home and take care of yourself," said Marc Arnaiz, a doctor in the internal medicine unit of the Igualada hospital, who tested positive earlier this month.
"For most of us this job is a vocation, so it's shocking and frustrating," he said.
Mr. Arnaiz, 31, said he had likely been infected by a patient. He noticed the first symptoms on March 9, the day his patient was confirmed positive, among the first in the hospital, which has since become one of the worst infection clusters in northeastern Spain.
While it's impossible to know how many patients infected doctors and vice versa, the alarming spread within hospitals has forced the government to struggle with a shortage of both professionals and equipment.
Last week, the government launched an emergency recruitment plan to add 50,000 health care workers, ranging from medical students to retired doctors.
After employees began complaining openly about the stresses on the system, some Madrid hospitals told their staff not to speak out. Many of those interviewed by The New York Times were not authorized to comment publicly and asked that their full names not be used for fear of retribution.
One, Yolanda, has been a nurse for 30 years, working in a public hospital in Madrid. But earlier this month, as the outbreak worsened in Spain, she said she was moved instead to a makeshift emergency ward, where she had to learn new skills on the job while working without decent protective gear.
"We've been put on the front line not only without enough protection, but also sometimes with the stress of a very different work environment," she said, noting that she had never before handled intubated patients. The nurses in her unit wore face masks and gowns, but they had to reuse them because of a shortage.
"Putting on a face mask again and again is as useless as sticking a piece of paper on your face," she said.
Last Thursday, Yolanda went home feeling feverish. On Sunday, she tested positive for coronavirus, along with about 30 colleagues. "We have done our best, but some of us sadly became part of the contamination chain," she said.
Hospital workers' unions were less hesitant to point fingers.
"When we already knew that the virus was circulating in hospitals, we were still being told that the usage of protective gear should be limited to specific circumstances," said Juanjo Menéndez, the communications director of SATSE Madrid, a nurses' union. "It's the kind of basic error that a student learns to avoid in the first year of medical school."
In Spain, France and Italy, officials and health care professionals said they were shocked by equipment shortages.
Giorgio Gori, the mayor of Bergamo, one of the hardest hit towns in Italy, said "the doctors weren't protected," and lacked "the sufficient defenses," adding that he was still receiving requests for masks and gloves from doctors making home visits.
Jean-Paul Hamon, the president of one of France's biggest doctor unions, told the LCI television broadcaster on Tuesday that he was particularly worried about workers who are not in hospitals but are still in close contact with patients, like general practitioners or retirement home employees.
Three of the five doctors who have died of Covid-19 so far in France were general practitioners, and one was a gynecologist. "The state is absolutely unprepared," said Mr. Hamon, who is himself infected. "The state is going to owe an explanation."
In Spain, doctors warned that hospitals were now paying the price of the loose measures announced in the early days of the outbreak.
"The lack of protection is everywhere, the improvisation seems to be widespread," said Antonio Antela, a doctor who coordinates the infectious disease unit at the university hospital of Santiago de Compostela, in northwestern Spain. He has been hospitalized for a week after developing pneumonia and testing positive.
"The lesson is: take care of your public health care system, because there will be other epidemics and we ought to be better prepared," he added in a telephone interview from his hospital bed.
At a medical center in the heart of Madrid, María, another nurse who is now isolated at home with coronavirus, said that she spent several days working without a face mask and gloves, handing out masks only to visitors who reported breathing problems or had recently been in Italy.
On March 11, the day she first felt fever, her medical center finally ordered all staff to wear masks. "We probably didn't have enough face masks, but we also acted for far too long as if this was a limited problem, mostly imported from Italy," she said.
The Spanish government is now stepping up efforts to buy medical equipment, as well as distributing about 650,000 new test kits across the country. Two Chinese cargo planes filled with face masks and other gear landed in Madrid and Zaragoza on Tuesday.
"We are a target like everybody else, but we are also a threat to other co-workers," said Juan, a 37-year-old doctor in a Madrid public hospital. "Also, if you test everyone and there's no health care workers left in the hospitals, what can you do?"

Texto completo: The coronavirus has infected far more people in the United States than testing has shown so far, and stringent measures to limit social contact in parts of the country not yet seeing many cases are needed to significantly stem the tide of illness and death in the coming months.
Those are the conclusions of Columbia University researchers who used a New York Times database of known cases and Census Bureau transportation data to model how the outbreak could evolve based on what is known about the virus. The estimates are inherently uncertain, and they could change as the U.S. adopts unprecedented measures to control the outbreak.
But they offer a stark warning: Even if the country managed to cut its rate of transmission in half - a tall order - about 650,000 people might become infected in the next two months.
The growth is driven by Americans with mild symptoms who are carrying and spreading the virus without being aware that they have it, the researchers say. The number of undetected cases - 11 times the total that has been officially reported, they estimate - reflects how far behind the U.S. has fallen in testing for the virus.
New York City, Seattle, Boston and parts of California already have such large outbreaks that they will probably see significant growth even after taking extraordinary measures over the past week, the researchers say. New York City's outbreak, the nation's largest, grew to more than 4,000 known cases Friday and is likely to increase many times over even in a favorable scenario.
On the other hand, parts of the country without large clusters of cases could still avoid the worst of the outbreak - if they impose measures like closing schools, banning mass gatherings and testing and quarantining sick people and their contacts. The epidemic would then spread inland at a much slower pace and strike with less severity, the estimates say.
But controls would need to be put in place immediately and everywhere.
"We're looking at something that's catastrophic on a level that we have not seen for an infectious disease since 1918," said Jeffrey Shaman, a professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia and the leader of the research team, referring to the Spanish flu. "And it's requiring sacrifices we haven't seen since World War II. There are going to be enormous disruptions. There's no easy way out."
Controls in many places have already changed the fabric of American life. Restaurants and schools have closed, people are working from home, and travelers have put off trips - all changes that should reduce the rate of infection.
In California, New York and Illinois, officials have announced more stringent directives aimed at stopping the spread. That means that at least 1 in 5 Americans will be under orders to stay home in the coming days, and more states are expected to follow suit.
But other places have resisted. Bars and restaurants remain open in Wichita, Kansas, in a county that reported its first case Thursday, and in Knoxville, Tennessee, where reports of the virus have been scarce. Some malls' recreational marijuana shops in Oregon and some retail chains nationwide remained open. Many businesses are still requiring workers to come into the office.
The scenarios do not estimate what effect individual local actions will have on the outbreak. But if the country as a whole does not take collective action, they suggest that Sedgwick County in Kansas, could see a significant proportion of its population - hundreds of thousands of people - infected with the virus in the next two months. If the country, as a whole, can reduce rates of transmission by 50%, Sedgwick County could instead see fewer than 1,000 cases in that time.
Several researchers not involved in the Columbia University analysis who reviewed the findings said they made sense and broadly agreed with their own thinking. Even in places that now appear to have few cases, they said, officials should act sooner rather than later.
"You have to think of this as an insurance for the future: The earlier you do it, the greater effect you have on the virus," said Alessandro Vespignani, director of the Network Science Institute at Northeastern University, who said the estimates were in line with his own projections. "It's better to take excessive precautions than not."
The Columbia researchers' model works by observing the behavior of the outbreak in the U.S. up until March 13, based on case records compiled by The New York Times, commuting patterns and other data.
The researchers use those observations to infer key features of the outbreak. One is how many people each infected person has tended to infect so far, about 2.2.
Another is how many people may pass on the virus without knowing that they have it. The disease is spreading far too fast to be explained by known cases alone, and only about 1 in 11 infections have been reported, they found.
Those factors allow the researchers to simulate the spread of a virus in the future. They adjust those simulations under different scenarios in which the nation imposes a range of control measures to stop the spread.
The estimates are imperfect, but they are consistent with available data. It is impossible to know the exact number of cases a week ago or to predict the future. It is also impossible to model the precise effect of unprecedented measures that the U.S. has already put in place to control the outbreak.
But the research estimates that if measures to slow the disease are not effective, the virus could sicken millions of people or more, losing steam on the coasts in May before spreading to the rest of the country over the summer.
A model estimates how many people could get the virus in each county in the United States by two months from now. Two scenarios envision what might happen if overall transmission is cut by 50% and by 25% from what it has been so far. A third scenario - which is unlikely - simulates what could happen without any intervention.
New York City, the model indicates, could count tens of thousands of new cases every day by late spring or early summer. But if the city remains vigilant about maintaining the stringent measures recently put in place, the peak could be delayed by weeks or longer and be significantly lower, the model suggests. Shaman cautioned that the model is designed to capture national trends, and local projections should be viewed as broad estimates.
"This is serious, and this is real. We have to act now and act aggressive," Vespignani said. "We have to mobilize all the resources that we have. None of us has a single solution. But we have to try all of them."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — An estimated 13,500 Americans abroad have asked the State Department for help returning to the United States as the coronavirus pandemic has resulted in closed borders and suspended commercial flights, two senior officials said Monday.
About 5,700 additional US citizens and legal residents have already been brought back on flights organized by the State Department.
From Peru to Morocco to Japan, stranded Americans have pleaded for help getting home as the pandemic has spread. Over the next five days, the State Department will charter 16 flights around the world to bring home another 1,600 people, said one of the officials, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity because of department protocols on briefing the news media.
About 10 million US citizens live abroad, officials said. But the officials urged Americans who have homes overseas to consider hunkering down, underscoring that the travel assistance was designed for tourists and temporary expatriates, like students. There was still room on some of the flights this week for additional passengers, said the official, who urged Americans to register at the department's travel enrollment system for information.
On Sunday, Global Guardian, an international security firm, evacuated 144 Americans who were stranded in Honduras.
“I cannot begin to express my gratitude to the entire Global Guardian team for getting my husband and I home safely to our families and lives here in Boston," Annie Perlick, a nurse at Boston's Children Hospital, said in a statement.

Biden's low profile during crisis seen as a liability
With President Trump providing daily televised briefings and governors like Andrew Cuomo emerging as national leaders during the coronavirus pandemic, former vice president Joe Biden is still grappling with how to position himself as a prominent voice .
Biden has been confined over the last week to an unusually small role for the likely — though not yet completely certain — nominee of a major political party. His public comments have been sparing and, for the most part, restrained. He has begun to ramp up a public schedule, beginning with an appearance on ABC's “The View" on Tuesday, and his aides said he would now offer remarks on camera in some fashion each day.
But Democratic strategists have said that Biden needs to be more visible at a time when Americans are looking for leadership. The challenge for Biden, they say, is to find ways to draw sharp contrasts in leadership style with Trump while showing sensitivity to the severity of the crisis.
On Monday, Biden gave a speech that was streamed live from his home in Delaware in which he criticized Trump's response to the virus as too slow and insufficient, and pressed him to act like the “wartime president" he says he is.
Neither CNN, Fox News, nor MSNBC aired his speech, instead showing a briefing by Cuomo of New York.
“Let me be clear: Donald Trump is not to blame for the coronavirus, but he does bear responsibility for our response," Biden said. “And I, along with every American, hope he steps up and starts to get this right."

Democratic convention planners look at options
Planners for the Democratic National Convention are looking at “contingency options" in case the mid-July gathering in Milwaukee can't take place because of the coronavirus, officials said Monday for the first time.
One person with knowledge of the discussions said Monday that “intensive scenario-planning" was taking place among officials from the Democratic National Committee, the convention committee and the Milwaukee host committee, who were all determining what to do about the convention, which is scheduled July 13-16 at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee.
Among the complicating factors are the uncertain nature of the professional basketball season and how the party's delegates will be selected. Delegates in most states are elected to the national convention from state conventions, but many state conventions, scheduled for late spring and early summer, are also being postponed.

Britain placed under virtual lockdown
Facing a growing storm of criticism about his laissez-faire response to the fast-spreading coronavirus, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced Monday that he would place Britain under a virtual lockdown, closing all nonessential shops, banning meetings of more than two people and requiring people to stay in their homes, except for trips for food or medicine.
People who flout the new restrictions, the prime minister said, will be fined by the police.
The steps, which Johnson outlined in a televised address to the nation, bring him into alignment with European leaders such as President Emmanuel Macron of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who have all but quarantined their countries in a desperate bid to slow the outbreak.
The prime minister said people also could leave their houses for exercise, either alone or with family members, and he did not close parks in London, which became a symbol of Britain's nonchalant response this weekend when they were thronged by people.
The number of confirmed cases in Britain rose to 6,650 on Monday, up from 5,683 a day earlier, while the death toll jumped by 54, to 335. British officials warn that the country is about two weeks behind Italy in the spread of the virus.

India halts its crucial train network to try to stop virus
As India expanded its virus-containment measures and halted its train network, the country's lifeblood, the federal government warned Monday of strict legal action for those who flout the rules.
The wholesale shutdown of India's massive train system is unprecedented.
"Please save yourself, save your family," Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted in Hindi, calling for states to follow the preventive measures issued by the federal government to contain the spread of the virus.
The strict legal action vowed wasn't immediately clear. Other places have simply sent violators home, since alternatives like detention would create crowded conditions where the virus could spread.
To contain the outbreak, authorities have gradually started to lock down much of the country of 1.3 billion people, sending stock markets to record lows.

South Africa to go into nationwide lockdown
South Africa, Africa's most industrialized economy and a nation of 57 million people, will to go into a nationwide lockdown for 21 days starting Thursday to try to contain the spread of the new coronavirus, the president said Monday.
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the measures in response to the increase of COVID-19 cases to 402. South Africa will be the third country in Africa to close down all but essential economic activity, after Rwanda and Tunisia.
South Africa's coronavirus cases jumped 47 percent on Monday from the day before with 128 new cases, increasing worries of exponential growth and making it the country with the most cases in Africa, taking over from Egypt.

Texto completo: NEW DELHI — India's prime minister ordered all 1.3 billion people in the country to stay inside their homes for three weeks starting Wednesday — the biggest and most severe action undertaken anywhere to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
“There will be a total ban of coming out of your homes," the prime minister, Narendra Modi, announced on television Tuesday night, giving Indians less than four hours' notice before the order took effect at 12:01 a.m.
“Every district, every lane, every village will be under lockdown," Modi said.
“If you can't handle these 21 days, this country will go back 21 years," he said. “The only option is social distancing, to remain away from each other. There is no way out to escape from coronavirus besides this."
Modi did not make clear how people would get food, water, and other necessities during the lock-down, or how they would maintain a safe distance from one another in the cramped spaces many now live. Nor did the prime minister make clear whether exceptions would be made for workers deemed critical to keep the country — the world's most populous nation after China — functioning.
The breadth and depth of such a challenge is staggering in a country where hundreds of millions of citizens are destitute and countless millions live in packed urban areas with poor sanitation and weak public health care.
Though India's number of reported coronavirus cases remains relatively low — around 500 — the fear is that, should the virus hit as it has in the United States, Europe, or China, the consequences would lead to a disaster far bigger than anywhere else.

Egypt announces 2-week nightly curfew to slow virus
CAIRO — Egypt will impose a two-week, nightly curfew in the Arab world's most populous country in an effort to stop the spread of the new coronavirus, its prime minister announced Tuesday as the International Monetary Fund warned that a shortage of medical supplies could affect the Mideast's poorest nations.
There are more than 31,000 confirmed cases of the virus across the Mideast, the vast majority in the hard-hit nation of Iran. While most recover from the COVID-19 illness that the virus causes, bottoming crude oil prices have put additional strain on even the wealthiest countries of the region. That in turn could affect their ability to spend on needed supplies as the virus challenges medical systems worldwide.
Egyptian Prime Minister Moustafa Madbouly told a news conference that the 11-hour curfew from 7 p.m. until 6 a.m. would go into effect Wednesday across the country. He said many kinds of transportation will be halted during the curfew.
Egypt has 366 confirmed cases and 21 fatalities, including two senior military officers.
Madbouly also announced the continued closure of airports, schools, and universities until April 12. He said shops and malls will be closed Fridays and Saturdays, the weekend in Egypt, and will be open from 7 a.m. till 5 p.m. the rest of the week. Groceries, bakeries, and pharmacies would be excluded from the closure order.

Confusion reigns, as Britain clamps down to fight spread
LONDON — Confusion rippled through Britain Tuesday, a day after Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered a three-week halt to all nonessential activity to fight the spread of the new coronavirus.
Streets were empty but some subways were full. Hairdressers were closed, but construction sites were open. Divorced parents wondered whether their children could continue to see them both.
The government has ordered most stores to close, banned gatherings of three or more people who don't live together, and told everyone apart from essential workers to leave home only to buy food and medicines or to exercise.
“You must stay at home," Johnson said in a somber address to the nation on Monday evening.
But photos showed crowded trains on some London subway lines Tuesday morning amid confusion about who was still allowed to go to work.
Many families were also confused by the new rules.
After Johnson said people should not mingle outside of their household units, separated parents asked whether their children could still travel between their homes. In a series of television and radio interviews, Cabinet minister Michael Gove initially said children should not move between households, before clarifying that it was permitted.

Antarctica only continent to be untouched by COVID-19
One continent has not yet confirmed a case of the novel coronavirus. It's a place of barren ice, where the all-consuming cold and darkness of winter is fast approaching.
Over the past few months, some 4,000 people from around the world have watched from Antarctica as the coronavirus pandemic, which began in Wuhan, China, swept around the globe, reaching all but its southernmost reaches.
"You'd better stay there; you're safer there," Alberto Della Rovere, leader of the 35th Italian expedition to Antarctica, said his colleagues at home told him via WhatsApp.
For now, they appear to be right. Even in normal times, only a limited number of people are allowed in and out of Antarctica, with medical workers screening for signs of influenza and other illnesses before arrival.
"Right now, this, Antarctica, is the safest place in the world," Della Rovere said. "There are no outside contacts, and we're far away from any settlement."

Two months later, China to ease lock-down on Hubei
HONG KONG — The Chinese province of Hubei, where the coronavirus first emerged, on Wednesday will begin allowing most of its 60 million residents to leave after nearly two months of lock-down, in a sign of the government's confidence that its tough measures have worked to control the outbreak.
Wuhan, the provincial capital and the city hardest hit by the epidemic, will remain sealed off until April 8, although public transportation there will start running again, the government said.
But even as authorities announced the eased restrictions, new questions were being raised about the virus's toll in China and whether the threat had fully passed. Hours before the loosening was announced, officials in Wuhan, after several days of reporting zero new local infections, said a doctor there had tested positive for the virus.
News reports have also claimed that health officials are finding a number of people with asymptomatic infections but not publicizing those figures, raising fears that the virus is still silently spreading. In addition, cases continue to climb among people newly arriving in China.

Bodies of virus victims found in nursing homes in Spain
MADRID — Spanish army troops disinfecting nursing homes have found, to their horror, some residents living in squalor among the infectious bodies of people that authorities suspect have died from the new coronavirus. Prosecutors have launched a judicial probe.
Defense Minister Margarita Robles said the elderly were “completely left to fend for themselves, or even dead, in their beds." She said the discovery included several nursing homes and several bodies but did not give exact locations for the nursing homes or exactly how many bodies were found.
The news came as Spain on Tuesday announced a record daily rise of 6,584 new coronavirus infections, bringing the overall total to 39,673. The number of deaths also jumped by a record number of 514 to 2,696.
Madrid took over a public skating rink Tuesday after the city morgue overflowed. To date, 1,535 people have died in the hard-hit Spanish capital, more than half of the national total. The region has over 12,350 infections.

Democrats kill coronavirus relief package and New York Times editorial board blames Republicans

Texto completo: Those rascally Republicans — they somehow forced Senate Democrats to kill Congress's COVID-19 emergency relief package this weekend!
Well, that's what the New York Times editorial board said. Maybe someone needs to explain it to them.

“The Coronavirus Bailout Stalled. And It’s Mitch McConnell’s Fault,” declares the board's headline. The subhead adds, “Senate Republicans are blocking passage of an economic bailout plan that protects jobs and wages.”

Democrats put partisan politics ahead of efforts to halt the coronavirus pandemic and prevent the collapse of the U.S. economy. This isn't hard to understand unless you don't want to.

Congress’s upper chamber was set to pass an emergency relief package this weekend. Democrats decided at the last minute to vote it down. They then made a counterproposal packed with irrelevant and ideologically charged items, many of which could even be called poison pills.
Those are just the facts. Keep them in mind as you try to understand the New York Times’s contorted reasoning for blaming Senate Republicans for the death of the COVID-19 relief bill.

“Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky failed to do his job this weekend,” the editorial reads. “As the economy spiraled downward, Mr. McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said he would produce a bipartisan bailout bill authorizing an infusion of desperately needed aid.”

It adds, essentially rehashing several Democratic press releases: “Instead, Mr. McConnell emerged on Sunday evening with a bill that would provide a lot of help for corporate executives and shareholders, and not nearly enough for American workers. Senate Democrats, refusing to play along, blocked the bill in a procedural vote on Sunday night. But responsibility for the deadlock rests squarely on Mr. McConnell’s shoulders.”

The New York Times’s knee-jerk impulse is simply to back whatever Democratic leadership says. But maybe just once, the members of its editorial board should exercise some critical thinking.

Its COVID-19 editorial was published a bit before 4 p.m. Monday, meaning the board had ample opportunity to review the Democratic Party’s counterproposal: the “Take Responsibility for Workers and Families Act.” Just one look at this abomination of a bill makes it clear that Democratic objections to the Senate Republicans' proposal had nothing to do with worker protections and everything to do with holding the country hostage to enact into law a wish list of left-wing programs and goodies.

Worse still, the Times even parrots the Democratic complaint that the Senate GOP bill gave Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin too much discretionary authority to allocate $500 billion earmarked for “severely distressed businesses.” But the Democratic counterproposal has a similar provision for "distressed businesses" and gives the Treasury secretary the exact same powers to “review and decide on applications for loans and loan guarantees.”

Put more plainly, the Democratic complaints parroted by the New York Times’s editorial board are transparently disingenuous, intended as a means of preserving plausible deniability.

The New York Times’s slavish deference to the Democratic Party is nothing new, but this coronavirus editorial represents a new low for its board. Playing for a certain team is one thing; running interference for its worst behavior in a time of crisis is quite another.
The New York Times recently announced it wouldn't be writing editorials as frequently. This would have been a great day to skip and spare itself some embarrassment.

Cruz slams Democrats on Senate floor for adding policy provisions to coronavirus relief package

Texto completo: Texas Sen. Ted Cruz slammed Democrats, notably House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, for blocking a coronavirus relief package proposed by fellow Republicans for what he deems as political reasons.
“Last night when this Senate voted on whether to move forward with emergency relief legislation for the millions of people being devastated by economic disaster we’re seeing as a result of the coronavirus epidemic, every single Democrat in this body voted block consideration of this bill,” Cruz said on the Senate floor Monday.
“The famed quote from Rahm Emanuel, that’s President Obama’s chief of staff: ‘Never let a good crisis go to waste.’ Sadly, we’re seeing the embodiment of that cynical approach right now,” the Texas Republican added. “Because with all the people out of jobs, the Democrats are using this to push — what are they pushing for? Changing the emissions standards on airplanes,” Cruz said. “What the hell do the emissions standards on airplanes have to do with thousands to people dying and millions of people out of work in the coronavirus epidemic?”
Cruz went on to criticize the way the media characterized the Democrats’ stonewalling.
“The New York Times headline moments afterwards [the stimulus bill vote last night] read ‘Democrats block $1.7 trillion stimulus bill.’ Of course, that headline had the fault of being accurate, so within minutes, the New York Times changed it ‘Democrats block $1.7 trillion stimulus bill, citing worker concerns,'” he said.
Tweet
Democrats have been criticized for attempting to include funding in the coronavirus relief package that appears to have no connection to combating the virus, such as $300 million for migrants and refugees, increased fuel emission standards, and $35 million for the Kennedy Performing Arts Center in Washington, D.C.
“This is not about the ridiculous Green New Deal,” President Trump said on Twitter. “It is about putting our great workers and companies BACK TO WORK!”
“Congress must approve the deal, without all of the nonsense, today,” he added. “The longer it takes, the harder it will be to start up our economy. Our workers will be hurt!”

Ex-field organizers sue Bloomberg campaign, claiming they were misled

Texto completo: Former field organizers for Michael Bloomberg filed two proposed class-action lawsuits against his presidential campaign Monday, arguing that they and thousands of others laid off this month had been tricked into taking jobs they were told would last until November.
The lawsuits, both filed in federal court in New York City, argued that the campaign had recruited staff members to work on Bloomberg’s bid under false pretenses, preventing them from pursuing other opportunities. One of the suits, brought by a former field organizer in Florida, also alleged the campaign had breached its contract with its organizers and failed to pay them necessary overtime.
In dismissing the workers eight months earlier than promised, that complaint said, the campaign had “deprived them of promised income and health care benefits, leaving them and their families potentially uninsured in the face of a global pandemic.” (Despite the campaign’s promises of continued employment, the field organizers had signed at-will contracts, indicating they could be terminated at any point.)
“People are going from a pretty generous health care benefit to projected 20 to 30% unemployment,” said Sally J. Abrahamson, a lawyer with Outten & Golden in Washington representing Donna Wood, a former field organizer in Miami who was laid off on Friday and filed the breach of contract suit. “It’s kind of jaw-dropping that Bloomberg spent what he did on the race and wouldn’t at least provide health insurance for these folks.”
A spokeswoman for the campaign initially declined to comment on Monday, later issuing a statement announcing that “a fund is being created to ensure that all staff receive health care through April, something no other campaign has done.”
“Staff worked 39 days on average, but they were also given several weeks of severance and health care through March, something no other campaign did this year,” the statement said.
Within hours of Wood’s complaint, a second proposed class-action suit was filed in the same court, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, by former campaign workers in Georgia, Utah and Washington state.
“Michael Bloomberg and his campaign made a promise,” that complaint said, claiming promissory estoppel, or harm done to the former employees who rearranged their lives, forgoing other jobs and plans to apply to graduate school, based on the promise that they would work on the general election.
“After Bloomberg lost the Democratic nomination, his campaign unceremoniously dumped thousands of staffers,” the complaint said.
For some New York-based employees who lost their jobs last week, the news came immediately after the campaign had circulated an email informing them that a coworker was infected with the coronavirus and they had potentially been exposed.
Bloomberg — a multibillionaire who entered the Democratic race in late November and dropped out in early March — assembled an army of campaign workers quickly, attracting them with unusually high pay, full benefits and the lure of campaign work through the fall, regardless of who won the Democratic nomination. He spent more than $900 million along the way and repeatedly promised to deploy his campaign in service of whoever the party ultimately selected.
But on March 9, days after he exited the race, Bloomberg’s campaign laid off field workers in all but six battleground states, asking if they were open to relocating to one of those states — Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — or if they wanted to be referred to another presidential campaign.
Last week, as he announced an $18 million donation to the Democratic National Committee in place of a new super PAC designed to help Democrats in the presidential race, Bloomberg also laid off staff members like Wood who had worked in those six states.
His campaign invited all former employees to apply to work for the DNC, though it called the hiring process competitive and specified that pay and benefits would be different. The campaign said in a news release last week that DNC staffing would draw “in part from our own incredibly experienced and talented organizing staff.”
Some affected employees, including people who had left stable jobs to work for Bloomberg, as Wood did, expressed frustration publicly, in spite of the confidentiality and non-disparagement agreements they had signed. They said they would not have accepted the work had they known its true terms.
Most immediately, some former employees, like those from Georgia, Utah and Washington who sued on Monday, were seeking to be freed from those broad confidentiality agreements, according to Peter Romer-Friedman, a lawyer at the firm Gupta Wessler who represents them.
Brynne Craig, a senior adviser to Bloomberg, said last week that the former mayor remained determined to fund the effort to topple President Donald Trump.
“We’re changing the mechanism, not our commitment,” she said, calling it more effective to coordinate field efforts through the DNC.
While some field organizers have applied for the DNC work, they remain aggrieved. “This is a tight-knit community, and they’re all mad, they’re all hurt and they’re all scared, especially at a time when health insurance is so important,” Gregg I. Shavitz, another lawyer for Wood, said Monday.
A set of interview talking points used by the campaign to hire field organizers and seen by The New York Times referred to “full health, dental and vision benefits” and “employment through November 2020 with Team Bloomberg.” But signed contracts seen by The Times also stipulated that employment was at-will, allowing for termination at any time. The contracts also specified that the workers were “classified as exempt from the overtime provisions of federal and applicable state laws.”
Wood’s legal complaint challenged that, claiming violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and arguing that none of the exemptions applied to the field organizers, who had little leeway in doing their jobs and routinely worked more than 40 hours a week.
“Essentially, you need to be running an organization or have a lot of discretion,” Abrahamson said of the claim. “You maybe don’t see a lot of these in campaign world because people don’t want to come forward and burn employers, but this is an unprecedented time.”

Texto completo: We were told that if America passed Obamacare, it would result in death panels.
This lie was invented by Sarah Palin in 2009, during the fight for what would become the Affordable Care Act. It was the hysterical version of the common conservative critique that universal health care means government rationing.
“Virtually every European government with ‘universal’ health care restricts access in one way or another to control costs, and it isn’t pretty,” said a Wall Street Journal editorial about the ACA. The Journal allowed that our system already rations health care according to people’s ability to pay for it, but argued that that’s how freedom works: “This is true of every good or service in a free economy and a world of finite resources but infinite wants.”
This argument was always specious, but it looks especially absurd in light of the coronavirus tearing through the world. America’s inadequate health care system, far from increasing liberty, is poised to make death panels more likely.
As waves of sick people crash onto undersupplied hospitals, doctors are preparing to make choices about who will get access to ventilators and other equipment, and who will get only palliative care.
“Health workers are urging efforts to suppress the outbreak and expand medical capacity so that rationing will be unnecessary,” The Times reported. “But if forced, they ask, how do they make the least terrible decision?”
America is not alone in facing such harrowing calculations. In Italy, which has universal health care, a medical association has published guidelines for allocating scarce health resources, giving priority to “patients with the highest chance of therapeutic success.” But with our hyper-privatized and grossly unequal health care system, the crisis here could be even worse.
After months of inaction and misinformation from an administration that disdains expertise, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases appears to be growing at a faster rate in the United States than in any other country with a major outbreak, and we are not ready. America has fewer hospital beds per capita than most developed countries, and more chronic health problems like diabetes that may put infected people at a higher risk for complications.
Donald Trump has been waging war on the ACA since he came into office, and the number of uninsured Americans has, by one measure, grown by 1.3 million since he took office. “To contain the virus, people will need to call health care providers as soon as they develop any flulike symptoms,” said an article in Stat, a health news website. “But will they do so if it means losing money?”
“The United States by its policy choices has one arm tied behind their back and is hopping on one leg,” said Gregg Gonsalves, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Medicine. Suddenly, the poor state of public health in America is becoming a life-or-death problem for even the most privileged.
When people without access to doctors, paid medical leave or decent housing get sick and are unable to quarantine themselves, the coronavirus spreads more quickly to everyone. Those trapped in prisons or crowded into homeless shelters can’t practice the social distancing necessary to contain the pandemic.
“The infection can propagate through people we didn’t want to care for as a society,” Gonsalves said.
Elites in this country have long tolerated a dysfunctional health care system because, while it delivers relatively poor results for many people, it provides good care for those at the top. A study published last year in The Journal of the American Medical Association compared life expectancy in the United States and Norway. “Life expectancy was higher in Norway than in the United States in all income percentiles, except for the highest income percentiles, in which life expectancies were similar in the two countries,” it found. For a lucky few, everything ugly and unfair about American health care might, in the past, have seemed like someone else’s problem.
But now Americans of all classes are going to be competing for the same scarce health resources. Your top-tier health insurance is unlikely to get you seen any quicker if you find yourself gasping for breath in an overflowing emergency room. The New York Post reports that plutocrats who’ve tried to purchase their own $35,000 ventilators are coming up empty: “Money can’t buy something that’s not there.”
Hospitals are being forced to postpone treatments for people with cancer and heart disease. The richest people might find workarounds — celebrities have had an easier time getting tested than the rest of us — but wealth can’t fully protect them. No one is safe from the coronavirus until everyone is.
Since the election of Ronald Reagan, America has tended to value individual market choice over collective welfare. Even Democratic administrations have had to operate within what’s often called the neoliberal consensus. That consensus was crumbling before the coronavirus, but the pandemic should annihilate it for good. This calamity has revealed that the fundamental insecurity of American life is a threat to us all.
“There’s no such thing as society,” Margaret Thatcher famously said. “There are individual men and women and there are families.”
Tell that to the families effectively under house arrest until society gets this right.

Paul Krugman: Republicans add insult to illness

Texto completo: If you want a quick summary of the state of play over fiscal stimulus legislation, here it is: Republicans insist that we should fight a plague with trickle-down economics and crony capitalism. Democrats, for some reason, don’t agree, and think we should focus on directly helping Americans in need.
And if legislation is stalled, as it appears to be as I write this (although things change fast when we’re on COVID time), it’s because Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, is holding needy Americans hostage in an attempt to blackmail Democrats into giving Donald Trump a $500 billion slush fund.
First, let’s talk about the nature of the economic crisis we face. At the worst point in the 2007-2009 recession, America was losing around 800,000 jobs per month. Right now, we’re probably losing several million jobs every week .
What’s causing these job losses? So far it’s not what usually happens in a recession, when businesses lay off workers because consumers aren’t spending enough. What we’re seeing instead are the effects of social distancing: restaurants, entertainment venues and many other establishments have been closed to limit the spread of the coronavirus.
And we neither can nor should bring those jobs back until the pandemic has faded. What this tells us is that right now our highest priority isn’t job creation, it’s disaster relief: giving families and small businesses that have lost their incomes enough money to afford necessities while the shutdown lasts. Oh, and providing generous aid to hospitals, clinics and other health care providers in this time of incredible stress.
Now, while social distancing is currently driving employment destruction, there will eventually be a second, more conventional round of job losses as distressed families and businesses cut back on spending. So there is also a case for stimulus to sustain overall spending — although helping Americans in need will provide much of that stimulus, by also helping them continue to spend.
So what’s in the stimulus bill that McConnell is trying to ram through the Senate? It grudgingly provides some, but only some, of the aid Americans in distress will need. Funny, isn’t it, how helping ordinary Americans is always framed as a “Democratic demand”? And even there the legislation includes poison pills, like a provision that would deny aid to many nonprofit institutions like nursing homes and group homes for the disabled.
But it also includes a $500 billion slush fund for corporations that the Trump administration could allocate at its discretion, with essentially no oversight. This isn’t just terrible policy; it’s an insult to our intelligence.
After all, it would be hard to justify giving any administration that kind of power to reward its friends and punish those it considers enemies. It’s almost inconceivable that anyone would propose giving such authority to the Trump administration.
Remember, we’ve had more than three years to watch this administration in action. We’ve seen Trump refuse to disclose anything about his financial interests, amid abundant evidence that he is profiting at the public’s expense. Trump’s trade war has been notable for the way in which favored companies somehow manage to get tariff exemptions while others are denied. And as you read this, Trump is refusing to use his authority to require production of essential medical gear.
So it would be totally out of character for this administration to allocate huge sums fairly and in the public interest.
Cronyism aside, there’s also the issue of competence. Why would you give vast discretionary power to a team that utterly botched the response to the coronavirus because Trump didn’t want to hear bad news? Why would you place economic recovery efforts in the hands of people who were assuring us just weeks ago that the virus was contained and the economy was “holding up nicely”?
Finally, we’ve just had a definitive test of the underlying premise of the McConnell slush fund — that if you give corporations money without strings attached they will use it for the benefit of workers and the economy as a whole. In 2017, Republicans rammed through a huge corporate tax cut, which they assured us would lead to higher wages and surging business investment.
Neither of these things happened; instead, corporations basically used the money to buy back their own stock. Why would this time be any different?
As I write this, Republicans are ranting that Democrats are sabotaging the economy by refusing to pass McConnell’s bill — which is a bit rich for those who remember the GOP’s scorched-earth opposition to everything Barack Obama proposed. But in any case, if McConnell really wants action, he could get it easily either by dropping his demand for a Trump-controlled slush fund or by passing the stimulus bill House Democrats are likely to offer very soon.
And maybe that will happen within a few days. As I said, we’re now living on COVID time. But right now Republicans seem dead set on exploiting a crisis their own president helped create by his refusal to take the pandemic seriously.

Jamelle Bouie: Trump thinks he knows better than the doctors about coronavirus

Texto completo: First, President Donald Trump ignored the coronavirus, dismissing its threat to the public. Then briefly he took it somewhat seriously. He gave an address from the Oval Office, followed by one of the more sober-minded news conferences of his administration. A day later, he was back to his usual antics, attacking the press, amplifying propagandists and spreading misinformation. He has even promised a miracle cure.
Now, as it becomes clear that this is not a momentary crisis — that the economy may have to come to a standstill to keep the disease from overwhelming the country — Trump appears ready to quit altogether, even if it costs thousands upon thousands of American lives.
“WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF,” the president said (or screamed) on Twitter late Sunday night. “AT THE END OF THE 15 DAY PERIOD, WE WILL MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHICH WAY WE WANT TO GO!”
WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF. AT THE END OF THE 15 DAY PERIOD, WE WILL MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHICH WAY WE WANT TO GO!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 23, 2020
Subsequent reporting from Jonathan Swan of Axios confirmed that the administration is looking to relax guidelines for public gatherings, in order to bring the economy back online: “Amid dire predictions for jobs and the economy, the White House is beginning to send signals that there’s light at the end of the tunnel — that the squeeze from nationwide social distancing won’t be endless.”
If the United States had the strict testing regime of South Korea or Taiwan — if it knew the full extent of the outbreak and had the resources to selectively quarantine the sick and the contagious — then you could imagine a return to normalcy in the next month or so, as most people began to go back to work and the vulnerable stayed home. But that is an unlikely, best-case scenario, more dream world than reality.
What is actually happening is that we don’t know how many Americans are sick or how many are asymptomatic. We aren’t quite flying blind, but without more tests we can’t see very clearly either. What we do know is that we have a fast-growing caseload that implies that there are many more infections than what’s in the official numbers so far. To relax restrictions in this environment is to guarantee greater spread of the disease and higher death tolls
With a fatality rate of 1%, we can expect nearly 1 million deaths if 30% of Americans come down with the virus. Of course, the fatality rate isn’t fixed. Among other things, it depends on the capacity of the health system. If local hospitals aren’t able to handle a flood of coronavirus patients — if they can’t treat everyone — then the fatality rate will go up. In Italy, where hospitals are straining to treat the sick, the fatality rate among confirmed cases is closer to 9%.
The economy will collapse under an extended social lockdown. It will also collapse in the face of a million or more coronavirus deaths, as people refuse to work or spend time in public spaces lest they risk infection. Both choices are bad, but one will save lives while the other will sacrifice them for the sake of illusory gains. That’s why the administration’s own experts have urged the White House to continue social distancing and other protective measures.
But neither Trump nor many of his allies appear to care that much about the human toll. Or at least they’ve convinced themselves that an extended lockdown is more harmful than anything the virus can do. Trump, The Washington Post reports, is “fixated on the plummeting stock market, is chafing at the idea of the country remaining closed until the summer and growing tired of talking only about the coronavirus.” Key officials within the administration — like Steven Mnuchin, the secretary of the Treasury — are pushing the president to get the economy back on track. “The president is right. The cure can’t be worse than the disease,” Larry Kudlow, director of the White House National Economic Council, said on Fox News on Monday. “And we’re going to have to make some difficult trade-offs.”
I suppose it is possible that when Trump and Kudlow say this, they are thinking of service employees and blue-collar workers, of people who live from paycheck to paycheck. But their mutual fixation on the stock market — Trump’s shift from apathy to attention came in the wake of a breathtaking sell-off — makes this unlikely. The “trade-off” here isn’t lives for prosperity — again, coronavirus will dampen economic activity with or without social distancing — it’s lives for shareholder value.
There’s another issue as well. The only way to sustain an economy in lockdown is unconditional government support for individuals, families and communities. It’s social democracy, if only for a while. And that amount of redistribution — from top to bottom, from creditors to debtors — is unacceptable to the president and his allies. Remember that the Trump administration is still trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act and end food assistance for 700,000 Americans.
Marxists have a turn of phrase that dates back to the late 19th century: “Socialism or barbarism.” It comes from the German journalist and philosopher Karl Kautsky, who in 1892 wrote, “As things stand today capitalist civilization cannot continue; we must either move forward into socialism or fall back into barbarism.”
Two decades later, in a 1915 pamphlet, “The Crisis in German Social Democracy,” the Polish revolutionary Rosa Luxemburg recapitulated the idea, attributing it to Karl Marx’s lifelong friend and collaborator Friedrich Engels. “Bourgeois society stands at the crossroads,” she wrote while a generation of European men marched to their doom in the First World War, “either transition to socialism or regression into barbarism.”
You don’t have to be a revolutionary socialist to understand the sentiment. In the face of disaster, the only path forward is solidarity and mutual concern. Reject it, and all that’s left is a cold and selfish disregard for human life.
“America will again — and soon — be open for business,” the president said on Monday. “Very soon, a lot sooner than three or four months that somebody was suggesting. A lot sooner.”
In other words, Trump will sacrifice Americans to coronavirus if it will save the market and his prospects for reelection. Which is to say that given the choice between solidarity and barbarism, Trump will choose barbarism. We’ll see, in November, if the rest of the country follows suit.

News Publishers Urge China to Allow Reporters to Remain During Coronavirus Pandemic; Joint letter by publishers of Wall Street Journal, Washington Post and New York Times seeks reversal of expulsions of American journalists

Texto completo: The publishers of The Wall Street Journal, New York Times and Washington Post are asking China to reconsider the expulsion of the news organizations' reporters during the global coronavirus pandemic, so as not "to deprive the world of critical information at a perilous moment."
In a joint letter published in the three newspapers on Tuesday, the publishers called the decision to revoke the press credentials of around a dozen of the news outlets' reporters "uniquely damaging and reckless as the world continues the struggle to control this disease."
The move comes amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and China, who have been engaged in a trade war over the past two years, that have led recently to the ousting of journalists from both countries.
"This moment underscores the urgent importance of both probing, accurate, on-the-ground reporting from the centers of the pandemic and of sharing the information, insights and lessons that reporting reveals as widely as possible," the letter read.
The letter was signed by William Lewis, Fred Ryan and A.G. Sulzberger, publishers of the Journal, the Post and the Times, respectively.

Last week, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs ordered all U.S. nationals working for the papers to turn in their press credentials within 10 days, in the largest expulsion of foreign journalists in China in the post-Mao era. It also ordered the three newspapers and two other media outlets—Voice of America and Time magazine—to submit information about staff, finances, operations and real estate in China.
The move came about a month after China expelled three Journal reporters in response to a piece published on the paper's opinion page that the country said was racially discriminatory. That led the Trump administration to place a cap on the number of staff at four Chinese state-run news organizations in the U.S., lowering it to 100 from around 160.
China has become increasingly combative with foreign media in recent years under leader Xi Jinping, as the government has attempted to exert greater control over information. Before expelling the three Journal reporters in February, China hadn't expelled a credentialed foreign correspondent since 1998.
So far, China has been the hardest hit by the new coronavirus which has sickened more than 80,000 people in the country, killing nearly 3,300, since the virus emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December.
The virus has since become a pandemic, spreading around the world and affecting nearly 400,000 people and leaving close to 17,000 dead. In the U.S., almost 17,000 cases have been confirmed with almost 600 people having died. It has caused widespread lockdowns and closures that have devastated the global economy.
"Even when this crisis passes we believe both countries will continue to benefit from freer access to news and information about the other," the letter read. "We believe it is unambiguously in the interests of the people of both countries, as well as their leaders, to let journalists do their work."

Texto completo: These are days that test every leader -- local, state and national. They are each being asked to make huge life and death decisions, while driving through a fog, with imperfect information, and everyone in the back seat shouting at them. My heart goes out to them all. I know they mean well. But as so many of our businesses shut down and millions begin to be laid off, some experts are beginning to ask: "Wait a minute! What the hell are we doing to ourselves? To our economy? To our next generation? Is this cure -- even for a short while -- worse than the disease?"
I share these questions. Our leaders are not flying completely blind: They are working off the advice of serious epidemiologists and public health experts. Yet we still need to be careful about "group think,'' which is a natural but dangerous reaction when responding to a national and global crisis. We're making decisions that affect the whole country and our entire economy -- therefore, small errors in navigation could have huge consequences.
Of course, because this virus is potentially affecting so many Americans at once, we need to provide more hospital beds, treatment equipment for those who will need it and protective gear like N95 masks for the doctors and nurses caring for virus-infected patients. That is urgent! And we need to immediately rectify the colossal failure to supply rapid, widespread testing. That is urgent!
But we also need to be asking ourselves -- just as urgently -- can we more surgically minimize the threat of this virus to those most vulnerable while we maximize the chances for as many Americans as possible to safely go back to work as soon as possible. One expert I talk to below believes that could happen in as early as a few weeks -- if we pause for a moment and think afresh about the coronavirus challenge.
Indeed, if my inbox is any indication, a thoughtful backlash is brewing to the strategy the country has stumbled into. And stumbling is what inevitably happens when you have a president who goes from treating the coronavirus as a hoax to a war in the space of two days. A lot of health experts want to find a better balance to the medical, economic and moral issues now tugging at us all at once.
Dr. John P.A. Ioannidis, an epidemiologist and co-director of Stanford's Meta-Research Innovation Center, pointed out in a March 17 essay on statnews.com, that we still do not have a firm grasp of the populationwide fatality rate of coronavirus. A look at some of the best available evidence today, though, indicates it may be 1% and could even be lower.
"If that is the true rate,'' Ioannidis wrote, "locking down the world with potentially tremendous social and financial consequences may be totally irrational. It's like an elephant being attacked by a house cat. Frustrated and trying to avoid the cat, the elephant accidentally jumps off a cliff and dies."
Is there another way?
One of the best ideas I have come across was offered by Dr. David L. Katz, founding director of Yale University's CDC-funded Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center and an expert in public health and preventive medicine.
Katz wrote an op-ed in The New York Times on Friday that caught my eye. He argued that we have three goals right now: saving as many lives as we can, making sure that our medical system does not get overwhelmed -- but also making sure that in the process of achieving the first two goals we don't destroy our economy, and as a result of that, even more lives.
For all these reasons, he argued, we need to pivot from the "horizontal interdiction" strategy we're now deploying -- restricting the movement and commerce of the entire population, without consideration of varying risks for severe infection -- to a more "surgical'' or "vertical interdiction" strategy.
A surgical-vertical approach would focus on protecting and sequestering those among us most likely to be killed or suffer long-term damage by exposure to coronavirus infection -- that is, the elderly, people with chronic diseases and the immunologically compromised -- while basically treating the rest of society the way we have always dealt with familiar threats like the flu. That means we would tell them to be respectful of others when coughing or sneezing, wash their hands regularly and if they feel sick to stay home and get over it -- or to seek medical attention if they are not recuperating as expected.
Because, as with the flu, the vast majority will get over it in days, a small number will require hospitalization and a very small percentage of the most vulnerable will, tragically, die. (That said, coronavirus is more dangerous than the typical flu we are familiar with.) As Katz argued, governors and mayors, by choosing the horizontal approach of basically sending everyone home for an unspecified period, might have actually increased the dangers of infection for those most vulnerable.
"As we lay off workers, and colleges close their dorms and send all their students home," Katz noted, "young people of indeterminate infectious status are being sent home to huddle with their families nationwide. And because we lack widespread testing, they may be carrying the virus and transmitting it to their 50-something parents, and 70- or 80-something grandparents."
"OK," I said, calling Katz by phone at his home in Connecticut after reading his article, "but we are where we are now. Most states and cities have basically committed to some period of horizontal social distancing and sheltering in place. So, can we make lemonade out of this lemon -- and not destroy our economy?"
I don't see why not, he answered. "Now that we have shut down almost everything, we still have the option of pivoting to a more targeted approach. We may even be able to leverage the current effort at horizontal, population-wide, interdiction to our advantage as we pivot to vertical, risk-based, interdiction."
How? "Use a two-week isolation strategy,'' Katz answered. Tell everyone to basically stay home for two weeks, rather than indefinitely. (This includes all the reckless college students packing the beaches of Florida.) If you are infected with the coronavirus it will usually present within a two-week incubation period.
"Those who have symptomatic infection should then self-isolate -- with or without testing, which is exactly what we do with the flu," Katz said. "Those who don't, if in the low-risk population, should be allowed to return to work or school, after the two weeks end."
Effectively, we'd 'reboot' our society in two or perhaps more weeks from now. "The rejuvenating effect on spirits, and the economy, of knowing where there's light at the end of this tunnel would be hard to overstate. Risk will not be zero, but the risk of some bad outcome for any of us on any given day is never zero."
I am not a medical expert. I'm just a reporter -- who is afraid for his own loved ones, for his neighbors and for people everywhere as much as anyone. I share these ideas not because I know they are the magic cure, or have every variable thought through. I share them because I am certain that we need to broaden the debate -- I am certain that we need less herd mentality and more herd immunity -- as we come to terms our hellish choice:
Either we let many of us get the coronavirus, recover and get back to work -- while doing our utmost to protect those most vulnerable from being killed by it. Or, we shut down for months to try to save everyone everywhere from this virus -- no matter their risk profile -- and kill many people by other means, kill our economy and maybe kill our future.

Texto completo: Dr. Anthony Fauci is a bum.
A quack, a snake oil salesman.
He got his degrees online, not from Holy Cross and Cornell .
He watches Wheel of Fortune but not Jeopardy.
He's a Yankees fan.
Such character assassination is unsavory but necessary because Fauci's calm, reassuring competence in response to the coronavirus pandemic is placing him at serious risk of hearing the words that made his boss famous: You're fired.
President Trump is watching and listening to the same thing we are, i.e., Fauci going to the podium to rebut with facts the latest outbreak of paranoid anxiety or the president's regularly reckless statements.
Fauci is an oasis of rigor and reason in a barren desert of confusion and fear.
Which, given who he works for, makes him an endangered species.
During the Vietnam War, some US Army officer supposedly suggested that in order to save a village from the Vietcong they had to destroy it.
And so, to save Dr. Fauci, we must destroy him — at least in Trump's eyes.
Now that might sound crazy, but we're dealing with a crazy president in crazy circumstances.
It's not as if there's no relevant precedent here.
Two words: Bill Bratton.
Two other words: Rudy Giuliani. Who happens to be Trump's BFF.
Before Giuliani grew old, deranged, and more qualified to be a spokesman for Miracle Ear than the president's lawyer, he was the reform-minded mayor of New York City.
Rudy rode into Dodge, which is what Times Square resembled at the time, and vowed to clean it up. His hand-picked sheriff was Dorchester's own Bill Bratton.
As police commissioner, Bratton did much to stem violent crime in the nation's biggest city, but even more remarkably got his cops to reduce the incidence of more minor, so-called quality of life crimes that had made New York less livable, from the tony sections of Manhattan to the Tony Fauci sections of Brooklyn.
Bratton did his job too well. He ended up on the cover of Time magazine, hailed as the guy who pulled the worm out of the Big Apple. He became more popular than the mayor.
This drove Giuliani nuts. Rudy had to be the smartest guy in the room, had to get all the credit. Sound familiar?
So Bratton had to go.
That wasn't Bratton's first rodeo. Long before he landed in New York, he became the face of progressive, modern policing in his hometown, the youngest-ever Boston Police superintendent. Police Commissioner Joe Jordan resented his overly-ambitious No. 2 so he busted Bratton.
The point is, insecure bosses don't like being shown up by smarter, more competent subordinates. Small men make big mistakes.
It may be too late to save Fauci. He just got the star treatment from Maureen Dowd in The New York Times.
There used to be a thing called the Sports Illustrated curse, that after an athlete appeared on its cover his or her career tanked. Similarly, being in the Trump administration and getting praised by The New York Times is the kiss of death.
Now, normally, you could print something in the Times and chances were the president wouldn't read it. He routinely dismisses the Gray Old Lady as fake news, except when his and his family's lousy books are mass-bought onto the newspaper's bestsellers list. He is not fond of polysyllabic words and prefers to get his news from “Fox & Friends" or whatever white nationalist website his aide Stephen Miller might recommend.
But Trump reads Mo Dowd because they have known each other forever and she writes about him at a nuanced, personal level that drives him especially cuckoo.
We're way past the theoretical here.
Tony Fauci is in real danger, and by extension so are the rest of us who expect — nay, pray for — one person in the White House to be trustworthy and competent in a time of unprecedented crisis.
So, again, repeat after me, Dr. Anthony Fauci is a bum.
Long live the bum.

Texto completo: Obamacare didn't lead to rationing. The mismanagement of the coronavirus will.
We were told that if America passed Obamacare, it would result in death panels.
This lie was invented by Sarah Palin in 2009, during the fight for what would become the Affordable Care Act. It was the hysterical version of the common conservative critique that universal health care means government rationing.
"Virtually every European government with 'universal' health care restricts access in one way or another to control costs, and it isn't pretty," said a Wall Street Journal editorial about the A.C.A. The Journal allowed that our system already rations health care according to people's ability to pay for it, but argued that that's how freedom works: "This is true of every good or service in a free economy and a world of finite resources but infinite wants."
This argument was always specious, but it looks especially absurd in light of the coronavirus tearing through the world. America's inadequate health care system, far from increasing liberty, is poised to make death panels more likely.
As waves of sick people crash onto undersupplied hospitals, doctors are preparing to make choices about who will get access to ventilators and other equipment, and who will get only palliative care. "Health workers are urging efforts to suppress the outbreak and expand medical capacity so that rationing will be unnecessary," reported The Times. "But if forced, they ask, how do they make the least terrible decision?"
America is not alone in facing such harrowing calculations. In Italy, which has universal health care, a medical association has published guidelines for allocating scarce health resources, giving priority to "patients with the highest chance of therapeutic success." But with our hyper-privatized and grossly unequal health care system, the crisis here could be even worse.
After months of inaction and misinformation from an administration that disdains expertise, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases appears to be growing at a faster rate in the United States than in any other country with a major outbreak, and we are not ready. America has fewer hospital beds per capita than most developed countries, and more chronic health problems like diabetes that may put infected people at a higher risk for complications.
Donald Trump has been waging war on the A.C.A. since he came into office, and the number of uninsured Americans has, by one measure, grown by 1.3 million since he took office. "To contain the virus, people will need to call health care providers as soon as they develop any flulike symptoms," said an article in Stat, a health news website. "But will they do so if it means losing money?"
"The United States by its policy choices has one arm tied behind their back and is hopping on one leg," said Gregg Gonsalves, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Medicine. Suddenly, the poor state of public health in America is becoming a life-or-death problem for even the most privileged.
When people without access to doctors, paid medical leave or decent housing get sick and are unable to quarantine themselves, coronavirus spreads more quickly to everyone. Those trapped in prisons or crowded into homeless shelters can't practice the social distancing necessary to contain the pandemic. "The infection can propagate through people we didn't want to care for as a society," Gonsalves said.
Elites in this country have long tolerated a dysfunctional health care system because, while it delivers relatively poor results for many people, it provides good care for those at the top. A study published last year in The Journal of the American Medical Association compared life expectancy in the United States and Norway. "Life expectancy was higher in Norway than in the United States in all income percentiles, except for the highest income percentiles, in which life expectancies were similar in the two countries," it found. For a lucky few, everything ugly and unfair about American health care might, in the past, have seemed like someone else's problem.
But now Americans of all classes are going to be competing for the same scarce health resources. Your top-tier health insurance is unlikely to get you seen any quicker if you find yourself gasping for breath in an overflowing emergency room. The New York Post reports that plutocrats who've tried to purchase their own $ 35,000 ventilators are coming up empty: "Money can't buy something that's not there."
Hospitals are being forced to postpone treatments for people with cancer and heart disease. The richest people might find workarounds -- celebrities have had an easier time getting tested than the rest of us -- but wealth can't fully protect them. No one is safe from coronavirus until everyone is.
Since the election of Ronald Reagan, America has tended to value individual market choice over collective welfare. Even Democratic administrations have had to operate within what's often called the neoliberal consensus. That consensus was crumbling before coronavirus, but the pandemic should annihilate it for good. This calamity has revealed that the fundamental insecurity of American life is a threat to us all.
"There's no such thing as society," Margaret Thatcher famously said. "There are individual men and women and there are families." Tell that to the families effectively under house arrest until society gets this right.

Texto completo: The publishers of The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post release a statement critical of China's revocation of Americans' credentials.
The publishers of The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post on Tuesday released a statement critical of the Chinese government's decision to bar American journalists for the three publications from working in China.
The unusual statement, signed by A.G. Sulzberger of The Times, William Lewis of The Journal and Fred Ryan of The Post, was released online early Tuesday and was scheduled to appear in the rival newspapers' Tuesday print editions.
"We strongly urge the Chinese government to reverse its decision to force the Americans working for our news organizations to leave the country and, more broadly, to ease the growing crackdown on independent news organizations that preceded this action," the publishers said in the statement. "The media is collateral damage in a diplomatic dispute between the Chinese and U.S. governments, threatening to deprive the world of critical information at a perilous moment."
On Wednesday, China announced that all American journalists at the three newspapers based in the country whose credentials were set to expire in 2020 had to hand in their press cards within 10 days. The action would affect at least 13 journalists, according to an estimate by the Foreign Correspondents' Club of China.
China's move was the latest in an escalating diplomatic feud between the Chinese government, led by President Xi Jinping, and the Trump administration. The ouster of the American journalists followed the Trump administration's decision to limit to 100 the number of Chinese citizens who can work in the United States for five state-run Chinese media organizations that are widely considered propaganda outlets.
Before that, China expelled three Journal reporters last month over a headline, "China Is the Real Sick Man of Asia," on an opinion column about the country's response to the coronavirus outbreak.
The letter from the three publishers emphasized the need for a free flow of information during the coronavirus crisis. "This move -- made in retaliation for recent expulsions by the United States government -- is one that we would protest under any circumstances," the publishers wrote. "But it is uniquely damaging and reckless as the world continues the struggle to control this disease, a struggle that will require the free flow of reliable news and information."
They added, "Even when this crisis passes we believe both countries will continue to benefit from freer access to news and information about the other."
China has been waging a broader crackdown on foreign correspondents dating roughly to Mr. Xi's ascension near the beginning of the decade. During that period, foreign outlets have reported on issues that Chinese officials consider sensitive, including camps for Muslims in western China, the suspicious business of some Chinese leaders' relatives and the government's handling of the coronavirus outbreak.
The publishers offered some praise for China's containment of the virus, writing, "We have prominently featured news and analysis about China's remarkable progress in reducing the spread of the virus through containment and mitigation. Even now, with some of our journalists facing imminent expulsion, they are reporting on how China is mobilizing state resources to develop vaccines that could offer hope to billions of people there and around the world."
The statement also said the world learned of the virus thanks to "the journalists who work for us in China, as well as their colleagues for other leading news organizations."
The publishers added, "Our news organizations are rivals. We compete with each other on the biggest stories, including this one. But on this matter we speak with a single voice."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — An estimated 13,500 Americans abroad have asked the State Department for help returning to the United States as the coronavirus pandemic has resulted in closed borders and suspended commercial flights, two senior officials said Monday.
About 5,700 additional US citizens and legal residents have already been brought back on flights organized by the State Department.
From Peru to Morocco to Japan, stranded Americans have pleaded for help getting home as the pandemic has spread. Over the next five days, the State Department will charter 16 flights around the world to bring home another 1,600 people, said one of the officials, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity because of department protocols on briefing the news media.
About 10 million US citizens live abroad, officials said. But the officials urged Americans who have homes overseas to consider hunkering down, underscoring that the travel assistance was designed for tourists and temporary expatriates, like students. There was still room on some of the flights this week for additional passengers, said the official, who urged Americans to register at the department's travel enrollment system for information.
On Sunday, Global Guardian, an international security firm, evacuated 144 Americans who were stranded in Honduras.
“I cannot begin to express my gratitude to the entire Global Guardian team for getting my husband and I home safely to our families and lives here in Boston," Annie Perlick, a nurse at Boston's Children Hospital, said in a statement.

Biden's low profile during crisis seen as a liability
With President Trump providing daily televised briefings and governors like Andrew Cuomo emerging as national leaders during the coronavirus pandemic, former vice president Joe Biden is still grappling with how to position himself as a prominent voice .
Biden has been confined over the last week to an unusually small role for the likely — though not yet completely certain — nominee of a major political party. His public comments have been sparing and, for the most part, restrained. He has begun to ramp up a public schedule, beginning with an appearance on ABC's “The View" on Tuesday, and his aides said he would now offer remarks on camera in some fashion each day.
But Democratic strategists have said that Biden needs to be more visible at a time when Americans are looking for leadership. The challenge for Biden, they say, is to find ways to draw sharp contrasts in leadership style with Trump while showing sensitivity to the severity of the crisis.
On Monday, Biden gave a speech that was streamed live from his home in Delaware in which he criticized Trump's response to the virus as too slow and insufficient, and pressed him to act like the “wartime president" he says he is.
Neither CNN, Fox News, nor MSNBC aired his speech, instead showing a briefing by Cuomo of New York.
“Let me be clear: Donald Trump is not to blame for the coronavirus, but he does bear responsibility for our response," Biden said. “And I, along with every American, hope he steps up and starts to get this right."

Democratic convention planners look at options
Planners for the Democratic National Convention are looking at “contingency options" in case the mid-July gathering in Milwaukee can't take place because of the coronavirus, officials said Monday for the first time.
One person with knowledge of the discussions said Monday that “intensive scenario-planning" was taking place among officials from the Democratic National Committee, the convention committee and the Milwaukee host committee, who were all determining what to do about the convention, which is scheduled July 13-16 at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee.
Among the complicating factors are the uncertain nature of the professional basketball season and how the party's delegates will be selected. Delegates in most states are elected to the national convention from state conventions, but many state conventions, scheduled for late spring and early summer, are also being postponed.

Britain placed under virtual lockdown
Facing a growing storm of criticism about his laissez-faire response to the fast-spreading coronavirus, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced Monday that he would place Britain under a virtual lockdown, closing all nonessential shops, banning meetings of more than two people and requiring people to stay in their homes, except for trips for food or medicine.
People who flout the new restrictions, the prime minister said, will be fined by the police.
The steps, which Johnson outlined in a televised address to the nation, bring him into alignment with European leaders such as President Emmanuel Macron of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who have all but quarantined their countries in a desperate bid to slow the outbreak.
The prime minister said people also could leave their houses for exercise, either alone or with family members, and he did not close parks in London, which became a symbol of Britain's nonchalant response this weekend when they were thronged by people.
The number of confirmed cases in Britain rose to 6,650 on Monday, up from 5,683 a day earlier, while the death toll jumped by 54, to 335. British officials warn that the country is about two weeks behind Italy in the spread of the virus.

India halts its crucial train network to try to stop virus
As India expanded its virus-containment measures and halted its train network, the country's lifeblood, the federal government warned Monday of strict legal action for those who flout the rules.
The wholesale shutdown of India's massive train system is unprecedented.
"Please save yourself, save your family," Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted in Hindi, calling for states to follow the preventive measures issued by the federal government to contain the spread of the virus.
The strict legal action vowed wasn't immediately clear. Other places have simply sent violators home, since alternatives like detention would create crowded conditions where the virus could spread.
To contain the outbreak, authorities have gradually started to lock down much of the country of 1.3 billion people, sending stock markets to record lows.
Associated Press
South Africa to go into nationwide lockdown
South Africa, Africa's most industrialized economy and a nation of 57 million people, will to go into a nationwide lockdown for 21 days starting Thursday to try to contain the spread of the new coronavirus, the president said Monday.
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the measures in response to the increase of COVID-19 cases to 402. South Africa will be the third country in Africa to close down all but essential economic activity, after Rwanda and Tunisia.
South Africa's coronavirus cases jumped 47 percent on Monday from the day before with 128 new cases, increasing worries of exponential growth and making it the country with the most cases in Africa, taking over from Egypt.

Texto completo: ProPublica announced Monday that Elizabeth Weil will join its staff as a reporter covering California and climate, investigating not only how climate change is being lived but how decisions by individuals, industries and governments are shaping life-and-death outcomes.
Weil previously worked as a writer-at-large for the New York Times Magazine. Among her most notable work there was a profile of a man charged in the deaths of his friends in a fire at the Ghost Ship artists’ warehouse in Oakland, while neither the building’s landlords or city officials were held accountable. Her magazine work has won a New York Press Club Award in feature reporting, a Lowell Thomas Award in travel writing, a GLAAD Award for coverage of LGBT issues, and been a finalist for a National Magazine Award, a James Beard Award in food writing, and Dart Award for coverage of trauma.
An author of several books, Weil’s most recent, The Girl Who Smiled Beads , was a New York Times bestseller and long-listed for the Andrew Carnegie Medal of Excellence in nonfiction. She lives in San Francisco with her husband, the writer Daniel Duane, and their two teenage daughters.
“Elizabeth is an exciting addition to the ProPublica team, a gifted writer with a dedication to digging for the truth,” Robin Fields, ProPublica managing editor, said. “As California experiences climate change in extreme ways, from unprecedented heat to intensifying fire, we’re thrilled that she will be telling the story of how the nation’s most influential climate policy lab is making choices that will resonate across the country and world.”
“California is endlessly fascinating, and its influence has always stretched far beyond the borders of the state,” Weil said. “Right now our world needs ProPublica more than ever, and I am honored to be joining the team.”

A bad case of both-sidesism: Washington Post, New York Times, and others refuse to tell us which party blocked the coronavirus aid bill

Texto completo: The Democrats may have had good reasons to filibuster the coronavirus package in the Senate on Sunday night. That is a matter for debate, and a responsible news outlet would cover both sides of that debate.
But here’s what's not a matter for debate or a question where editors and reporters ought to apply “both-sidesism”: The Democrats filibustered the bill. Democrats blocked it.
Yet the largest media outlets, which suffer from partisan bias and a bad habit of both-sidesism, refused to cover the Democratic filibuster for what it was.
The Washington Post opted to use neither its headline nor its subheadline to inform readers of what actually happened. Instead, it wrote, “Clash between GOP, Democrats over stimulus bill intensifies.” The subhead was “$1.8 trillion package falls far short of advancing in the Senate.”
No mention of a filibuster in the headlines. No mentioning that one party tried to pass a bill and the other party blocked it. Informing the reader did not appear to be a priority.
How did the Washington Post’s filibuster headlines read back when Democrats last controlled the Senate? I'm sure you can guess.
“Senate Republicans block minimum wage increase bill.”
“Senate Republicans filibuster appellate court nominee Caitlin Halligan.”
“Senate Republicans block another Obama court pick.”
“Senate Republicans block vote on Hagel nomination.”
And so on.
The formula seems to be different now that Democrats are the ones doing the blocking.
USA Today similarly played the both-sides game last night. “Senate at odds over makeup of coronavirus stimulus package,” was its headline. "At odds" is one way of putting it, but it's not a terribly informative way of putting it.
Parallel situations, when Republicans were doing the blocking, had different headlines at USA Today. “Republicans block $250 million to beef up election security.”
Tom Bevan of RealClearPolitics followed these headlines on Twitter and collected them here.
The New York Times’s progression over the course of the night was informative. It started with a true headline: “Democrats block action on $1.8 trillion stimulus bill.”
This completely accurate headline did not pass judgment. It didn't take sides on whether Democrats were right to block the bill. After all, blocking a bill is often the right thing to do. Democrats had some good reasons, such as worrying that it granted the Treasury secretary too much discretion and could result in a TARP-like slush fund. nyt1.jpegSo it’s understandable that the New York Times expanded its headline to offer some hints as to the Democrats’ argument (These screen grabs come from Twitter user @DavisKanne.)nyt2.jpegBut alas. We know that when the New York Times provides factually correct headlines that upset its far-left readership base, it eventually changes them. In this case, the newspaper descended to the same both-sidesism that the rest of the media practiced.nyt3.jpegAlas. Now, neither party has blocked the bill. It's just a disembodied "partisan divide!"
The media need to realize that while some questions (such as whether this bill needs to be fixed before being passed) have two valid sides, other questions (such as how the Senate bill fizzled on Sunday night) are clear-cut, even if one side doesn't like the way it sounds.

Texto completo: There is literally one single government to blame for the havoc that the new coronavirus has created, and it’s that of the People's Republic of China. But you can’t ask the media to do that.
No, instead, they find blame anywhere else they can — including at Fox News.
New York Times media critic Ben Smith wrote Sunday that if not for “two crucial weeks in late February and early March” that Fox hosts harped on “a Democratic- and media-led plot against President Donald J. Trump,” we might be in tiptop shape.
“Fox failed its viewers and the broader public in ways both revealing and potentially lethal,” wrote Smith. “In particular, [CEO] Lachlan Murdoch failed to pry its most important voices away from their embrace of the president’s early line: that the virus was not a big threat in the United States.”
I asked Smith what made the two weeks in February and early March more “crucial” than any other week since the end of December, when China first publicly confirmed it was treating patients for the diseased caused by the virus. “Those were the weeks when social distancing would have totally changed the trajectory of the thing,” he said. “Those were the weeks when Fox, rather than reporting on the virus story itself or other stories, was really fully ramped up in covering the media-politics story of it.”
But Smith doesn’t know what he’s talking about. It wasn’t until almost mid-March that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began publicly advising “social distancing" and warning against all but the smallest gatherings. The Trump administration had actually taken its first major step to contain the virus on Jan. 31 when Trump restricted travel from China and the State Department warned U.S. citizens against traveling to China. If anything, the first two weeks of February would have been the crucial time to start the practice, not the arbitrary dates chosen by Smith in an effort to shoehorn the facts into his narrative.
Smith also has to admit in his column that Tucker Carlson hadn't pushed the “Democratic- and media-led plot” narrative about the coronavirus, and the most he manages to pin on Sean Hannity is his (completely accurate) complaint on-air that Democrats have been politically exploiting the virus.
“Mr. Carlson, had been a rare voice on the network urging Mr. Trump to act more urgently,” he wrote. “Even Mr. Hannity had hosted Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, early on his show and warned of the risks.”
But, said Smith, there were others, as though it were a vast and widespread problem at Fox, even though he fails to provide a single clear example of what he's talking about outside of a Fox Business host, and she has been suspended, though it's not clear if it was for reasons related to her coronavirus coverage.
He mentions prime-time host Laura Ingraham. But, in the sole segment Smith quotes from Ingraham's show, and he quotes just one phrase out of a seven-minute monologue, she didn't downplay the virus's seriousness. In fact, part of her argument was that Trump was taking the virus seriously. She mentioned that he had restricted travel from China and declared coronavirus a public health emergency.
Ingraham did criticize the political response by Democrats and much of the media to "weaponize fear" and exploit the situation by blaming the spread of the virus on Trump. Citing multiple examples, she argued that Democrats were treating the virus as "a political godsend" and an opportunity to take Trump down. You know, like when New York Times columnist Gail Collins referred to the coronavirus as the "Trump virus."
At no point in the segment did Ingraham treat the virus itself as a frivolous concern. Smith probably ought to provide at least one example of that happening on the channel, given that it's the basis of his entire piece.
But, no, Smith's entire column is a reach. Lots of writers and commentators have focused on the politics of the virus without necessarily minimizing the importance of the virus itself. It’s why the last Democratic presidential debate earlier this month rendered headlines such as “Coronavirus takes center stage at Democratic debate.” At that event, Bernie Sanders, who presumably wants a Democrat in the White House next year, accused the president of “blabbering with unfactual information, which is confusing the general public."
The politics of it is a real story. It was certainly a bigger story in early March, before anyone (Smith included) expected to be forced into quarantine. The 2020 campaign, after all, didn’t stop with the spread of a new disease.
This isn’t Fox News’s fault. It’s China’s. But don’t ask journalists such as Smith to say that.

Texto completo: At a private New York meeting in October of 1940, William Knudsen made a desperate plea to the automobile industry’s top executives. Knudsen himself had been the president of General Motors until a few months earlier. But he had stepped down to help oversee military production at President Franklin Roosevelt’s request. The position paid $1 a year.
Knudsen told the executives that U.S. military officials surveying the Nazis’ bombing of England had concluded that the country with the strongest airpower was going to win the war. And the United States was badly behind. So Roosevelt and his military advisers wanted the car companies to forget about making cars, Knudsen said. They needed to begin making warplanes.
It was a radical request. It also matched the urgency of the situation. The car executives said yes, and the overhaul of Detroit became crucial to winning the war.
The coronavirus is not an actual war, but it does threaten modern society and human life in ways that nothing has in decades. More than 2 million Americans could die. Many will do so alone, separated from their family and friends. Funerals will often be impossible. Stores, schools and entire neighborhoods are shutting down. In the second quarter of this year, which starts next week, forecasters predict that the economy could shrink at the most rapid rate since the Great Depression.
This is a moment that calls for the urgency that Roosevelt and Knudsen summoned in the fall of 1940 — when, it’s worth remembering, the attack on Pearl Harbor was still more than a year away.
President Donald Trump, however, has chosen a different response.
He has repeatedly decided not to get out in front of the virus. Instead of taking aggressive steps that public-health experts were urging, he has moved slowly, presumably in the hope that things would somehow work out for the best. Only when it’s clear that they aren’t working for the best has he followed the advice that experts had been offering for weeks. He has then tried to rewrite recent history and claimed that his response had been aggressive from the start.
The first example, of course, was his effort to play down the virus for almost two months, starting in late January. He falsely said that the number of cases was falling and that the virus might just go away, “like a miracle.” Even as medical experts were warning about the lack of testing, Trump did nothing to fix the situation, and the United States fell badly behind other countries.
The biggest current example of Trump’s relaxed response is his refusal to use his authority — from a 1950 law, the Defense Production Act — to order a sweeping mobilization of medical supplies. It could resemble the old overhaul of Detroit, with companies directed to produce millions of masks, ventilators, gowns, inhalers, prescription drugs, virus tests and more.
If you spend any time talking with doctors, nurses and other front-line workers, you will hear how badly they need these supplies. You will also hear them explain, sometimes in tears, that the lack of supplies will have deadly consequences. Patients will die needlessly, and so will doctors and nurses.
Esther Choo, an emergency-room doctor in Oregon, started an online campaign called #GetMePPE (which refers to personal protective equipment), and it’s led to an outpouring of anguished stories. Vidya Kumar Ramanathan, a Michigan doctor, has had to reuse the same mask all day, which makes it impossible to cleanse herself of the virus while working. Jessica Varga, a New York-area anesthesiologist, had to buy her own eye protection on Amazon. Amy Silverman, a Colorado nurse, says some of her colleagues have used the same mask for weeks.
The federal government has lamely suggested that doctors and nurses use bandannas or scarves to shield their faces “as a last resort” — even though those items may not offer protection. It’s a far cry from the can-do spirit of 1940.
Some private companies, to their credit, are increasing production of medical equipment. But it’s not happening quickly enough. It’s also not happening in any organized way: Caregivers have had to create Google spreadsheets to do their best to match supplies and need. The only way for a national mobilization to happen quickly and efficiently is with presidential leadership.
Instead, Trump has taken to the White House lectern to boast that he has invoked the 1950 Defense Production Act, which is technically true. He has then made vague and often incorrect claims about all the good it’s doing. On Sunday, he tweeted that Ford, GM and Tesla had “the go ahead” to make ventilators, a statement that appears to have little meaning. His advisers, in anonymous interviews, have admitted the truth: He doesn’t want to direct companies to produce medical supplies because doing so would violate the administration’s free-market economic views.
I want to emphasize that blaming Trump for the appearance of coronavirus would be deeply unfair. No matter who was president, the virus would likely have created a crisis, as it has in Europe.
But it’s also important to be clear about the responsibility that does fall on Trump. His months of denial — and his acceptance of the testing fiasco — meant that the United States failed to isolate people with the virus, as South Korea and Singapore did. His refusal to fix the medical-supply crisis means that the virus is unnecessarily spreading in hospitals and that Americans will unnecessarily die.
The severity of the virus, in turn, will make the economic downtown worse and longer lasting. And Trump will be partly at fault. A reality-based response in January and February would have produced a different economy in April and May.
There is still a lot of uncertainty about the next few months. Maybe coronavirus will turn out to be much less bad than now seems likely. If so, that would be wonderful. If not, the president will deserve significant responsibility — for the human toll, for the depth of the recession, for his refusal to act when he could have.

Texto completo: Dr. Anthony Fauci is a bum.
A quack, a snake oil salesman.
He got his degrees online, not from Holy Cross and Cornell .
He watches Wheel of Fortune but not Jeopardy.
He's a Yankees fan.
Such character assassination is unsavory but necessary because Fauci's calm, reassuring competence in response to the coronavirus pandemic is placing him at serious risk of hearing the words that made his boss famous: You're fired.
President Trump is watching and listening to the same thing we are, i.e., Fauci going to the podium to rebut with facts the latest outbreak of paranoid anxiety or the president's regularly reckless statements.
Fauci is an oasis of rigor and reason in a barren desert of confusion and fear.
Which, given who he works for, makes him an endangered species.
During the Vietnam War, some US Army officer supposedly suggested that in order to save a village from the Vietcong they had to destroy it.
And so, to save Dr. Fauci, we must destroy him — at least in Trump's eyes.
Now that might sound crazy, but we're dealing with a crazy president in crazy circumstances.
It's not as if there's no relevant precedent here.
Two words: Bill Bratton.
Two other words: Rudy Giuliani. Who happens to be Trump's BFF.
Before Giuliani grew old, deranged, and more qualified to be a spokesman for Miracle Ear than the president's lawyer, he was the reform-minded mayor of New York City.
Rudy rode into Dodge, which is what Times Square resembled at the time, and vowed to clean it up. His hand-picked sheriff was Dorchester's own Bill Bratton.
As police commissioner, Bratton did much to stem violent crime in the nation's biggest city, but even more remarkably got his cops to reduce the incidence of more minor, so-called quality of life crimes that had made New York less livable, from the tony sections of Manhattan to the Tony Fauci sections of Brooklyn.
Bratton did his job too well. He ended up on the cover of Time magazine, hailed as the guy who pulled the worm out of the Big Apple. He became more popular than the mayor.
This drove Giuliani nuts. Rudy had to be the smartest guy in the room, had to get all the credit. Sound familiar?
So Bratton had to go.
That wasn't Bratton's first rodeo. Long before he landed in New York, he became the face of progressive, modern policing in his hometown, the youngest-ever Boston Police superintendent. Police Commissioner Joe Jordan resented his overly-ambitious No. 2 so he busted Bratton.
The point is, insecure bosses don't like being shown up by smarter, more competent subordinates. Small men make big mistakes.
It may be too late to save Fauci. He just got the star treatment from Maureen Dowd in The New York Times.
There used to be a thing called the Sports Illustrated curse, that after an athlete appeared on its cover his or her career tanked.
Similarly, being in the Trump administration and getting praised by The New York Times is the kiss of death.
Now, normally, you could print something in the Times and chances were the president wouldn't read it. He routinely dismisses the Gray Old Lady as fake news, except when his and his family's lousy books are mass-bought onto the newspaper's bestsellers list. He is not fond of polysyllabic words and prefers to get his news from “Fox & Friends" or whatever white nationalist website his aide Stephen Miller might recommend.
But Trump reads Mo Dowd because they have known each other forever and she writes about him at a nuanced, personal level that drives him especially cuckoo.
We're way past the theoretical here.
Tony Fauci is in real danger, and by extension so are the rest of us who expect — nay, pray for — one person in the White House to be trustworthy and competent in a time of unprecedented crisis.
So, again, repeat after me, Dr. Anthony Fauci is a bum.
Love live the bum.

Robert Saldin and Steven Teles: These conservatives knew Trump would be a disaster in a crisis

Texto completo: In the blink of an eye, the essential nature of the American presidency seems to have changed. Only days ago most Republicans were cheering along to the president’s less than statesmanlike routine and happy to let him act as the chief culture warrior and judicial nominator in chief. But suddenly, the specter of COVID-19 has made owning the libs seem slightly less important and shined a bright light on the centrality of character to presidential leadership.
Even such fervid supporters of President Trump as Tucker Carlson have admitted that his management of his administration in this crisis has left something to be desired.
But there is one group of Republicans for whom the president’s performance under pressure has been entirely unsurprising — the oft-abused when not entirely neglected NeverTrumpers. Almost no one predicted that a global pandemic would be the test of President Trump’s mettle as a leader. But if you interviewed conservative critics of Trump as we did for a book, many of them emphasized precisely those aspects of the president’s character that have come to the fore in the last few weeks.
Many NeverTrumpers disliked what they saw as Trump’s violations of conservative orthodoxy, but what really cleaved them from their former friends who made peace with the president was their obsession with what they referred to as “character.” This concern was dismissed by most Republicans as moral preening or a Pollyannaish unwillingness to recognize the distinction between private morality and realpolitik.
But NeverTrumpers feared that Trump’s own cruelty, narcissism and sexual incontinence would make the job of remoralizing the country that much harder, a goal they prioritized over tax cuts, deregulation and judicial nominations. As the controversial conservative social scientist Charles Murray told us in the summer of 2019: “You can’t have a successful limited government unless you have a population that itself is virtuous. And so, that means character in the leaders is important, not just so they can perform a job effectively. It’s extremely important as an emblem of what the country’s all about.”
Many NeverTrumpers who held important positions in previous Republican administrations agreed. These conservative critics of Trump recognized — if only in outline — that the president’s personal pathologies that would lead to something like his disastrous management of the COVID-19 crisis. While most Republicans focused on Trump as an ideological and cultural bludgeon with which to pummel their enemies, NeverTrumpers foresaw that his character and governing instincts would have unpredictable and terrifying consequences.
When we spoke to Pete Wehner, a veteran of three Republican administrations (and a New York Times contributing opinion writer), in 2017, for example, he emphasized that judging Trump purely by his willingness to wage partisan war on behalf of Republicans was an erroneous standard, given the unpredictability of the president’s agenda. “There’s just too many things in the presidency that you can’t anticipate … You ultimately have to depend on the wisdom and prudence, the insight of an individual. And Donald Trump strikes me as … somebody with a disordered personality. I think he’s emotionally and psychologically unstable, and is temperamentally dangerous.”
Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, the inability of President Trump to strike an elevated, sober tone that reflects the seriousness of the moment has been clear for all to see. Philip Zelikow, who was a top deputy to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, emphasized to us in 2017 that, “In government, you’re often in a world in which there are lots of different ceremonials associated with appropriate behavior — funerals, commemorations — and I think all of this just tends to maybe give a stronger consciousness of the expectations for an American president and what an American president represents.”
Trump’s inability to shape himself to the ceremonial character of the presidency has a long track record, going back to his bizarrely improper tone in his visit to the CIA’s Memorial Wall the day after his inauguration. This failure has had grave consequences in his response to the current pandemic, as during his trip to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, when he not only passed along erroneous information, but quite implausibly talked up his acumen in the field of medical science and returned to his “perfect” phone call with the Ukraine president.
Eliot Cohen, another former assistant to Secretary Rice, emphasized to us in 2017 that Trump seemed entirely incapable of embracing and being shaped by the office of the presidency.
“One thing you get from foreign policy and national security people is they do have this sense of the dignity of the office. Particularly if you’ve been in the White House, as all of us have been. That sense of … who the previous occupants of it have been, and the things that had come across their desk, the things that they had done. It seemed to me, and it seems to me today, to be a desecration.”
Finally, in a crisis that demanded that the president listen carefully to and mobilize professional, expert knowledge, President Trump has been almost entirely at sea. Peter Feaver, a political-science professor at Duke and a former National Security Council staff member under George W. Bush, thought that Republicans had already flirted too much with an anti-analytical and anti-professional stance in their romance with Sarah Palin and that, “Donald Trump personified the problems of 2012 — outrageous statements, not well-briefed, a stance of anti-expertise, as if knowing something about the policy, having experience, was a bad thing … Donald Trump was personifying that, doubling down on it, tripling down on it.”
Many of the NeverTrumpers have much to answer for themselves, including their role in the Iraq War. But in their instinctual revulsion at Donald Trump, they saw something that other Republicans allowed themselves to ignore. They realized that character defects that are corrosive of the nation’s character in the long-term can be threats to the people’s literal short-term survival when the country faces unanticipated emergencies — as almost every president does. We are now all facing the life and death consequences of ignoring their warnings.

To verify accuracy, please compare to our digital microfilm at www.stltoday.newspapers.com. The old ballplayer was asleep in the other room. But his daughter was wide awake, so she turned on the radio. It was some overnight sports show, and they were taking about her daddy.
Now, the insomniac was incensed.
"I called in about it!" explained Sara Saucier, 66, of Amarillo, Texas. "They were saying the only thing he was known for was the Eddie Gaedel at-bat. And I said: 'You need to do your research, because there's much more than that.'"
Sure, yes, former St. Louis Browns player Frank Saucier forever is the answer to a trivia question -- for whom who did the 3-foot-7 Eddie Gaedel pinch-hit? But Saucier had a unique baseball career and a fascinating life.
- He's got a college baseball field named after him.
- He served in World War II and during the Korean War.
- In 1949, his first full season in pro ball, his minor-league batting average was .446.
- In 1950, he hit .343 as a minor leaguer and made the cover of "The Sporting News."
Then, he hit oil. Temporarily quit baseball. Was talked back into the game by Bill Veeck.
He finished as one of the rare players who has a hit -- but only one -- in a major-league career.
And in regards to St. Louis pro baseball, he's one of the best that never was.
"But I look back at what he did and what he accomplished in life, and he did everything he wanted to do," said his first cousin, Tom Saucier, raised in O'Fallon, Mo., and currently living in O'Fallon, Ill. "I'm awfully proud of him. You can always do the what-ifs? But if you change one domino, do you still get the same result? This is the way I want to remember Frank. I don't want to what-if him to death."
Frank Saucier is 93 and lives with Sara down in Amarillo. He's one of only eight men to play for the Browns who is still living (the American League's Browns became the Baltimore Orioles beginning in 1954). Sara said he was unavailable to do a phone interview, but she and other family members, as well as a local sports historian, shared insights and perspective about the man "The Sporting News" called "Mr. Slug."
The batting baron   
The French pronounce it "Saw-see-ay." But Frank grew up in the German-influenced Missouri town of Washington, where they dropped a syllable, smashed some sounds together and came up with "So-shay."
Frank So-shay graduated high school at age 16. He joined the Navy and was granted a waiver at 18 to be commissioned as an officer. This was historic, per a 1993 story in The Washington Missourian, as Saucier became one of the youngest deck officers commissioned in the modern U.S. Navy.
After serving in Japan and the Philippines, Saucier headed to Fulton's Westminster College. He arrived five months after Winston Churchill came to campus and delivered his famous "Iron Curtain" speech. At Westminster, Saucier impressed with statistics -- he earned a mathematics degree. And his hitting numbers were so good, they ended up naming the school's field after him.
Saucier sashayed his way into pro ball -- that .446 mark in 1949 was the highest in any pro league that year, so he won a silver bat from Hillerich & Bradsby. He's still got it.
Now, as the old story goes, when he proposed, his team was in last place. It was the 1950 season for San Antonio of the Texas League. Frank asked Virginia Pullen to marry him. They set a date for right after the season. But Frank won another batting crown and the team went on a late run.
"Frank had to call," said his cousin Tom. "He told her, 'I don't think we're going to be able to get married on the day we decided on.' And she said, 'Well, you better figure something out.' Click!"
The San Antonio team qualified for the Dixie Series, a clash against the champs from the Southern Association. For his wedding, Saucier was going to have to miss one of the games. So they postponed the game. Well, this was actually done because the club officials feared Texans wouldn't come that Saturday night, because Texas A&M had a football game against Texas Tech. But the San Antonio baseball officials also knew this meant Saucier could have his wedding cake and eat it, too.
Frank got a ring, didn't miss a game . . . and after a Game 7 win, earned another ring.
By this point in his minor-league career, Saucier looked like the next George Sisler. Made the cover of "The Sporting News" in January 1951. But he had a new wife and a second life as an offseason oil man.
"I was content,'' he told The New York Times in 1991. ''I had also invested in an oil well (in Oklahoma). And in February of 1951, lo and behold, the well began flowing 150 barrels natural a day. So, I quit baseball."
Think about that. The top hitting prospect in the minors just stopped playing.
But times were different. Ballplayers didn't make gargantuan sums. In the spring of 1951, the Browns tried to bring Saucier to camp but he held out -- demanding a larger salary. That April, he was placed on the suspended player list for a failure to report. He didn't seem to care.
But during summer of 1951, the great showman Veeck became owner of the Browns. He kept hearing about the prospect who became an oil prospector. He finally tracked down Saucier, and his parent's home in Washington, Mo., on the Fourth of July. Veeck reached him by phone late at night, made the 51-mile drive and the two negotiated until the early morning.
"Veeck worked out a unique deal to pay him $10,000 with a bunch of IOUs, so it didn't look like his salary was that much," said historian Ed Wheatley, author of the upcoming book, "Baseball in St. Louis -- From Little Leagues to Major Leagues."
Saucier was headed to St. Louis.
Making history
But he hadn't been training -- and already missed spring training. And it was July. Soon he suffered acute bursitis in his right shoulder. He tallied his first (and only) hit on Aug. 5, against Cleveland's Mike Garcia. And on Aug. 19, even though he was undergoing shoulder treatments, he got a start in right field. Veeck spread word to the citizens of Washington that Saucier would start. Locals piled in a bus that took them to Sportsman's Park. Saucier played the top of the first in right, and prepared to leadoff the bottom of the inning, when . . .
Yep, Eddie Gaedel, a 3-foot-7 non-ballplayer, was inserted into the lineup to bat for Frank Saucier.
Gaedel, hired by Veeck, had a miniature bat and wore the bat boy uniform of a club executive's son. The bat boy was Bill DeWitt Jr., the current chairman of the St. Louis Cardinals. An addition was made to the jersey, though. Gaedel's uniform number was 1/8.
''I just laughed," Saucier told The New York Times in 1991. "I thought this was one of the greatest acts of show business I'd ever seen, and still do. But the umpire didn't. It was Ed Hurley, and he said to (manager Zack) Taylor, 'You can't do this.' And Zack said, 'Yes, I can, I have the contract right here in my pocket.'
''I remember Zack hollering to Eddie, 'Don't swing!' So Eddie bent over and his strike zone was about an inch high. He walked on four pitches, of course. As he trotted to first base, he stopped and tipped his hat to the crowd and waved. And then when he got on first, Jim Delsing went out to pinch-run for him.
''Eddie came back to the dugout and sat down beside me. I said, 'Eddie, you were kind of showin' it up a little bit there, weren't you?' 'Man,' he said, 'I felt like Babe Root.' ''
The fans from Washington got back on the bus.
Saucier finished the season one for 14 (.071 batting average). The next year, 1952, Saucier served his country again, this time during the Korean War.
In 1954, he was out of the service. Still only 28, the now Baltimore Orioles tried to get Saucier to rediscover baseball. But there was a family to raise and money to be made. By the 1960s, "His company was the No. 1 gas chemical distributor in the world for Union Carbide," Sara said.
Frank and Virginia raised two kids. Virginia passed away in 2009. Frank now is in Amarillo, where he spends his time reading the Bible and "Field & Stream" magazine. He loves studying Saucier genealogy and eating at Dyer's BBQ.
"It's like his own, personal 'Cheers,'" cousin Tom said.
There, everyone knows his name -- and not just because of Eddie Gaedel.
"I always have pretty much idolized my father," Sara said. "But not from the perspective that he's a pro athlete. He's your all-around good guy. An outstanding man. Those things are much more important to him than fame."

Texto completo: Washington • It’s not easy being a national treasure.
“I’m exhausted,” confessed Dr. Anthony Fauci when I reached him Thursday evening in the middle of another 18-hour workday.
“I have changed my tune a bit, probably thanks to my wife,” said the 79-year-old director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “About a week ago, I was going about four or five days in a row on about three hours of sleep, which is completely crazy, ’cause then I’ll be going on fumes. The last couple of nights, I’ve gotten five hours’ sleep, so I feel much better.”
He said he misses the endorphins of power walking, and he is wracked when he gets home at midnight and it’s too late to answer calls and emails.
“I gotta get rid of this guilt feeling,” he murmured about that moment’s 727 emails.
He said he has not been tested for the coronavirus but takes his temperature every day and usually has it taken another couple times before White House press conferences and meetings in the Oval.
When I spoke with him, he had been missing from the White House briefing for two days and Twitter blew a gasket, with everyone from Susan Rice to Laurence Tribe seeking an answer to the urgent query, “Where is Dr. Fauci?”
Donald Trump, the ultimate “me” guy, is in a “we” crisis and it isn’t pretty. The president is so consumed by his desire to get back his binky, a soaring stock market, that he continues to taffy-twist the facts, leaving us to look elsewhere — to Fauci and governors like Andrew Cuomo and Gavin Newsom — for leadership during this grim odyssey.
Fauci chuckled at speculation that he was banished due to his habit of pushing back on Trump’s hyperbolic and self-serving ad-libbing.
“That’s kind of funny but understandable that people said, ‘What the hell’s the matter with Fauci?’ because I had been walking a fine line; I’ve been telling the president things he doesn’t want to hear,” he said. “I have publicly had to say something different with what he states.
“It’s a risky business. But that’s my style, Maureen. You know me for many years. I say it the way it is, and if he’s gonna get pissed off, he’s gonna get pissed off. Thankfully, he is not. Interestingly.”
The first time I talked to Fauci was during a panic in the mid-1980s about stopping another virus, the cause of the heartbreaking AIDS crisis. Then, as now, he was honest, brave and innovative. He told me that he tries to be diplomatic when he has to contradict the president about what “game-changer” cures might be on the horizon and whether everyone who wants to be tested can get tested.
“I don’t want to embarrass him,” the immunologist said, in his gravelly Brooklyn accent. “I don’t want to act like a tough guy, like I stood up to the president. I just want to get the facts out. And instead of saying, ‘You’re wrong,’ all you need to do is continually talk about what the data are and what the evidence is.
“And he gets that. He’s a smart guy. He’s not a dummy. So he doesn’t take it — certainly up to now — he doesn’t take it in a way that I’m confronting him in any way. He takes it in a good way.”
On Friday, a trigger-happy Trump was so quick to talk up the fabulous possibilities of an anti-malarial drug in combating the virus that Fauci had to pump the brakes, taking the microphone to explain that we do not know yet because controlled testing is needed.
The president returned to the lectern to press his unscientific case and compliment himself: “I’m a smart guy,” he said. “I feel good about it. And we’re going to see. You’re going to see soon enough.”
Probably thinking about all his government staffers working round-the-clock, Fauci could not help rubbing his forehead and cheek — going against his own advice to the public — when Trump cracked a joke about the “Deep State Department.”
Although the scientist listens respectfully when the president and the vice president are talking, he somehow manages to emit an “Oh my God, please don’t say that” vibe when the two men scamper over the line. When Mike Pence went into false-hope overdrive, saying, “I just can’t emphasize enough about the incredible progress that we have made on testing,” Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx, the administration’s virus response coordinator, exchanged a whispered aside that sent the internet into a frenzy.
Fauci assured me that, despite their crosscurrents and an early overconfidence about how easy it would be to control the path of the virus, the president “absolutely” now gets the threat of “the invisible enemy,” as Trump calls the virus.
Still, Trump managed to have an hourlong press conference about public health guidance in which he relentlessly ran afoul of public health guidance.
He wants to think of himself as a wartime president, but he can’t rise above his pettiness and defensiveness long enough to stop trashing White House reporters who are simply trying to do their job under perilous circumstances. He also can’t move away from his old standby, xenophobia.
Trump has never understood anything about government, so he doesn’t know what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention versus the Food and Drug Administration versus the Federal Emergency Management Agency should do. His improvisational leadership style was vividly — and disturbingly — on display Friday during a call with Chuck Schumer, who urged him to invoke the Defense Production Act to get ventilators and masks to desperate states — despite the president’s cavalier remark a day earlier that the federal government is “not a shipping clerk” for the states. “Then POTUS yelled to someone in his office to do it now,” a Schumer spokesman reported.
Trump is just a petrified salesman who believes in perception over reality. He thinks if he can create the perception that this is going to be a quick fix and there’s a little pill coming, then the stock market will roar back, along with his 2020 momentum.
With Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Great Depression, the only thing to fear was fear itself. With Trump and our new abyss, we have to fear not only fear but also the ignorance and misdirection of the White House and the profiteering of senators. Not to mention the virus.

Texto completo: MAIDUGURI, Nigeria - The six young women set down their bombs and stood around the well, staring into the dark void.
As captives of Boko Haram, one of the deadliest terror groups on Earth, the women had been dispatched for the grimmest of missions: go blow up a mosque and everyone inside.
The women wanted to get rid of their bombs without killing anyone, including themselves. One of them, Balaraba Mohammed, then a 19-year-old who had been blindfolded and kidnapped by Boko Haram a few months earlier, came up with a plan: They removed their headscarves and tied them into a long rope. Mohammed attached the bombs and gingerly lowered them into the well, praying it was filled with water.
She let go.
"We ran for our lives," Mohammed said.
In the decadelong war with Boko Haram that has coursed through northeast Nigeria and spread to three neighboring countries, more than 500 women have been deployed as suicide bombers or apprehended before they carried out their deadly missions - a number that terrorism experts said exceeds any other conflict in history.
Some, like Mohammed and the women at the well, have resisted, foiling the extremists' plans in quiet and often unheralded ways.
But most women who broke away from Boko Haram keep their abductions secret, knowing they would be stigmatized as terrorist sympathizers even though they were held against their will and defied the militants. They walk the streets of Maiduguri, Nigeria, in the shadow of billboards celebrating the heroism of Malala Yousafzai, who was shot for standing up to the Taliban.
The women are often forgotten, not unlike the more than 100 schoolgirls kidnapped from the village of Chibok who remain missing - nearly six years after their abduction caused such global alarm.
Dozens of women interviewed by The New York Times have said that Boko Haram gave them a terrible choice: "marry" the group's fighters or be deployed as bombers. Captives have said some women chose instead to blow up only themselves.
But some survived and want to tell their stories. Mohammed is one.
Mohammed said she arrived at the Boko Haram camp in a daze in 2012. Boko Haram had murdered her husband in front of her after he criticized the group. Days later they came back for Mohammed, throwing her baby to the ground and abducting her. She thought her daughter was dead.
New female captives would arrive every time fighters left the camp. Some of them were raped and forced to take birth control pills, she said. Some of them were used to test suicide vests.
Mohammed considered suicide, but she thought of her ailing grandmother who needed her as caretaker. To get out of being married off to a fighter, she said she feigned sickness. To get out of weapons training, she faked mental illness.
When fighters gave her a bomb, she said, "I felt as if I was dead." She knew she would have to go or be shot.
Which is how she found herself with five others at the edge of that well.
The bombs didn't detonate, and the young women, scared and unsure what to do, ran back to the Boko Haram camp, Mohammed said. They swore on a Quran to their captors they had accomplished their mission and that they ran so fast to escape that they lost their hijabs on the way.
Cheers went up from the fighters.
The six women, two of them barely teenagers, had outsmarted Islamic extremists.
For women trying to escape Boko Haram's clutches, all the options are bad. Those trying to surrender to authorities are sometimes killed by nervous soldiers, according to UNICEF.
After the trick at the well, fighters sent Mohammed and the other women on a second suicide mission along with a new captive. She said their target was to be a market in Banki, a once-bustling town. One of the fighters planned to escort the women. But the new captive assured the militants she was from Banki and knew her way through the countryside.
Again, the women collected their bombs and used their hijabs to lower them into the well. They sprinted back to the fighters' camp expecting the same joyous reception.
But fighters were shocked to see them so soon.
Just then, the radio crackled with news: a bombing had been reported in Banki - but in a small village outside the main town, not in the market. The fighters turned on the new captive, thinking she had led the women to the wrong place.
They shot her to death.
Days went by, and fighters came and went, engaging in fierce battles that claimed some of their lives.
Mohammed was locked in a tin shack with other captives as they listened to fighters preparing for vigilante forces to invade the camp.
"I was saying in my heart that 'Oh God, even if I would die, let my relatives find my corpse,' " she said.
She heard gunshots and a loud noise. She lost consciousness.
Hadiza Musa, who had joined the local vigilante force to avenge the Boko Haram capture of her sister, arrived to find a horrific scene: The entire camp was on fire, and there was carnage everywhere. In an attempt to distract the vigilantes, Musa said, it appeared that Boko Haram had blown up their own camp and their captives and fled.
Musa said she sifted through the dead and came across Mohammed, who was unconscious with burns covering her body and blood pouring from what looked like a bullet wound to her leg. Musa cried as she helped ferry Mohammed to a hospital.
Musa stayed by Mohammed, caring for her until she was conscious. She tracked down her grandmother and told Mohammed the first good news she had heard in months: Her baby, Hairat, was alive.
Musa and Mohammed now consider themselves sisters. Mohammed still bears scars from burns to her face, arms and legs. In Maiduguri, where she lives with Hairat, who is now in first grade, some neighbors who know she was abducted think she might be loyal to Boko Haram.
"The best thing is for you to be killed," a neighbor told Mohammed.
She tries to ignore those kinds of comments. She knows none of the ordeal was her fault. She pays for Hairat's schooling by knitting caps and selling soft drinks from a rented mini-refrigerator. She makes regular trips to the morgue to search for her brother's body.
Mohammed has started training to become a nurse. She couldn't afford fees for recent exams after an uncle kicked her out of his house, still suspicious of her time with militants.
Until she can save up money for the exam, she keeps a first aid kit with her.

Texto completo: Editor's note: The author, a professor of art history at Rowan University in Glassboro, knew the late John Seward Johnson Jr., well and followed his career for many years. This is his tribute.
John Seward Johnson, Jr., took sculpture from the museum to the public square.
As a prolific sculptor, he created hyper-realist figures with meticulously rendered clothing and accessories in familiar poses that celebrated ordinary aspects of daily activities.
Johnson, founder of Grounds for Sculpture sculpture park and nearby Seward Johnson Atelier in Hamilton, died on March 10, a month before his 90th birthday, surrounded by family at his winter home in Key West.
The artist once said, "It is easy to forget the simple things that give us pleasure." Like Walt Whitman, Johnson was a "poet of the soul." He vigorously engaged with people from all walks of life, and his approachable, photogenic sculptures do the same.
Johnson, known to those who knew him as Seward, has left a legacy of hundreds of sculptures in public and private collections, many of them in New Jersey. He established Grounds for Sculpture, the incomparable sculpture park, in 1992. From a modest start, it has expanded to over 40 acres with sculpture exhibitions and varied programs for all ages.
At the time of the park's silver anniversary in 2017, Johnson said, "We created the impossible."
He also founded the Johnson Atelier, a high-tech facility for the production of cast sculpture. In addition, he was a philanthropist for numerous social, cultural, and arts education causes.
Heir to a famous fortune Johnson was an heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, so his name is familiar from the red script on consumer healthcare products.
As grandson of one of the co-founders of the New Brunswick-based multinational corporation, he had an unsettled, itinerant childhood. When he was three years old, soon after the notorious Lindbergh baby kidnapping in Hopewell and an attempted break-in a few weeks later at the nearby Johnson estate, the family left New Jersey for safety.
A diagnosis eventually confirmed he had dyslexia, explaining many years of academic difficulties for the future artist.
At 38, Johnson was introduced to three-dimensional art making through his wife, Cecelia Joyce. In 1968, when he won the Design in Steel Award for "Stainless Girl," a sinuous recumbent nude female figure, which he enjoyed saying "was created in nine months," Johnson found his artistic calling.
The result was the creation of nearly a thousand cast metal sculptures with their technically refined colored patinas or painted surfaces placed like "decoys" in outdoor settings.
President of the Naughty Club Possessing a quick wit and an infectious laugh, Johnson was an entertaining storyteller who enjoyed festive gatherings accompanied by good wine and food.
At Grounds for Sculpture, he often hosted sing-along get-togethers.
The artist never took himself too seriously, though he knew many famous figures from Cory Booker to Gloria Vanderbilt to Robert DeNiro to Joyce Carol Oates.
At a luncheon several years ago, Johnson recalled Georgia O'Keefe joining a few of the artists from the former foundry at the Johnson Atelier on a visit to a New Jersey strip club. And Johnson declared himself the president of his grandchildren's Naughty Club.
Johnson's sense of humor carried over to his art. Along with its clever title, "Turn of the Century" has Renoir dancing figures serenaded by Mariachi players.
"The Greeters," installed at the entrance of Grounds for Sculpture, includes Johnson's "grumpy accountant" as the inspiration for the figure holding a sign that reads, "We thought you'd never get here!" A tipsy young man in the group raises a bourbon bottle to toast, "I drink to your arrival."
'A palpable connection with sculpture' Johnson's series of sculptures called "Beyond the Frame" are based on acclaimed 19th-century French paintings that celebrate the joy of life. In addition to putting the viewer into a three-dimensional version of these Impressionist and Post-Impressionist works, Johnson quipped, "I am able to see what the artist originally missed."
His son, John Seward Johnson, III, who co-founded BuzzFeed, endearingly commented that his father was, "always considering something from an upside-down point of view."
Johnson strove to achieve what he called "the visceral moment ... a palpable connection with a sculpture ... the viewer's moment of receiving the message, the value of art," the sculptor explained.
Tom Moran, chief curator at Grounds for Sculpture, said Johnson "did not think of himself as part of a movement; he was one-of-a-kind ... He loved sculpture."
Associated with the artist and his career for many years, Paula Stoeke, curator of The Seward Johnson Atelier, affirmed, "He had so much fun making every single one."
Johnson was truly a people-person, wanting to connect with humanity. The sculptor asserted, "Life is marvelous!"
'But is it art?' "Classics" — the artist's first series — pays tribute to everyday heroes. These life-size sculptures of men, women and children populate public spaces.
"Sunday Morning," at the entrance of the Cherry Public Library, is a young couple placed directly on the grass reading the Arts and Leisure Sunday section of The New York Times (August 9, 1981). In the man's hand, the page is opened to a story with the headline, "But is it Art?" That word offers a comment on both the obvious illusion that the two figures might be real people on the lawn, as well as how some highbrow critics had dismissed his illustrative groupings as not credible art.
There are many amusing stories about Johnson's figures being mistaken for real people. A few years ago, at Drumthwacket, the governor's residence in Princeton, "Between Appointments," which depicts a man napping on a bench, had been installed as a temporary loan. The state troopers working as the property's security force were not notified of the new addition outside the mansion. One of the troopers during his surveillance rounds in the dim light of dusk or dawn called out to the man to stand up. Since there was no response, guns were drawn; fortunately, no shots were fired at the sculpture.
More than 30 Johnson sculptures are currently installed at various New Jersey sites including: The Seeing Eye in Morristown; Kean University in Union; Hackensack Meridian Health; the Hudson River Waterfront Walkway in Jersey City; Richard J. Hughes Justice Complex in Trenton, as well as en route from the Hamilton Train Station to Grounds for Sculpture.
Johnson was committed to making sculpture accessible, so plaques at Grounds for Sculpture suggest, "Please touch with respect" and he was pleased when vision-impaired visitors talked about "seeing" his work.
Losing a friend For 20 years, I had the pleasure of a special friendship with Seward Johnson.
He was very unassuming about how he helped aspiring artists. I experienced this first-hand through the highly competitive and generous Seward Johnson Artist Development Travel Scholarship awarded each spring semester to an art major at Rowan University. Since its inception in 2006, this award has enabled a student to spend at least four months based in Florence, Italy.
After learning of Johnson's death, Jessica Padilla, who received this scholarship in 2011 and went on to receive her MFA degree from the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 2018, wrote in an unsolicited email, "I will be forever grateful for the once in a lifetime opportunity he gave us. He was a generous, creative soul. A beautiful man."
Likewise, Joseph Cimino, awarded the undergraduate scholarship in 2018 and returned this year to pursue the MFA degree at Studio Arts College International in Florence, emailed from Italy, "Without his scholarship I would not be in graduate school here right now nor the person I am today. I am forever grateful for him and the impact he has had on my life."
It was impressive to see Johnson interact with the students after their overseas experience, encouraging them with insightful, caring critical comments about their work.
Through Seward Johnson's creative accomplishments and innumerable philanthropic activities that advocate for the arts, he established a remarkable legacy that will continue to be a fanfare for the common man.
As Walt Whitman wrote, "I am of old and young, of the foolish as much as the wise, Regardless of others, ever regardful of others."

Texto completo: Editor's note: The author, a professor of art history at Rowan University in Glassboro, knew the late John Seward Johnson Jr., well and followed his career for many years. This is his tribute.
John Seward Johnson Jr., took sculpture from the museum to the public square.
As a prolific sculptor, he created hyper-realist figures with meticulously rendered clothing and accessories in familiar poses that celebrated ordinary aspects of daily activities.
Johnson, founder of Grounds for Sculpture sculpture park and nearby Seward Johnson Atelier in Hamilton, died on March 10, a month before his 90th birthday, surrounded by family at his winter home in Key West.
The artist once said, "It is easy to forget the simple things that give us pleasure." Like Walt Whitman, Johnson was a "poet of the soul." He vigorously engaged with people from all walks of life, and his approachable, photogenic sculptures do the same.
Johnson, known to those who knew him as Seward, has left a legacy of hundreds of sculptures in public and private collections, many of them in New Jersey. He established Grounds for Sculpture, the incomparable sculpture park, in 1992. From a modest start, it has expanded to over 40 acres with sculpture exhibitions and varied programs for all ages.
At the time of the park's silver anniversary in 2017, Johnson said, "We created the impossible."
He also founded the Johnson Atelier, a high-tech facility for the production of cast sculpture. In addition, he was a philanthropist for numerous social, cultural, and arts education causes.

Texto completo: The albatross hanging from every arts reporter' neck is the stack of untouched books sitting on their desk, on a shelf, or shamefully hidden away in the closet farthest from them. Sent in from authors, agents and publishers it is the combined weight of all these unwritten about books that (I assume) will one day drag my soul to the depth of the River Styx. With the coronavirus forcing most events to shut down or cancel, we are all now going to have a lot more time on our hands for literary pursuits.
'Afterlife' by Julia Alvarez Genre: Fiction
Length: ~250 pages
From the author of "In the Time of Butterflies" is a new novel for adults. "Afterlife" is a novel about immigrant and English teacher Antonia Vega who is hit with a trio of problems at once. Her husband dies, her sister goes missing and an undocumented and pregnant teenager appears at her doorstep.
The book, a roughly 250-page affair, is scheduled for release on April 7, 2020.
'All the Flowers in Paris' by Sarah Jio Genre: Fiction
Length: ~ 300 pages
A novel that switches between a pair of perspectives, one of which is Caroline, who wakes up with no memory in a Paris hospital in 2009. The other is Celine, a woman in Nazi-occupied Paris in 1943. The story follows both women as they try to make sense of their respective situations: Caroline who gradually pieces together who she is and Celine who needs to try to
Not necessarily the kind of book I myself would be on the edge of my seat to read, but I can think of a half dozen friends I'd recommend this to by description alone. Plus, an aspect of Caroline's character is discovering she's had a "reclusive life in a sprawling apartment on the rue Cler," which — at this moment —sounds like the exact situation I'd like to be living in (at least for the next few weeks).
'An American Bum in China' by Tom Carter Genre: Biography
Length: ~125 pages
A brief biography following five years with Muscatine native Matthew Evans as he finds himself in China in 2014 as the Hong Kong protests were just beginning. Evans' tale is told by Tom Carter who previously published "Unsavory Elements: Stories of Foreigners on the Loose in China."
Initially, I'd planned to run a review of the book back in December that didn't end up finding its way to print. It was a topical read at the time with the Hong Kong protests in the news cycle and — while Hong Kong hasn't been the focus of recent coverage — China's arguably in the news cycle even more now than it was then.
'Bedlam' by Kenneth Paul Rosenberg, MD Genre: Nonfiction
Length: ~200 pages
The full title of the text is "Bedlam: An Intimate Journey Into America's Mental Health Crisis." Rosenberg's book is intended to give readers an inside look at the American mental health system and its failings. After seven years of interviews, the book uses those accounts to shine a light on the criminalization of individuals with mental health issues among other topics.
This book and the author behind it are the exact kinds of things I love to cover. When it was first delivered to our office I showed it to everyone in the newsroom. The only reason why it's not pending on my personal reading list is I'm not sure I have the emotional fortitude to read about institutional, systemic failure, especially at this particular moment.
'Bloody Genius' by John Sanford Genre: Mystery
Length: ~375 pages
This is the most recent Virgil Flowers novel from New York Times bestselling author John Sanford, marking the 12th novel in a series that started in 2007 with "Dark of the Moon." In this particular book, a culture war on a state campus between the science and medical departments is interrupted when a scholar turns up dead. Enter the series investigator Virgil Flowers, tasked with finding the killer.
While this title was briefly alluded to in my write-up on the 2019 Iowa City Book Festival, it didn't end up receiving full coverage, even though Sanford is a Cedar Rapids native and University of Iowa grad. This fell by the wayside for me at the time partly because of my own ignorance of Sanford being a local name and the sheer volume of events surrounding the book festival.
'Deacon King Kong' by James McBride Genre: Historical Fiction
Length: ~375 pages
Set in September of 1969, "Deacon King Kong" starts with the deacon of Five Ends Baptist Church shooting a 19-year-old-drug dealer in the face in South Brooklyn. The release that came with the book touts it as being infused with "humor and compassion" as it explores the lives of the fictional characters around this incident.
I've had a copy of this book so long and I've wanted to read it so bad! As if to taunt me Penguin Random House sent me a second copy which I also have not read.
I'm positive I'll get around to this once I work through my personal pending backlog of unread books, but like Entertainment Weekly and The New York Times, this book is high on my to-read list and can make it to yours too since it was released on March 3.
'The Dearly Beloved' by Cara Wall Genre: Fiction
Length: ~350 pages
The story of this novel spent 15 years coming into focus for its author, Iowa Writers' Workshop graduate Cara Wall, who first conceived of the novel during her 2004 pregnancy. The book focuses on a pair of couples, each of which includes an individual drawn to the Christian faith and another who is skeptical of it.
This is another novel I had planned to write a review of. First, before it's Aug. 13, 2019 publication and then before Wall's Sept. 23 visit to Prairie Lights. Though outside my general area of interest, it's one I feel strangely drawn to and would like to finish someday.
'Everywhere You Don't Belong' by Gabriel Bump Genre: Fiction
Length: ~250 pages
This is the first novel from the Chicago originating author Gabriel Bump, an experience explored in this novel through the character of Claude McKay, a young black man growing up on the South Side.
This is another book on my personal reading list and comes recommended by numerous other publications. it represents yet another instance of not enough local connections for me to cover.
'The Mountains Sing' by Nguyen Phan Que Mail Genre: Historical Fiction
Length: ~350 pages
The 11th book from Nguyen Phan Que Mai, "The Mountains Sing" follow the Tran family as they navigate their way through a Vietnam wrapped in War. The most recent addition to my ever-growing work shelf of unread books, "The Mountains Sing" will have been published just before this article runs. I have never read this book, but, for what it's worth, it comes with my highest recommendation.
'One Night At the Lake' by Bethany Chase Genre: Fiction
Length: ~275 pages
The jacket description of this book pitches two straight forward premises. The first: Leah has been dating Ollie for four years and, upon being invited to his family's lake house, she suspects he's going to propose. The second: June is visiting her fiance's Ollie's lake house, "a house haunted by long-buried memories of her lost friend" Leah.
If this wasn't the first novel that hit my desk after I started at the P-C last year, it's one of the first. But I'd completely forgotten about it until I started putting this list together. It's not usually the kind of thing I'd go for, but if the description appeals to you, it strikes me as the kind of book that would be a pleasant distraction during turbulent times.

Rethinking coronavirus relief from the ground up

Texto completo: Before we congratulate House Democrats and the president for agreeing on a new COVID-19 emergency package, let's focus on the tens of millions of victims who are still likely to be ignored.
As dangerous as the pandemic itself is, especially for seniors, it's crucial to remember that this will also be an economic disaster for vast numbers of Americans who live paycheck to paycheck — even if they don't get sick.
In Nevada, think of all the workers who could be laid off from our casinos, restaurants, hotels and ski resorts because customers are staying away from public places. Think of single parents who are forced to stay home because schools have shut down and they can't afford day care. Think of everybody who's self-employed or an independent "contractor" in in a gig economy that's gone cold.
For all too many, a day or two of lost wages can be the difference between paying or not paying the rent.
To her credit, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi persuaded our clueless president to support legislation that would guarantee 10 days of paid sick leave to at least some employees. But the bill exempts both big companies with more than 500 workers and small ones with fewer than 50. As the New York Times notes, that could exclude 80% of employees — not to mention 100% of those who are self-employed.
Thankfully, Nevadans have a bit of extra protection. Gov. Steve Sisolak signed a Democratic bill last year that requires companies with more than 50 employees to provide up to 40 hours a year of paid leave. At best, though, that's just one week. In many cases, that won't be enough.
We need to be thinking about this differently — not just in Washington, but here at home.
The ugly reality is that when catastrophes occur, the people who suffer the most and get the least help are those who were already poor or struggling. It was revolting but not surprising that one of President Trump's first ideas about relief was to bail out cruise ships, airlines and other industries hit by the coronavirus.
That's wildly backward. We need to remember that all of us — poor and rich, immigrant and native-born — are in this together. If millions of families can't pay rent or put food on the table, the whole economy will suffer. If sick workers can't afford to stay home, or even see a doctor, this pandemic will become orders of magnitude more lethal than it already is. If we ignore those who don't have political clout, we will pay on the installment plan.
Perhaps this health crisis will make Republicans realize just how wrong-headed they were in trying to shred the federal safety net and abolish the Affordable Care Act. Who knows? Miracles can happen.
While we wait, though, we in Reno and Northern Nevada should think about how we can help our own communities. For those of us who are more fortunate and more flexible, here are a few ideas.
Reach out to neighbors who need help with child care, food or transportation.
Round up financial contributions for people who are temporarily out of work.
Take on shopping for people who are quarantined or self-quarantined.
Maybe just talk, by phone or computer, to those who are sick, isolated or depressed.
Think of this as an historic opportunity to reconnect with American goodness — the shining city on a hill. We'd all be better for it.

Texto completo: What was supposed to be the adventure of a lifetime – a four-month cruise around the world – slowly turned into "involuntary insanity" for a Newark couple.
The once-in-a-lifetime vacation for Chris and Sandi Mulligan began in early January, with expectations to visit all the continents. But a little more than month in, the coronavirus outbreak made its impact on passengers of the M.S. Amsterdam.
No one of the Holland America Line-owned cruise ship has the virus, but with ports closing to the travelers, passengers were told they will be disembarking todaywhen they arrive in Australia. They must then find their own way home.
"We really do not want to come home this soon," Chris Mulligan said last week. "Things are too crazy. The airports are a mess, and we're just going to be part of it next week. Not looking forward to adding to the insanity."
Coronavirus concerns have prompted cruise lines to suspend their operations.
Princess Cruises, a division of Carnival, has said it won't sail for 60 days, according to USA Today. Two of its ships, the Diamond Princess and Grand Princess, have experienced outbreaks of coronavirus in recent weeks.
More than 700 people aboard the Diamond Princess tested positive, and six of them died. At least two passengers and 19 crew members aboard the Grand Princess also tested positive.
No cruises The U.S. State Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have advised Americans, especially those with underlying health conditions, to avoid cruise travel because of the coronavirus.
Former Food and Drug Administration chief Scott Gottlieb told USA Today that no one should be taking a cruise right now.
"This is a very sticky pathogen," he said. "It's an awful risk to pack a lot of people on a cruise ship."
'Different world' The America – and the world – the Mulligans knew when they left their Newark home on Dec. 28 has changed.
"This virus wasn't even a blip on the radar," Chris Mulligan said.
On that day, the world was learning about an airliner that crashed in Kazakhstan, killing at least 12 people, and that Wawa was facing lawsuits after a data breach.
It wouldn't be for a few more days that the government in Wuhan, China, would confirm that health authorities were treating dozens of cases of a new virus, according to the New York Times.
Days later, researchers in China identified that new virus. At the time, they said there was no evidence it was readily spread by humans. Health officials in China said they were monitoring it to prevent a more severe outbreak.
Chinese state media wouldn't report the first known death from the the virus until Jan. 11. The Mulligans' cruise ship left Florida seven days earlier.
The couple had already visited the islands of Dominica and St. Lucia and were heading to Devil's Island in French Guiana. The only death mourned by Chris Mulligan during this time was that of Rush drummer Neil Peart, who died on Jan 7.
"Damn The drumming/rock world loses another giant," Chris posted on his Facebook timeline four days later.
The Mulligans continued enjoying life aboard the Amsterdam, docking in the Brazilian port city of Belem – the gateway to that country's lower Amazon region.
On Jan. 20, the couple was in Rio de Janeiro and after an "amazing" bus and train ride made it to the base of the Christ statue at Corcovado.
The same day, officials in Japan, South Korea and Thailand reported the virus was spreading in their countries, according to the World Health Organization. The first confirmed case in the United States occurred on Jan. 21 in Washington state, where a man in his 30s developed symptoms after returning from a trip to Wuhan, the New York Times reported.
By then, the couple's ship was on its way to Uruguay, Argentina and even a pass by the Antarctic Peninsula on Jan. 30.
After another trip past South America in mid-February, the ship headed toward the Indian Ocean.
It wouldn't be long before Washington state declared a state of emergency on Feb. 29, hours after a man in his 50s with underlying health problems was identified as the first person in the U.S. to die from the coronavirus.
By this time, the world was starting to respond to the disease.
The ports of Singapore, Indonesia and Sri Lanka had closed to the passengers of the Amsterdam, causing the Mulligans' trip to start unraveling.
"We had absolutely no idea that anything like this would happen," Chris Mulligan said.
"We read the news every day, local and world," he said. "All the stuff we were reading about, every place shutting down, we figured we were in the safest place on the planet, a feeling shared by a lot of passengers."
On March 13, Holland America Lines made the decision to end the Grand World Voyage early. It was supposed to end May 12.
Passengers were told this past week they would be arriving in Fremantle, Australia, where they will disembark today. The couple will take a flight out of Perth – something Chris Mulligan is not looking forward to.
"I have not been on a plane since 1986," Chris Mulligan said. "I'm absolutely terrified of them. I'm much more comfortable with 12,000 feet of water beneath me than 30,000 feet of thin air. Flying from Perth, Australia, to Philadelphia is not a favorable option."
The couple expects to be home this week.
"I'm a little nervous about coming home because we've been on one of the safest places, and now we're getting dumped back into this hotbed of infectious panic," Sandi Mulligan said. "I don't have the fear of flying, but I'm still not thrilled about spending 30-plus hours in the air.
"Yes, I will cruise again, but probably not for a couple of years. And as of right now, I would definitely not do another world cruise."
The Mulligans will be returning to a Delaware under a state of emergency as the number of people confirmed to have the virus grows daily.
Concerns over the virus have also cleared grocery shelves and fueled sales of firearms and ammunition. Dine-in is no longer permitted in Delaware bars and restaurants.
"We've gotten notes from friends at home, and we're definitely coming back to a totally different world," Chris Mulligan said. "You can bet we'll be following all the recommended guidelines for our safety and that of others. And, like everything else, we'll take it a day at a time and hope for the best."

AJC VISUAL ARTS NEWNAN PHOTOS: An outsider looking in: 'Seeing Newnan': Public art portrait series stirs conversation about race in Georgia town.

Texto completo: NEWNAN -- Can a middle-aged white woman from Rhode Island help a Southern town contend with its troubled past?
It's a question the artist Mary Beth Meehan, 52, asked herself while working on the public art project "Seeing Newnan" for the town of 38,000 located 40 miles southwest of Atlanta.
Currently on view through June, the project features 17 enormous photo banners that hang from various buildings in Newnan's historic downtown, including the Presbyterian Church, a toy store, the Wadsworth Auditorium and a fitness center.
The images are portraits that present a cross-section of people who live in Newnan -- a domestic worker, manual laborer, mill-worker, high school students, pastors, children in their cotillion finery, an Ivy Leaguer -- in a kind of alternative advertisement of place. In addition, Meehan posted interviews with her subjects on her blog at marybethmeehan.com. Black, white, well-to-do and on-the-margins -- all are put on an equal footing. Meehan's billboard-sized photos suggest a kind of Norman Rockwell street art, treating ordinary people as monumental in keeping with an American democratic ideal.
Her project is part of Newnan ArtRez, an artist-in-residency program that provides a retreat for artists who, in turn, enrich the community with their work. It is sponsored by the University of West Georgia and funded by charitable trusts.
Soon after arriving in Newnan in 2016 and speaking to its residents, Meehan knew her project was going to be about race. How could it not be? Even though Newnan had a growing population of immigrants and newcomers drawn by the town's affordability and its proximity to Atlanta and Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, the town's past still haunted some black residents. Historically, Newnan made its fortune from a cotton industry fueled by slavery, like much of the South. And it was the site in 1899 of one of the most notorious lynchings in Southern history of victim Sam Hose.
Even today, Newnan remains geographically divided by race. Yet, "there are still people who think race is not an issue," says Andrew Copeland, 26, the youngest and only black board member for Newnan ArtRez.
More than half of Meehan's banner subjects are nonwhite in a town where 62% of the population is white. More importantly, they are economically and socially diverse. They represent a broad spectrum of black life in a nation where such complex portraits are still relatively rare.
Meehan knew when she started the project that a northerner treating race in the South was a tinderbox.
"It wasn't easy for any of us. There were people who were going,'Why is she writing about white supremacy? Get her out of here,'" said Meehan, whose photography has appeared in The New York Times, the Boston Globe and Le Monde. Her previous photo projects have addressed issues such as income inequality in Silicon Valley and immigration in Providence, Rhode Island.
The Newnan project almost didn't happen. Business owners worried it would stir up controversy. Even members of the Newnan ArtRez board had reservations. "Why are you doing this?" Meehan was asked about her motives. "We had some really rough conversations. There were tears," said board member Liza Nelson Brown. One mural had to be moved to another location when the original sponsor backed out.
"Seeing Newnan" debuted in the spring of 2019, and Newnan ArtRez board president Robert Hancock says the response on social media was immediate. "I was so overwhelmed and disarmed by it," he says. He wondered, "is this the town I live in?"
Some residents complained on Facebook about a portrait of teenage sisters Aatika and Zahraw Shah wearing hijabs that hangs on an office building. That photo fueled anti-Muslim invective and generated a story in The New York Times.
"The nastiness of the posts," says Meehan. "It made me think, this is what it must have been like for people of color one generation ago."
"Take down the Muslim picture or someone else will,"one commenter wrote.
But Hancock says the rebuttals to those comments were also instantaneous, with people calling out their neighbors for racist and Islamophobic comments.
"There are these dissenting voices," says ArtRez board member Susan Crutchfield. "But the majority of people are so positive."
Despite the negative attention, Aatika is glad she participated in the project, which she likened to Brandon Stan-ton's "Humans of New York" project that features street photography of ordinary people who share their personal stories. "I love Georgia," she says. "Seeing those faces around Newnan, it opened up a lot of conversations. (It) opened up Newnan through a new lens and (created) an understanding of the diversity of Newnan, in religion, in race."
Monique Bentley, a 23-year-old senior at Georgia State University, was photographed in Newnan's Farmer Street cemetery adjacent to the African American Heritage Museum, where enslaved people are buried.
"(Race) can be a scary topic to talk about," Bentley says. "The white community doesn't want to accept what their ancestors did to our ancestors. (But)what we do moving forward is what matters, even if it means uncovering the dark history."
Meehan says it is hard to deny the injustices of the past in the stories she heard from people like domestic worker Helen Berry, resplendent in a tangerine-colored caftan in Meehan's portrait. Berry grew up in Newnan under segregation and found limited prospects available to her.
"The fact that Mrs. Berry graduates from high school in 1954 and is consigned to a professional life that is way below her intellectual, human abilities because of racially inscribed laws," posits Meehan, "how could that not have had an effect on how people are relating to each other in 2020?"
The murals have prompted many residents to contemplate disturbing events like Hose's lynching and the neo-Nazi rally held in 2018 in Newnan's Greenville Street Park, where the local counter-protesters far outnumbered the white supremacists, who were outsiders to the community.
"It's not where it was 50 years ago," says Copeland, of Newnan. "But we're not where we need to be today. And I think that this project is inherently good because it can spark these conversations."
Newnan still feels like a place where black and white residents live in separate worlds.The charming downtown area is home to Meehan's regal portrait of a black pastor, Rev. Rufus Smith Sr., and a monument to Confederate dead.
For longtime Newnan resident Tavaris Johnson, a student at Georgia College & State University in Milledgeville, "Seeing Newnan" provided a way to look at his community in a new light.
"My race has shaped my life's experiences, and some people are unwilling to acknowledge that," says Johnson, who credits Meehan's outsider status for bringing a fresh perspective to the topic. "I think it's important for people to be exposed to the people they normally have no, or limited, contact with. That's why I was drawn to this project."
In the end, "Seeing Newnan" is evidence of public art's potential to prompt a community to look deeper at itself and examine what lies beneath the surface of perceived realities.
When so many Americans seem unwilling to grapple with the issue of racism, at least Meehan is trying, and so is Newnan.

Texto completo: We asked New York Times readers how they're coping with coronavirus travel restrictions. Here's how they responded.
Travelers everywhere are facing disruptions from the worldwide spread of the coronavirus.
Some forged ahead with their plans and took extra precautions. But others canceled their trips.
Just over a week ago, we asked readers of The New York Times in the second group to tell us about their "staycation" plans, and to offer advice to others who find themselves in similar circumstances. In some cases, they planned on visiting restaurants or other public spaces, ideas that now may need to be put on hold until the crisis is resolved.
Following are their responses, which have been edited for clarity and length.
Do you have staycation plans of your own? If so, share them in the comments or email us at travel@nytimes.com , and we'll publish another selection soon.
Hitch the gate
A close family member is ill, and I'm on family medical leave. After a life of loving and longing to travel, there is nowhere I can imagine going and feeling safe. My advice: Plan for your staycation as though you're going on an elaborate trip. Collect items to read, make watching lists and gather supplies, plants for the garden. To me, hitching the gate shut on my front picket fence is a joy.
-- Leslie McLean, Sonoma, Calif.
No Flying
My husband and I live in a small town in central Oregon. We pride ourselves on not using our cars each day. We've decided that flying is "out" for now. We'll use our Sprinter van more often, for camping close by and for a wee bit of travel to eastern Oregon, and to the coast.
-- Vicki Bugbee-Reed, Oregon
Travel through cookbooks
We canceled a seven-week trip around the world. We've been buying cookbooks for years. Most have never been used or even read. We're now going through those cookbooks, and choosing things that we want to make. So far, it's been a lot of fun. We are traveling the world through our cookbooks.
-- Victoria Trenten
Streets of Philadelphia
My husband and I just canceled a four-week trip to Southeast Asia; we were supposed to depart this week.
As relatively new residents of Philadelphia, we're planning a staycation in our new hometown. We'll finally plow through our lengthy backlist of streaming movies and shows. If things stay calm, we might do a short road trip to the Eastern Shore, but we'll make that decision on a last-minute basis. Finally, I'll get a chance to catch up on my writing. -- Anne Marie Gold, Philadelphia

Texto completo: Time’s about to get reeeeeal heavy on our hands, especially with restless, bored kids – from infants on up to college students – suddenly home from day care, school and pretty much every extracurricular activity, in an unprecedented attempt to curb the spread of a global coronavirus pandemic.
Are playdates OK to pass the time?
It depends who you ask. Asaf Bitton, a Boston-based primary care physician, wrote a widely shared Medium piece calling on parents to commit to “no kid playdates, parties, sleepovers or families/friends visiting each other’s houses and apartments” during school and other closures related to coronavirus.
“This sounds extreme because it is,” Bitton wrote. “We are trying to create distance between family units and between individuals. It may be particularly uncomfortable for families with small children, kids with differential abilities or challenges, and for kids who simply love to play with their friends. But even if you choose only one friend to have over, you are creating new links and possibilities for the type of transmission that all of our school/work/public event closures are trying to prevent. The symptoms of coronavirus take four to five days to manifest themselves. Someone who comes over looking well can transmit the virus.”
On the other hand, infectious disease physician and epidemiologist Eli Perencevich told the New York Times that playdates are fine, with proper precautions, and trying to isolate yourselves and your kids from everyone else over the coming weeks “would be impossible.”
“Dr. Perencevich recommended organizing playdates around an isolated outdoor activity,” the New York Times reported. “Invite another child to come along on a family hike. Or have the kids run around in a big, uncrowded park, which will be less germy than a popular local playground.”
(Bitton also weighed in on playgrounds: “If you have kids, try not to use public facilities like playground structures, as coronavirus can live on plastic and metal for up to nine days, and these structures aren’t getting regularly cleaned.”)
What about kids hanging out together indoors?
I called Scott Goldstein, a pediatrician at Northwestern Children’s Practice and instructor of clinical pediatrics at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine, to get his input.
“There’s no one right way of handling this,” Goldstein said. “The American Academy of Pediatrics hasn’t put out a specific recommendation saying, ‘Stay at home and don’t do playdates.’ And you go online, and everybody has their viewpoints and I’m seeing a lot of parent-shaming, which isn’t helpful.”
If playdates are optional – you don’t need to host a child whose parents have to go to work or attend to something mandatory; you don’t need to drop your child at a friend’s house for similar reasons – “it’s probably best to avoid them,” Goldstein said.
But he didn’t want to go as far as Bitton and outright ban small, social get-togethers.
“If nobody in your house is sick and nobody in the other house is sick and you want to get a couple of kids who are not sick together to do something creative,” he said, “I think that’s something a reasonable person could feel comfortable with.”
He emphasized that the risk of contracting coronavirus remains low for children and that the vast majority of people who do contract the illness don’t experience severe symptoms.
But there is wisdom, he said, in trying to “flatten the curve,” meaning we each do our part to limit how fast and far the virus spreads by taking social distancing measures where we can.
“Before this blew up, a lot of people, even me, were saying, ‘This is something that just has to run its course like the flu does every year, and people are going to get it, and some people are going to get sick like they do with any virus and then it’s going to go away,’” Goldstein said.
“But then it became more clear that people are getting more sick from this than they do with your typical flu season,” he continued, “and the body doesn’t have any natural immunity to it, and we have no treatment for it except to put people in the hospital and support them with whatever they need – whether it’s oxygen or IV fluid. And if you just let it go unchecked, you’re going to have this exponential growth of people getting infected, and it’s just going to overwhelm the health care system because you can’t provide people the support they need because there’s just no space to do it – not enough doctors, not enough equipment, not enough nurses. So the idea with flattening the curve is that if you limit the exposure to people, it’s going to build up at a much slower level, which makes the peak much lower, which lets the health care system accommodate the sick people, which also then prevents them from spreading it.”
I like that approach. I’m going to do everything in my power to adopt that approach, I told Goldstein, including not letting my kids have friends over or go to friends’ houses while their schools are closed through March 30.
“Everybody is going to have their own comfort level,” he said. “There’s no one right approach.”
And no two families’ lives or schedules or sets of needs look the same, I realize.
But for me? With the privilege of a job that allows me to work from home, and a budget that allows me to buy groceries and supplies ahead of time, and a (thus far) generally healthy family that doesn’t have to venture out to address a chronic medical condition? I’m going to hunker down and try to flatten that dang curve.
“The big burden of flattening the curve has already been put on families by canceling school and all activities,” Goldstein said. “That’s a huge way of flattening the curve, and that’s going to go a long way toward helping, way more than one person not having one playdate.”
Fair enough. These are scary times, and the recommendations and statistics are changing rapidly. I certainly don’t want to judge anyone’s approach to this pandemic. (Except the guy who bought up 17,700 bottles of hand sanitizer. I definitely judge him.)
But I also love this quote from Mari Armstrong-Hough, an epidemiologist and assistant professor of global public health at New York University, who tweeted, “You won’t ever know if what you did personally helped. That’s the nature of public health. When the best way to save lives is to prevent a disease rather than treat it, success often looks like an overreaction.”

A possible unique link is seen in Florida cases

Texto completo: A company that distributes smart thermometers to track the flu might be able to predict coronavirus hotspots before the CDC, according to a report from the New York Times.

And in Florida, theyve observed an unusually high spike in influenza-like illnesses, even though national flu levels are declining, said Nita Nehru, a spokeswoman for Kinsa Health.

Nehru said they believe its related to coronavirus. A symptom of the pandemic illness is a fever, which is what the thermometer tracks on their map. The company looks at typical, observable illness levels and then at how much higher illness levels are compared to normal.

In Florida, the illness level is about 2.4 percent above what they normally observe.

What we are trying to do with this information is show where something unusual is happening and help serve as a guidepost or help serve as a resource for public health first responders, Nehru said.

Kinsa Health has given away more than a million of their internet-connected thermometers, which record temperatures above 100 as people get their results. In the past, their maps have predicted the spread of the flu before even the CDC, according to the New York Times.

And last week, Nehru said they saw a spike in Florida. She pointed out that their map that tracks atypical data closely mirrors the states own coronavirus tracking map.

She said they have also observed atypical illness in Washington state, one of the first places in the United States where coronavirus took hold, but classify it as mild. She said that is likely because the state has already been providing critical care to the sick and enforcing social distancing for weeks.

That stands apart from Florida, where the numbers are still high, she said.

This is not proven out in our data, we cant say that for a fact, (but) to me I think its an interesting correlation that the spring break stuff is still happening, we know coronavirus has been confirmed in Florida, and were seeing this increase in illness levels, Nehru said.

Texto completo: Mandy Moore never thought she'd release another album.
In the late '90s and early 2000s, the Emmy-nominated "This Is Us" actress enjoyed success as a teen pop star, scoring infectious hits in "Candy," "In My Pocket" and "I Wanna Be With You," and touring with 'NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys. But her singing career came grinding to a halt after the release of her sixth album, "Amanda Leigh," in 2009, the same year she married musician Ryan Adams.
In a devastating interview with The New York Times last year, Moore detailed how Adams wrested control of her career, saying he refused to record songs they wrote together and undermined her as an artist.
In the years after their 2016 divorce, "there was a lot of work I had to do to reframe my idea of whether or not I was still a musician," Moore tells USA TODAY. "There was a big conversation around legitimacy, and a lot of baggage I had to drop in order to find my way back to the music landscape."
That emotional journey is what led her to "Silver Landings," out now, an achingly vulnerable album that builds on the '70s-influenced folk pop of her previous efforts. She started writing in earnest about 18 months ago with producer Mike Viola (Jenny Lewis, Shania Twain) and husband Taylor Goldsmith, lead singer of indie rock band Dawes, whom she married in 2018.
Moore, 35, talks with USA TODAY about her new album and U.S. tour, which kicks off March 20 in Pittsburgh.
Question: What made you want to start writing music again?
Mandy Moore: I think it all started when I started dating my husband (Goldsmith). Traveling around with them, they're an incredible live band and have so much fun on stage – it's really contagious. And I remember one of the first times watching Taylor thinking, "I'm kind of jealous because I want to be up there. I miss this so much." It was a real light-bulb moment of, "I have to figure out a way to find myself on stage again."
Then having music interwoven into my character's backstory on "This is Us," having to go into the recording studio and make music even in the very beginning of Season 1. That was a revelation for me as well, like, "Oh, I remember how to do this. I love this." But for a long time, I leaned on the excuse of, "I want to do it, but I don't have a music manager or a record label anymore. I wouldn't even know how any of this works." So I had to work my way into realizing it just starts with the song. I just have to write and then everything else will fall into place. That's what happened with this record.
Q: Writing and recording with Taylor on this album, were you able to leave work in the studio or was it a constant in your home?
Moore: Living with and being married to a songwriter as prolific as Taylor, there's constantly a guitar in his hand or a piano being played or a record on. Music is inescapable in our house, so we were always discussing things and I was constantly inspired. I very much felt like I had the ultimate partner and collaborator in Taylor. He was so happy to be by my side and helped usher me into this next chapter of my life. It takes a certain kind of person to be able to support your partner in that way and not let your ego infuse the experience. It only has strengthened our relationship and made us closer. Honestly, the idea of being able to go on the road, and look to my left every night and see his face playing and singing with me, is a dream come true in every cheesy sense of the term. I'm just so beside myself with excitement, I can't wait.
Q: Have you guys laid out any ground rules for touring together yet? (Goldsmith's band Dawes will join her on the road.)
Moore: Well, we're all coupled up. Most of us are married, so there's not going to be any crazy, debaucherous behavior on the road. No one's a big partyer and I don't drink when I'm touring because I don't like to dry my vocal cords out. So I think it'll be a fairly mellow tour across the country with my favorite people in the world. But I hope maybe they'll be a little cleaner in the bathroom, knowing there is a lady there 24/7 now. Hopefully their aim will be a little bit more accurate – that's probably all I ask of them.
Q: Last year, you came forward with other brave women and talked about your emotionally abusive relationship (with ex-husband Ryan Adams) in The New York Times. Why was that important for you to do?
Moore: It was important to be a part of a community of women who were giving a voice to an issue and a conversation that I think a lot of women were desperate to be having around psychological and emotional abuse. The outpouring and wealth of support all of us received in the wake of that story was tremendously moving. And it's a conversation we need to continue having. I'm happy to have been part of that jumping-off point, but I'm also happy to have told that story and to be able to move forward now, and not be impeded by my past.
Q: And how does it feel now, to not only have shared your story but to finally have personal and artistic freedom?
Moore: It's emotional, and it's all starting to hit me. It's sort of come in waves over the last year of the writing and recording process – it's like every little step has been something new for me to really stop and appreciate and reckon with, and I think touring won't be an exception. But I'm really proud to be making music again on my own terms and I'm excited about the future. And I'm really looking forward to keeping this momentum going. I don't want to have another 10, 11-year lapse in between albums. I feel like I've found this incredible team of collaborators in Mike and Taylor, and I just look forward to seeing what we'll do together on this tour and beyond.

It's sort of come in waves over the last year of the writing and recording process – it's like every little step has been something new for me to really stop and appreciate and reckon with, and I think touring won't be an exception. But I'm really proud to be making music again on my own terms and I'm excited about the future. And I'm really looking forward to keeping this momentum going. I don't want to have another 10, 11-year lapse in between albums. I feel like I've found this incredible team of collaborators in Mike and Taylor, and I just look forward to seeing what we'll do together on this tour and beyond.

Texto completo: Mandy Moore never thought she'd release another album.
In the late '90s and early 2000s, the Emmy-nominated "This Is Us" actress enjoyed success as a teen pop star, scoring infectious hits in "Candy," "In My Pocket" and "I Wanna Be With You," and touring with 'NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys. But her singing career came grinding to a halt after the release of her sixth album, "Amanda Leigh," in 2009, the same year she married musician Ryan Adams.
In a devastating interview with The New York Times last year, Moore detailed how Adams wrested control of her career, saying he refused to record songs they wrote together and undermined her as an artist.
In the years after their 2016 divorce, "there was a lot of work I had to do to reframe my idea of whether or not I was still a musician," Moore tells USA TODAY. "There was a big conversation around legitimacy, and a lot of baggage I had to drop in order to find my way back to the music landscape."
That emotional journey is what led her to "Silver Landings," out now, an achingly vulnerable album that builds on the '70s-influenced folk pop of her previous efforts. She started writing in earnest about 18 months ago with producer Mike Viola (Jenny Lewis, Shania Twain) and husband Taylor Goldsmith, lead singer of indie rock band Dawes, whom she married in 2018.
Moore, 35, talks with USA TODAY about her new album and U.S. tour, which kicks off March 20 in Pittsburgh.
Question: What made you want to start writing music again?
Mandy Moore: I think it all started when I started dating my husband (Goldsmith). Traveling around with them, they're an incredible live band and have so much fun on stage – it's really contagious. And I remember one of the first times watching Taylor thinking, "I'm kind of jealous because I want to be up there. I miss this so much." It was a real light-bulb moment of, "I have to figure out a way to find myself on stage again."
Then having music interwoven into my character's backstory on "This is Us," having to go into the recording studio and make music even in the very beginning of Season 1. That was a revelation for me as well, like, "Oh, I remember how to do this. I love this." But for a long time, I leaned on the excuse of, "I want to do it, but I don't have a music manager or a record label anymore. I wouldn't even know how any of this works." So I had to work my way into realizing it just starts with the song. I just have to write and then everything else will fall into place. That's what happened with this record.
Q: Writing and recording with Taylor on this album, were you able to leave work in the studio or was it a constant in your home?
Moore: Living with and being married to a songwriter as prolific as Taylor, there's constantly a guitar in his hand or a piano being played or a record on. Music is inescapable in our house, so we were always discussing things and I was constantly inspired. I very much felt like I had the ultimate partner and collaborator in Taylor. He was so happy to be by my side and helped usher me into this next chapter of my life. It takes a certain kind of person to be able to support your partner in that way and not let your ego infuse the experience. It only has strengthened our relationship and made us closer. Honestly, the idea of being able to go on the road, and look to my left every night and see his face playing and singing with me, is a dream come true in every cheesy sense of the term. I'm just so beside myself with excitement, I can't wait.
Q: Have you guys laid out any ground rules for touring together yet? (Goldsmith's band Dawes will join her on the road.)
Moore: Well, we're all coupled up. Most of us are married, so there's not going to be any crazy, debaucherous behavior on the road. No one's a big partyer and I don't drink when I'm touring because I don't like to dry my vocal cords out. So I think it'll be a fairly mellow tour across the country with my favorite people in the world. But I hope maybe they'll be a little cleaner in the bathroom, knowing there is a lady there 24/7 now. Hopefully their aim will be a little bit more accurate – that's probably all I ask of them.
Q: Last year, you came forward with other brave women and talked about your emotionally abusive relationship (with ex-husband Ryan Adams) in The New York Times. Why was that important for you to do?
Moore: It was important to be a part of a community of women who were giving a voice to an issue and a conversation that I think a lot of women were desperate to be having around psychological and emotional abuse. The outpouring and wealth of support all of us received in the wake of that story was tremendously moving. And it's a conversation we need to continue having. I'm happy to have been part of that jumping-off point, but I'm also happy to have told that story and to be able to move forward now, and not be impeded by my past.
Q: And how does it feel now, to not only have shared your story but to finally have personal and artistic freedom?
Moore: It's emotional, and it's all starting to hit me. It's sort of come in waves over the last year of the writing and recording process – it's like every little step has been something new for me to really stop and appreciate and reckon with, and I think touring won't be an exception. But I'm really proud to be making music again on my own terms and I'm excited about the future. And I'm really looking forward to keeping this momentum going. I don't want to have another 10, 11-year lapse in between albums. I feel like I've found this incredible team of collaborators in Mike and Taylor, and I just look forward to seeing what we'll do together on this tour and beyond.

Texto completo: Donald Trump and the Republican Party are trying to distract you from their catastrophic failure.
Two months ago, as the world knows, Trump was praising China’s government for its handling of the coronavirus outbreak, while downplaying the severity of the threat to the United States. “We have it totally under control,” he said in an interview to CNBC on Jan. 22. “It’s one person coming in from China and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.” For good measure, he said it again on Twitter: “China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi!”
Now, of course, Trump simultaneously denies that anyone could have known about the pandemic (“I would view it as something that just surprised the whole world”) and claims to have predicted the extent of the disaster (“This is a pandemic. I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic”). Similarly, he’s moved from praising President Xi Jinping’s government to attacking it. He’s also changed the language he uses to describe the pathogen that causes COVID-19. After weeks of saying “coronavirus,” he now calls it the “Chinese virus.”
The administration says it is simply holding Beijing responsible for spreading the disease. And it is true that the Chinese government suppressed information and punished whistleblowers, hiding the potential danger until it was too late. But given the president’s previous praise for China’s response, that explanation doesn’t hold up.
The likely truth is that Trump is flailing. His change in language came shortly after the stock market collapsed and the president faced harsh criticism for his sluggish response to the outbreak. Rather than face his failures — the United States is far behind its peers in testing, and its hospitals are largely unprepared for a surge of the severely ill — Trump turned to racial demagoguery. He would bounce back not by fixing his mistakes but by fanning fear of foreign threat.
Following the president’s lead, Republican lawmakers, activists and officials have adopted the president’s language about the virus while avoiding any discussion of his response to the outbreak. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas told reporters that “China is to blame because” of “the culture where people eat bats and snakes and dogs and things like that.” Kevin McCarthy, the minority leader of the House, called the disease “Chinese coronavirus.” And on Twitter, Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa wondered what all the commotion was about: “I don’t understand why China gets upset bc we refer to the virus that originated there the ‘Chinese virus’ Spain never got upset when we referred to the Spanish flu in 1918&1919,” he wrote, in his typically hurried style.
None of this is the least bit clever. Trump failed to act when it was most important, and now his allies are flooding the zone with rhetoric meant to move attention away from the president’s poor performance and toward an argument over language.
One might think that Republicans have an interest in pushing the administration into a stronger response, but the truth is that Trump wasn’t the only member of his party to downplay the threat who knew better.
In January, just over two weeks after she was sworn in, Sen. Kelly Loeffler of Georgia was part of a private briefing on the coronavirus provided by administration officials, including Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. That same day, according to The Daily Beast, she and her husband began to sell millions in stock, a process that continued over the next few weeks. They also made a purchase: between $100,000 and $250,000 worth of shares in a company that specializes in technology that helps people work remotely.
Loeffler seems to have sensed danger. But that’s not what she said to the public. “Democrats have dangerously and intentionally misled the American people on #Coronavirus readiness,” she said on Twitter in February. “Here’s the truth: @realDonaldTrump & his administration are doing a great job working to keep Americans healthy & safe.”
(For her part, Loeffler denies any connection between her stock market activity and what she learned as a senator: “This is a ridiculous and baseless attack,” she wrote on Twitter late Thursday. “I do not make investment decisions for my portfolio. Investment decisions are made by multiple third-party advisers without my or my husband’s knowledge or involvement.”)
In February, Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, co-wrote an op-ed in which he assured the public that “the United States today is better prepared than ever before to face emerging public health threats, like the coronavirus.” A few days later, however, he sold somewhere between $628,00 and $1.7 million in stock, according to ProPublica. And a few days after that, NPR reported, he warned representatives from select companies and organizations (including donors to this 2016 reelection campaign) that the virus might move local communities to close schools and force the federal government to mobilize the military in response to acute medical need.
“We’re going to send a military hospital there; it’s going to be in tents and going to be set up on the ground somewhere,” Burr said. “It’s going to be a decision the president and DOD make. And we’re going to have medical professionals supplemented by local staff to treat the people that need treatment.”
It’s tempting to say that now is not the time for partisan recrimination. But this is the second consecutive Republican administration to lead the United States to disaster. The difference is that it took George W. Bush most of his two terms to bring the country to the brink of economic collapse — Trump has done it in less than four years. He’s even hit some of the same milestones; Bush let Hurricane Katrina drown New Orleans, Trump let Hurricane Maria destroy Puerto Rico.
In other words, now absolutely is the time for recriminations, because it’s the only way we might avoid another such administration in a country where control of government moves like a pendulum.
The public needs to know that the Republican Party is culpable for the present crisis, just as it was culpable for the Great Recession, even if it did not originate either. It needs to know that in the face of a deadly pandemic, some Republican lawmakers appear to have looked to profit rather than to prepare. It needs to understand that the deadly incompetence of Republican governance is a feature, not a bug.
This won’t happen of its own accord. It is the political task of the Democratic Party to make the public understand the nature of the Republican Party and its leading role in this disaster so that when November comes, Americans hold no illusions about what it would mean for their futures — and their lives — to give Republicans another four years of power in Washington.

Health care system not ready

Texto completo: Fox News talk show host Sean Hannity celebrated the White House’s response to the novel coronavirus in a recent TV monologue, saying the U.S. health care system is ready for the virus.
“We need to prepare for the worst-case scenario,” Hannity said on his TV show March 16. “Now, as it stands, our health care system has adequate ventilators, ICU beds, medical professionals and ultimately, like I said, we must prepare for the worst, pray for the best.”
The available data suggests that U.S. hospitals are not as well-equipped as Hannity claimed.
A surge of cases could overwhelm hospitals
According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the United States has 2.8 hospital beds per 1,000 people.
That ratio puts the U.S. behind other countries — such as China and Italy — that have struggled to keep up with the spread of COVID-19.
That doesn’t bode well for the U.S. response to the coronavirus. As of March 16, Italy has seen more than 24,700 confirmed infections and over 1,800 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. Hospitals can’t handle the influx of patients, forcing doctors into difficult decisions.
In a March 12 op-ed in the New York Times, health policy experts wrote that if 5% of the country catches COVID-19, there will be enough serious cases to overwhelm the health care system.
“If we follow the curve that Italy has followed, in two to three weeks we will no longer have adequate supplies of any of those necessary resources,” Matthew Wynia, director of the Center for Bioethics and Humanities at the University of Colorado, told us.
A March 17 analysis from the Harvard Global Health Institute, ProPublica and the New York Times shows how many beds would be filled in parts of the United States if, over the next six, 12 or 18 months, the coronavirus infects 20%, 40% or 60% of the country.
The projections show that in the worst-case scenario — where 60% of the population gets sick within six months — the U.S. would need seven times the number of available hospital beds it currently has, the analysis found.
Even in a moderate scenario where 40% is infected over 12 months, many cities such as Washington, D.C., would still need to significantly expand hospital capacity.
Another analysis from USA Today found that “there could be almost six seriously ill patients for every existing hospital bed” — and possibly as many as 17 patients per bed.
That examination said the 6-to-1 ratio was a “conservative” estimate based on the assumption that all the hospital beds in the U.S. are currently empty.
They’re not.
“Our ICUs are currently stretched thin by flu, and we have shortages of nurses and doctors in many parts of the country,” said Eric Toner, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.
A February report Toner worked on said the U.S. has approximately 46,500 ICU beds in total.
If the coronavirus spreads at a moderate pace, then 1 million Americans could be hospitalized and 200,000 Americans would ultimately need an ICU, the report said.
A more severe scenario could put up to 9.6 million Americans in the hospital and 2.9 million in need of ICUs.
A separate Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security report identified about 160,000 ventilators in the country, though not all are full-featured. That includes tens of thousands of ventilators in hospitals nationwide and thousands more in an emergency federal stockpile.
Not all COVID-19 patients will need treatment at the same time, of course. Aaron Carroll, professor at the Indiana School of Medicine, wrote in the New York Times that a key metric is “the difference between the total number of people who might get sick and the number who might get sick at the same time.” But states and doctors are worried about shortages.
Our ruling
Hannity said, “Now, as it stands, our health care system has adequate ventilators, ICU beds, medical professionals.”
That might be true if the U.S. stopped the coronavirus from spreading any further. But given the country’s likely trajectory, experts said all evidence points to the U.S. being short on beds, ICUs, ventilators and medical professionals.
The U.S. will need to take steps to slow the spread and expand hospital capacity if it wants to keep its health care system from being overrun by the likely uptick in cases.
We rate this statement Mostly False.

Texto completo: The albatross hanging from every arts reporter' neck is the stack of untouched books sitting on their desk, on a shelf, or shamefully hidden away in the closet farthest from them. Sent in from authors, agents and publishers it is the combined weight of all these unwritten about books that (I assume) will one day drag my soul to the depth of the River Styx.
I'm not saying it's a silver lining, far from it, but with the coronavirus forcing most events to shut down or cancel, we are all now going to have a lot more time on our hands for literary pursuits. With no upcoming festivals or performances to profile, now is the perfect time to let readers know what is on the reading agenda for the next week, or month or longer interval before society as we know it returns to some semblance of normalcy.
Some of these books I've read most or all of, others I haven't read at all. But none of them have been covered in depth by the Press-Citizen heretofore.
'Afterlife' by Julia Alvarez Genre: Fiction
Length: ~250 pages
From the author of "In the Time of Butterflies" is a new novel for adults. "Afterlife" is a novel about immigrant and English teacher Antonia Vega who is hit with a trio of problems at once. Her husband dies, her sister goes missing and an undocumented and pregnant teenager appears at her doorstep.
This is the kind of book I'd love to cover, but Alvarez's scheduled tour dates and tours sent with the book will not bring her through Iowa City. The book, a roughly 250-page affair, is scheduled for release on April 7, 2020.
'All the Flowers in Paris' by Sarah Jio Genre: Fiction
Length: ~ 300 pages
A novel that switches between a pair of perspectives, one of which is Caroline, who wakes up with no memory in a Paris hospital in 2009. The other is Celine, a woman in Nazi-occupied Paris in 1943. The story follows both women as they try to make sense of their respective situations: Caroline who gradually pieces together who she is and Celine who needs to try to
Not necessarily the kind of book I myself would be on the edge of my seat to read, but I can think of a half dozen friends I'd recommend this to by description alone. Plus, an aspect of Caroline's character is discovering she's had a "reclusive life in a sprawling apartment on the rue Cler," which — at this moment —sounds like the exact situation I'd like to be living in (at least for the next few weeks).
'An American Bum in China' by Tom Carter Genre: Biography
Length: ~125 pages
A brief biography following five years with Muscatine native Matthew Evans as he finds himself in China in 2014 as the Hong Kong protests were just beginning. Evans' tale is told by Tom Carter who previously published "Unsavory Elements: Stories of Foreigners on the Loose in China."
Initially, I'd planned to run a review of the book back in December that didn't end up finding its way to print. It was a topical read at the time with the Hong Kong protests in the news cycle and — while Hong Kong hasn't been the focus of recent coverage — China's arguably in the news cycle even more now than it was then.
'Bedlam' by Kenneth Paul Rosenberg, MD Genre: Nonfiction
Length: ~200 pages
The full title of the text is "Bedlam: An Intimate Journey Into America's Mental Health Crisis." Rosenberg's book is intended to give readers an inside look at the American mental health system and its failings. After seven years of interviews, the book uses those accounts to shine a light on the criminalization of individuals with mental health issues among other topics.
This book and the author behind it are the exact kinds of things I love to cover. When it was first delivered to our office I showed it to everyone in the newsroom. The only reason why it's not pending on my personal reading list is I'm not sure I have the emotional fortitude to read about institutional, systemic failure, especially at this particular moment.
'Bloody Genius' by John Sanford Genre: Mystery
Length: ~375 pages
This is the most recent Virgil Flowers novel from New York Times bestselling author John Sanford, marking the 12th novel in a series that started in 2007 with "Dark of the Moon." In this particular book, a culture war on a state campus between the science and medical departments is interrupted when a scholar turns up dead. Enter the series investigator Virgil Flowers, tasked with finding the killer.
While this title was briefly alluded to in my write-up on the 2019 Iowa City Book Festival, it didn't end up receiving full coverage, even though Sanford is a Cedar Rapids native and University of Iowa grad. This fell by the wayside for me at the time partly because of my own ignorance of Sanford being a local name and the sheer volume of events surrounding the book festival.
'Deacon King Kong' by James McBride Genre: Historical Fiction
Length: ~375 pages
Set in September of 1969, "Deacon King Kong" starts with the deacon of Five Ends Baptist Church shooting a 19-year-old-drug dealer in the face in South Brooklyn. The release that came with the book touts it as being infused with "humor and compassion" as it explores the lives of the fictional characters around this incident.
I've had a copy of this book so long and I've wanted to read it so bad! As if to taunt me Penguin Random House sent me a second copy which I also have not read.
I'm positive I'll get around to this once I work through my personal pending backlog of unread books, but like Entertainment Weekly and The New York Times, this book is high on my to-read list and can make it to yours too since it was released on March 3.
'The Dearly Beloved' by Cara Wall Genre: Fiction
Length: ~350 pages
The story of this novel spent 15 years coming into focus for its author, Iowa Writers' Workshop graduate Cara Wall, who first conceived of the novel during her 2004 pregnancy. The book focuses on a pair of couples, each of which includes an individual drawn to the Christian faith and another who is skeptical of it.
This is another novel I had planned to write a review of. First, before it's Aug. 13, 2019 publication and then before Wall's Sept. 23 visit to Prairie Lights. Though outside my general area of interest, it's one I feel strangely drawn to and would like to pick up and finish someday.
'Everywhere You Don't Belong' by Gabriel Bump Genre: Fiction
Length: ~250 pages
This is the first novel from the Chicago originating author Gabriel Bump, an experience explored in this novel through the character of Claude McKay, a young black man growing up on the South Side.
This is another book on my personal reading list and comes recommended by numerous other publications. it represents yet another instance of not enough local connections for me to cover.
'Hey Grandude!' by Paul McCartney, Illustrated by Kathryn Durst Genre: Picture Book
Length: ~ 30 pages
I think there are only two reasons I haven't read or reviewed this book: First, world-renowned singer/songwriter Paul McCartney has not had a book tour through Iowa City promoting it. Second, I don't know that I could justify a picture book review to my editor as the 4- to 6-year-old age range does not make up a huge amount of our readership.
But now I can, so here's my one-paragraph review:
As a book about a bunch of kids stuck inside who turn to their grandude to entertain them, I think this book will resonate with kids in this very specific moment in time. While the plot is somewhat aimless, it's a fun read with pretty illustrations that takes its characters to the beach, to the American West and to the mountainside. All through the aid of a magic compass.
'The Mountains Sing' by Nguyen Phan Que Mail Genre: Historical Fiction
Length: ~350 pages
The 11th book from Nguyen Phan Que Mai, "The Mountains Sing" follow the Tran family as they navigate their way through a Vietnam wrapped in War. The most recent addition to my ever-growing work shelf of unread books, "The Mountains Sing" will have been published just before this article runs. I have never read this book, but, for what it's worth, it comes with my highest recommendation.
'One Night At the Lake' by Bethany Chase Genre: Fiction
Length: ~275 pages
The jacket description of this book pitches two straight forward premises. The first: Leah has been dating Ollie for four years and, upon being invited to his family's lake house, she suspects he's going to propose. The second: June is visiting her fiance's Ollie's lake house, "a house haunted by long-buried memories of her lost friend" Leah.
If this wasn't the first novel that hit my desk after I started at the P-C last year, it's one of the first. But I'd completely forgotten about it until I started putting this list together. It's not usually the kind of thing I'd go for, but if the description appeals to you, it strikes me as the kind of book that would be a pleasant distraction during turbulent times.
'Pitty the Reader' by Kurt Vonnegut and Suzanne McConnel Genre: Nonfiction
Length: ~375 pages
Half of this book's authorship is renowned author Kurt Vonnegut, the other half is Suzanne McConnell who was a student of Vonnegut's at the Iowa Writers' Workshop. The latter has collected everything she can about what Vonnegut as a teacher regarding the craft of writing.
I seem to have a problem with not reading books by Kurt Vonnegut. I've been told I'd love "Slaughterhouse-Five," which has nonetheless been gathering dust on my personal shelf for ages. Of all the books on my P-C shelf though, this is maybe the one I was most hoping to read most of all, and was only reminded of as I started to put together this list.
'Real Life' by Brandon Taylor Genre: Fiction
Length: ~325 pages
This is a story about an Alabama-born protagonist, Wallace, and his navigating of his sexuality and self-preservation while at a Midwestern university. Author Brandon Taylor is a staff writer Literary Hub and a graduate of the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop. He read from this book at Prairie Lights in February.
Sometimes I like to imagine alternate realities. While putting this article together, I wonder if the version of me that's read all these books is a happier person. I feel like he is. I feel like he's somehow more attractive too. Yet, despite being interested and having months of notice, I slept on this book and ended up not writing any local coverage.
If you're interested in reading, this is your chance to not be like this realities me. Be like alternate-universe, happy/handsome me.
'These Boys and Their Fathers' by Don Waters Genre: Memoir
Length: ~250 pages
A 2010 mission self-set by author Don Waters was "to write a magazine story about a surfing icon who had known his absentee father"." That resulted in the investigative and introspective memoir we have today.
The book was published by the University of Iowa Press last year and Waters was another attendee of the Iowa City Book Festival who went uncovered by the P-C. From the very little I've read, the books seems to be in a similar vein as "The Glass Castle" by Jeannette Walls.
'Time After Time' by Lisa Grunwald Genre: Fiction
Length: ~400 pages
The release for this one pitches this love story as a fusion of "The Time Traveler's Wife" and "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button." Joe is a railroad man and Nora is an aspiring artist who discover's she is stuck, in a very real sense, in Grand Central Terminal by a force she doesn't understand. The narrative charts the relationship between the two over roughly a decade.
God, I love the cover and title of this book. Yet another example of a text I'm not particularly inclined toward that I can't help but want to read whenever it catches my eye. Once again we see a character who is stuck in a place and, maybe it's just because of the time and place we're all currently stuck in, but that resonates.
'Surfside Sisters' by Nancy Thayer Genre: Fiction
Length: ~300 pages
Protagonist Keely Green grew up in Nantucket with her best friend, Isabelle, with dreams of becoming a novelist. Years later she's achieved those dreams and is living the glamorous big city life of a successful New York novelist. Her dream life is interrupted by the one-two punch of her editor passing on her novel and her mom's health declining, forcing her to return to Nantucket to things she thought she'd put behind her.
Technically I have two Nancy Thayer books on my desk. (This and "Let It Snow" a Christmas themed novel.) But coverage for one of them felt like enough for our purposes here. I don't know much about Thayer, but going through the press releases included with her work here I've discovered she's famous for capturing the "natural beauty" of Nantucket. So for those of you stuck inside and wishing you were somehow in Nantucket, Thay surely has a book for you.
'When You Learn the Alphabet' by Kendra Allen Genre: Nonfiction
Length: ~150 pages
A book of essays focusing on the parental relationships of author Kendra Allen, this shortish book touches on a wide array of topics. Marriage, race, mental health and feminism are just a few of the themes interwoven throughout the book.
Like "Bloody Genius" this is one I didn't get a chance to cover in full because of the local event relating to it being positioned during the local literary festival. That said I've only heard good things and if someone demanded why I hadn't read this yet I would probably mutter something about "having a lot on my plate" and then failing to go to sleep because I'm questioning internally why I haven't read this book.

Texto completo: To stop the spread of the coronavirus, state and local governments have shut down as much of communal life as possible. People are also social distancing, staying out of public spaces to slow transmission of the disease. But this has destroyed demand for goods and services, putting the United States on the path to a recession that could easily become an outright depression.
Washington is, finally, working toward a response. But even the most ambitious proposals are nowhere near powerful enough to actually stop the coronavirus from destroying the economy. To do that, policymakers have to go beyond stimulus or bailouts for select industries. They have to take responsibility for economic life on a scale not seen since the New Deal.
Nothing has been passed into law yet, but politicians have begun to float ideas and propose legislation. On Friday, the House of Representatives passed a bill that would offer free testing for all Americans as well as sick days and paid emergency leave for a small subset of working people. On Monday, Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah called for sending $1,000 to every American, a one-time grant to pump cash into the economy. On Tuesday, Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, called for more than $850 billion in economic stimulus, including $58 billion in airline bailouts, $250 billion in small business loans and $500 billion in payroll tax cuts.
Some of these ideas are good and necessary, if not sufficient. Millions of Americans need to pay for housing, medicine and groceries now, and immediate cash disbursals are the only way to make that happen. To its credit, the White House has moved away from the payroll tax cut - which would only help workers still employed, not those who have been laid off, furloughed or who work for tips - and embraced cash payments, although they'll only amount to an average of two weeks of pay for most workers and won't go out until the end of April.
Bailouts are more controversial, but they could be worthwhile if the government offers cash with strings attached. To receive assistance, in Sen. Elizabeth Warren's view, companies would be forced to maintain their payrolls, provide a $15 minimum wage, bring worker representatives onto corporate boards and end share buybacks, among other requirements.
But none of this is actually enough.
The outbreak threatens entire industries with destruction. Most restaurants, for example, can probably survive a week or two of social distancing. Some can survive a month. But if self-quarantine lasts for months, then hundreds of thousands of businesses, including suppliers and distributors, will fail. Millions of Americans will be out of work. It's even worse for travel and tourism. The so-called accommodations sector of the economy, which includes hotels and other forms of lodging, accounts for more than 2 million jobs - all of them are endangered by extended periods of social distancing. The shock from losing these industries would be more than enough to push the economy into depression.
Nearly one-fifth of American workers already say they've lost hours or work because of the outbreak. If lawmakers are going to save the economy from destruction, they need to think along the lines of the economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman of the University of California, Berkeley, who, in a brief paper, call for the government to act as a "payer of last result" to "stanch the flow of mass layoffs and business destruction."
In the program they envision, workers would remain formally employed but receive unemployment benefits. Businesses would report their costs to the government and receive payment in return. If businesses report too much, or get too much in return, then the payments could be "transformed into an interest-free loan that the government could recoup over several years."
This would not stop a recession; it would help keep the downturn from spiraling out of control. It's an unprecedented program, but we're facing an unprecedented situation.
To the extent that this has begun to dawn on Washington, it has spurred more ambitious proposals. A group of Democratic senators - Cory Booker of New Jersey, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Michael Bennet of Colorado - have proposed up to $4,500 in "immediate direct cash payments" to nearly all Americans.
Their plan would give each adult (and child) $2,000 to cover the next three months, supplemented by additional payments over the course of the year depending on the state of the economy and the state of the pandemic. It's a good framework, but it, too, could be much stronger, with larger payments - equivalent to thousands per month - and less concern over means-testing, which only slows distribution. If lawmakers are worried about giving cash to the wealthy, they can just raise their taxes by an equivalent amount later.
Democrats in the House have also proposed cash grant programs, some more generous than others. Reps. Ro Khanna of California and Tim Ryan of Ohio have introduced legislation to establish an emergency earned-income tax credit that would provide a check between $1,000 and $6,000 to every American who earned less than $65,000 last year, which is more than three-quarters of the workforce. Reps. Joe Kennedy III of Massachusetts and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota have also called for unconditional cash assistance, with universal programs that would assist all of us.
Washington should keep moving along these lines. In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has suspended state debt collection. Congressional Democrats should pressure the federal government to follow suit. The important point is that right now there's nothing on the table that is too big for the crisis at hand.
And for the party that pioneered American social insurance, the party of FDR and LBJ, it's an opportunity to once again embrace direct state action as a powerful tool for preserving and promoting prosperity. If the era of small government is over, and it is, then it is well past time for Democrats to seize a moment that belongs to them.

It's Dangerous To Be Ruled By Fear

Texto completo: The reaction to the pandemic should not be allowed to become as dangerous as the disease itself.
Donald Trump's first instinct when it came to the coronavirus was to dismiss the threat as overblown, over there, and "totally under control." His second was to use the pandemic as an opportunity to show off his world-historical leadership skills by treating the virus as a threat on par with World War II.
Both reactions were driven by politics, not evidence. The first was unquestionably wrong. The second needs to be questioned aggressively before we impose solutions possibly more destructive than the virus itself.
On Thursday, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California commanded the people of his state to stay home. That's roughly 40 million people. He anticipates that about 25 million Californians will be infected by the virus over the next eight weeks.
Where does that projection come from? The governor cites a "model" used by state planners, the accuracy of which can only be guessed. How long will it be enforced, and for how long can it be sustained? Nobody knows. The only certainty is that, in the midst of a crisis, politicians are rarely penalized for predicting the worst possible outcome. If it comes to pass, they seem prophetic. If it doesn't, they take credit for averting catastrophe.
In the meantime, they seek to enhance their powers. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who is fighting to stay in office and out of jail, has also ordered Israelis not to leave their homes -- while maneuvering to shutter the country's Parliament. The political consequences of pandemics should not be allowed to become as dangerous as the disease itself.
Nor should the economic consequences. Can the United States afford to shut down for a week or two? Yes. What about a few months? In that event, we might face not a recession but a full-blown depression, which would be financially ruinous for hundreds of millions and have its own disastrous knock-on effects in mental, emotional, and physical health, including for the elderly and sick who already face the greatest risks from the virus.
And what if a "suppression" strategy of school closures, restaurant shutdowns, home quarantines, bans on gatherings of more than a few people, and other methods of social distancing lasts 18 months -- the estimate of how long it might take to develop and distribute a safe and effective vaccine?
In that case, we are looking at a century-defining calamity that could bankrupt the government; wreck nearly every business in America, large or small; disrupt supply chains and create critical shortfalls of food, medicines, and other essential items; lead to dramatic increases in deaths of loneliness and despair; tempt political leaders, including the president, to disavow democratic norms in the name of public health (including by seeking to postpone elections); and create widespread, perhaps deadly, civil unrest.
This may be a nightmare scenario. But it's one we will move swiftly toward if we continue to operate on worst-case scenario thinking and an unwillingness to countenance the balancing of risks. With all respect to Dr. Anthony Fauci, who believes in the virtues of overreaction, there are grave dangers to that, too.
Especially since we are making historically momentous policy decisions based on dangerously spotty data. "We don't know if we are failing to capture infections by a factor of three or 300," writes Stanford's disease prevention expert, John P.A. Ioannidis, in a must-read piece in the authoritative science and medicine website Stat (itself a must-read). The need for better data, obtained through repeated random sampling of the entire population, could not be clearer.
What we should not do, Ioannidis warns, is impose draconian measures that seem effective on paper but whose unintended consequences are poorly thought through. School closures, for example, may backfire if children socialize in other ways and bring home the virus to elderly or sick relatives.
"Flattening the curve" is another concept that needs a closer look: "If the level of the epidemic does overwhelm the health system and extreme measures have only modest effectiveness, then flattening the curve may make things worse," he writes. "Instead of being overwhelmed during a short, acute phase, the health system will remain overwhelmed for a more protracted period."
Is that right? Hard to say. But his larger point is surely right: Policymaking should not be dictated, as it is now, by a combination of raw fear and lousy data, much less the vanity and political calculations of the president.
The term "sustainability" comes to mind. Sooner or later, people will figure out that it is not sustainable to keep tens of millions of people in lockdown; or use population-wide edicts rather than measures designed to protect the most vulnerable; or expect the federal government to keep a $ 21 trillion economy afloat; or throw millions of people out of work and ask them to subsist on a $ 1,200 check.
The risks posed by the coronavirus are real, immediate and frightening. The risks of doing ourselves even greater damage by indulging the illusion that we can impose Chinese-style controls in a free society or refuse to countenance trade-offs between public health and economic survival are no less real. It's a tragedy that we do not have a president who can explain these facts, and who inspires the trust needed to move us toward safety.

Texto completo: This article is by James Glanz, Lauren Leatherby, Matthew Bloch, Mitch Smith, Larry Buchanan, Jin Wu and Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs
The coronavirus has infected far more people in the United States than testing has shown so far, and stringent measures to limit social contact in parts of the country not yet seeing many cases are needed to significantly stem the tide of illness and death in the coming months. Those are the conclusions of Columbia University researchers who used a New York Times database of known cases and Census Bureau transportation data to model how the outbreak could evolve based on what is known about the virus. The estimates are inherently uncertain, and they could change as America adopts unprecedented measures to control the outbreak. But they offer a stark warning: Even if the country managed to cut its rate of transmission in half -- a tall order -- some 650,000 people might become infected in the next two months. The growth is driven by Americans with mild symptoms who are carrying and spreading the virus without being aware that they have it, the researchers say. The number of undetected cases -- 11 times the total that has been officially reported, they estimate -- reflects how far behind the United States has fallen in testing for the virus. New York City, Seattle, Boston and parts of California already have such large outbreaks that they will probably see significant growth even after taking extraordinary measures over the past week, the researchers say. New York City's outbreak, the nation's largest, grew to more than 4,000 known cases on Friday and is likely to increase many times over even in a favorable scenario. On the other hand, parts of the country without large clusters of cases could still avoid the worst of the outbreak -- if they impose measures like closing schools, banning mass gatherings and testing and quarantining sick people and their contacts. The epidemic would then spread inland at a much slower pace and strike with less severity, the estimates say. But controls would need to be put in place immediately, and everywhere. "We're looking at something that's catastrophic on a level that we have not seen for an infectious disease since 1918," said Jeffrey Shaman, a professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia and the leader of the research team, referring to the Spanish flu. "And it's requiring sacrifices we haven't seen since World War II. There are going to be enormous disruptions. There's no easy way out." Controls in many places have already changed the fabric of American life. Restaurants and schools have closed, people are working from home and travelers have put off trips -- all changes that should reduce the rate of infection. In California, New York and Illinois, officials have announced more stringent directives aimed at stopping the spread. That means that at least 1 in 5 Americans will be under orders to stay home in the coming days, and more states are expected to follow suit. But other places have resisted. Bars and restaurants remain open in Wichita, Kan., in a county that reported its first case on Thursday night, and in Knoxville, Tenn., where reports of the virus have been scarce. Some malls remain open in Chicago, recreational marijuana shops in Oregon, and some retail chains nationwide. Many businesses are still requiring workers to come into the office. "I'm not really supportive yet of restricting things further or closing down," said Pete Meitzner, head of the Board of County Commissioners in Sedgwick County, which includes Wichita, a city of about 400,000. Mr. Meitzner said he was growing increasingly anxious at the possibility that people who do not know they are ill might spread the virus, but that he also needed to consider the fate of workers as the community decided whether to close buildings. "Some of our public offices and buildings are, but I do feel horrible for our restaurant workers and our hospitality workers at our hotels," he said. "They are really suffering." Of the area's relative dearth of cases, Mr. Meitzner added, "We don't know for sure if we're lucky or what." The scenarios do not estimate what effect individual local actions will have on the outbreak. But if the country as a whole does not take collective action, they suggest that Sedgwick County could see a significant proportion of its population -- hundreds of thousands of people -- infected with the virus in the next two months. If the country, as a whole, can reduce rates of transmission by 50 percent, Sedgwick County could instead see fewer than 1,000 cases in that time. Several researchers not involved in the Columbia University analysis who reviewed the findings said they made sense and broadly agreed with their own thinking. Even in places that now appear to have few cases, they said, officials should act sooner rather than later. "You have to think of this as an insurance for the future: The earlier you do it, the greater effect you have on the virus," said Alessandro Vespignani, director of the Network Science Institute at Northeastern University, who said the estimates were in line with his own projections. "It's better to take excessive precautions than not." The economic challenges of that loom. "We're staying open until someone forces us to shut down," Beau McKee, the general manager at Not Watson's Kitchen and Bar in Knoxville, said in a telephone interview, as dishes clattered in the background. "I feel like those people that are vulnerable know who they are and they should be careful, and we should continue testing. But small businesses are getting crushed." Mr. McKee said he has grown increasingly worried about how the virus could affect his own father, in his 70s, but that there were other worries too. "At least we can offer a handful of people goodpaying jobs and when we get out of this and we're on the other side, we'll hopefully have gained more clientele by doing so because we kind of stuck it out and didn't wave the white flag," he said. The Columbia researchers' model works by observing the behavior of the outbreak in the United States up until March 13, based on case records compiled by The New York Times, commuting patterns and other data. The researchers use those observations to infer key features of the outbreak. One is how many people each infected person has tended to infect so far, about 2.2. Another is how many people may pass on the virus without knowing that they have it. The disease is spreading far too fast to be explained by known cases alone, and only about 1 in 11 infections have been reported, they found. Those factors allow the researchers to simulate the spread of a virus in the future. They adjust those simulations under different scenarios in which the nation imposes a range of control measures to stop the spread. The estimates are imperfect, but they are consistent with the available data. It is impossible to know the exact number of cases a week ago or to predict the future. It is also impossible to model the precise impact of unprecedented measures that America has already put in place to control the outbreak. But the research estimates that if measures to slow the disease are not effective, the virus could sicken millions of people or more, losing steam on the coasts in May before spreading to the rest of the country over the summer. A worst-case scenario is unlikely to play out. A handful of countries, including China and South Korea, have managed to slow down their own fast-moving outbreaks through tracking and isolating sick people and reducing social contact. It is not known if measures imposed in the last week have started slowing the outbreak in the United States. But the researchers' estimates show the enormity of the task. As in China, most of those who have been infected but not tested are likely to have mild symptoms, or none at all, the researchers say. That means they can spread the virus without being aware they are infected. Several researchers said that the slow pace of testing in the United States is one major reason the proportion of unreported infections is so high here. Despite a ramping up of testing in recent days, the United States still lags both Italy and South Korea in the total number of people tested and in testing per-capita, figures show. This map shows how many people the model estimates could get the virus in each county in the United States by two months from now. Two scenarios envision what might happen if overall transmission is cut by 50 percent and by 25 percent from what it has been so far. A third scenario -- which is unlikely -- simulates what could happen without any intervention. New York City, the model indicates, could count tens of thousands of new cases every day by late spring or early summer. But if the city remains vigilant about maintaining the stringent measures recently put in place, the peak could be delayed by weeks or longer and be significantly lower, the model suggests. Dr. Shaman cautioned that the model is designed to capture national trends, and local projections should be viewed as broad estimates. "This is serious and this is real. We have to act now and act aggressive," Dr. Vespignani said. "We have to mobilize all the resources that we have. None of us has a single solution. But we have to try all of them." In the days since New York's first recorded case, on March 1, the state has declared a state of emergency and deployed the National Guard to New Rochelle, an early focal point of the outbreak; New York City has closed schools and barred dining in at restaurants and watching Broadway shows. But in places like Wichita, some parts of life have yet to change. In that city, bars and restaurants are allowed to operate freely as long as they keep crowds to fewer than 50 people. Still, Beverly Salas, an owner of Egg Cetera, a downtown restaurant that serves brunch and latenight bites for the bar crowd, said she chose to close the restaurant anyway. "It was a hard decision, honestly, because we have no more income coming in," Ms. Salas, 24, said. But her customers include nurses from a nearby hospital and many people who are in their 60s or older, she said, and the thought that someone might somehow contract the illness at her small restaurant was too much for her to bear. "I'm looking at other places like Italy and trying to avoid going through that," she said. "Why are we not taking it as seriously as New York, Chicago, or even Kansas City? I know we're a smaller town, but there are cases all over the country.

Texto completo: Many journalists are covering a once-in-a-lifetime story from home, thanks to Zoom and Slack. But as readers flock to large news outlets, ads are starting to disappear.
They Slack. And the journalists stuck working from home also plan their coverage through videoconferencing applications like Google Hangouts, Zoom, UberConference, BlueJeans and Nexi.
"Everyone should be jumping on Zoom at least once a day to see members of their team, smile at each other and provide the interaction that will keep us feeling connected," said Noah Shachtman, the editor in chief of The Daily Beast, in an email. "It's key to avoid feeling isolated and staying motivated."
Babies and small children make onscreen cameos. So does Sookie, the brown cat belonging to Henry Blodget, the chief executive of Insider Inc., the publisher of Business Insider.
Staff members at The Verge have spent off hours playing Mario Kart while chatting over the app Discord. Vox Media is planning Zoom reading hours for children and parents.
"We're just little Brady Bunches on the screen," said Susan Matthews, the features editor at Slate.
Despite the coronavirus containment efforts that have emptied newsrooms, journalists across the country have managed to meet their deadlines at a time when the appetite for news seems greater than ever. In the last four weeks, as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States rose sharply, web traffic surged.
"I do not expect this newsroom to miss a beat," said Carrie Budoff Brown, the editor of Politico.
The number of minutes spent by readers at news sites increased 46 percent from the same period ending a few days ago last year, and overall visits rose 57 percent, according to a study of more than a dozen general news websites by comScore, a media measurement company.
Outlets showing big gains included The Atlantic, Business Insider, The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, The Wall Street Journal and Wired, all of which doubled or nearly doubled the number of visits. Most outlets have made coronavirus-related articles available free to nonsubscribers.
A graphics-heavy story in The Washington Post on March 14 headlined "Why outbreaks like coronavirus spread exponentially, and how to 'flatten the curve"' was its most-viewed article ever, a spokeswoman said.
USA Today's online audience shot up 30 percent, year over year, and the number of readers visiting Vox.com increased 60 percent from the first week of March to the second, the outlets said. Hearst Magazines sites attracted 33 percent more readers, compared with last year. And the number of unique visitors to Vanity Fair soared 44 percent last week, thanks, in part, to a tweet by President Trump attacking the magazine's coronavirus coverage.
The audience for Verizon Media sites, including HuffPost and Yahoo News, has increased by nearly 80 percent in recent days, said Guru Gowrappan, the chief executive of Verizon Media, in an email. BuzzFeed News's traffic was up 44 percent for the 10 days before last weekend, according to a spokesman.
Matt Murray, the editor in chief of The Journal, expressed concern that the paper's journalists might overdo it as they chronicle the pandemic and its economic fallout.
"They're all eager to be on a big story and work hard, which is great, but I don't want them to work 100 hours a week," he said. "We need them to get through the next couple of months and not burn out."
The surge in page views has been good for much of the news business, at least in the short term. There were 57.5 percent more new subscriptions to U.S. news sites last Sunday than on an average Sunday, according to the media software company Piano. The Journal, Bloomberg and The Daily Beast said they had signed up a much greater number of new subscribers than usual in recent weeks.
"People are really desperate for factual, good information and analysis," said John Micklethwait, the editor in chief of Bloomberg News. "My guess is a lot of the quality end of journalism has done well, because suddenly it matters enormously what the facts are."
The throng of readers has not fully restored the ailing news industry, however. Some media companies have had to cancel or postpone the events they had come to depend on for revenue. Other planned gatherings will go online, including a health care conference sponsored by The Journal that was to take place next week in Washington. A live show of Slate's "Dear Prudence" advice column scheduled for the Bell House in Brooklyn next month will be streamed from the living room of the columnist Daniel M. Lavery. An Eater wine club event will be virtual.
Once-reliable advertisers -- hotel chains and airlines among them -- have cut back or canceled campaigns. The New York Times Company advised investors this month that "uncertainty and anxiety about the virus" had led to downward adjustments of advertising revenue expectations.
Nicholas Thompson, the editor in chief of Wired, said the magazine would "take a big hit."
"But our view is, we'll worry about that next," he added. "Right now, we're worried about getting the best, most truthful information out there."
The outlook is worse for local news websites, daily newspapers in midsize cities and weekly papers across the country, which typically rely on now-struggling neighborhood businesses for the bulk of their advertising.
"We are seeing some cancellations," said Steve Yaeger, the chief marketing officer of The Minneapolis Star Tribune. "We're also seeing some new spending, but it's not offsetting the cancellations. It's a bit of a shock to the system."
Jim Spanfeller, the chief executive of G/O Media, said the current ad market "feels very similar to after 9/11."
There have been a few bright spots. Jason Wagenheim, president and chief revenue officer of Bustle Digital Group, said his company had received an unusual number of ad requests from streaming video, baby care and food companies.
"Everyone's home on their couch, eating," he said.
Many news organizations have bet on podcasts to fill the void. Slate's coronavirus-related podcasts have received more than four million downloads, according to a spokeswoman. A Vox Media executive said its podcasts had been downloaded 50 percent more than usual, with newsy shows like "Today, Explained" and "The Weeds" especially popular.
Last week, Katherine Wells, the executive producer of podcasts at The Atlantic, suggested a new daily show during a call with Adrienne LaFrance, the publication's executive editor. The next day, the first episode of "Social Distance" was ready. Episodes often feature James Hamblin, a staff writer who is a medical doctor.
"It's unlocking a world of experimentation and nimbleness," Ms. LaFrance said.
Some reporters have switched beats. A couple of members of Politico's agriculture and trade team are now covering the pandemic, Ms. Budoff Brown said. The Daily Beast's education and gender reporters are digging into health and medicine stories, Mr. Shachtman said.
But with a story so pervasive, others have been able to take what the grim news cycle gives them and fit it into their usual areas of coverage. Joanna Stern, a personal technology columnist at The Journal, has included a work-from-home tip in Mr. Murray's morning newsletter, "The 10-Point." The Romper, a Bustle site for millennial mothers, has weighed in on the best disinfectants and how to explain the pandemic to children.
There is still plenty of demand for non-coronavirus-related material. Recent trending videos on the animal site The Dodo have included one about a sea turtle making its way back to the ocean and another about a monkey and a dog that are pals.
"I really want to know everything going on and the right information to protect my family and employees," said Ben Lerer, the chief executive of Group Nine Media, the company behind The Dodo. "And then I also want to unplug."

Texto completo: The former New York mayor, announcing he would donate $ 18 million to the Democratic National Committee, abandoned a plan to employ his campaign organizers through November.
Michael R. Bloomberg on Friday abandoned plans to form a new super PAC for the presidential race and employ his campaign organizers through November, instead opting to give $ 18 million to the Democratic National Committee for the party's battleground states program and disband the army of field workers he had assembled across the country.
The reversal -- which came on the same day that election authorities reported he had spent more than $ 900 million on his campaign -- prompted an outcry from former staff members, who said it was particularly startling for Mr. Bloomberg's campaign to shatter their expectations of employment and health benefits in the middle of a major public-health crisis.
"I'm so sorry I worked for this guy. I thought he was totally different," said Jane Conrad, a former field organizer for Mr. Bloomberg in Minnesota whom the campaign recruited away from her work as a union field representative in February. "He took me out of my job for his own gain."
Mr. Bloomberg's presidential campaign had promised at its outset that it would finance a field program through the November election, attracting staff members like Ms. Conrad with generous pay and benefits. Then, upon his withdrawal from the race earlier this month, Bloomberg officials said the former New York mayor would continue to employ some of his campaign's field staff through an independent campaign organization.
In the end, Mr. Bloomberg, a multibillionaire, chose to do none of those things. He transferred $ 18 million from his campaign account to the D.N.C., which intends to use the funds to hire its own organizing staff in battleground states.
"While we considered creating our own independent entity to support the nominee and hold the president accountable, this race is too important to have many competing groups with good intentions but that are not coordinated and united in strategy and execution," the Bloomberg campaign wrote in an unsigned memo.
The Bloomberg campaign had already paid rents through November for dozens of field offices in states expected to be competitive in the general election. Those offices will be transferred to Democratic state parties, which D.N.C. officials said would hire organizers using the money from Mr. Bloomberg's campaign. The Bloomberg memo said the D.N.C. staffing would draw "in part from our own incredibly experienced and talented organizing staff."
In a conference call Friday, about 1,500 former campaign staff members across the country -- including some who had been laid off earlier in the month -- were informed of the plans by the campaign's states director and encouraged to apply to work for the D.N.C., though they were advised that, should they be hired, those jobs would carry different pay and benefits.
A set of interview talking points used by the campaign to hire field organizers over the last several months, seen by The New York Times, had included mention of "full health, dental and vision benefits" and "employment through November 2020 with Team Bloomberg."
Those verbal promises were first tested on March 9, less than a week after Mr. Bloomberg exited the race, when many field organizers were laid off and told they would be paid through the end of the month. Employees were encouraged to reapply to work for Mr. Bloomberg's organization in six battleground states: Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
But on Friday, campaign employees in those states learned that they would not be working through the general election either. The Bloomberg campaign circulated a new survey to employees, inviting them to add their names to a list that would be forwarded to the D.N.C. for potential hiring. The deadline to fill it out was March 25.
There was no promise of a job. Applicants would "be fed into the competitive hiring process," the message said.
"I spent all that time talking to people in my district, telling them we were going to be there through November -- that was hammered into us over and over again," said Dallas Johnson, who began working as an organizer in Minnesota for Mr. Bloomberg in January. "For the people who got let go today, there are other things they could have been doing," he said, adding they had "pretty much zero job prospects of getting hired right now."
Ms. Conrad, who took a leave of absence to join the campaign last month, said Friday that she would be unable to reclaim her job as a labor union representative before the end of the year.
She expressed particular concern about losing health care at the end of the month in the face of the coronavirus outbreak.
"I was looking to get ahead and pay off medical bills," said Ms. Conrad, whose son has Crohn's disease and takes immunosuppressant drugs. "Now I'm looking at falling further behind on them."
Brynne Craig, a senior adviser to Mr. Bloomberg, said Friday morning that the former mayor remained determined to fund the campaign to topple President Trump. "We're changing the mechanism, not our commitment," Ms. Craig said, saying an independent-expenditure field program would be "not as effective" as one coordinated through the D.N.C.
But Mr. Bloomberg's decision not to form a new super PAC represents an abrupt retreat from months of chest-thumping promises from some of his political advisers, particularly his campaign manager, Kevin Sheekey, who had boasted that the former mayor would end up either mounting the best-funded presidential candidacy in history, or funding the biggest independent-expenditure effort ever.
On Friday's call with former campaign employees, Dan Kanninen, the campaign's states director, communicated the decision to those it affected most directly.
"I know that for those of you who have primaries that have yet to come, ending so abruptly, as all campaigns inevitably do, is a really odd feeling for very different reasons," Mr. Kanninen said, according to a recording obtained by The New York Times.
"I can't emphasize enough how much things have changed in the intervening days since March 3, and even the days before," he said, referencing the Super Tuesday contests in which Mr. Biden won decisive victories and Mr. Bloomberg won only the caucuses in American Samoa.
After Mr. Bloomberg ended his campaign on March 4, Mr. Sheekey said that Mr. Bloomberg was already in the process of trademarking a name for an independent-expenditure group.
But at the time, other Bloomberg advisers cautioned that the former mayor was still a long way from deciding exactly how he would spend his money in the general election, and that nothing could move forward without vetting by campaign finance lawyers.
Nearly a dozen other former campaign workers expressed frustration in interviews on Friday, saying the pay and promises of job security through November had been key reasons they joined Mr. Bloomberg's long-shot campaign. They requested anonymity to speak because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed with the campaign and a desire not to jeopardize the remaining pay the campaign had promised them.
Some said they had completed the form sent out by the campaign on Friday, asking them to prioritize their interest in working in 14 different states for the D.N.C.
"It's embarrassing to me, because I worked within my neighborhood," Elle Zwicky, another former field organizer for Mr. Bloomberg in Minnesota, said Friday. "Now to go back to all these neighbors and friends and community members around me who hosted house parties, volunteered -- that's a breach of trust for the people that gave time and energy to the campaign, that I gathered, that I organized."
Mr. Bloomberg is all but certain to remain a major funder of the Democratic Party, even in the absence of an organization under his direct control.
His $ 18 million contribution to the D.N.C., a figure that far exceeds individual limits, is legal, party officials said, because it is coming in the form of a transfer from the campaign. Individuals are allowed to make unlimited contributions to their own campaigns, and campaigns can make unlimited transfers to political parties.
The transfer is also not expected to be Mr. Bloomberg's last huge contribution to the campaign against Mr. Trump: In recent weeks, he has also announced large donations to three major progressive groups -- Swing Left, Collective Future and Voto Latino -- and those checks are likely to keep coming.
"With this transfer from the Bloomberg campaign, Mayor Bloomberg and his team are making good on their commitment to beating Donald Trump," said Tom Perez, the D.N.C. chairman. "This will help us invest in more organizers across the country to elect the next president and help Democrats win up and down the ballot."
Though some of Mr. Bloomberg's former campaign workers have turned their organizing efforts inward, saying on Friday they were consulting with employment lawyers and challenging the campaign's message, others expressed resignation, citing the at-will employment contracts they had signed.
"I especially feel for people who relocated or left jobs or gave up job opportunities for this, and suddenly you find out the agreement is not there," Mr. Johnson, the former field organizer said. "I worked as a contractor in my life, and when I took on a contract, you realize people might go bankrupt or things change. But this was a major hiring point."

Texto completo: CHICAGO — The United States sank into a deeper state of disruption and paralysis Friday as New York and Illinois announced a broad series of measures aimed at keeping tens of millions of residents cloistered in their homes, following similar actions by California and a patchwork of restrictions from coast to coast.
By the end of the weekend, at least 1 in 5 Americans will be under orders to stay home, and more states were expected to follow suit. Forty-five states have closed all their schools and the other five have closed at least some of them. Bars, restaurants, and other gathering spots have been abruptly shuttered.
New York state has become the center of the outbreak, as its confirmed coronavirus cases have jumped to more than 8,300. With 6 percent of the US population, the state accounts for more than one-third of all confirmed cases in the country.
Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York on Friday announced what he called “the most drastic action we can take," ordering all nonessential businesses closed by 8 p.m. Sunday.
New York City's public transit system will continue to run, but the city it travels through was profoundly transformed from its usually bustling, never-sleep energy: Its restaurants and bars were closed; its schools, museums, and theaters dark; and its gaudy central mall — Times Square — quieter than it has been in decades.
Hours after the New York announcement, Illinois followed. Governor J.B. Pritzker issued an order for the state's more than 12 million residents to stay home, beginning Saturday at 5 p.m. “For the vast majority of you already taking precautions, your lives will not change very much," Pritzker said.
His order, set to expire April 7, still allows the state's 12.6 million residents to head outside to buy groceries and medicine.
“If there are actions that I can take that will save lives in the midst of this pandemic, no matter how difficult, then I have an obligation," Pritzker said. The Democrat said he was trying to prevent “potentially tens of thousands" of deaths but urged people not to panic.

Federal tax filing deadline extended into July
WASHINGTON — American taxpayers will have until July 15 to file their tax returns, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Friday, a move intended to offer additional reprieve to individuals and companies in the middle of the coronavirus.
The move follows an earlier decision by the Treasury Department, at the direction of President Trump, to allow individuals and companies to defer tax payments until July 15.
Guidance released this week said individual taxpayers can defer up to $1 million of federal income tax, and companies can defer up to $10 million of tax payments for 90 days.
Mnuchin has said that delaying tax payments will inject $300 billion of temporary liquidity into the US economy. For those expecting a refund, he encouraged taxpayers to file by April 15 so that they can receive those funds.
The move by the Treasury Department and the IRS does not affect state income taxes, but some states have started announcing their own delays.

NYC fire department hit with positive tests, quarantines
NEW YORK — It began last week when an Emergency Medical Services worker contracted the coronavirus from his girlfriend.
Three days later, more than 20 of these workers, who form part of the New York City Fire Department, were in isolation for potential exposure to the virus, either through their colleagues, patients or off-duty contacts.
By Wednesday morning, three Fire Department employees had tested positive.
Now, more than 150 members of the department are in quarantine, including dozens of EMS workers, according to union and department officials.
The speed with which the coronavirus has affected the department's ranks has rattled New York City's ambulance crews at a time when these workers may be pivotal in managing a surge of patients with the illness.

National Spelling Bee is postponed
The Scripps National Spelling Bee won't be held as scheduled this year because of the coronavirus, meaning years of preparation by some of the country's top spellers could go for naught.
Scripps cited state and federal recommendations against large gatherings Friday as it canceled plans to hold the contest during the week of May 24. Scripps said it would try to reschedule for later this year but did not commit to a new date. It's possible the bee won't be held at all.
"Canceling the bee would cause an emotional breakdown for most spellers," Navneeth Murali, a 14-year-old bee veteran from Edison, N.J., told the Associated Press.
The bee's rules require only that participants not move beyond eighth grade before Aug. 31, which means if this year's bee were held later than that, the competition could include some ninth-graders for the first time.

Indiana pushing back state primary vote to June
INDIANAPOLIS — Indiana's political leaders announced Friday that they agreed to push back the state primary by nearly a month, to June 2, and to allow all voters to cast mail-in ballots due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Republican Governor Eric Holcomb said during a news conference with the state GOP and Democratic Party chairmen that only during such emergency times would he support moving the primary from its scheduled May 5 date.
The announcement came as state health officials reported Friday that Indiana now had COVID-19 cases in all the major population centers.

Texto completo: For the foreseeable future, MinnPost will be providing daily updates on coronavirus in Minnesota, published following the press phone call conducted by the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) each afternoon.
Here are the latest updates from March 20, 2020:
* 26 new cases announced; 115 total
* Minnesota developing model of coronavirus spread
* Gear requested from the feds
* Unemployment continues to spike
* YMCA expands children’s services
* New executive orders on price gouging, state programs
* Is Minnesota overreacting?
* No shelter in place — yet
26 new cases announced; 115 total
MDH announced 26 new cases of COVID-19 in Minnesota on Friday, for a total of 115 confirmed in the state. Because of a lack of testing capacity, the true number of cases is likely much larger.
Minnesotans with confirmed cases have ranged from age 17 to 94. There have been no documented cases in children.
To-date, eight Minnesotans have been hospitalized, three have been released from the hospital. Two are in intensive care.
15 out of Minnesota’s 115 confirmed cases are believed to have picked up the virus through community transmission — meaning not through travel or contact with a known COVID-19 case. But Infectious Disease Director Kris Ehresmann cautioned against interpreting that as a sign the virus isn’t elsewhere. She said MDH believes there is community transmission throughout the state.
Modeling the spread
MDH is consulting with the University of Minnesota to develop a model of the spread of COVID-19 in Minnesota and the state’s capacity to handle it. Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said the model will be shared when there’s enough confidence in its accuracy to share, but that there’s little Minnesota data to model off of right now.
“With 115 cases and only eight hospitalizations we just don’t have enough of our own data to make this a really Minnesota-specific model,” she said, though those working on it are also using data from elsewhere to inform the construction of their model.
“As soon as that model exists and we have some confidence in it, we will be certainly transparent with that,” she said.
Gear requested from the feds
Minnesota has made several requests to the federal government for gear from a national strategic stockpile of potentially lifesaving medical equipment and supplies. Malcolm said Minnesota is expecting a formula-based proportional share, and has so far received a partial order. “We’re unclear where the rest of it is,” she said, adding the state had not received responses on two of its orders.
Malcolm said she understands the federal system is getting a lot of requests, but it’s essential for Minnesota to know how much equipment it can expect sooner than later. State Emergency Management director Joe Kelly said the state is both trying to tap reserves and buy equipment.
“We’ll leave no stone unturned to find the shortest supply lines,” Kelly said.
Unemployment continues to spike
Droves of people continue to apply for unemployment insurance. As of 8 p.m. Thursday, 95,352 had applied for benefits this week, smashing a record of roughly 18,000, said Steve Grove, commissioner of the Department of Employment and Economic Development.
Grove said about a third of applicants are people laid off from the restaurant, bar and entertainment industry. DEED has expanded hours, allowing applications on Sunday between 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. The agency is also working to open a new call center with 15 more people to answer phones. But Grove continued to urge people to apply online and save the phone lines for people without internet or who need translators.
YMCA to expand services for children
The YMCA will partner with state officials to expand its child care services at 38 locations to help look after school-age children of emergency workers. That means the Y will facilitate “distance learning” and child care for children in kindergarten through sixth grade. The Y expects to prioritize emergency workers in the second priority tier for child care, which includes grocery store workers, teachers, state IT personnel, utility workers, trash collectors and other public works employees.
“This is a huge collaborative effort,” Walz told reporters. “It’s one where folks are stepping into the void and asking what they can do to help to make sure (child care) is there.”
The Y will open its doors Monday and child care will run from 8:30 a.m. through 5 p.m., Monday through Friday at a cost of $40 per day.
Three new executive orders signed
Walz signed, and the executive council made up of the other statewide elected officials signed off on, three new orders under his emergency powers. One empowers the state attorney general to go after price gouging on needed supplies. The others attempt to give the state Department of Human Services flexibility to continue to provide health and social services.
“We were seeing hand sanitizer for $60 a bottle, others were hawking $1 per squirt for hand sanitizer,” Walz said. “That’s not who we are. Many of them come from out of state and this gives the state attorney general the ability to crack down.”
The HHS measures ask the federal government for waivers on some federally funded programs but also institute state changes. The new rules are designed to protect benefits, cover COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment costs under state health programs, allow some client contacts to be done by phone rather than in person.
Other changes would lessen renewal processes and reapplication requirements for certain social services.
Is Minnesota overreacting?
Walz said he has heard from residents and some GOP lawmakers that his statewide closure of public gathering places was an overreaction since many counties in Greater Minnesota haven’t seen positive tests.
“This pandemic and the best numbers that are coming out are predicated on having a much more positive outcome,” Walz said, even using a State of Hockey reference by saying he doesn’t want the infection graph line to look like a hockey stick — gradual at first but followed by a straight line up.
“For those who are listening saying so many people are going to get this and get better, that is absolutely true. But the disruption it causes in our health care system will be enough that even the usual rhythm of a medical facility for births, for gall bladders, for heart attacks, for falling and breaking a hip, all of those things have to enter into this too.
“You don’t have a whole lot of open beds or a whole lot of physicians or nurses not doing anything. They’re all working. So when you surge into that system in a catastrophe, that’s where the pressure comes from.”
No shelter in place order yet, but it will likely come
California, New York and Illinois this week announced statewide shelter in place orders, meaning that only essential workers can be out for work and only essential errands such as groceries and supplies can be made.
“You’re going to see this start to happen,” Walz said. “What I can assure Minnesotans is we are looking at the data. We’re trying to make the best-informed decisions that will have an impact on flattening the curve. I can tell you this that at this point in time I am not prepared to make that but I am prepared at some time in the future if it becomes necessary … to make that decision.”
The governor did say it is important for people to get outside, to get exercise.
“If this is going to go on longer, we’ve got to figure out at least where people can go, where they can walk, where they can get some exercise in a way that’s safe,” he said.

Beijing revokes permits for Chinese citizens working for US media

Texto completo: Beijing revoked the work permits of Chinese citizens working as researchers and assistants at U.S. media organizations in China, the latest in a tit-for-tat diplomatic dispute.
Two Chinese news assistants at the New York Times and one at the Wall Street Journal were told by the Beijing Service Bureau for Diplomatic Missions earlier this week that their work permits were revoked, the South China Morning Post reported. A Chinese news assistant at Voice of America also had their work permit rescinded.
Chinese nationals are not permitted to work as reporters for foreign news outlets in the country, but they can work as researchers and Chinese-language assistants and secretaries.
China pulled the credentials of five American media outlets on Tuesday, retaliating against President Trump’s requirement that Chinese state-run media organizations operating in the United States register as foreign missions and placed restrictions on the number of Chinese nationals they could employ in the states.
“They will not be allowed to continue working as journalists in the People's Republic of China, including its Hong Kong and Macao Special Administrative Regions,” China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.
The new policy affects Voice of America, a U.S.-funded outlet; the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, and Time magazine. Employees of those organizations must hand in their press badges within 10 days.
Last month, China revoked the credentials of three other Wall Street Journal reporters over an opinion headline China said was racist.

Debate over coronavirus name is stupid and counterproductive

Texto completo: What to call the pandemic sweeping across the world has become the subject of peculiar political, press, and pundit focus. At press briefings this week, President Trump has doubled down on calling the virus at the heart of the pandemic “the Chinese virus.” Richard Engel at NBC News labeled this racist. “This is a virus that came from the territory of China but came from bats. This is a bat virus, not a China virus. It doesn't speak Chinese,” he lectured.
Freelance writer Jeryl Bier has collected a series of screenshots of media outlets, the Atlantic and the New York Times, for example, condemning as racist the moniker Chinese virus or Wuhan virus after Trump used the phrase, despite having used the same phrasing previously. Likewise, Vox headlined an article “Trump’s new fixation on using a racist name for the coronavirus is dangerous” despite having called the new sickness “the Wuhan coronavirus” themselves multiple times. The World Health Organization has also engaged in its own naming debate, finally settling on COVID-19, as well as its fair share of political hypocrisy.
Pointing out hypocrisy is a Washington sport, but in this case, the very debate in which the media, politicians, and United Nations bureaucrats now engage is wrong-headed and counterproductive.
Simply put, when Washington and New York focus on naming debates, it is usually a sign of policy confusion, frustration, and hopelessness. Rather than advance a solution, it feeds an illusion of substantive action but achieves little.
Nor is the name chosen by policy or media elites seldom the one that sticks.
Consider President Barack Obama’s fixation with ISIL for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant rather than ISIS, for the Islamic State of Iraq and al Sham. Obama feared that ISIS might be misconstrued as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and push the United States further toward direct conflict with Syria. He also warned against acknowledging the “Islamic” portion of the Islamic State, hence his embrace of the acronym. However, omitting mention of Islamic meant little to those living under the group’s flag or battling against it. Nor did the choice of acronym matter as, in reality, most everyone in the region called the group by its Arabic acronym, Daesh. However, even then, Lt. Gen. James Terry, then commander of U.S. Army Central, appeared ridiculous to most everyone in the Middle East when he urged people not to use ISIL or ISIS, but instead to choose Daesh, so as not to associate the group’s abuses with Islam.
The problem runs deeper. Janet Napolitano, Obama’s first secretary of Homeland Security, sought to re-cast terrorism as “man-caused disasters.” “I referred to ‘man-caused’ disasters,” she explained. “It demonstrates that we want to move away from the politics of fear toward a policy of being prepared for all risks that can occur.” The BBC took a similar attitude, refusing even to label those who slaughtered journalists at the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo as terrorists. The head of BBC Arabic explained, “Terrorism is such a loaded word” and too “value-laden.”
Of course, neither Napolitano’s change of phrase or the BBC’s denial changed the fact that terrorism remained a problem. If anything, the politically correct patina simply gave cover not to address the problem.
The same naming distraction also infected the Bush administration when the Pentagon wasted hundreds of man hours against the backdrop of escalating insurgency in Iraq debating whether the terrorists were “Anti-Iraqi Forces,” jihadists, terrorists, or insurgents. Debates were heated: To use the term jihadist, some in the policy community argued, was to imbue the terrorists with religious legitimacy, as if any potential terrorist looked at Washington bureaucrats to determine what was or was not Islamically permissible. Some scholars even suggested in a New York Times op-ed that to call terrorists Jihadists was to endorse their mission just as much as “if Franklin D. Roosevelt had taken to calling Adolf Hitler the ‘leader of the National Socialist Aryan patriots’ or dubbed Japanese soldiers fighting in World War II as the ‘defenders of Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere.’”
The list goes on. During the Clinton administration, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright insisted that “rogue regimes” be recast as “states of concern.” Rather than change behavior in Tehran or Pyongyang, however, Albright’s phrasing change simply distracted from the broad goal of changing the behavior of both.
Back to the Chinese virus, Wuhan disease, COVID-19, novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2. Save the debates over racism or deeper meanings of each word choice for the college seminar room, if they ever reopen. Debates over phrasing usually serve as distractions and diversions away from far more serious and substantive debates. In Iraq, for example, it did not matter what the terrorists were called; what mattered was their defeat. Ditto with the Islamic State. Name games with Iran and North Korea won’t solve the nuclear program of either.
Stupid gotcha stunts or judgmental riffs on the part of the press do more to delegitimize it or allow the administration to avoid answering tough questions on the pandemic than to address the most important decisions that must now be made which are, quite literally, matters of life and death.

Texto completo: Last Friday, Rep. Andy Levin, D-Mich., wrote a letter signed by 56 colleagues urging Donald Trump to invoke a law called the Defense Production Act in the fight against coronavirus. Passed during the Korean War in 1950, the law lets the president direct manufacturers to make supplies necessary for national security.
“It very clearly allows the president to use the same powers for a public health emergency,” Levin told me.
At a time when the coronavirus pandemic is leading to a critical shortage of tests, ventilators, respirators, ICU beds and protective gear for medical professionals, it seemed like an obvious move.
“He has the power to get what we need,” Levin said. “And this is tens and hundreds of thousands of lives at stake in real time here.”
Finally, Wednesday, Trump invoked the law, and it briefly looked as if things were going to get moving. But later that day, he tweeted that he’s holding off on actually using the powers the law gives him: “I only signed the Defense Production Act to combat the Chinese Virus should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future. Hopefully there will be no need, but we are all in this TOGETHER!”
Levin was incredulous.
“The worst-case scenario is right now,” he said, adding: “This is something that is completely beyond partisanship. It’s an all-hands-on-deck crisis.”
With the world plunged into the most terrifying emergency in living memory, some people, and not just right-wing hacks, are saying that now is not the time to talk about the malfeasance of Donald Trump.
Barack Obama’s former political guru David Axelrod, commenting on a planned Democratic ad blitz hitting Trump’s handling of the coronavirus, tweeted that “now doesn’t seem the moment for negative ads.” On Wednesday I appeared on MSNBC with Maryland’s Republican governor, Larry Hogan, who acknowledged that Trump made a grave mistake in initially downplaying the severity of the coronavirus. But, Hogan said, “We can’t waste a lot of time, you know, finger-pointing and talking about what mistakes the president made or anybody made in Washington. Let’s talk about what we can do right now.”
I understand this impulse. Those in the trenches fighting the pandemic can’t afford to waste time inveighing against presidential inadequacy. The rest of us are dealing with extraordinary personal upheaval and ever-present fear. In the four years that Donald Trump has dominated the national conversation, he’s gnawed away at the sanity of those of us who see him for what he is. In this new, even more dystopian era of coronavirus, it would be nice to be furloughed from having to think about him.
But while the calamity we are experiencing is not Trump’s doing, his dishonesty and incompetence have exacerbated it and continue to do so. To point this out is not to dwell on the past but to confront the scale of our present crisis. Trump has been giving daily televised briefings in which he overpromises and spreads misinformation. He makes bad decisions and reverses himself only under the pressure of bad press. That makes frankness about his catastrophic ineptitude imperative.
Because of Trump’s disdain for expertise and his obsession with loyalty, we entered this crisis with a government from which many competent professionals have been purged and whose political appointees tend to be lackeys and mediocrities.
As has been widely reported, Trump’s administration dissolved the National Security Council’s global health security office, which was responsible for planning for disease outbreaks.
“Some of the people we cut, they haven’t been used for many, many years, and if we ever need them we can get them very quickly and rather than spending the money,” he said at a briefing last month.
On Thursday The Times reported that Trump’s own Department of Health and Human Services ran a series of simulations last year about a pandemic respiratory virus originating in China that ultimately infected 110 million Americans. The exercise “drove home just how underfunded, underprepared and uncoordinated the federal government would be for a life-or-death battle with a virus for which no treatment existed.” Yet there’s little evidence of a serious push to increase America’s readiness.
When this coronavirus emerged in China, Trump’s instinct was to treat it as a public relations problem, insisting repeatedly that it would “go away.” South Korea and the United States announced their first coronavirus cases at around the same time; while South Korea ramped up the production of tests, the United States dithered. As Reuters reported, South Korea, a country of around 51 million, has tested 290,000 people. In the United States, a country of 330 million, only 60,000 tests had been conducted as of Tuesday.
Trump’s decision to ban some travel from Europe might have made sense, but the mistake-ridden Oval Office address announcing the move caused mass panic among Americans abroad. No one made adequate preparations to get hordes of travelers returning from coronavirus hot zones through security quickly, leading to crowds of people waiting as long as seven hours at some airports, a situation that seemed bound to spread infections.
Steven Teles is a senior fellow at the Niskanen Center and a political science professor at Johns Hopkins, where he teaches a class on policy disasters. He points out that most government decisions never reach the president’s desk, but that people in the bureaucracy tend to respond to the president’s priorities.
“What an executive can do is to inject energy and a general sense of direction to people who are going to make decisions without them pushing them all the way up the chain of command,” Teles told me. He suspects that when books are finally written about this debacle, a big part of the story will be that much of “the government didn’t get sufficiently energized early enough because there wasn’t a signal from the top.”
There still isn’t. Trump spent his news conference Thursday attacking the media and putting the onus on governors to acquire medical supplies.
“The federal government’s not supposed to be out there buying vast amounts of items and then shipping, you know, we’re not a shipping clerk,” he said.
He also touted an anti-malarial drug, chloroquine, saying that it “was approved very, very quickly, and it’s now approved by prescription.” In fact, the Food and Drug Administration has not approved chloroquine for treating COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. Though doctors can prescribe it off label, it’s not yet established that the drug works for this purpose.
It can become tedious to dwell on the fact that the president is a dangerous and ignorant narcissist who has utterly failed as an executive, leaving state governments on their own to confront a generational cataclysm. But no one should ever forget it.
Soon, even if the pandemic is still raging, there will be an election, and the public will be asked to render a verdict on Trump’s leadership. Being clear that people are suffering and dying needlessly because the president can’t do his job isn’t looking backward. It’s the only way to move forward.

Texto completo: html> Screw this virus. Screw this virus that is already ravaging families, burying people in the hard isolation of the same four walls, leaving waitresses in anguish about how they’re going to pay the rent. If you don’t have a little hate in your heart toward this thing, you probably aren’t motivated enough.
While we’re at it, screw certainty. Over the past few weeks I’ve been bingeing on commentary from people predicting how long this is going to last and how bad it’s going to be. The authors seem really smart and their data sets seem really terrible.
I’m beginning to appreciate the wisdom that cancer patients share: We just can’t know. Don’t expect life to be predictable or fair. Don’t try to tame the situation with some feel-good lie or confident prediction. Embrace the uncertainty of this whole life-or-death deal.
There’s a weird clarity that comes with that embrace. There is a humility that comes with realizing you’re not the glorious plans you made for your life. When the plans are upset, there’s a quieter and better you beneath them.
We’re seeing the world with plague eyes now. We’re all going through the same experiences. People in Seoul, Milan and New Jersey are connected by a virus that reminds us of the fundamental fact of human interdependence.
Most of us are self-distancing at the same time. Most of us are experiencing the same pause in normal life, undergoing deeper reflections inspired by that pause, experiencing the same anxieties and fears, reading the same memes. So many human universals.
The great paradox, of course, is that we had to be set apart in order to feel together. I’ve been writing about the social fabric for years now, but you really see it only after you’ve lost it.
It’s like when you’re starving, and food is all you can think about. Suddenly everybody has human connection on the top of mind.
All the little acts of social contact we took for granted now seem like candy. I miss choruses and sports bars, the weird way we all used to stare straight ahead in crowded elevators.
Judging from my social network, the absence of social connection is making everybody more ardent for it. People are geniuses at finding ways to touch each other even when they can’t. On Twitter I saw a picture of a house where an older lady was self-isolating. Two neighborhood kids put on a cello concert on her front porch. Have you noticed that music and art are already filling the emotional gaps left by the absence of direct human contact?
Through plague eyes I realize there’s an important distinction between social connection and social solidarity. Social connection means feeling empathetic toward others and being kind to them. That’s fine in normal times.
Social solidarity is more tenacious. It’s an active commitment to the common good — the kind of thing needed in times like now.
This concept of solidarity grows out of Catholic social teaching. It starts with a belief in the infinite dignity of each human person but sees people embedded in webs of mutual obligation — to one another and to all creation. It celebrates the individual and the whole together, and to the nth degree.
Solidarity is not a feeling; it’s an active virtue. It is out of solidarity, and not normal utilitarian logic, that George Marshall in “Saving Private Ryan” endangered a dozen lives to save just one. It’s solidarity that causes a Marine to risk his life dragging the body of his dead comrade from battle to be returned home. It’s out of solidarity that health care workers stay on their feet amid terror and fatigue. Some things you do not for yourself or another but for the common whole.
It will require a tenacious solidarity from all of us to endure the months ahead. We’ll be stir-crazy, bored, desperate for normal human contact. But we’ll have to stay home for the common good. It’s an odd kind of heroism this crisis calls for. Those also serve who endure and wait.
I wonder if there will be an enduring shift in consciousness after all this. All those tribal us-them stories don’t seem quite as germane right now. The most relevant unit of society at the moment is the entire human family.
All those burn-it-down/destroy-the-system/anti-establishment tirades ring a little hollow, too. It’s not the angry outsiders who are protecting us right now, it’s the Establishment.
The whole culture of autonomy seems immature, too: I’m free to be myself! The people who are out there doing their own thing are at Spring Break threatening the lives of the most vulnerable around them.
We’ll need a great reset when this is all over. We need to start planning a great social festival and ask the obvious questions: Why did we tolerate so much social division before? Why didn’t we cultivate stronger social bonds when we had the chance?
In the meantime, as someone on my Twitter feed observed: Airport rules apply. If you want a beer at 9 a.m., go for it.

Paul Krugman: Three rules for the Trump pandemic

Texto completo: So Donald Trump is now calling COVID-19 the “Chinese virus.” Of course he is: Racism and blaming other people for his own failures are the defining features of his presidency. But if we’re going to give it a nickname, much better to refer to it as the “Trump pandemic.”
True, the virus didn’t originate here. But the U.S. response to the threat has been catastrophically slow and inadequate, and the buck stops with Trump, who minimized the threat and discouraged action until just a few days ago.
Compare, for example, America’s handling of the coronavirus with that of South Korea. Both countries reported their first case on Jan. 20. But Korea moved quickly to implement widespread testing; it has used the data from that testing to guide social distancing and other containment measures; and the disease appears to be on the wane there.
In the U.S., by contrast, testing has barely begun — we’ve tested only 60,000 people compared with South Korea’s 290,000, even though we have six times its population, and the number of cases here appears to be skyrocketing.
The details of our failure are complex, but they all flow ultimately from Trump’s minimization of the threat: He was asserting that COVID-19 was no worse than the flu just last week (although true to form, he’s now claiming to have known all along that a pandemic was coming).
Why did Trump and his team deny and delay? All the evidence suggests that he didn’t want to do or say anything that might drive down stock prices, which he seems to regard as the key measure of his success. That’s presumably why as late as Feb. 25 Larry Kudlow, the administration’s chief economist, declared that the U.S. had “contained” the coronavirus, and that the economy was “holding up nicely.”
Well, that was a bad bet. Since then, the stock market has more or less given up all its gains under the Trump presidency. More important, the economy is clearly in free-fall. So what should we do now?
I’ll leave health policy to the experts. On economic policy, I’d suggest three principles. First, focus on hardship, not GDP. Second, stop worrying about incentives to work. Third, don’t trust Trump.
On the first point: Many of the job losses we’ll experience over the next few months will be not just unavoidable but actually desirable. We want workers who are or might be sick to stay home, to “flatten the curve” of the virus’ spread. We want to partly or wholly close large business establishments, like auto plants, that could act as human petri dishes. We want to close restaurants, bars and nonessential retail establishments.
Now, there will surely be additional, unnecessary job losses caused by a plunge in consumer and business spending, which is why we should be engaged in substantial overall stimulus. But policy can’t and shouldn’t prevent widespread temporary job loss.
What policy can do is reduce the hardship facing those who are temporarily out of work. That means that we need to spend much more on programs like paid sick leave, unemployment benefits, food stamps and Medicaid that aid Americans in distress, who need far more help than they’ll get from an across-the-board cash drop. This spending would also provide stimulus, but that’s a secondary concern.
Which brings me to my second point. The usual suspects are already objecting that helping Americans in need reduces their incentive to work. That’s a lousy argument even in good times, but it’s absurd in the face of a pandemic. And state governments that have been trying, with encouragement from the Trump administration, to reduce public assistance by imposing work requirements should suspend all such requirements, immediately.
Finally, about Trump: Over the past few days state TV, I mean Fox News, and right-wing pundits have abruptly pivoted from dismissing COVID-19 as a liberal hoax to demanding an end to all criticism of the president in a time of national emergency. This should come as no surprise.
But this is where the history of the Trump pandemic — all those wasted weeks when we did nothing because Donald Trump didn’t want to hear anything that might hurt him politically — becomes relevant. It shows that even when American lives are at risk, this administration’s policy is all about Trump, about what he thinks will make him look good, never mind the national interest.
What this means is that as Congress allocates money to reduce the economic pain from COVID-19, it shouldn’t give Trump any discretion over how the money is spent. For example, while it may be necessary to provide funds for some business bailouts, Congress must specify the rules for who gets those funds and under what conditions. Otherwise you know what will happen: Trump will abuse any discretion to reward his friends and punish his enemies. That’s just who he is.
Dealing with the coronavirus would be hard in the best of circumstances. It will be especially hard when we know that we can’t trust either the judgment or the motives of the man who should be leading the response. But you go into a pandemic with the president you have, not the president you wish you had.

Bruni: Why COVID-19 is so much worse than 9/11

Texto completo: After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, we were exhorted to defiance. I remember it well.
Don’t let the terrorists win, we were told. Don’t let them steal your joys or disrupt your routines — at least not too much. Be wary, yes, and be patient with extra-long security lines where they didn’t previously exist. If you see something, say something. But otherwise, resume normal life. Venture out. Revel.
“Get down to Disneyworld,” President George W. Bush said.
Disneyworld is now closed.
The specter of the coronavirus is utterly different from prior moments of national panic or devastation. I keep hearing comparisons to Sept. 11 in particular, and I understand why: The terror now is similar to the terror then, a wicked weave of vulnerability, helplessness and the inability to guess what’s next.
But there’s something crueler at work this time around, a psychological contradiction and emotional oxymoron that are peculiar to a pandemic.
At the very moment when many of us hunger most for the reassurance of company and the solace of community, we’re hustled into isolation. At the very moment when we most desperately crave distraction, many of our favorite means of release are off-limits.
It’s not just concerts and sporting events that are verboten or canceled. It’s not just restaurant meals, birthday parties, wedding receptions, bar mitzvahs. It’s not just action flicks at the multiplex, which can no longer fling superheroes at us when superheroes are just what we need.
To follow President Donald Trump’s latest, newly responsible counsel is to avoid any gathering of more than 10 people. That rules out, say, a children’s soccer match. That forbids church. Americans who pray are no doubt doing that more and harder than ever, but not among the stained-glass symbols of God, in the comforting clutch of friends and neighbors, with the balm of a pastor, rabbi or imam close at hand.
No, we’re advised or, depending on the ZIP code, commanded to worship like we dine and do all else at this juncture — alone, or as close to alone as we can manage. It’s called social distancing, and if an odder, uglier phase has ever been coined, I can’t think of it.
“Social distancing” is another oxymoron, because how is distancing ever social? To pull together, we must stay apart. It’s an epidemiological necessity. It’s also a kick in the gut.
I’m writing this on St. Patrick’s Day in New York City, but there’s no parade, and on streets proudly teeming with Irish pubs, not one is open.
Pubs, restaurants: After hurricanes, as we sift through the wreckage and commence the repairs, we’re typically encouraged to flock to them, both to bolster local businesses and reclaim a sense of normalcy.
But normalcy is the enemy in this pandemic. We have to behave abnormally to reach the far side of it. As my New York Times colleague Michelle Goldberg recently wrote, “This mass withdrawal is like social chemotherapy, damaging the fabric of our communal life while trying to save it.”
On Monday I spotted a friend on the street, and we walked hurriedly toward each other, propelled by the human instinct for connection. About 4 feet from her, I abruptly stopped, the siren of science suddenly blaring in my head. But she kept advancing, and I was paralyzed: Dare I correct and possibly sadden someone whose error was possibly a sign of how sad she already was?
I did step slightly backward, and she seemed to register that, ending up maybe 2½ feet away: still too close, but less close than she might otherwise have been. We silently established some physical truce there. The etiquette of this pandemic is unwritten, and it’s brutal.
In the wake of Sept. 11, many of us sought to counter the economic toll by patronizing the kinds of businesses in New York and Washington that were most affected. That’s tougher with this pandemic. The most affected business are the ones that are shuttered, and our interactions with them can’t be transferred entirely to the virtual realm, though I’m consoled somewhat to see movements to purchase gift cards redeemable for restaurant meals, movie tickets and such at some future, post-pandemic point.
There will be such a point, right? We’ve been given no timeline, and that’s another special challenge of this crisis. It’s rolling rather than fixed, diffuse instead of discrete. It resists the drawing of any parameters around it. We have no idea what will ultimately be asked of us, so we can’t know what new emotional muscles to build, how strong they must be and what pace to take.
I’m beyond grateful for the internet and the ingenuity with which people are using it — for yoga classes held via Zoom web conferencing, for FaceTime cocktails, for free classes, musical performances and museum tours that civic-minded, generous individuals and organizations are presenting online.
But none of these replace flesh-and-blood camaraderie, and I suspect they’ll become less and less satisfying as the lockdown on group activities grinds on.
“Staying home,” “working from home” and “holing up” have sweet, nurturing rings when they’re voluntary and exceptional. But when the seclusion is compulsory and spans an unspecified progression of days, it’s a lonely, claustrophobic and crazy-making condition. It’s not heaven but hell.
Besides, we have many homes, and we’re now cut off from some of them. College students have been evicted from campus buildings that were perhaps their safest and most treasured spaces. Workers have been barred from offices where they toiled, yes, but could also lift their heads, raise their voices and have a conversation — a face-to-face chat — whenever they needed that nourishment.
The pandemic is asking us to dig deep and stand strong as it takes away some of the most essential tools for doing so. If I were in the mood for jokes, I’d call that a Catch-COVID-19.
But jokes don’t fly right now. And in my eerily languid, palpably tense Manhattan neighborhood, it has been a few days since I heard the music of human laughter.

Texto completo: The albatross hanging from every arts reporter' neck is the stack of untouched books sitting on their desk, on a shelf, or shamefully hidden away in the closet farthest from them. Sent in from authors, agents and publishers it is the combined weight of all these unwritten about books that (I assume) will one day drag my soul to the depth of the River Styx.
I'm not saying it's a silver lining, far from it, but with the coronavirus forcing most events to shut down or cancel, we are all now going to have a lot more time on our hands for literary pursuits. With no upcoming festivals or performances to profile, now is the perfect time to let readers know what is on the reading agenda for the next week, or month or longer interval before society as we know it returns to some semblance of normalcy.
Some of these books I've read most or all of, others I haven't read at all. But none of them have been covered in depth by the Press-Citizen heretofore.
'Afterlife' by Julia Alvarez Genre: Fiction
Length: ~250 pages
From the author of "In the Time of Butterflies" is a new novel for adults. "Afterlife" is a novel about immigrant and English teacher Antonia Vega who is hit with a trio of problems at once. Her husband dies, her sister goes missing and an undocumented and pregnant teenager appears at her doorstep.
This is the kind of book I'd love to cover, but Alvarez's scheduled tour dates and tours sent with the book will not bring her through Iowa City. The book, a roughly 250-page affair, is scheduled for release on April 7, 2020.
'All the Flowers in Paris' by Sarah Jio Genre: Fiction
Length: ~ 300 pages
A novel that switches between a pair of perspectives, one of which is Caroline, who wakes up with no memory in a Paris hospital in 2009. The other is Celine, a woman in Nazi-occupied Paris in 1943. The story follows both women as they try to make sense of their respective situations: Caroline who gradually pieces together who she is and Celine who needs to try to
Not necessarily the kind of book I myself would be on the edge of my seat to read, but I can think of a half dozen friends I'd recommend this to by description alone. Plus, an aspect of Caroline's character is discovering she's had a "reclusive life in a sprawling apartment on the rue Cler," which — at this moment —sounds like the exact situation I'd like to be living in (at least for the next few weeks).
'An American Bum in China' by Tom Carter Genre: Biography
Length: ~125 pages
A brief biography following five years with Muscatine native Matthew Evans as he finds himself in China in 2014 as the Hong Kong protests were just beginning. Evans' tale is told by Tom Carter who previously published "Unsavory Elements: Stories of Foreigners on the Loose in China."
Initially, I'd planned to run a review of the book back in December that didn't end up finding its way to print. It was a topical read at the time with the Hong Kong protests in the news cycle and — while Hong Kong hasn't been the focus of recent coverage — China's arguably in the news cycle even more now than it was then.
'Bedlam' by Kenneth Paul Rosenberg, MD Genre: Nonfiction
Length: ~200 pages
The full title of the text is "Bedlam: An Intimate Journey Into America's Mental Health Crisis." Rosenberg's book is intended to give readers an inside look at the American mental health system and its failings. After seven years of interviews, the book uses those accounts to shine a light on the criminalization of individuals with mental health issues among other topics.
This book and the author behind it are the exact kinds of things I love to cover. When it was first delivered to our office I showed it to everyone in the newsroom. The only reason why it's not pending on my personal reading list is I'm not sure I have the emotional fortitude to read about institutional, systemic failure, especially at this particular moment.
'Bloody Genius' by John Sanford Genre: Mystery
Length: ~375 pages
This is the most recent Virgil Flowers novel from New York Times bestselling author John Sanford, marking the 12th novel in a series that started in 2007 with "Dark of the Moon." In this particular book, a culture war on a state campus between the science and medical departments is interrupted when a scholar turns up dead. Enter the series investigator Virgil Flowers, tasked with finding the killer.
While this title was briefly alluded to in my write-up on the 2019 Iowa City Book Festival, it didn't end up receiving full coverage, even though Sanford is a Cedar Rapids native and University of Iowa grad. This fell by the wayside for me at the time partly because of my own ignorance of Sanford being a local name and the sheer volume of events surrounding the book festival.
'Deacon King Kong' by James McBride Genre: Historical Fiction
Length: ~375 pages
Set in September of 1969, "Deacon King Kong" starts with the deacon of Five Ends Baptist Church shooting a 19-year-old-drug dealer in the face in South Brooklyn. The release that came with the book touts it as being infused with "humor and compassion" as it explores the lives of the fictional characters around this incident.
I've had a copy of this book so long and I've wanted to read it so bad! As if to taunt me Penguin Random House sent me a second copy which I also have not read.
I'm positive I'll get around to this once I work through my personal pending backlog of unread books, but like Entertainment Weekly and The New York Times, this book is high on my to-read list and can make it to yours too since it was released on March 3.
'The Dearly Beloved' by Cara Wall Genre: Fiction
Length: ~350 pages
The story of this novel spent 15 years coming into focus for its author, Iowa Writers' Workshop graduate Cara Wall, who first conceived of the novel during her 2004 pregnancy. The book focuses on a pair of couples, each of which includes an individual drawn to the Christian faith and another who is skeptical of it.
This is another novel I had planned to write a review of. First, before it's Aug. 13, 2019 publication and then before Wall's Sept. 23 visit to Prairie Lights. Though outside my general area of interest, it's one I feel strangely drawn to and would like to pick up and finish someday.
'Everywhere You Don't Belong' by Gabriel Bump Genre: Fiction
Length: ~250 pages
This is the first novel from the Chicago originating author Gabriel Bump, an experience explored in this novel through the character of Claude McKay, a young black man growing up on the South Side.
This is another book on my personal reading list and comes recommended by numerous other publications. it represents yet another instance of not enough local connections for me to cover.
'Hey Grandude!' by Paul McCartney, Illustrated by Kathryn Durst Genre: Picture Book
Length: ~ 30 pages
I think there are only two reasons I haven't read or reviewed this book: First, world-renowned singer/songwriter Paul McCartney has not had a book tour through Iowa City promoting it. Second, I don't know that I could justify a picture book review to my editor as the 4- to 6-year-old age range does not make up a huge amount of our readership.
But now I can, so here's my one-paragraph review:
As a book about a bunch of kids stuck inside who turn to their grandude to entertain them, I think this book will resonate with kids in this very specific moment in time. While the plot is somewhat aimless, it's a fun read with pretty illustrations that takes its characters to the beach, to the American West and to the mountainside. All through the aid of a magic compass.
'The Mountains Sing' by Nguyen Phan Que Mail Genre: Historical Fiction
Length: ~350 pages
The 11th book from Nguyen Phan Que Mai, "The Mountains Sing" follow the Tran family as they navigate their way through a Vietnam wrapped in War. The most recent addition to my ever-growing work shelf of unread books, "The Mountains Sing" will have been published just before this article runs. I have never read this book, but, for what it's worth, it comes with my highest recommendation.
'One Night At the Lake' by Bethany Chase Genre: Fiction
Length: ~275 pages
The jacket description of this book pitches two straight forward premises. The first: Leah has been dating Ollie for four years and, upon being invited to his family's lake house, she suspects he's going to propose. The second: June is visiting her fiance's Ollie's lake house, "a house haunted by long-buried memories of her lost friend" Leah.
If this wasn't the first novel that hit my desk after I started at the P-C last year, it's one of the first. But I'd completely forgotten about it until I started putting this list together. It's not usually the kind of thing I'd go for, but if the description appeals to you, it strikes me as the kind of book that would be a pleasant distraction during turbulent times.
'Pitty the Reader' by Kurt Vonnegut and Suzanne McConnel Genre: Nonfiction
Length: ~375 pages
Half of this book's authorship is renowned author Kurt Vonnegut, the other half is Suzanne McConnell who was a student of Vonnegut's at the Iowa Writers' Workshop. The latter has collected everything she can about what Vonnegut as a teacher regarding the craft of writing.
I seem to have a problem with not reading books by Kurt Vonnegut. I've been told I'd love "Slaughterhouse-Five," which has nonetheless been gathering dust on my personal shelf for ages. Of all the books on my P-C shelf though, this is maybe the one I was most hoping to read most of all, and was only reminded of as I started to put together this list.
'Real Life' by Brandon Taylor Genre: Fiction
Length: ~325 pages
This is a story about an Alabama-born protagonist, Wallace, and his navigating of his sexuality and self-preservation while at a Midwestern university. Author Brandon Taylor is a staff writer Literary Hub and a graduate of the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop. He read from this book at Prairie Lights in February.
Sometimes I like to imagine alternate realities. While putting this article together, I wonder if the version of me that's read all these books is a happier person. I feel like he is. I feel like he's somehow more attractive too. Yet, despite being interested and having months of notice, I slept on this book and ended up not writing any local coverage.
If you're interested in reading, this is your chance to not be like this realities me. Be like alternate-universe, happy/handsome me.
'These Boys and Their Fathers' by Don Waters Genre: Memoir
Length: ~250 pages
A 2010 mission self-set by author Don Waters was "to write a magazine story about a surfing icon who had known his absentee father"." That resulted in the investigative and introspective memoir we have today.
The book was published by the University of Iowa Press last year and Waters was another attendee of the Iowa City Book Festival who went uncovered by the P-C. From the very little I've read, the books seems to be in a similar vein as "The Glass Castle" by Jeannette Walls.
'Time After Time' by Lisa Grunwald Genre: Fiction
Length: ~400 pages
The release for this one pitches this love story as a fusion of "The Time Traveler's Wife" and "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button." Joe is a railroad man and Nora is an aspiring artist who discover's she is stuck, in a very real sense, in Grand Central Terminal by a force she doesn't understand. The narrative charts the relationship between the two over roughly a decade.
God, I love the cover and title of this book. Yet another example of a text I'm not particularly inclined toward that I can't help but want to read whenever it catches my eye. Once again we see a character who is stuck in a place and, maybe it's just because of the time and place we're all currently stuck in, but that resonates.
'Surfside Sisters' by Nancy Thayer Genre: Fiction
Length: ~300 pages
Protagonist Keely Green grew up in Nantucket with her best friend, Isabelle, with dreams of becoming a novelist. Years later she's achieved those dreams and is living the glamorous big city life of a successful New York novelist. Her dream life is interrupted by the one-two punch of her editor passing on her novel and her mom's health declining, forcing her to return to Nantucket to things she thought she'd put behind her.
Technically I have two Nancy Thayer books on my desk. (This and "Let It Snow" a Christmas themed novel.) But coverage for one of them felt like enough for our purposes here. I don't know much about Thayer, but going through the press releases included with her work here I've discovered she's famous for capturing the "natural beauty" of Nantucket. So for those of you stuck inside and wishing you were somehow in Nantucket, Thay surely has a book for you.
'When You Learn the Alphabet' by Kendra Allen Genre: Nonfiction
Length: ~150 pages
A book of essays focusing on the parental relationships of author Kendra Allen, this shortish book touches on a wide array of topics. Marriage, race, mental health and feminism are just a few of the themes interwoven throughout the book.
Like "Bloody Genius" this is one I didn't get a chance to cover in full because of the local event relating to it being positioned during the local literary festival. That said I've only heard good things and if someone demanded why I hadn't read this yet I would probably mutter something about "having a lot on my plate" and then failing to go to sleep because I'm questioning internally why I haven't read this book.
"Hey Grandude!" by Paul McCartney.

Texto completo: Mohegan Sun Pocono Racing Operations is working with the Pennsylvania Harness Horsemen’s Association and the Pennsylvania Department of Health following the death of harness racing trainer Carmine Fusco, the casino’s President and General Manager Tony Carlucci said Thursday.
Fusco, 55, died Wednesday and is the first Pennsylvania resident to die as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. He trained horses that competed at several tracks in the region, including the Downs at Mohegan Sun Pocono. He had two horses racing at Pocono as recently as March 9.
“Our deepest condolences are with this family that has endured so much, as well as with friends and the horse-racing community of which this gentleman excelled,” Carlucci said in a statement.
Like all Pennsylvania casinos, Mohegan Sun Pocono is temporarily closed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
Carlucci said Mohegan Sun Pocono officials are communicating with the department of health on further precautionary actions and for guidance on informing racing team members that may have worked in the paddock area.
Nate Wardle, press secretary from the Pennsylvania Department of Health, said the department is not providing information on individual cases.
For businesses in which there may have been exposures or potential concerns, Wardle said, “We have been and will continue to work with them to ensure that precautions are taken to protect individuals.”
His advice to everyone who thinks they might have been in contact with someone who is a confirmed coronavirus case is to “stay home as much as possible.”
Fusco was one of four people in his family to die from the virus.
According to the New York Times, his mother, Grace Fusco, 73, from Freehold, New Jersey, died Wednesday night without knowing that her two oldest children had died before her.
Her daughter, Rita Fusco-Jackson, also 55, a religious education teacher from Freehold, New Jersey, died Friday.
NJ.com reported Thursday that Vincent Fusco, the fourth person from the same New Jersey family, died Thursday at CentraState Medical Center in Freehold.
More than 20 Fusco relatives are quarantined in their homes. According to the New York Times, health officials are exploring what may have made the virus so deadly to the family.

Texto completo: FREEHOLD TOWNSHIP, N. J. – A gathering of an old-school Italian-Catholic family from Freehold Township became the epicenter for a New Jersey cluster of the novel coronavirus that has now killed four family members and left several others hospitalized.
Rita Fusco-Jackson, 56, was the first in the family to succumb to the virus March 13 after being treated at a local hospital. Her brother Carmine Fusco, 55, died in a Pennsylvania hospital on Wednesday, just hours before the death of the family's matriarch, 73-year-old Grace Fusco, said Monsignor Sam Sirianni, the pastor of the Co-Cathedral of St. Robert Bellarmine, the family's church.
A fourth member of the family succumbed Thursday, 53-year-old Vincent Fusco of Manalapan, Sirianni said. He also had been hospitalized. Vincent Fusco was the fourth-oldest of the family's 11 children.
Three of Grace Fusco's other children remain hospitalized with the coronavirus, two of them in critical condition, The New York Times reported Wednesday, citing a family spokesperson. Nearly 20 relatives are in quarantine.
Sirianni said his Freehold parishioners are feeling a complicated grief — shock and sorrow over the sudden deaths in the Fusco family mixed with fear that the coronavirus has arrived with such devastating consequences so close to home.
“I think it’s complex," he said. "It’s sadness because a lot of people knew her. There’s also fear because it kind of brings into the heart of our parish the reality that someone we know, care about, worked with, prayed with, caught the virus and died because of it. ”
One of the Grace Fusco’s sons was friends with John Brennan, a 69-year-old horse trainer from Bergen County who became the first person in the state to die of COVID-19 last week. State health officials have said Brennan was friends with someone who attended a Fusco family gathering.
Officials have said that several family members who were at the gathering became ill with the virus.
The family was heavily involved in horse racing at the nearby Freehold Raceway. The raceway, which has now temporarily closed, reported last week that someone who had been in contact with a positive COVID-19 case attended the track March 7.
The family often drew together at Grace Fusco's Freehold Township home for "dinner at grandma's," Sirianni said. The family relative told the New York Times that the gathering that spread the virus was a typical Tuesday dinner.
Fusco-Jackson was a religious education teacher at St. Robert Bellarmine, teaching in the confirmation program. She attended a Feb. 29 church retreat, serving as a teacher volunteer and hall monitor. Her contact with retreat participants was minimal, the church said in a Facebook post.
Grace Fusco, her late husband and the couple's 11 children were all original members of St. Robert Bellarmine when it opened in 1973. Even after the children were grown and started families of their own, when they attended Mass they flocked around their mother at the same pew, about four or five rows up on a side aisle.
"You have to say that they were an Italian-Catholic family. They lived that," Sirianni said. "They carried themselves with a dignity that was rooted in hard work. "
Grace Fusco worked at a rehabilitation and nursing home before she retired. In her younger years, she brought Holy Communion to the sick and worked occasionally as a minister of Holy Communion. She was reserved, Sirianni said, but it was clear that she took great pride in her family.
"She was a true matriarch," he said.
In addition to teaching, Fusco-Jackson sang in the choir and formerly worked as a wedding coordinator, helping brides to "stay calm and breathe" before they walked down the aisle, Sirriani said.
He was told of her death March 13 by a family member, who also reported that Grace and two of her sons were in the hospital and were being tested for COVID-19.
“That was like a shock," he said. "You read it in the paper, see it on the news and then find that it’s right in your parish. ”
Asked about media reports on the Fusco family, state health officials said Thursday that they couldn’t discuss specifics about any particular “family cluster,” but state epidemiologist Christina Tan said “intense interactions” and “prolonged contact” can increase the likelihood of the virus spreading through families. The severity of the disease depends on factors like age and underlying health conditions, she said.
Officials stressed that people with the virus who are isolating at home should not interact with other family members and should have their own room when possible.
David Cennimo, an infectious disease expert at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, said models from China have estimated that up to three-quarters of COVID-19 cases are related to the virus spreading in families or among others who share close contact with people who are sick. That's because the virus is believed to spread through droplets from sick people, not through the air, Cennimo said.
"Your risk of being in contact with a respiratory droplet of someone (either directly or touching a contaminated surface) increases significantly as you share more close proximal space," he said in an email. "I believe this is why we are seeing 'the virus rip through' some groups. "
The family cluster likely led an aerospace manufacturing company in Wall to close down as a precaution. An employee of Safran Aerosystems Evacuation told the company that her mother died of the coronavirus March 13 — the same day Gov. Phil Murphy announced Fusco-Jackson was New Jersey's second death.
The Fuscos were among the first in New Jersey to bare the brunt of the growing coronavirus pandemic. The virus has killed nine people and sickened 742 statewide as of Thursday, officials said.
Monmouth County has so far seen 43 COVID-19 cases. The county's three deaths thus far are the Fuscos.
Because the family had so many children, a whole generation of people who grew up Freehold were "in class with a Fusco," Sirianni said. For those that knew them, the daily disruption brought on by the virus has been compounded by personal grief and deep anxiety.
He said the church has been directing members with questions about exposure to local health officials, who have been investigating the cases. The Freehold Health Department did not return calls seeking comment.
The church has been cleaned and the parish is posting prayer videos on its Facebook page.
Mass on Sunday will be live-streamed on Facebook Live. With relatives quarantined and restrictions on public gatherings extending to funeral services, Sirianni said he doesn't know how the family will lay to rest the four who died.
"It's hard for a lot of our people," Sirianni said. "I'm trying hard to call them away from fear and to hold onto hope. "

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO - Amazon quietly banned Adolf Hitler's manifesto "Mein Kampf" late last week, part of its accelerating efforts to remove Nazi and other hate-filled material from its bookstore, before quickly reversing itself.
The retailer, which controls the majority of the book market in the United States, is caught between two demands that cannot be reconciled. Amazon is under pressure to keep hate literature off its platform at a moment when extremist impulses seem on the rise. But the company does not want to be seen as the arbiter of what people are allowed to read, which is traditionally the hallmark of repressive regimes.
Booksellers that sell on Amazon say the retailer has no coherent philosophy about what it decides to prohibit, and seems largely guided by public complaints. Over the last 18 months, it has dropped books by Nazis, the Nation of Islam and American neo-Nazis David Duke and George Lincoln Rockwell.
But it has also allowed many equally offensive books to continue to be sold.
An Amazon spokeswoman said in a statement Tuesday that the platform provides "customers with access to a variety of viewpoints" and noted "all retailers make decisions about what selection they choose to offer."
"Mein Kampf" was first issued in Germany in 1925 and is the foundational text of Nazism. The Houghton Mifflin edition of "Mein Kampf," continuously available in the United States since 1943, was dropped by Amazon on March 13.
"We cannot offer this book for sale," the retailer told booksellers that had been selling the title, according to emails reviewed by The New York Times.
After disappearing for a few days, "Mein Kampf" is again being sold directly by Amazon. But secondhand copies and those from third-party merchants appear to be still prohibited, a distinction that sellers said made no sense.
But on Amazon's subsidiary AbeBooks, which operates largely independently, there are hundreds of new and used copies of "Mein Kampf" available.
"It's ridiculous how the greatest e-commerce company in the world has such lousy control of their platforms," said Scott Brown, a California bookseller who sells on Amazon. "They somehow can't prevent price gouging, and they can't prevent people from selling counterfeit goods, and they can't manage to - or don't want to - effectively implement a Nazi ban."
Amazon also prohibited last week all editions of "The International Jew," the anti-Semitic propaganda published by automaker Henry Ford in the early 1920s, as well as editions of "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion," the fabrication from the early 20th century describing a plan for Jewish domination.
Karen Pollock of Holocaust Educational Trust, a group that works with students, school and communities in Britain, said Amazon should go further. She welcomed the dropping of "Mein Kampf" but tweeted that "surely @AmazonUK should also remove books by Himmler, Goebbels and Rosenberg too?"

Texto completo: A gathering of an old-school Italian-Catholic family from Freehold Township became the epicenter for a local cluster of the novel coranvirus that has now killed four family members and left several others hospitalized.
Rita Fusco-Jackson, 56, was the first in the family to succumb to the virus Friday after being treated at CentraState Medical Center in Freehold Township. Her brother Carmine Fusco, 55, died in a Pennsylvania hospital on Wednesday, just hours before the death of the family's matriarch, 73-year-old Grace Fusco at CentraState, said Monsignor Sam Sirianni, the pastor of the Co-Cathedral of St. Robert Bellarmine, the family's church.

The retailer, which controls the majority of the book market in the United States, is caught between two demands that cannot be reconciled. Amazon is under pressure to keep hate literature off its platform at a moment when extremist impulses seem on the rise. But the company does not want to be seen as the arbiter of what people are allowed to read, which is traditionally the hallmark of repressive regimes.
Booksellers that sell on Amazon say the retailer has no coherent philosophy about what it decides to prohibit, and seems largely guided by public complaints. Over the last 18 months, it has dropped books by Nazis, the Nation of Islam and American neo-Nazis David Duke and George Lincoln Rockwell.
But it has also allowed many equally offensive books to continue to be sold.
An Amazon spokeswoman said in a statement Tuesday that the platform provides "customers with access to a variety of viewpoints" and noted "all retailers make decisions about what selection they choose to offer."
"Mein Kampf" was first issued in Germany in 1925 and is the foundational text of Nazism. The Houghton Mifflin edition of "Mein Kampf," continuously available in the United States since 1943, was dropped by Amazon on March 13.
"We cannot offer this book for sale," the retailer told booksellers that had been selling the title, according to emails reviewed by The New York Times.
After disappearing for a few days, "Mein Kampf" is again being sold directly by Amazon. But secondhand copies and those from third-party merchants appear to be still prohibited, a distinction that sellers said made no sense.
But on Amazon's subsidiary AbeBooks, which operates largely independently, there are hundreds of new and used copies of "Mein Kampf" available.
"It's ridiculous how the greatest e-commerce company in the world has such lousy control of their platforms," said Scott Brown, a California bookseller who sells on Amazon. "They somehow can't prevent price gouging, and they can't prevent people from selling counterfeit goods, and they can't manage to - or don't want to - effectively implement a Nazi ban."
Amazon also prohibited last week all editions of "The International Jew," the anti-Semitic propaganda published by automaker Henry Ford in the early 1920s, as well as editions of "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion," the fabrication from the early 20th century describing a plan for Jewish domination.
Karen Pollock of Holocaust Educational Trust, a group that works with students, school and communities in Britain, said Amazon should go further. She welcomed the dropping of "Mein Kampf" but tweeted that "surely @AmazonUK should also remove books by Himmler, Goebbels and Rosenberg too?"

Texto completo: The Fusco family, an enormous and tight-knit clan torn by grief after four members succumbed to the pandemic coronavirus, is praying now for relatives still hospitalized with the illness, two of whom are in critical condition.
The patients are all children of Grace Fusco of Freehold, New Jersey, the 73-year-old family matriarch who died Wednesday shortly after her son, Carmine Fusco, and five days after her daughter, Rita Fusco-Jackson, a religious education teacher also from Freehold. Grace, a mother of 11, was unaware her children died, a family spokeswoman told The New York Times.
On Thursday evening, a fourth member of the family, Vincent Fusco, died at CentraState Medical Center in Freehold, NJ.com reported.
More than 20 Fusco relatives remain in quarantine.
"I don't know why this virus picked my family," said one relative, who asked not to be named.
Health experts aren't sure the degree to which genetics could play a role in the spread and severity of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, but say research is being done to answer that question as more data becomes available globally.
Carmine Fusco, 55, a harness horse trainer who lived outside Bath, was the first Pennsylvanian to die of the illness, which as of Thursday had infected 185 people, including four reported cases in Northampton County besides Fusco. Lehigh County has one reported case. Nationwide, more than 10,000 are infected and more than 150 have died.
The global toll is more than 228,000 infected, with more than 9,300 deaths and nearly 85,000 recoveries.
The New York Times said a Fusco family member was in contact with John Brennan, a Yonkers Raceway employee who was first to die of the illness in New Jersey, then attended a routine family gathering.
Grace Fusco, a native of Brooklyn, had 11 children with her husband, Vincenzo, an immigrant from Italy. He died in 2017 at age 74. They were married for 55 years.
Thursday morning, the relative said all the family members who took ill early in the month went to the doctor. One was told he had an ear infection, another that she had a sinus infection.
None was especially worried.
"They weren't sickly people," the relative said, adding that all but Grace Fusco felt better for a time before taking a turn for the worse.
Doctors don't know why the virus hit Grace and her children so hard, said the relative, who is upset that some of Grace's 27 grandchildren learned of her death through the media.
According to The Times account, officials are exploring what may have made the virus so deadly to the family.
No funeral arrangements will be made until the other relatives are well, the relative said, adding that the family's grief is exacerbated by the fact that no one can visit the ailing siblings at CentraState Medical Center.
Chrysan Cronin, a public health professor at Muhlenberg College, could not speak to why exactly the virus had such a devastating effect on the Fusco family, but said data from China shows that family clusters can be at particular risk. It makes sense that a virus could spread between people under the same roof, but Cronin said there's another reason relatives could experience a cluster of severe symptoms of the virus.
"We know that many familial health issues are genetically determined," Cronin said. "So at a very basic molecular level, yes, genetics could play a role."
These underlying health issues often mentioned by experts discussing risk can be tricky since so many go undetected until a problem arises, Cronin said. Pair that with the fact that our bodies have built no immunity to this new virus, and it can be a perfect storm, she said.
For this reason, social distancing can even be necessary in the same home, especially for people living with high-risk relatives under the same roof. Cronin suggested keeping separate areas as much as possible, practicing an at least 6-foot separation in the home and disinfecting unavoidable common spaces to help limit the spread of the virus.
Dr. Jeffrey Jahre, an infectious disease expert and senior vice president of medical and academic affairs at St. Luke's University Health Network, said the role that genetics might play in how the coronavirus affects certain people is an active area of research.
"That's really being looked into right now," Jahre said. "We know a lot about this disease but there's also a tremendous amount that we don't know and are continuing to learn about. That's why recommendations can seem like they're changing quickly."
Jahre said health officials are encouraging families to have an outbreak plan so they know how to cope if someone in same household falls ill.
Limiting contact within the home is critical, though it can be difficult. If possible, the sick person should wear a face mask, Jahre said, and surfaces should be cleaned frequently. The family pet, an unintentional transmitter thanks to cuddles, hugs and kisses, should have limited contact with the sick person as well, he said.
Jahre said he worries that younger people, particularly those cooped at home with their parents or grandparents, may think they don't have be so vigilant since they're not part of the population considered high risk.
But there have been plenty of cases where young people have been infected, and many more where they appeared to have transmitted the virus to someone who is more vulnerable, he warned. As more people are tested and those with mild cases of COVID-19 recuperate at home, he said the guidelines become more important.
With the Passover and Easter holiday approaching, Jahre said families should consider thinking about how they might celebrate differently this year. Virtual meet-ups or much smaller gatherings could be the unique reality this holiday.
"If you have someone in particular that you're concerned about being alone on the holiday and if you can provide a safe space for them in your household, then that could be worth it," Jahre said. "But if you're a family that usually has a big gathering, it just might not be the time to do that."

Texto completo: MALL AT ROBINSON, PITTSBURGH MILLS TO TEMPORARILY CLOSE DUE TO VIRUS
The Mall at Robinson and the Galleria at Pittsburgh Mills in Frazer announced that they would close to help halt the spread of COVID-19. The Mall at Robinson said it would shut down at 6 p.m. Thursday. The Pittsburgh Mills mall, located in Frazer, wrote in a Facebook post that it will be closed "until further notice."
FORD SUSPENDS DIVIDEND TO PRESERVE CASH RESERVES
Ford suspended the dividend that its management has vowed to maintain even through a downturn as the pandemic forces the struggling automaker to protect its cash reserves. The company took the step to prioritize financial flexibility and investments in a series of new-product launches this year, it said. Ford also said it will fully draw $15.4 billion from two credit lines and withdrew the 2020 earnings guidance given to investors Feb. 4, which didn't factor in the effects of the coronavirus.
METROPOLITAN OPERA CANCELS SEASON AMID OUTBREAK
The Metropolitan Opera, the nation's largest performing arts organization, said that it would cancel the rest of its season because of the pandemic and begin an emergency fundraising effort aimed at covering an anticipated loss of up to $60 million. The move came a day after the Metropolitan Museum of Art said it would stay closed at least until July and expected a nearly $100 million shortfall.
TESLA WILL SUSPEND PRODUCTION AT SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA PLANT
Tesla will temporarily end production at its Fremont, Calif., assembly plant beginning March 23 to comply with San Francisco Bay Area restrictions amid the virus outbreak. The company made the announcement after days of controversy as CEO Elon Musk kept the plant running full-tilt despite shelter-in-place lockdown orders from Alameda County, where Fremont is located.

But once the passengers and crews got off and headed to quarantine facilities in California and Georgia, there weren't enough tests, there was a lack of cleanliness and enforcement of protocols like social distancing, not enough gloves and in some rooms, there wasn't even soap.
One pair of travelers said they didn't get fed for 17 hours.

Bill Moore and his wife were headed to Palm Springs from Canada to decide if they wanted to retire in the desert warmth. Connie Holmerud was flying south from Washington state for a 40th birthday party. Andrew Caldwell was making the short trip from Los Angeles, also to celebrate a birthday.
Then the coronavirus pandemic hit, with orders to shelter in place for millions of people, and suggestions to #stayathome and social distance for everyone else.
The travelers decided this was the wrong time to visit the Coachella Valley. So, they tried to cancel their plans and wait until the pandemic passed to re-book. But a vacation home rental company called TurnKey declined to refund them thousands of dollars, instead offering them re-booking credits with what they called onerous terms.
Said company spokesperson Adam Pedowitz, via email: "On the other side of every refund request for a non-refundable booking is a homeowner. "

Texto completo: The albatross hanging from every arts reporter' neck is the stack of untouched books sitting on their desk, on a shelf, or shamefully hidden away in the closet farthest from them. Sent in from authors, agents and publishers it is the combined weight of all these unwritten about books that (I assume) will one day drag my soul to the depth of the River Styx.
I'm not saying it's a silver lining, far from it, but with the coronavirus forcing most events to shut down or cancel, we are all now going to have a lot more time on our hands for literary pursuits. With no upcoming festivals or performances to profile, now is the perfect time to let readers know what is on the reading agenda for the next week, or month or longer interval before society as we know it returns to some semblance of normalcy.
Some of these books I've read most or all of, others I haven't read at all. But none of them have been covered in depth by the Press-Citizen heretofore.
'Afterlife' by Julia Alvarez Genre: Fiction Length: ~250 pages
From the author of "In the Time of Butterflies" is a new novel for adults. "Afterlife" is a novel about immigrant and English teacher Antonia Vega who is hit with a trio of problems at once. Her husband dies, her sister goes missing and an undocumented and pregnant teenager appears at her doorstep.
This is the kind of book I'd love to cover, but Alvarez's scheduled tour dates and tours sent with the book will not bring her through Iowa City. The book, a roughly 250-page affair, is scheduled for release on April 7, 2020.
'All the Flowers in Paris' by Sarah Jio Genre: Fiction Length: ~ 300 pages
A novel that switches between a pair of perspectives, one of which is Caroline, who wakes up with no memory in a Paris hospital in 2009. The other is Celine, a woman in Nazi-occupied Paris in 1943. The story follows both women as they try to make sense of their respective situations: Caroline who gradually pieces together who she is and Celine who needs to try to
Not necessarily the kind of book I myself would be on the edge of my seat to read, but I can think of a half dozen friends I'd recommend this to by description alone. Plus, an aspect of Caroline's character is discovering she's had a "reclusive life in a sprawling apartment on the rue Cler," which — at this moment —sounds like the exact situation I'd like to be living in (at least for the next few weeks).
'An American Bum in China' by Tom Carter Genre: Biography Length: ~125 pages
A brief biography following five years with Muscatine native Matthew Evans as he finds himself in China in 2014 as the Hong Kong protests were just beginning. Evans' tale is told by Tom Carter who previously published "Unsavory Elements: Stories of Foreigners on the Loose in China."
Initially, I'd planned to run a review of the book back in December that didn't end up finding its way to print. It was a topical read at the time with the Hong Kong protests in the news cycle and — while Hong Kong hasn't been the focus of recent coverage — China's arguably in the news cycle even more now than it was then.
'Bedlam' by Kenneth Paul Rosenberg, MD Genre: Nonfiction Length: ~200 pages
The full title of the text is "Bedlam: An Intimate Journey Into America's Mental Health Crisis." Rosenberg's book is intended to give readers an inside look at the American mental health system and its failings. After seven years of interviews, the book uses those accounts to shine a light on the criminalization of individuals with mental health issues among other topics.
This book and the author behind it are the exact kinds of things I love to cover. When it was first delivered to our office I showed it to everyone in the newsroom. The only reason why it's not pending on my personal reading list is I'm not sure I have the emotional fortitude to read about institutional, systemic failure, especially at this particular moment.
'Bloody Genius' by John Sanford Genre: Mystery Length: ~375 pages
This is the most recent Virgil Flowers novel from New York Times bestselling author John Sanford, marking the 12th novel in a series that started in 2007 with "Dark of the Moon." In this particular book, a culture war on a state campus between the science and medical departments is interrupted when a scholar turns up dead. Enter the series investigator Virgil Flowers, tasked with finding the killer.
While this title was briefly alluded to in my write-up on the 2019 Iowa City Book Festival, it didn't end up receiving full coverage, even though Sanford is a Cedar Rapids native and University of Iowa grad. This fell by the wayside for me at the time partly because of my own ignorance of Sanford being a local name and the sheer volume of events surrounding the book festival.
'Deacon King Kong' by James McBride Genre: Historical Fiction Length: ~375 pages
Set in September of 1969, "Deacon King Kong" starts with the deacon of Five Ends Baptist Church shooting a 19-year-old-drug dealer in the face in South Brooklyn. The release that came with the book touts it as being infused with "humor and compassion" as it explores the lives of the fictional characters around this incident.
I've had a copy of this book so long and I've wanted to read it so bad! As if to taunt me Penguin Random House sent me a second copy which I also have not read.
I'm positive I'll get around to this once I work through my personal pending backlog of unread books, but like Entertainment Weekly and The New York Times, this book is high on my to-read list and can make it to yours too since it was released on March 3.
'The Dearly Beloved' by Cara Wall Genre: Fiction Length: ~350 pages
The story of this novel spent 15 years coming into focus for its author, Iowa Writers' Workshop graduate Cara Wall, who first conceived of the novel during her 2004 pregnancy. The book focuses on a pair of couples, each of which includes an individual drawn to the Christian faith and another who is skeptical of it.
This is another novel I had planned to write a review of. First, before it's Aug. 13, 2019 publication and then before Wall's Sept. 23 visit to Prairie Lights. Though outside my general area of interest, it's one I feel strangely drawn to and would like to pick up and finish someday.
'Everywhere You Don't Belong' by Gabriel Bump Genre: Fiction Length: ~250 pages
This is the first novel from the Chicago originating author Gabriel Bump, an experience explored in this novel through the character of Claude McKay, a young black man growing up on the South Side.
This is another book on my personal reading list and comes recommended by numerous other publications. it represents yet another instance of not enough local connections for me to cover.
'Hey Grandude!' by Paul McCartney, Illustrated by Kathryn Durst Genre: Picture Book Length: ~ 30 pages
I think there are only two reasons I haven't read or reviewed this book: First, world-renowned singer/songwriter Paul McCartney has not had a book tour through Iowa City promoting it. Second, I don't know that I could justify a picture book review to my editor as the 4- to 6-year-old age range does not make up a huge amount of our readership.
But now I can, so here's my one-paragraph review:
As a book about a bunch of kids stuck inside who turn to their grandude to entertain them, I think this book will resonate with kids in this very specific moment in time. While the plot is somewhat aimless, it's a fun read with pretty illustrations that takes its characters to the beach, to the American West and to the mountainside. All through the aid of a magic compass.
'The Mountains Sing' by Nguyen Phan Que Mail Genre: Historical Fiction Length: ~350 pages
The 11th book from Nguyen Phan Que Mai, "The Mountains Sing" follow the Tran family as they navigate their way through a Vietnam wrapped in War. The most recent addition to my ever-growing work shelf of unread books, "The Mountains Sing" will have been published just before this article runs. I have never read this book, but, for what it's worth, it comes with my highest recommendation.
'One Night At the Lake' by Bethany Chase Genre: Fiction Length: ~275 pages
The jacket description of this book pitches two straight forward premises. The first: Leah has been dating Ollie for four years and, upon being invited to his family's lake house, she suspects he's going to propose. The second: June is visiting her fiance's Ollie's lake house, "a house haunted by long-buried memories of her lost friend" Leah.
If this wasn't the first novel that hit my desk after I started at the P-C last year, it's one of the first. But I'd completely forgotten about it until I started putting this list together. It's not usually the kind of thing I'd go for, but if the description appeals to you, it strikes me as the kind of book that would be a pleasant distraction during turbulent times.
'Pitty the Reader' by Kurt Vonnegut and Suzanne McConnel Genre: Nonfiction Length: ~375 pages
Half of this book's authorship is renowned author Kurt Vonnegut, the other half is Suzanne McConnell who was a student of Vonnegut's at the Iowa Writers' Workshop. The latter has collected everything she can about what Vonnegut as a teacher regarding the craft of writing.
I seem to have a problem with not reading books by Kurt Vonnegut. I've been told I'd love "Slaughterhouse-Five," which has nonetheless been gathering dust on my personal shelf for ages. Of all the books on my P-C shelf though, this is maybe the one I was most hoping to read most of all, and was only reminded of as I started to put together this list.
'Real Life' by Brandon Taylor Genre: Fiction Length: ~325 pages
This is a story about an Alabama-born protagonist, Wallace, and his navigating of his sexuality and self-preservation while at a Midwestern university. Author Brandon Taylor is a staff writer Literary Hub and a graduate of the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop. He read from this book at Prairie Lights in February.
Sometimes I like to imagine alternate realities. While putting this article together, I wonder if the version of me that's read all these books is a happier person. I feel like he is. I feel like he's somehow more attractive too. Yet, despite being interested and having months of notice, I slept on this book and ended up not writing any local coverage.
If you're interested in reading, this is your chance to not be like this realities me. Be like alternate-universe, happy/handsome me.
'These Boys and Their Fathers' by Don Waters Genre: Memoir Length: ~250 pages
A 2010 mission self-set by author Don Waters was "to write a magazine story about a surfing icon who had known his absentee father"." That resulted in the investigative and introspective memoir we have today.
The book was published by the University of Iowa Press last year and Waters was another attendee of the Iowa City Book Festival who went uncovered by the P-C. From the very little I've read, the books seems to be in a similar vein as "The Glass Castle" by Jeannette Walls.
'Time After Time' by Lisa Grunwald Genre: Fiction Length: ~400 pages
The release for this one pitches this love story as a fusion of "The Time Traveler's Wife" and "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button." Joe is a railroad man and Nora is an aspiring artist who discover's she is stuck, in a very real sense, in Grand Central Terminal by a force she doesn't understand. The narrative charts the relationship between the two over roughly a decade.
God, I love the cover and title of this book. Yet another example of a text I'm not particularly inclined toward that I can't help but want to read whenever it catches my eye. Once again we see a character who is stuck in a place and, maybe it's just because of the time and place we're all currently stuck in, but that resonates.
'Surfside Sisters' by Nancy Thayer Genre: Fiction Length: ~300 pages
Protagonist Keely Green grew up in Nantucket with her best friend, Isabelle, with dreams of becoming a novelist. Years later she's achieved those dreams and is living the glamorous big city life of a successful New York novelist. Her dream life is interrupted by the one-two punch of her editor passing on her novel and her mom's health declining, forcing her to return to Nantucket to things she thought she'd put behind her.
Technically I have two Nancy Thayer books on my desk. (This and "Let It Snow" a Christmas themed novel.) But coverage for one of them felt like enough for our purposes here. I don't know much about Thayer, but going through the press releases included with her work here I've discovered she's famous for capturing the "natural beauty" of Nantucket. So for those of you stuck inside and wishing you were somehow in Nantucket, Thay surely has a book for you.
'When You Learn the Alphabet' by Kendra Allen Genre: Nonfiction Length: ~150 pages
A book of essays focusing on the parental relationships of author Kendra Allen, this shortish book touches on a wide array of topics. Marriage, race, mental health and feminism are just a few of the themes interwoven throughout the book.
Like "Bloody Genius" this is one I didn't get a chance to cover in full because of the local event relating to it being positioned during the local literary festival. That said I've only heard good things and if someone demanded why I hadn't read this yet I would probably mutter something about "having a lot on my plate" and then failing to go to sleep because I'm questioning internally why I haven't read this book.

Texto completo: Mohegan Sun Pocono is working with the Pennsylvania Harness Horsemen’s Association and the Pennsylvania Department of Health following the death of harness racing trainer Carmine Fusco, the casino’s president and general manager Tony Carlucci said Thursday.
Fusco, 55, died Wednesday and is the first Pennsylvania resident to die as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. He trained horses that competed at several tracks in the region, including The Downs at Mohegan Sun Pocono. He had two horses racing at Pocono as recently as March 9.
“Our deepest condolences are with this family that has endured so much, as well as with friends and the horse-racing community of which this gentleman excelled,” Carlucci said in a statement.
Like all Pennsylvania casinos, Mohegan Sun Pocono is temporarily closed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
Carlucci said Mohegan Sun Pocono officials are communicating with the department of health on further precautionary actions and for guidance on informing racing team members that may have worked in the paddock area.
Nate Wardle, press secretary from the Pennsylvania Department of Health, said the department is not providing information on individual cases.
For businesses in which there may have been exposures or potential concerns, Wardle said, “We have been and will continue to work with them to ensure that precautions are taken to protect individuals.”
His advice to everyone who thinks they might have been in contact with someone who is a confirmed coronavirus case is to “stay home as much as possible.”
Fusco was one of four people in his family to die from the virus.
According to the New York Times, his mother, Grace Fusco, 73, from Freehold, New Jersey, died Wednesday night without knowing that her two oldest children had died before her.
Her daughter, Rita Fusco-Jackson, also 55, a religious education teacher from Freehold, New Jersey, died Friday.
NJ.com reported Thursday that Vincent Fusco, the fourth person from the same New Jersey family, died Thursday at CentraState Medical Center in Freehold.
More than 20 Fusco relatives are quarantined in their homes. According to the New York Times, health officials are exploring what may have made the virus so deadly to the family.

The New York Times goes full-apologist for Chinese communists

Autor: Adams, T. 

Información de publicación: Washington Examiner ; Washington, D.C. [Washington, D.C]. 19 Mar 2020.

Texto completo: Of all the American news outlets that have acted recently as unofficial public relations firms for the Chinese Communist Party, the New York Times may be the worst.

On Wednesday, the New York Times published a report titled, “Its Coronavirus Cases Dwindling, China Turns Focus Outward.”

Its subhead reads, “Beijing is mounting a humanitarian aid blitz in countries struggling with their own outbreaks. In doing so, it’s stepping into a role the West once dominated.”

It may be the most shameful piece of Chinese disinformation published by any newsroom in the United States since the COVID-19 outbreak first became a story.

The report, co-authored by New York Times Beijing bureau chief Steven Lee Myers (bet you did not see that coming), goes to great lengths to cast China as a thoughtful, meticulous, proactive, and responsible world leader whose contributions to fighting the pandemic it created make it a more reliable and responsible superpower compared to the U.S. The article parrots China’s claim that its daily coronavirus cases have dwindled “into the single digits.” No attempt is made to verify these numbers. The story also casts China’s absurd allegation that the U.S. military created the coronavirus pandemic as merely a clumsy attempt by Chinese officials to respond to criticism.

Worse than what the article says is what it does not say. The New York Times report makes no mention of the fact that China arrested and punished the whistleblowers who tried in 2019 to warn the international community about the virus. The report also fails to mention allegations that Chinese authorities forced scientists to destroy proof of the virus. For the New York Times, China’s failed attempts to cover up the pandemic it created are characterized simply as a “mishandling” of the outbreak.

Also, and this is especially macabre, the report goes on for a full 28 paragraphs before it reveals that China is selling its so-called humanitarian aid to countries such as Italy, which has suffered some of the worst fatalities rates as a result of COVID-19's spread.
Moreover, when the story does eventually get around to providing this fairly relevant piece of information, it does so by casting the issue as a “critics say” situation, meaning that instead of reporting on China’s duplicitous efforts to “help” infected counties, it downplays the issue by making it sound as if it is just the say-so of annoyed individuals.
The report’s 27th and 28th paragraphs read:
China’s critics dismiss the assistance as hollow gestures, even cynical ones. Many in Italy, for example, angrily pointed out that China was selling masks, respirators and other medical equipment, not donating them, and claimed that some of the materials were meant for Chinese citizens in the country.
This information should be verified, moved to the opening paragraphs, and made the entire focus of the report. Instead, it is buried and practically dismissed off-hand in favor of a narrative that casts China as the hero of the COVID-19 pandemic.

There is also this line in the New York Times report: “The state news media has also highlighted the chaos in Europe and the United States with something close to schadenfreude. People’s Daily cheered the news this week that the pace of infections and deaths overseas now exceeds that inside China.”

“Schadenfreude” is not the word I would have chosen.

Lastly, there is only a single mention in the entire report of China’s announcement this week that it will expel American journalists from China, Hong Kong, and Macau (it is not mentioned until the 24th paragraph). You would think a New York Times report on the Chinese Communist Party's attempt to control the coronavirus narrative would include a few more details on China's efforts to expel U.S. journalists, especially considering New York Times reporters are among those targeted for expulsion. Then again, perhaps the puff piece about China’s “humanitarian” efforts is a direct and none-too-subtle response to the expulsion decree.
With the media acting like this, who even needs the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China?

Texto completo: Now that China’s fever has broken in terms of its mismanagement of the novel coronavirus, the Chinese Communist Party has the strength to raise its finger to point blame.
Last week, the U.S. State Department summoned Chinese Ambassador to the U.S. Cui Tiankai after Chinese Foreign Minister Zhao Lijian spread a conspiracy theory on Twitter. “It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan,” he wrote. “Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!” Undeterred, the Chinese ambassador to South Africa later tweeted, “More evidence suggests that the virus was not originated at the seafood market in Wuhan at all, not to mention the so called ‘made in China.’”
It’s to be expected that the Chinese Communist Party is pushing disinformation around its mishandling of the virus that originated within its country's borders. What’s worse is American journalists running similar cover for the party.
New York Times reporter Ian Johnson wrote a piece last week entitled “China Bought the West Time. The West Squandered It.” Not to be outdone, Atlantic staff writer Anne Applebaum authored her own called “The Coronavirus Called America’s Bluff.” Using a pro-colonialism hook (I’m sure that will go over well at Upper East Side cocktail parties), Applebaum’s argument is nothing more than an elaborate bit of whataboutism, essentially claiming that while China’s response was bad, President Trump’s response could potentially be much worse and thus put us on par with China, as if the Trump administration and the Chinese are equally situated in the spread of the virus.
And demonstrating an affinity for control, New York Times reporter Donald McNeil applauded China’s handling of the virus on Rachel Maddow’s program, assuring audiences those mass camps where people were forcibly relocated were not concentration camps. Further, NBC News ran an opinion piece titled “Coronavirus in China kept me under quarantine. I felt safer than back here in the U.S.” Nothing says comfort and safety like the weighted blanket of Chinese authoritarianism — what that opinion writer concedes can be perhaps “overzealous.”
From a global response perspective, it was widely reported that China was sending “experts, ventilators, and masks to Italy.” Applebaum and many others applauded the move as a demonstration of Chinese global leadership dwarfing the Trump administration’s response to the pandemic. Of course, this framing lacked fundamental context. As the Washington Post later reported, “Those shipments of goods are, in at least some cases, not donations but rather exports of goods for purchase. And 1,000 ventilators is a decent deal for a country trying to get its business sector restarted.”
The pivot toward appearing as the global leader in combating the coronavirus is an obvious rebrand opportunity for Chinese President Xi Jinping. Only weeks ago, Xi was rightly hearing of in-party chatter about his fumbling of the virus. Now, with the help of some useful fools in American media, the Chinese have even managed to claim that any discussion of the “Wuhan coronavirus” smacks of racism.
Last week, the Atlantic’s David Frum tweeted: “Nobody calls the 1919-20 pandemic the Spanish flu anymore, and not because we are soft on the Inquisition. It's just not a useful way to name a disease.” Yes, yes, they do.
Others declared that Trump, Republican lawmakers, and anyone who called the disease anything but “COVID-19” are “racist,” “xenophobic,” and other such superlatives of wrongthink. Forget that as recently as two months ago, the Atlantic, the New York Times, the World Health Organization, and the rest now crying foul were all calling the illness the Wuhan coronavirus and identifying its point of origin with nary a worry. In coming to the Chinese Communist Party’s defense, they have assisted in completing the feedback loop with Xinhua News, a party mouthpiece, tweeting, “Racism is not the right tool to cover your own incompetence.” Good job, everyone.
Let’s be clear: The virus began in China. Chinese scientists knew of the virus as early as December and were ordered to cover it up and destroy evidence. Doctors and whistleblowers have been silenced (in at least one case, even dying of the virus) or disappeared. People have been dragged out of their homes into forced quarantine. Medical professionals have cast doubt on the overall mortality statistics coming out of Wuhan. One would think that the State Department issuing an informal slap on the wrist to the Chinese for falsely accusing the U.S. Army of creating the virus and planting it in Wuhan would at least give public intellectuals some pause before parroting communist talking points. But, alas, it’s 2020, and Trump is the president.
The propaganda machine will only get worse in the weeks and months ahead as the surgical masks are removed across China. Xinhua News, in a piece titled “Be Bold: The World Owes China a ‘Thank You,’” has already said the United States owes China an apology and that “the world should thank China for its gargantuan efforts and sacrifices to prevent the spread of the disease to other countries, an act that is really startling the universe and moving the gods.” And to be clear, this is a “say thank you, or else,” type of situation, as the Chinese have threatened pharmaceutical export controls that will “plunge [the U.S.] into the mighty sea of coronavirus.” Hopefully, these folks who have been running cover for the Chinese can swim.
Going forward, keep in perspective the facts, Trump's and local governments' response to the pandemic, and where this all began. Deviating from the facts as they are is either lowbrow anti-Trumpism or, worse, aiding and abetting the Chinese propaganda shell game. Never forget: The devil works hard, but the Chinese Communist Party works harder.

Texto completo: There is a lot to mourn right now. Many thousands of people all over the world are mourning dead loved ones. People are mourning lost jobs, lost savings, lost security. Senior citizens in locked-down nursing homes are mourning the loss of visitors. I’m lucky; I’m just mourning the city.
To live in a city like New York, where I’ve spent most of my adult life, is to trade private space for public space. It’s to depend on interdependence. I don’t have a dining room, but I’ve been able to eat in thousands of restaurants. I have no storage space, but everything I needed was at the bodega. I don’t have a home office, but I could work at coffee shops.
Now those supports are gone. The coronavirus disaster is going to devastate communities all over the country, even if many in red America don’t realize it yet. But it poses particular challenges for urbanites, and not just because the disease spreads more easily where people are packed close together.
Historically, cities have made it easier for people to live alone without experiencing constant loneliness.
“For single women, with or without children, cities offer domestic infrastructure,” my friend Rebecca Traister wrote in her book “All the Single Ladies: Unmarried Women and the Rise of an Independent Nation.” “The city itself becomes a kind of partner, providing for single women the kind of services that women have, for generations, provided men.”
In times of stress in New York — Sept. 11, the 2003 blackout, the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy — people gather for comfort and mutual assistance. When Donald Trump was elected and many New Yorkers felt the ground beneath their feet crumbling, they rushed to mass meetings.
Now the ground beneath our feet is crumbling again, but many of us are stuck in at least semi-isolation. Togetherness, once a balm, has become a threat. This mass withdrawal is like social chemotherapy, damaging the fabric of our communal life while trying to save it.
Social distancing is brutal for everyone, but it’s a particular difficulty for people in cities, especially those who live alone and those packed into tiny spaces. Steven Taylor, a University of British Columbia professor and author of “The Psychology of Pandemics: Preparing for the Next Global Outbreak of Infectious Disease,” told me that some people quarantined during the SARS epidemic developed post-traumatic stress disorder.
“Self-isolation is like a milder version of quarantine,” he said.
And where you’re isolated matters.
“It’s going to be a fundamentally different experience if you’re able to stroll around your 10-acre farm and pick the produce you’ve been growing,” Taylor said, than if you’re “living in a one-bedroom apartment with your three roommates.”
When this emergency is over, people are likely to emerge into fundamentally changed cities, with economies in crisis, and beloved restaurants, businesses and cultural institutions gone for good.
“We all need to be worried about the corner diner and the new coffee shop and the bodega and the small nonprofit organizations,” said Eric Klinenberg, a sociology professor at New York University and author of “Palaces for the People: How Social Infrastructure Can Help Fight Inequality, Polarization, and the Decline of Civic Life.” “There’s just countless operations that are vulnerable right now because everyone is pulling in.”
New York City is launching a loan program for small businesses, and hopefully state and federal governments will follow with more substantial rescue packages. But Gregg Bishop, commissioner of the New York City Department of Small Business Services, told me, “There’s probably going to be some businesses that may not be able to recover from this.”
I wonder if our cultural romance with urban living will recover either. In recent decades, millennials, who tend to be more averse to suburbia than their parents and grandparents, have helped fuel an urban resurgence. If the shock of the coronavirus is devastating enough, that could change, as more people seek their own personal bunkers.
“We have lots of previous historical experiences that generated new anxiety about the city and pushed people out into the suburbs,” Klinenberg said. “There was a post-World War II anxiety about nuclear war that gave some people the fantasy that the suburb would be a safer place. Before that there were anxieties about infectious diseases, or public health hazards like cholera, that pushed people out of the city as well.”
Klinenberg is far from convinced that this will happen again.
“What I hope for is that this rising generation learns to appreciate just how deeply connected we are to each other, just how valuable it is to invest in public goods, and how precious and important shared experiences in public spaces are,” he said.
I hope so too. Maybe when this ends, people will pour into the restaurants and bars like a war’s been won, and cities will flourish as people rush to rebuild their ruined social architecture. But for now it’s chilling to witness an entire way of life coming to a sudden horrible halt. So many of the pleasures and conveniences that make dwelling in cramped quarters worth it, for those privileged enough to choose city life, have disappeared. Even if they all come back, we’ll always know they’re not permanent.

Farhad Manjoo: It’s time to bring back big government

Texto completo: Ten or 20 years from now, by the time the current crisis has hardened into a cautionary tale about the dangers of governmental incompetence, I imagine we’ll look back on President Donald Trump’s Rose Garden news conference of Friday, March 13, as the moment that finally shattered the world’s faith in America. What broke me, at least, was the spectacular smallness on display — how, in the span of about an hour that afternoon, the illusion of American can-do greatness shriveled like a frightened turtle right before our eyes.
Trump had been disastrously late to lead the fight against the coronavirus, but the United States is often a laggard in times of global turmoil. Now, facing a moment of maximum peril for his country and for the wider world, Trump might have embraced an opportunity for some good old-fashioned American shock and awe. Given his vast powers over land and sea and space, a near-limitless treasury and the untapped reserves of American ingenuity, the only question was which mountain the president would aim to move first.
Would he commit the federal government to building hospitals to treat the masses sickened by the virus, the way China did? Would he command a warlike mobilization to rush into production the supplies and equipment needed to weather the crisis — not just tests for the virus but also protective gear and hospital ventilators? Would he promise a frightened nation that it had nothing to fear, because, as ever, its mighty government would rush in to protect its weary people?
LOL. Nothing of the sort. After weeks of dithering, Trump all but excused the federal government of much responsibility. Instead, he turned to the only the real power left in the land: America’s brands.
“I want to thank Google,” said the American president. “Google is helping to develop a website. It’s going to be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past, to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location.”
Let us not dwell on the clown show that followed this news: Reporters soon discovered that Trump had oversold the site; instead of the nationwide coordinating service the president had described, Verily, a life sciences subsidiary of Google’s parent company, was building only a small pilot effort to direct people in the San Francisco Bay Area to coronavirus resources. When the media clarified these details, the president doubled down and called reporters liars, and Google gutlessly played along with the charade.
But as I said, never mind all this; it’s just frosting on the chaos cake. For now, it’s worth focusing on the initial embarrassment — on the sorry fact that in order to provide its citizens tests for a pandemic disease, the wealthiest and most powerful nation had to desperately finagle the services of volunteer coders at Google.
And this was hardly the end of America’s reliance on brands in the face of crisis. “Mr. President, I want to join you in thanking Walmart and CVS and Target and Walgreen,” said Vice President Mike Pence, as if he were an Instagram influencer trying too hard to bank some new sponcon. What an enormous comedown for a nation whose government once aimed to lead the world in competence and expertise.
During the Great Depression, Franklin D. Roosevelt assembled a mighty federal apparatus to rebuild a broken economy. Lyndon Johnson used federal power to bring civil rights to the South. Ours was the sort of government that promised unprecedented achievement, and delivered.
But now all that is over; facing the catastrophe of pandemic, our national government stands naked in its mediocrity and impotence. In a call with governors this week, the president made it plain: “Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment — try getting it yourselves,” he said.
This is a national shame, but not a surprise. The incompetence we see now is by design. Over the last 40 years, America has been deliberately stripped of governmental expertise. This is what happens when you starve the beast. This is what happens when you shrink government down to the size that you can drown it in a bathtub. The plain ineptitude we see now is the end result of a decades-long effort to systematically plunder the federal government of professionalism and expertise and rigor and ability.
Much of this project, of course, originated on the political right. It was Ronald Reagan who quipped that the most terrifying words in the English language were “I’m from the government, and I’m here to help.” A parade of Republican-led Congresses sought to shrink federal budgets and stymie federal power.
Then, as Michael Lewis documented in “The Fifth Risk,” Trump came to power and began to take a sledgehammer to the government’s core functions. His administration gutted some services deliberately — among them the National Security Council’s pandemic-response team — while leaving other agencies, like the State Department, to shrivel out of neglect.
But it would be wrong to pin the government’s incompetence only on partisan ideology. Bill Clinton, celebrating cuts to the safety net, promised that the era of big government was over. Barack Obama pushed for and got an enormous government stimulus passed, but he, too, often seemed uncomfortable with federal power. When it came to creating a universal health care plan, Obama relied on private insurers to get it done; when he wanted to solve the financial crisis, he looked to titans on Wall Street for the solution.
The diminution of governmental expertise in favor of corporate power, then, may have less to with ideology than with diminished expectations on the part of all of us. Just about every day, now, we’re presented with new evidence of our government’s inability to address the nation’s worst problems; we can’t solve mass shootings, we can’t do anything about climate change, we can’t win wars, we can’t fight monopolies, and now we can’t fight pandemics. The incompetence feeds on itself — the less the government seems to be able to do, the less citizens expect it to do, a downward spiral of ineptitude.
Meanwhile, corporations rush in to fill the competence void. Today, it’s the technology industry, not the federal government, that is building tomorrow’s national infrastructure (see Tesla, SpaceX, Amazon or Blue Origin). Rather than letting regulators make weighty decisions about political speech or health care or election spending, we’ve turned over governance to the private sector — Facebook, not the Federal Election Commission, decides who gets to run political ads, while health care monopolies decide how much you’ll pay for insulin.
The coronavirus crisis should be our wake-up call. The brands can’t help us. The brands won’t help us. The most comforting words I can think of now, amid so much uncertainty, chaos and confusion, are these: “I’m from the government, and I’m here to help.”

Gail Collins: Is it time to give Trump a grade?

Texto completo: So our question for today is: What is the appropriate attitude toward Donald Trump in a time of national crisis?
A) Rally around the president.
B) Tell your friends about the pandemic response team he dismantled.
C) Put your head down and watch 200 repeats of “Modern Family.”
Come on, get your head up. I know this is tough. It’s definitely a time for Americans to come together. On the other hand, complaining about Trump is sort of ... our way of life.
“It’s the last pleasure I have,” whimpered one of my housebound friends.
Compromise: Every time Trump irritates or appalls you, write it down in your Coronavirus Diary. After this is all over, we’ll have a contest for the best collection.
Meanwhile, try to divert yourself. Read a great book. Or something less challenging — I hear the “Twilight” series was vastly underrated, and this might be a good time to consider bringing back vampires. Or have extremely long discussions about Tom Brady leaving the New England Patriots. Even if you don’t know who Tom Brady is, you’ll find it’s soothing.
(The coronavirus has been pretty sneaky in managing to simultaneously keep everybody home and end all TV sports. Millions of Americans who don’t watch anything but ESPN are trapped in their living rooms, confronted with nothing but talking heads and mixed martial arts repeats from foreign lands.)
And try to think positive: The governors and mayors are working hard, and Trump’s actually helping some of them out. Congress just passed a coronavirus aid package. There are still a lot of deep-state survivors in the federal government who know what they’re doing. Things could possibly, conceivably, be worse.
But don’t go overboard! I am thinking here of Mike Pence, who’s in charge of the government’s coronavirus response. This is obviously a very important task, and every day Pence appears at a special press conference to tell us what’s going on while mentioning his boss’s name as often as humanly possible. Once you start counting, it’s hard to focus on anything else.
On Wednesday Pence scored a very impressive 16 references to “President Trump,” “the president” and “Mr. President” in four minutes. Shortly below Tuesday’s record of 19 — or 26 if you count answers to two reporters’ questions. Still, you can’t say the man isn’t trying.
Trump himself started off with an insult to China. (“Thank you very much. I would like to begin by announcing some important developments in our war against the Chinese virus.”) The White House and Beijing are having an unseemly who-started-it fight, and the president is trying to get even with a Chinese ministry that claims American soldiers brought the disease to Wuhan during an athletic competition.
Whom would you rather blame, people?
A) China.
B) Bats.
C) Jared Kushner.
No fair picking Kushner. He did help write the Oval Office speech that had everybody swooning with terror. But we are absolutely not going to call it the Jared virus.
Sometimes, it’s not clear exactly how much the president is focusing on all the bad news. His reelection arm is still sending out emails to the troops that focus on things nobody should be thinking about, like the wall, and things that are going to look very sad very soon. (“Brought unemployment numbers to a record low.”) Even his enemies do not want to think that at this point in history, the president is wandering around the Oval Office muttering about Mexico and last month’s economy.
We will not mention that one of Trump’s biggest non-virus accomplishments of the month was appointing the administration’s fourth chief of staff. One big plus is that you won’t have to learn who he is before he’s gone.
Trump and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who were having a tweet war earlier in the week, are now apparently buddies. Or at least on speaking terms. “With respect to Governor Cuomo, we had a great talk this morning,” the president said during one of the coronavirus press conferences. “We’re both doing a really good job.”
Yeah, in an ideal world Trump would have said Cuomo is doing a good job and then waited for the governor to return the compliment. But you cannot expect the crisis to strip our president of his self-regard. We will all go before the ego.
Trump does seem aware that it was a bad idea to tell reporters that he rated his coronavirus performance 10 out of 10. Instead, Wednesday he tossed the ball to ... the polls. “I see that they’re very high,” he noted modestly. “I’m beating Sleepy Joe Biden by a lot.”
OK, not a strong point for presidential transformation.
We’re so distracted, a lot of people failed to notice that Tuesday Joe Biden continued his lockup of the nomination. Won Florida! And Arizona! And ... some other stuff.
Think about it. Last month Biden, who had never won a single primary in three campaigns for president, came in fifth in New Hampshire. That was February, and look at him now. Feel free to see this as a sign that when things seem most terrible, it might just be time for a turnaround.
Bernie Sanders says he is not ending his campaign. He is “assessing.” As are we all, Bernie.

Texto completo: The Claim
A viral Facebook post singles out Milwaukee as one of a handful of cities where large numbers of black voters didn’t vote.
The image, shared from numerous different sources, is usually accompanied by some kind of call for black voters to get to the polls.
It lists several states with narrow margins in the 2016 election and black turnout in their large cities. For Wisconsin it says, "(President Donald) Trump won Wisconsin by 23,000 votes … in Milwaukee, 93,000 blacks didn’t vote. "
The graphic is a screenshot from a Feb. 26, 2020, opinion piece in the New York Times by Karthik Balasubramanian, an information systems professor who worked for the Barack Obama campaigns in 2008 and 2012.
The numbers are consistent with the story, but they are presented without context.
Black voters, key swing states and the 2016 election
The various versions of the graphic we saw didn’t include the header explaining this was based on the 2016 election — though that’s implied by the Trump reference — or the statistical note that the data is based on metropolitan statistical areas (cities plus surrounding areas), not just cities as the labels on the graphic imply. Most were also missing the bottom state or two, presumably because they don’t fit on a typical phone screen.
The victory margin figures are accurate.
The black turnout numbers are a little squishier. There isn’t firm data on turnout by race since voter registration doesn’t capture that data, so the figures on the right side of the graphic are an estimate based on a U. S. Census Bureau survey that breaks down race and voter participation by state and the demographic makeup of each city.
Nationwide, the Census found black voter turnout was 59. 6% in 2016, down sharply from 66. 6% in 2012 — and the lowest black turnout rate since 2000.
The 2016 rate was lower than white voters (65. 3% of whom turned out) but higher than other minority groups. In 2012, black voters had a higher turnout than white voters for the first time, according to the Census.
Of course, many people of other races did not vote as well, but the thrust of the message was to boost African American turnout in the 2020 election.
So the numbers are in line with what the story reported. But the screenshotted graphic leaves off the statistical detail that the numbers include the surrounding area for each city, and doesn’t specify that these numbers reflect only 2016.

Texto completo: A coming-of-age movie with Pete Davidson is on Hulu. And the comedian Mae Martin stars in a new series on Netflix.
What's Streaming
BIG TIME ADOLESCENCE (2020) Stream on Hulu. Pete Davidson plays a role model with platinum blond hair and a taste for weed in this coarse coming-of-age comedy, the debut film of the writer-director Jason Orley. The plot centers on a brotherly relationship between Davidson's character, a 23-year-old named Zeke, and Mo (Griffin Gluck), his ex-girlfriend's 16-year-old younger brother, whom he walks through the finer points of the suburban slacker lifestyle. The story also involves small-time drug dealing and Mo's pursuit of a crush (played by Oona Laurence). "Though Davidson, Gluck and Laurence show star potential, Orley either boxes them into a too-conventional coming-of-age arc or gives them cloyingly charming characteristics," Kristen Yoonsoo Kim wrote in her review for The New York Times. "Despite some moments of tenderness and easy chemistry between Zeke and Mo," Kim added, "'Big Time Adolescence' doesn't have enough heart or humor to save it from becoming just another movie about white dudes bro-ing out."
THE 400 BLOWS (1959) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. More roving adolescent mischief can be found in this drama, a foundational work of the French New Wave and the debut movie of François Truffaut. The film follows Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud), a 12-year-old truant causing trouble on the streets of Paris. When it was released in the United States in 1959, Bosley Crowther referred to it as "a small masterpiece" in his review for The Times. "Where previous films on similar subjects have been fatted and fictionalized with all sorts of adult misconceptions and sentimentalities," he wrote, "this is a smashingly convincing demonstration on the level of the boy -- cool, firm and realistic, without a false note or a trace of goo."
FEEL GOOD Stream on Netflix. "Can you just lie on top of me and tell me something Canadian?" That question comes early in this romantic-comedy series, which stars the comedian Mae Martin as a version of herself, a Canadian in London. Making the request is George (Charlotte Ritchie), an English woman whom Mae begins dating. Much of the drama comes from a pair of struggles: George, who hasn't dated a woman before, is hesitant to come out to her family and friends, and Mae is a recovering addict. "It's a work of fiction," Martin recently told the British newspaper The Guardian. "But it's got an emotional truth, because it's based on experiences I've had."
What's on TV
AFTER TRUTH: DISINFORMATION AND THE COST OF FAKE NEWS (2020) 9 p.m. on HBO. In his 2011 documentary, "Page One: Inside The New York Times," the filmmaker Andrew Rossi explored the inner workings of The Times at a moment when the paper was struggling to adapt to the internet age. His latest doc, "After Truth," looks at one of the biggest issues to spike in media since: disinformation, and the way untruths are spread through social media.

Texto completo: An official said the expulsions were needed to defend China's media against American suppression. Chinese state media outlets criticized American newspapers for coverage they described as biased.
HONG KONG -- An increasingly rancorous rivalry between the United States and China entered a new phase on Wednesday as Beijing accused the Trump administration of starting a diplomatic clash that led it to expel almost all American journalists from three newspapers.
The Chinese government cast its expulsion of the journalists from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post as necessary to defend Beijing against what it perceived as an ideological campaign by the United States to impose its values on China. Around a dozen reporters could be required to leave, in a move that Beijing said was reciprocation for the United States' forcing out of about 60 Chinese reporters, who worked for propaganda outlets, this month.
"The United States cannot proceed from ideological prejudice, use its own standards and likes and dislikes to judge the media of other countries, let alone suppress the Chinese media unreasonably," Geng Shuang, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said at a news conference in Beijing on Wednesday.
Beijing has said that the expulsions were a response to the Trump administration's decision to limit the number of Chinese citizens from five state-controlled media outlets who could work in the United States to 100. On Wednesday, the Chinese government indicated it was prepared to take more measures if needed.
"We urge the United States to immediately change its course, correct mistakes, and stop political suppression and unreasonable restrictions on Chinese media," said Mr. Geng. "If the United States insists on taking its own course, compounding mistakes, China will be forced to take further countermeasures."
The expulsions, not seen to such an extent in recent history, point to the governing Communist Party's growing resolve to strike back in all aspects of what is quickly becoming a bare-knuckled competition with the United States. Over the past year, tensions have escalated over issues ranging from trade deficits to technological capacity and military dominance, with bruising effect on American and Chinese companies, business executives, and even university students and academics.
The dispute over media access underlines how this new era of great power rivalry has extended into the marketplace of ideas. It not only signals a more muscular approach to foreign policy in China but also accords with the party's tightening grip over information under Xi Jinping, the country's authoritarian leader.
The expulsions "will definitely have a big influence" on relations between the two countries, said Zhan Jiang, a retired journalism professor at Beijing Foreign Studies University. "We've never really seen anything like this in the past 40 years. This shows the relations between the two sides have fallen into a deadlock, with neither side retreating."
Under Mr. Xi, the news media has come under an increasingly tight grip and foreign reporters who displease the authorities have been punished with visa denials. In recent weeks, as the coronavirus spread through China, the government has cracked down on domestic and foreign reporting, muzzling medical professionals and censoring and removing reports and commentaries online that have challenged the official narrative.
On Tuesday, China went even further, requiring all American journalists for the three newspapers whose credentials expire by the end of the year to turn in their press cards within 10 days. It said they would not be allowed to continue working as journalists in China.
In an unusual move, it said the Americans were also forbidden from working as journalists in Macau or Hong Kong, two semiautonomous Chinese territories that have traditionally had greater protections for press freedom than the mainland.
The American news outlets criticized the Chinese government's decision. On Wednesday, American officials were discussing what measures to take in response, including further retaliatory actions against official Chinese interests in the United States. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday called the expulsions "unfortunate" and said he hoped China would reconsider.
Mr. Pompeo maintained there was a fundamental difference between the expelled American reporters, who are employed by independent media outlets, and the expelled Chinese journalists, who work for a state propaganda machine.
In its official rhetoric, the Chinese government has cast its decision as a matter of diplomacy. But its own comments and reports in state-run news outlets indicated that Beijing, which often accuses the Western media of bias, also takes issue with the three American news outlets' reporting on China.
"We reject ideological bias against China, reject fake news made in the name of press freedom, reject breaches of ethics in journalism," tweeted Hua Chunying, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman.
An article from The Global Times, a stridently nationalistic tabloid controlled by the party, criticized the The New York Times's coverage of the coronavirus outbreak, the monthslong antigovernment protests in Hong Kong, and the Chinese authorities' internment of ethnic-minority Muslims in far western Xinjiang. The paper's coverage of the epidemic, the article said, was "aiming to attack China's political system and smear China's efforts" to contain the virus.
It said reports by the Times and other outlets about the government's policies in the Xinjiang region had "smeared and attacked China without basis."
China also said it was requiring the three outlets as well as Time magazine and Voice of America to disclose details of their staff, assets and operations in China.
The action would affect at least 13 American journalists but the number could be higher, the Foreign Correspondents' Club of China said in a statement on Wednesday.
The organization said the expulsion "diminishes us in number and in spirit, though not in our commitment to vigorously cover China. There are no winners in the use of journalists as diplomatic pawns by the world's two pre-eminent economic powers."
The Global Times echoed this in an editorial on Wednesday that accused Washington of starting the tit-for-tat. "As a Chinese media, we regret that the conflict between China and the United States has escalated due to political differences," it said. Both Chinese and American journalists, it added, were "implicated by political frictions between China and the United States."
The cycle of retaliation began when China expelled three Journal reporters over a headline last month, "China Is the Real Sick Man of Asia," on an op-ed column about the country's coronavirus response efforts.
In recent days, The People's Daily, a Communist Party mouthpiece, and China Daily, a state-run newspaper, posted messages that circulated widely on China's Twitter-like forum Weibo targeting The Times for what they called "double standards" in its tweets about the lockdown imposed in China and in Italy to curb the spread of the virus.
Some questions remained unanswered, including how and whether the Hong Kong government would take further steps to enforce Beijing's expulsion. Hong Kong operates under a political formula known as "one country, two systems," which promises the Chinese territory a high degree of autonomy, including independent courts, a free news media and extensive protections of civil liberties.
Many global news organizations use Hong Kong as headquarters for the Asia region. Under the Basic Law, Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the region has jurisdiction over immigration matters. If Hong Kong refused to allow the journalists to work in the city, it would be seen by some critics as the latest sign of eroding freedoms in the territory.
On Wednesday, Mr. Geng said the action taken by Beijing was diplomatic in nature, and thus fell under the central government's authority, not that of Hong Kong.
But some of Hong Kong's pro-democracy lawmakers rejected the argument and threatened to request a judicial review if any of the American reporters were turned away at Hong Kong's border.
"Carrie Lam doesn't have to follow exactly what Beijing says," said Dennis Kwok, a pro-democracy lawmaker who represents Hong Kong's legal sector, referring to Hong Kong's leader. "If she has any integrity left, she can say this is Hong Kong and we have freedom of the press."
Claudia Mo, another lawmaker, said Beijing was using the situation as an opportunity to "shut down the free flow of information."
"Rule of law is quite dead in Hong Kong, we knew," Ms. Mo said in a news conference in Hong Kong.
"Free flow of information, they're telling us, forget about it."

In Ousting U.S. Reporters, China Signals New Kind of Self-Confidence

Texto completo: Western media once served as a useful tool. Now Beijing seeks to shape its own narrative, further widening the gulf between China and the world.
When China wanted to broadcast that it was ready to open to the world, Deng Xiaoping, then its paramount leader, told the Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci that Mao Zedong's portrait would hang over Tiananmen Square forever -- and that Beijing would welcome some elements of capitalism.
When China wanted to join the World Trade Organization, Jiang Zemin, one of Deng's successors, quoted the Gettysburg Address on "60 Minutes" and joined Mike Wallace for a few bars of "O Sole Mio."
When Beijing wanted to send a message in 2001 about official accountability over the deaths of three dozen schoolchildren who had been illegally working in a fireworks factory, Zhu Rongji, the country's economic czar, answered a question about the episode at a nationally televised news conference with the foreign media.
China has long had a fraught relationship with foreign reporters. The government censors international media outlets and frequently harasses journalists. Yet it has long recognized that the Western media fulfills an essential need. It can convey messages to the world, and sometimes to the Chinese public, more clearly and bluntly than local media. It also offers an unflinching window into what is happening in China, a country where even the leadership doesn't always trust the information it gets.
On Tuesday, that understanding broke down in dramatic fashion.
The Chinese government said it would oust mainland-based American reporters working for The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post. The order, which a journalists' association said would affect more than a dozen reporters, was the Chinese Communist Party's harshest attack on the foreign media in the modern era.
A diplomatic spat with the United States, which had slashed the number of visas it would grant to employees of Chinese state media outlets, was the principal reason. Still, the expulsions also serve as a sharp signal that Beijing feels it no longer needs the foreign media to reach the world.
The Communist Party has honed its domestic propaganda machine into an effective tool for the digital age. Its state-run media organs have built broadcast operations in the United States and around the world. On Twitter and other international platforms, its diplomats and state media relentlessly attack critics.
Like President Trump in the United States, populist leaders around world, including Beijing, have learned to use Twitter and other social media to bypass the traditional mainstream media and serve up their own messages on their own terms.
"Suspect that they had long waited for such an excuse to drive out these unwelcome elements of 'peaceful evolution,"' Yinan He, a professor at Lehigh University, posted on Twitter, citing a term used in China that refers to a Western conspiracy to transform the country into a democracy -- a shift that the government says would inevitably lead to chaos.
But China puts itself at risk by silencing outside voices. The expulsions signal that Beijing has accelerated its steps to further decouple from the United States politically, to silence dissent and to close itself off to the outside world -- in other words, walking back the steps the country has taken over the decades to make itself a more open and prosperous society.
China needs voices inside and outside the country to point out problems. State media now argues that China has, within its own borders, tamed the coronavirus outbreak that originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan and now threatens the world economy. But Chinese officials silenced those who tried to warn the country and the world about the outbreak, to disastrous results.
The Communist Party has a long history of opening up to the Western media when it needs to win over the outside world, and of becoming more hostile when it wants to close off the country.
Mao famously courted Edgar Snow and other Western journalists when the Communists fought a civil war for control of the country. Coverage from mainstream Western media outlets in the World War II era helped shift public opinion about the party both inside and outside the country.
After the Communist Party took power in 1949, it cut ties with the West, expelled foreign journalists and jailed Chinese people who had worked for foreign media outlets. When it decided to open up to the world again in the 1980s, it welcomed back The Times and others.
There have been many ups and downs in Beijing's relationship with the Western media since. Under Mr. Jiang and Mr. Zhu, China charmed the global media to portray the country as an open economy worthy of joining the W.T.O., the global club of major trading countries.
Two months before the W.T.O. decided on China's membership, Mr. Jiang told The Times's publisher and editors in Beijing that he hoped the Western world could understand China better. When asked why the Times website was blocked in China, he answered: "If you ask my view of The New York Times, my answer is it is a very good paper."
In the run-up to the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, the event China considered its coming-out party as a global power, the government eased restrictions on foreign journalists covering the country.
But China was never an easy place to cover. After the 1989 crackdown on Tiananmen Square protesters, Beijing expelled some foreign journalists.
China correspondents faced constant intimidation. Matthew Pottinger, a former Wall Street Journal correspondent in China and now the hawkish deputy national security adviser to Mr. Trump, wrote about being arrested and forced to flush his notes down a toilet. He wrote about being punched in the face in a Beijing Starbucks "by a government goon who was trying to keep me from investigating a Chinese company's sale of nuclear fuel to other countries."
The situation deteriorated after Xi Jinping came to power in late 2012. Mr. Xi demanded unstinting loyalty to the Communist Party from the Chinese news media and instructed them to enhance China's ability to shape its own narrative in the world.
Always viewing the foreign media with suspicion, the Chinese government has intensified its hostile tactics against Western journalists. My colleague Paul Mozur wrote about how he was followed, tracked and stopped from covering what was happening to the Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang, a prevalent reporting experience in the region.
The Foreign Correspondents' Club of China said that before the decision on Tuesday, Beijing had expelled nine foreign journalists since 2013. Since the beginning of 2019, at least 13 correspondents have been given truncated-term visas valid for six months or less. Since the beginning of 2020, three of those correspondents have been given one-month visas.
"By expelling journalists and keeping others in a state of visa uncertainty, China is overtly using its power in an attempt to influence overseas news coverage, by punishing those who publish information authorities see as unfavorable and wish to keep quiet," the correspondents' club said.
The party now feels it has other ways to reach a global audience.
The state-run Xinhua News Agency's English Twitter account has 12.6 million followers. The Communist Party's official newspaper, People's Daily, has seven million followers. The state broadcaster CGTN, an arm of the official broadcaster China Central Television, has 14 million followers.
In the past year, as the U.S.-China trade war intensified, China's diplomats "discovered" Twitter as well. Instead of playing the role of professional diplomats, a growing number of them post undiplomatic comments there. In recent days, Trump administration officials have expressed displeasure at unfounded suggestions from state media and diplomats that the coronavirus originated in the United States.
It's not clear how persuasive their tweets might be to the English-speaking world. But they are sure to please their bosses. They also please the many nationalistic Chinese people who read English and are eager to report about the assertive tweets by these diplomats back home.
Chinese officials have even adopted one of Mr. Trump's favorite phrases -- "fake news" -- to dismiss any outside media criticism. Gauging Chinese opinion is difficult, but signs indicate that that argument has found a receptive audience in China, just as it has among Mr. Trump's supporters in the United States.
"We reject ideological bias against China, reject fake news made in the name of press freedom, reject breaches of ethics in journalism," the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, posted on her Twitter account.
It was liked more than 3,700 times by Wednesday evening.

Texto completo: The controversy surrounding the proposed Oregon Village mixed-use development has caught the attention of The New York Times.
The Times on Tuesday published a lengthy article on the $120 million Manheim Township proposal that summarized the ongoing issue to date.
Headlined “A Plan to Develop Farmland in Amish Country Meets Resistance,” the story contrasts the position of the developers, the Hurst brothers, with the stance of the site’s Amish and Mennonite neighbors.
It also examines the differing views on whether the four-year-old proposal represents an example of “smart growth” or a blow to the county’s farm preservation movement.
Oregon Village is proposed for 76 acres along Oregon Pike, including the Oregon Dairy complex owned and operated by the Hurst brothers. It would replace the Oregon Dairy supermarket and restaurant with larger facilities, and add a hotel, offices and 554 residential units.
The proposal is slowly going through the township review process. Most recently, in June the township commissioners approved the development concept as a conditional use by a 3-2 vote. Two businesses and two farmers have appealed the decision to Lancaster County Court.
If the appeals are unsuccessful, the Hursts next would need to get a development plan approved, then obtain a host of permits, before they could start construction.

Media think there's never a bad time to call Trump and his supporters 'racist'

Texto completo: There’s a pandemic going on, but because there’s no bad time to call President Trump and his supporters racist, Thomas Edsall of the New York Times is out with a new column that asks, in earnest, “How Racist Is Trump’s Republican Party?”
Because Edsall is smart enough not to attach his own credibility to such an astoundingly offensive question, he farmed it out to a bunch of college professors and political scientists to kick around.
The result was exactly what you might expect — each of the experts defined racism specifically as the belief that certain races are inherently superior to others.
Just kidding! Edsall’s experts started that way, but it wasn’t long before you got to the part where racism is actually whatever liberals want it to be.
“My overall point is that we have forgotten what racism means,” Notre Dame political science professor Darren Davis told Edsall. “In doing so, we have focused attention on bigots and white nationalists and not held ordinary citizens accountable for beliefs that achieve the same ends.”
What’s an example of that? According to a Northwestern University professor, “President Trump’s or Steve King’s comments about certain types of immigrants being unassimilable or not sufficiently American and suggesting that other (e.g. white) immigrants do not have those characteristics.”
This is another way of saying that any criticism, complaint, or even recommendation on immigration is by its very nature racist.
This is another way of saying that if you believe in locking up criminals, putting limits on welfare, demanding standards on foreigners admitted into the country, you’re racist.
“Racist” has no actual meaning anymore because it means everything. That’s mostly by design, as the social justice ideology has made it less a term for describing someone’s attitudes and more so a weapon to use against anyone deemed to benefit from some unspecified “privilege.”
That’s why no one so much as blinks when the New York Times runs a column not asking if the president and his supporters (nearly half the country) are racist, but just how racist are they?
Oh, and because there’s never a bad time to call Trump a racist.

Trump knocks the New York Times for 'disgraceful' journalism of coronavirus coverage

Texto completo: President Trump criticized the coronavirus coverage of the New York Times, telling the paper they practiced “disgraceful” journalism this week.
“If they’re going to say things that are false, like the story that was written yesterday. Somebody — I think I know who, but they taped the conference call that I had with the governors. It was a good call. It was fine. I assume somebody is going to tape it,” Trump said during a press conference Tuesday in response to a question about fighting back against his critics. “They handed it to various people, and one of them was the New York Times, and the New York Times chose to write totally inaccurately about it.”
“It was a disgraceful thing. It was bad journalism,” he added. “But, you know, they do a lot of bad journalism. But, we respond to that. And actually, people get it, people get it.”
Trump also expressed the desire for a bipartisan response to the virus.
“No, I want it to be bipartisan, and nobody’s going to be better than me. But when they attack me or the people, these incredible people behind me, I’m not going to let them get away with it,” he said.
The New York Times and several other outlets appeared to misrepresent a phone call Trump had with governors across the nation by reporting that he essentially told them they were on their own and wouldn’t have the help of the federal government during the coronavirus outbreak.
New York Times editor Mara Gay was widely criticized on Twitter after posting a truncated version of Trump’s call, leaving out a crucial sentence that altered the context.
“Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment — try getting it yourselves. We will be backing you, but try getting it yourselves. Point of sales, much better, much more direct if you can get it yourself," the president told governors in a conference call Monday. "We will be backing you, but try getting it yourselves. Point of sales, much better, much more direct if you can get it yourself."
Gay left out the second sentence and simply tweeted, "Trump told governors this morning they are on their own: 'Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment — try getting it yourselves.”
Author and vocal Trump critic Jonah Goldberg said on Twitter in response to Gay’s tweet, “It is irresponsible to characterize his remarks this way."

China's Expulsion of American Journalists Raises Red Flags Over Hong Kong; Beijing bars expelled journalists from working in Hong Kong, encroaching on the financial hub's right to control its own immigration policy

Texto completo: HONG KONG—The Chinese government's move to ban more than a dozen journalists expelled from the mainland from reporting in Hong Kong heightened concerns about a further erosion of the city's relative autonomy.
Protests that rocked the city last year and sent it spiraling into recession were fueled by widespread public anger at signs of Beijing restricting freedoms in the city. Chinese leaders guaranteed Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy until 2047 under a 50-year agreement called "one country, two systems" with the former colonial power, the U.K.
Chinese authorities said they would be revoking the press credentials for American journalists working for The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times and the Washington Post, effectively expelling them from the country. Beijing said it was retaliation for restrictions placed by the Trump administration on the number of Chinese journalists working in the U.S.
In an unusual move, China's Foreign Ministry stipulated that the expelled foreign correspondents wouldn't be allowed to continue reporting in the Hong Kong and Macau special administrative regions. Previously, some journalists expelled from the mainland have relocated and worked in Hong Kong.
The action struck at the city government's right to control its own immigration policy, an encroachment that could affect the reputation of the business and financial hub. The announcement may further dent confidence in the rule of law in Hong Kong, especially among foreign investors who expressed alarm in 2018 when a foreign correspondent was expelled from the city for the first time.
The expulsions were a "necessary and reciprocal countermeasure China is compelled to take in response to the U.S. oppression of Chinese media," a spokesperson for China's Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong said Wednesday, adding that it was in accordance with Beijing's purview over foreign affairs in accordance with 'one country, two systems' and the Basic Law, Hong Kong's mini-constitution.
Under the Basic Law, immigration, including the power to permit or prohibit working, are exclusively matters for the Hong Kong government, said Sharron Fast, a media-law lecturer and deputy director of the University of Hong Kong's Journalism and Media Studies Centre. But, she added, Beijing has the final authority in cases that also trigger national-security and foreign-affairs concerns.
The Hong Kong government said late Wednesday that its Immigration Department would consider the circumstances of each case and act in accordance with laws and immigration policies. It didn't specifically address the cases of the expelled journalists.
Some local lawmakers and other critics questioned the legality of the move.
"I hope the government of Hong Kong will push back strongly on this gross infringement on its autonomy," said U.S. Rep. Jim McGovern (D., Mass.), who is the chair of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China. "It will be difficult to maintain the special U.S.-Hong Kong relationship moving forward if Beijing is constantly eroding the 'one country, two systems' framework."
In November, President Trump signed The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 , which requires the secretary of state to certify annually that Hong Kong is autonomous enough from Beijing to retain favored trading status with the U.S. The legislation opened the door for a number of possible punitive measures, such as sanctions, against officials found to be violating the city's agreed freedoms. The first report is due in a few months.
Beijing's decree to pre-emptively bar the journalists from the city is unprecedented and a blatant violation of the principle of 'one country, two systems,' said Alvin Yeung, a barrister, legislator and leader of the pro-democracy Civic Party. "It will only further reinforce the international community's impression that Hong Kong is losing its autonomy as China tightens its grip," he said.
The pronouncement creates significant uncertainty for international businesses that have previously operated under the assumption that their business in Hong Kong was insulated from politics, said Antony Dapiran, a corporate lawyer based in the city and author of the book "City on Fire: the Fight for Hong Kong."
In October 2018, Hong Kong authorities effectively expelled Victor Mallet, the Hong Kong-based Asia news editor for the Financial Times , after he hosted a press-club talk by an activist who had called for Hong Kong's independence from China, a speech that angered Beijing. Then, however, local authorities never publicly stated the reason for the visa denial.
The decision to not renew Mr. Mallet's visa provoked condemnation from the Hong Kong business and international communities. It was seen as a precursor of restrictions on foreign journalists working in Hong Kong that is now coming true, said Emily Lau, a former chairwoman of the city's Democratic Party.
Press freedom in Hong Kong is protected under the Basic Law and, along with wider free-speech protections and a separate legal system to China, is a major selling point used by the local government to attract foreign businesses to the international financial and trading center. The city is currently reeling from rising unemployment and collapsing retail and tourism industries hurt by protests and more recently, the coronavirus .
Journalists don't need specific press visas to report and several news organizations, including the Journal and the Times, maintain their regional headquarters in the city.

"As long as they meet the requirements for a work visa, they are free to do reporting in Hong Kong," said Chris Yeung, chairman of the Hong Kong Journalists Association. "That the Foreign Ministry has effectively directly applied the order in Hong Kong makes a mockery of the pledge of giving the city powers to handle its internal affairs."
U.S. citizens visiting Hong Kong for not more than three months aren't required to obtain visas, according to the consulate website.
Concerns about tightening press freedom grew throughout more than six months of protests in 2019, when many international correspondents flew in to help with coverage. Several journalism organizations condemned the Hong Kong police force's treatment of reporters covering events on the streets after some were injured.
The Foreign Correspondents' Club of Hong Kong expressed its alarm at China's expulsion order. It called on the Hong Kong government to immediately clarify the situation, and said if the independent decision-making of the local Immigration Department on the employment of foreign nationals had changed, it would "represent a serious erosion of the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle."
China has periodically expelled journalists whose work angered them. Many have then moved to Hong Kong and continued to report on China from the city.
"I feel sorry that they won't be able to report from Hong Kong, even though some of the reports are biased against the establishment," said Regina Ip, an adviser to the current local administration and a pro-establishment lawmaker. "It is important that Hong Kong remains an international media center as part of 'one country, two systems.'"

Formula maker fails to thrive

Texto completo: Like many first-time parents, Jon Borgese, a tech executive in Manhattan, had heard the buzz around the Baby Brezza formula maker, a countertop device that automatically dispenses warm bottles of formula at the touch of a button.
The $200 machine, widely available at retailers markets itself as the "most advanced way" to mix powdered baby formula and water "to perfect consistency."
But after Borgese and his wife, Nicole, started giving the machine-mixed formula bottles last year to their 2-month-old daughter, Lily, she became fussy and began to look thin, he said. The couple rushed her to the pediatrician, who confirmed that Lily was losing weight and sent her for medical tests to determine the cause.
The problem was the gadget, which had dispensed watery formula with insufficient nutrients, said Dr. Julie Capiola, Lily's pediatrician. Borgese said he had since filed two class-action lawsuits against the machine's maker, claiming the device was defective.
"You don't want any baby or any parent to go through this," he said, adding that Lily gained weight once the family stopped using the formula maker.
Borgese was one of many parents who have reported issues with the Baby Brezza formula machine, which was the top-selling baby feeding accessory in the United States over the last two years, according to the NPD Group, a market research company. On Amazon, Facebook, Better Business Bureau and parenting forums, people have posted more than 100 complaints saying the machines dispensed incorrect or inconsistent amounts of water or baby formula.
Separately, five pediatricians described to The New York Times how they had recently treated babies -- whose parents had fed them Brezza-dispensed bottles -- for failure to thrive, a condition caused by lack of nutrients. The doctors said the health risks could be even more severe because infants' digestive systems aren't developed enough to process formula that is too watery or too concentrated.
David Contract, marketing team lead for the Betesh Group, a private company in Newark, New Jersey, that makes the Baby Brezza devices, said the company had carefully calibrated the machines to work with more than 2,000 types of baby formulas and regularly tested the devices for precision. He said people must clean the machines frequently to prevent powder buildup, which could cause the systems to dispense watery formula. -- requirements he compared to installing infant car seats correctly.
"We are confident our machine works properly and accurately when it's used right," he said. He later added, "I do think there are people who don't use it properly, who get a bad outcome, who get a watery bottle because they're not cleaning; they're not using the right settings."
While the Food and Drug Administration regulates infant formula as a food and the Consumer Product Safety Commission oversees the safety of "durable" baby products like cribs, each agency initially said the other was responsible for vetting possible inaccuracies with automated baby formula-dispensing machines.
Last year, the CPSC received two reports from health care professionals about how babies who had been fed formula mixed by the Brezza devices had "lost significant weight" or "had to be evaluated after drinking the formula." Last month, the commission clarified that it was responsible for overseeing the devices and urged consumers to report any problems to saferproducts.gov.

Are play dates OK to pass the time?
It depends who you ask. Asaf Bitton, a Boston-based primary care physician, wrote a widely shared Medium piece calling on parents to commit to "no kid play
dates, parties, sleepovers or families/friends visiting each other's houses and apartments" during school and other closures related to coronavirus.
"This sounds extreme because it is," Bitton wrote. "We are trying to create distance between family units and between individuals. It may be particularly uncomfortable for families with small children, kids with differential abilities or challenges, and for kids who simply love to play with their friends. But even if you choose only one friend to have over, you are creating new links and possibilities for the type of transmission that all of our school/work/public event closures are trying to prevent. The symptoms of coronavirus take four to five days to manifest themselves. Someone who comes over looking well can transmit the virus."
On the other hand, infectious disease physician and epidemiologist Eli Perencevich told the New York Times that play dates are fine, with proper precautions, and trying to isolate yourselves and your kids from everyone else over the coming weeks "would be impossible."
"Dr. Perencevich recommended organizing play dates around an isolated outdoor activity," the New York Times reported. "Invite another child to come along on a family hike. Or have the kids run around in a big, uncrowded park, which will be less germy than a popular local playground."
(Bitton also weighed in on playgrounds: "If you have kids, try not to use public facilities like playground structures, as coronavirus can live on plastic and metal for up to nine days, and these structures aren't getting regularly cleaned.")
But temperatures are scheduled to hover around the high 30s/low 40s in Chicago for the next week or so. What about kids hanging out together indoors?
I called Scott Goldstein, a pediatrician at Northwestern Children's Practice and instructor of clinical pediatrics at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine, to get his input.
"There's no one right way of handling this," Goldstein said. "The American Academy of Pediatrics hasn't put out a specific recommendation saying, 'Stay at home and don't do play dates.' And you go online, and everybody has their viewpoints and I'm seeing a lot of parent-shaming, which isn't helpful."
If play dates are optional -- you don't need to host a child whose parents have to go to work or attend to something mandatory; you don't need to drop your child at a friend's house for similar reasons -- "it's probably best to avoid them," Goldstein said.
But he didn't want to go as far as Bitton and outright ban small, social get-togethers.
"If nobody in your house is sick and nobody in the other house is sick and you want to get a couple of kids who are not sick together to do something creative," he said, "I think that's something a reasonable person could feel comfortable with."
He emphasized that the risk of contracting coronavirus remains low for children and that the vast majority of people who do contract the illness don't experience severe symptoms.
But there is wisdom, he said, in trying to "flatten the curve," meaning we each do our part to limit how fast and far the virus spreads by taking social distancing measures where we can.
"Before this blew up, a lot of people, even me, were saying, 'This is something that just has to run its course like the flu does every year, and people are going to get it, and some people are going to get sick like they do with any virus and then it's going to go away,'" Goldstein said.
"But then it became more clear that people are getting more sick from this than they do with your typical flu season," he continued, "and the body doesn't have any natural immunity to it, and we have no treatment for it except to put people in the hospital and support them with whatever they need -- whether it's oxygen or IV fluid. And if you just let it go unchecked, you're going to have this exponential growth of people getting infected, and it's just going to overwhelm the health care system because you can't provide people the support they need because there's just no space to do it -- not enough doctors, not enough equipment, not enough nurses. So the idea with flattening the curve is that if you limit the exposure to people, it's going to build up at a much slower level, which makes the peak much lower, which lets the health care system accommodate the sick people, which also then prevents them from spreading it."
I like that approach. I'm going to do everything in my power to adopt that approach, I told Goldstein, including not letting my kids have friends over or go to friends' houses while their schools are closed through March 30.
"Everybody is going to have their own comfort level," he said. "There's no one right approach."
And no two families' lives or schedules or sets of needs look the same, I realize.
But for me? With the privilege of a job that allows me to work from home, and a budget that allows me to buy groceries and supplies ahead of time, and a (thus far) generally healthy family that doesn't have to venture out to address a chronic medical condition? I'm going to hunker down and try to flatten that dang curve.
"The big burden of flattening the curve has already been put on families by canceling school and all activities," Goldstein said. "That's a huge way of flattening the curve, and that's going to go a long way toward helping, way more than one person not having one play date."
Fair enough. These are scary times, and the recommendations and statistics are changing rapidly. I certainly don't want to judge anyone's approach to this pandemic. (Except the guy who bought up 17,700 bottles of hand sanitizer. I definitely judge him.)
But I also love this quote from Mari Armstrong-Hough, an epidemiologist and assistant professor of global public health at New York University, who tweeted, "You won't ever know if what you did personally helped. That's the nature of public health. When the best way to save lives is to prevent a disease rather than treat it, success often looks like an overreaction."

Texto completo: With the coronavirus spreading throughout the U.S., Americans are reacting in a variety of ways. Some of them are smart, others ... not so much.
Staying away from big crowds, stocking up on prescription medication and food in case of in-home isolation and washing hands frequently are all wise in the face of a pandemic that is spread through virus-laden droplets sneezed or coughed by sick people.
On the other hand, hoarding enormous quantities of toilet paper, crates of bottled water or five-year supplies of hand sanitizer as if the end is nigh is irrational and unhelpful to your fellow citizens. For one thing, public health experts say the best way to clean germy hands is to wash them with soap and water. It could also be counterproductive to deny hand sanitizer to others, who could use it to avoid spreading the infection to you. And even though the virus isn't going away tomorrow, medicine to treat coronavirus infections is expected in the coming months. A vaccine could be ready sometime next year.
And then there are simply idiotic and selfish reactions, such as stealing stocks of medical facemasks from hospitals and research facilities, as has been reported in the United States. The nation already has a woefully inadequate supply of facemasks, and taking protective gear away from those who work with sick people endangers everyone.
Panicking in the face of pandemic might make sense in a fictional zombie apocalypse, where 100% of those infected turn into flesh-eating monsters, but this kind of selfish and irrational behavior could very well make the coronavirus outbreak worse for everyone else.
Of course, people should be concerned and take extraordinary-but-rational precautions to avoid coming down with COVID-19 - for themselves, but also for others in the community who are at higher risk for serious illness or death, such as elderly people and those with underlying health conditions.
And it's true that health officials have good reasons to be more alarmed by the new virus than the seasonal influenza, despite the fact that the former is responsible for far fewer deaths this year than the latter. But the reality is that the vast majority of people who get infected will have moderate, mild or even no symptoms. There's simply no good reason for the masses to freak out.
As testing ramps up after a troubling delay, the number of confirmed cases will most likely rise quickly. Same with the global death toll. As this happens, people need to hold their panic level in check.
This means:
*Not demanding diagnostic tests from health care providers if you are well and have had no known contact with a sick person. The U.S. has a shortage of testing kits, and priority should be given to those showing signs of illness or with documented exposure, not to nervous germophobes.
*Not buying into "miracle cures," such the drinkable silver concoction that televangelist Jim Bakker has been hawking on his show that he claims can cure people of a COVID-19 infection in 12 hours. It can't; in fact, no cure has been found. There's got to be a special place in hell for those who are profiteering from this outbreak.
*Being skeptical of home remedies shared by friends that supposedly offer protections from infection, such as a shaving off facial hair (a myth that stemmed from respiratory safety poster for health providers from 2017) or avoiding ice cream and other cold food.
*Showing compassion, rather than distrust and disdain, for those who are infected or are self-quarantining to protect the rest of us.
*And having patience with state and local government officials who are grappling with difficult decisions and trying to walk the line between complacency and overreaction to protect the community. Does it make sense for an entire country to quarantine, as Italy has done? We will only know in hindsight.
With the stock market seesawing and our usual work or school routines disrupted, it may feel a bit like the end of the world as we know it. It's not, and we should act accordingly. Be careful, be responsible, but don't give in to pandemic panic.

Texto completo: Like many first-time parents, Jon Borgese, a tech executive in Manhattan, had heard the buzz around the Baby Brezza formula maker, a countertop device that automatically dispenses warm bottles of formula at the touch of a button.
The $200 machine, widely available at retailers markets itself as the "most advanced way" to mix powdered baby formula and water "to perfect consistency."
But after Borgese and his wife, Nicole, started giving the machine-mixed formula bottles last year to their 2-month-old daughter, Lily, she became fussy and began to look thin, he said. The couple rushed her to the pediatrician, who confirmed that Lily was losing weight and sent her for medical tests to determine the cause.
The problem was the gadget, which had dispensed watery formula with insufficient nutrients, said Dr. Julie Capiola, Lily's pediatrician. Borgese said he had since filed two class-action lawsuits against the machine's maker, claiming the device was defective.
"You don't want any baby or any parent to go through this," he said, adding that Lily gained weight once the family stopped using the formula maker.
Borgese was one of many parents who have reported issues with the Baby Brezza formula machine, which was the top-selling baby feeding accessory in the United States over the last two years, according to the NPD Group, a market research company. On Amazon, Facebook, Better Business Bureau and parenting forums, people have posted more than 100 complaints saying the machines dispensed incorrect or inconsistent amounts of water or baby formula.
Separately, five pediatricians described to The New York Times how they had recently treated babies - whose parents had fed them Brezza-dispensed bottles - for failure to thrive, a condition caused by lack of nutrients. The doctors said the health risks could be even more severe because infants' digestive systems aren't developed enough to process formula that is too watery or too concentrated.
David Contract, marketing team lead for the Betesh Group, a private company in Newark, New Jersey, that makes the Baby Brezza devices, said the company had carefully calibrated the machines to work with more than 2,000 types of baby formulas and regularly tested the devices for precision. He said people must clean the machines frequently to prevent powder buildup, which could cause the systems to dispense watery formula. - requirements he compared to installing infant car seats correctly.
"We are confident our machine works properly and accurately when it's used right," he said. He later added, "I do think there are people who don't use it properly, who get a bad outcome, who get a watery bottle because they're not cleaning; they're not using the right settings."
While the Food and Drug Administration regulates infant formula as a food and the Consumer Product Safety Commission oversees the safety of "durable" baby products like cribs, each agency initially said the other was responsible for vetting possible inaccuracies with automated baby formula-dispensing machines.
Last year, the CPSC received two reports from health care professionals about how babies who had been fed formula mixed by the Brezza devices had "lost significant weight" or "had to be evaluated after drinking the formula." Last month, the commission clarified that it was responsible for overseeing the devices and urged consumers to report any problems to saferproducts.gov.

Texto completo: Like many first-time parents, Jon Borgese, a tech executive in Manhattan, had heard the buzz around the Baby Brezza formula maker, a countertop device that automatically dispenses warm bottles of formula at the touch of a button.
The $200 machine, widely available at retailers markets itself as the "most advanced way" to mix powdered baby formula and water "to perfect consistency."
But after Borgese and his wife, Nicole, started giving the machine-mixed formula bottles last year to their 2-month-old daughter, Lily, she became fussy and began to look thin, he said. The couple rushed her to the pediatrician, who confirmed that Lily was losing weight and sent her for medical tests to determine the cause.
The problem was the gadget, which had dispensed watery formula with insufficient nutrients, said Dr. Julie Capiola, Lily's pediatrician. Borgese said he had since filed two class-action lawsuits against the machine's maker, claiming the device was defective.
"You don't want any baby or any parent to go through this," he said, adding that Lily gained weight once the family stopped using the formula maker.
Borgese was one of many parents who have reported issues with the Baby Brezza formula machine, which was the top-selling baby feeding accessory in the United States over the last two years, according to the NPD Group, a market research company. On Amazon, Facebook, Better Business Bureau and parenting forums, people have posted more than 100 complaints saying the machines dispensed incorrect or inconsistent amounts of water or baby formula.
Separately, five pediatricians described to The New York Times how they had recently treated babies - whose parents had fed them Brezza-dispensed bottles - for failure to thrive, a condition caused by lack of nutrients. The doctors said the health risks could be even more severe because infants' digestive systems aren't developed enough to process formula that is too watery or too concentrated.
David Contract, marketing team lead for the Betesh Group, a private company in Newark, New Jersey, that makes the Baby Brezza devices, said the company had carefully calibrated the machines to work with more than 2,000 types of baby formulas and regularly tested the devices for precision. He said people must clean the machines frequently to prevent powder buildup, which could cause the systems to dispense watery formula. - requirements he compared to installing infant car seats correctly.
"We are confident our machine works properly and accurately when it's used right," he said. He later added, "I do think there are people who don't use it properly, who get a bad outcome, who get a watery bottle because they're not cleaning; they're not using the right settings."
While the Food and Drug Administration regulates infant formula as a food and the Consumer Product Safety Commission oversees the safety of "durable" baby products like cribs, each agency initially said the other was responsible for vetting possible inaccuracies with automated baby formula-dispensing machines.
Last year, the CPSC received two reports from health care professionals about how babies who had been fed formula mixed by the Brezza devices had "lost significant weight" or "had to be evaluated after drinking the formula." Last month, the commission clarified that it was responsible for overseeing the devices and urged consumers to report any problems to saferproducts.gov.

Texto completo: Mandy Moore never thought she'd release another album.
In the late '90s and early 2000s, the Emmy-nominated "This Is Us" actress enjoyed success as a teen pop star, scoring infectious hits in "Candy," "In My Pocket" and "I Wanna Be With You," and touring with 'NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys. But her singing career came grinding to a halt after the release of her sixth album, "Amanda Leigh," in 2009, the same year she married musician Ryan Adams.
In a devastating interview with The New York Times last year, Moore detailed how Adams wrested control of her career, saying he refused to record songs they wrote together and undermined her as an artist.
In the years after their 2016 divorce, "there was a lot of work I had to do to reframe my idea of whether or not I was still a musician," Moore tells USA TODAY. "There was a big conversation around legitimacy, and a lot of baggage I had to drop in order to find my way back to the music landscape."
That emotional journey is what led her to "Silver Landings," out now, an achingly vulnerable album that builds on the '70s-influenced folk pop of her previous efforts. She started writing in earnest about 18 months ago with producer Mike Viola (Jenny Lewis, Shania Twain) and husband Taylor Goldsmith, lead singer of indie rock band Dawes, whom she married in 2018.
Moore, 35, talks with USA TODAY about her new album and U.S. tour, which kicks off March 20 in Pittsburgh.
Question: What made you want to start writing music again?
Mandy Moore: I think it all started when I started dating my husband (Goldsmith). Traveling around with them, they're an incredible live band and have so much fun on stage – it's really contagious. And I remember one of the first times watching Taylor thinking, "I'm kind of jealous because I want to be up there. I miss this so much." It was a real light-bulb moment of, "I have to figure out a way to find myself on stage again."
Then having music interwoven into my character's backstory on "This is Us," having to go into the recording studio and make music even in the very beginning of Season 1. That was a revelation for me as well, like, "Oh, I remember how to do this. I love this." But for a long time, I leaned on the excuse of, "I want to do it, but I don't have a music manager or a record label anymore. I wouldn't even know how any of this works." So I had to work my way into realizing it just starts with the song. I just have to write and then everything else will fall into place. That's what happened with this record.
Q: Writing and recording with Taylor on this album, were you able to leave work in the studio or was it a constant in your home?
Moore: Living with and being married to a songwriter as prolific as Taylor, there's constantly a guitar in his hand or a piano being played or a record on. Music is inescapable in our house, so we were always discussing things and I was constantly inspired. I very much felt like I had the ultimate partner and collaborator in Taylor. He was so happy to be by my side and helped usher me into this next chapter of my life. It takes a certain kind of person to be able to support your partner in that way and not let your ego infuse the experience. It only has strengthened our relationship and made us closer. Honestly, the idea of being able to go on the road, and look to my left every night and see his face playing and singing with me, is a dream come true in every cheesy sense of the term. I'm just so beside myself with excitement, I can't wait.
Q: Have you guys laid out any ground rules for touring together yet? (Goldsmith's band Dawes will join her on the road.)
Moore: Well, we're all coupled up. Most of us are married, so there's not going to be any crazy, debaucherous behavior on the road. No one's a big partyer and I don't drink when I'm touring because I don't like to dry my vocal cords out. So I think it'll be a fairly mellow tour across the country with my favorite people in the world. But I hope maybe they'll be a little cleaner in the bathroom, knowing there is a lady there 24/7 now. Hopefully their aim will be a little bit more accurate – that's probably all I ask of them.
Q: Last year, you came forward with other brave women and talked about your emotionally abusive relationship (with ex-husband Ryan Adams) in The New York Times. Why was that important for you to do?
Moore: It was important to be a part of a community of women who were giving a voice to an issue and a conversation that I think a lot of women were desperate to be having around psychological and emotional abuse. The outpouring and wealth of support all of us received in the wake of that story was tremendously moving. And it's a conversation we need to continue having. I'm happy to have been part of that jumping-off point, but I'm also happy to have told that story and to be able to move forward now, and not be impeded by my past.
Q: And how does it feel now, to not only have shared your story but to finally have personal and artistic freedom?
Moore: It's emotional, and it's all starting to hit me. It's sort of come in waves over the last year of the writing and recording process – it's like every little step has been something new for me to really stop and appreciate and reckon with, and I think touring won't be an exception. But I'm really proud to be making music again on my own terms and I'm excited about the future. And I'm really looking forward to keeping this momentum going. I don't want to have another 10, 11-year lapse in between albums. I feel like I've found this incredible team of collaborators in Mike and Taylor, and I just look forward to seeing what we'll do together on this tour and beyond.

Are play dates are okay?

Texto completo: Chicago Tribune
Time's about to get reeeeeal heavy on our hands, especially with restless, bored kids – from infants on up to college students – suddenly home from day care, school and pretty much every extracurricular activity, in an unprecedented attempt to curb the spread of a global coronavirus pandemic.
Are play dates OK to pass the time?
It depends who you ask. Asaf Bitton, a Boston-based primary care physician, wrote a widely shared Medium piece calling on parents to commit to “no kid playdates, parties, sleepovers or families/friends visiting each other's houses and apartments” during school and other closures related to coronavirus.
“This sounds extreme because it is,” Bitton wrote. “We are trying to create distance between family units and between individuals. It may be particularly uncomfortable for families with small children, kids with differential abilities or challenges, and for kids who simply love to play with their friends. But even if you choose only one friend to have over, you are creating new links and possibilities for the type of transmission that all of our school/work/public event closures are trying to prevent. The symptoms of coronavirus take four to five days to manifest themselves. Someone who comes over looking well can transmit the virus.”
On the other hand, infectious disease physician and epidemiologist Eli Perencevich told the New York Times that play dates are fine, with proper precautions, and trying to isolate yourselves and your kids from everyone else over the coming weeks “would be impossible.”
“Dr. Perencevich recommended organizing play dates around an isolated outdoor activity,” the New York Times reported. “Invite another child to come along on a family hike. Or have the kids run around in a big, uncrowded park, which will be less germy than a popular local playground.”
I called Scott Goldstein, a pediatrician at Northwestern Children's Practice and instructor of clinical pediatrics at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine, to get his input.
“There's no one right way of handling this,” Goldstein said. “The American Academy of Pediatrics hasn't put out a specific recommendation saying, ‘Stay at home and don't do play dates.' And you go online, and everybody has their viewpoints and I'm seeing a lot of parent-shaming, which isn't helpful.”
If play dates are optional – you don't need to host a child whose parents have to go to work or attend to something mandatory; you don't need to drop your child at a friend's house for similar reasons – “it's probably best to avoid them,” Goldstein said.
But he didn't want to go as far as Bitton and outright ban small, social get-togethers.
“If nobody in your house is sick and nobody in the other house is sick and you want to get a couple of kids who are not sick together to do something creative,” he said, “I think that's something a reasonable person could feel comfortable with.”
He emphasized that the risk of contracting coronavirus remains low for children and that the vast majority of people who do contract the illness don't experience severe symptoms.
But there is wisdom, he said, in trying to “flatten the curve,” meaning we each do our part to limit how fast and far the virus spreads by taking social distancing measures where we can.
“Before this blew up, a lot of people, even me, were saying, ‘This is something that just has to run its course like the flu does every year, and people are going to get it, and some people are going to get sick like they do with any virus and then it's going to go away,' ” Goldstein said.
“But then it became more clear that people are getting more sick from this than they do with your typical flu season. ... So the idea with flattening the curve is that if you limit the exposure to people, it's going to build up at a much slower level, which makes the peak much lower, which lets the health care system accommodate the sick people, which also then prevents them from spreading it.”
I like that approach. I'm going to do everything in my power to adopt that approach, I told Goldstein, including not letting my kids have friends over or go to friends' houses while their schools are closed through March 30.
“Everybody is going to have their own comfort level,” he said. “There's no one right approach.”
And no two families' lives or schedules or sets of needs look the same, I realize.
But for me? With the privilege of a job that allows me to work from home, and a budget that allows me to buy groceries and supplies ahead of time, and a (thus far) generally healthy family that doesn't have to venture out to address a chronic medical condition: I'm going to hunker down and try to flatten that dang curve.
“The big burden of flattening the curve has already been put on families by canceling school and all activities,” Goldstein said. “That's a huge way of flattening the curve, and that's going to go a long way toward helping, way more than one person not having one play date.”
Fair enough. These are scary times, and the recommendations and statistics are changing rapidly. I certainly don't want to judge anyone's approach to this pandemic.

Texto completo: BEIJING—China said it would revoke the press credentials of Americans working for three major U.S. newspapers in the largest expulsion of foreign journalists in the post-Mao era, amid an escalating battle with the Trump administration over media operating in the two countries.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Wednesday it was demanding all U.S. nationals working for The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times and the Washington Post whose credentials expire by the end of the year turn those credentials in within 10 days.
The measure would affect most of the U.S. journalists working at those newspapers in China, which issues press credentials for up to 12 months and has recently limited them to six and, in some cases, as little as one month.
The affected reporters won't be allowed to report anywhere in China, including the semiautonomous territories of Hong Kong and Macau, the statement said.
It also ordered the three newspapers and two other media outlets—Voice of America and Time magazine—to submit information about staff, finances, operations and real estate in China.
The move heightens tensions between the U.S. and China, the world's two biggest economies, which have been engaged in a trade war over the past two years. The fight recently spilled into the media sphere as the two countries forced the departure of journalists or staff from each others' media outlets.
The U.S. National Security Council, in a pair of tweets on Tuesday, criticized China's latest action. "The Chinese Communist Party's decision to expel journalists from China and Hong Kong is yet another step toward depriving the Chinese people and the world of access to true information about China," the NSC wrote. In another tweet, the White House called on China to instead focus on helping the world combat coronavirus, which the NSC pointedly described as the "Wuhan coronavirus."
The actions are "reciprocal countermeasures that China is compelled to take in response to the unreasonable oppression the Chinese media organizations experience in the U.S.," China's Foreign Ministry said.
On March 2, the Trump administration announced a personnel cap on four state-run Chinese media outlets—Xinhua News Agency, China Radio International, China Global Television Network and China Daily—forcing them to reduce their Chinese employees in the U.S. to 100 in total, from 160.
That move came shortly after China expelled three Journal reporters over a headline on an Opinion column.
Before that the White House had reclassified state-run Chinese media news organizations as "foreign missions," requiring them to declare their personnel and property to the State Department.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo disputed the Chinese government's contention that its action came in response to the Trump administration's measures.
"This isn't apples to apples," Mr. Pompeo told reporters at the State Department. "You all know the press freedoms you have…We know that that kind of freedom doesn't exist inside of China."
He said the individuals affected by the U.S. policy decision are employed not by independent media organizations, but by "Chinese propaganda outlets." He said he hoped Beijing would reconsider its decision.
Although Chinese officials claim to want others to better understand events inside China, Mr. Pompeo said, Beijing works to "deny the world the capacity to know what's really going on" there.
Matt Murray, editor in chief of the Journal, said in a tweet : "China's unprecedented attack on freedom of the press comes at a time of unparalleled global crisis. Trusted news reporting from and about China has never been more important. We oppose government interference with a free press anywhere in the world."
"Our commitment to reporting fully and deeply on China is unchanged," Mr. Murray added.
The Journal had previously condemned the expulsion in February of three reporters over an opinion headline, "the real sick man of Asia"—a phrase used historically to refer to the exploitation of a weakened China by European powers and Japan in the late 1800s and early 1900s. China's Foreign Ministry and state-media outlets had repeatedly called attention to the headline, which prompted widespread anger in China, and threatened unspecified consequences.
Washington Post Executive Editor Marty Baron said the paper condemned Tuesday's expulsion of U.S. reporters.
"The Chinese government's decision is particularly regrettable because it comes in the midst of an unprecedented global crisis, when clear and reliable information about the international response to covid-19 is essential. Severely limiting the flow of that information, which China now seeks to do, only aggravates the situation," Mr. Baron said.
New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet condemned the move, noting that reporters from his paper had worked in the country since the 1850s. "It is critical that the governments of the United States and China move quickly to resolve this dispute and allow journalists to do the important work of informing the public. The health and safety of people around the world depend on impartial reporting about its two largest economies, both of them now battling a common epidemic," he said.
Time magazine Editor in Chief Ed Felsenthal said the magazine opposes restrictions on the free press anywhere in the world.
Voice of America Director Amanda Bennett said: "We remain committed to continuing to serve as a consistently reliable, trusted and authoritative source of news to our Chinese-speaking audiences."
China has become increasingly combative with foreign media in recent years under leader Xi Jinping, as the government has attempted to exert greater control over information. Prior to the three Journal reporters in February, China hadn't expelled a credentialed foreign correspondent since 1998.
Steven Butler, the Asia program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists, urged Beijing and Washington to "negotiate to solve their differences and stop taking measures that cripple news reporting during a global pandemic, when the public's need for accurate information is greater than ever."
Some 37 American news organizations had 98 accredited reporters based in China, primarily in Beijing, according to a roster published by China's foreign ministry in July last year. The tally doesn't account for the ejections of four Wall Street Journal reporters since then, or for other changes in personnel.
In China, press credentials are issued by the Foreign Ministry to non-Chinese journalists. The credentials are necessary to receive a journalist visa in China. The Wednesday announcement didn't mention the visas themselves, but the revocation would effectively deprive the American journalists of the legal authorization to work in China.
The Foreign Correspondents' Club of China said it deplored the Chinese government's decision and that it affected at least 13 reporters.
"There are no winners in the use of journalists as diplomatic pawns by the world's two pre-eminent economic powers," the club said Wednesday.
China had expelled nine foreign reporters since 2013 before Tuesday's action, according to the club, which promotes press freedoms. It added that 13 foreign reporters have been given truncated visas of six months or less since the beginning of 2019.
"Journalists illuminate the world we live in. China, through this action, is dimming itself," it said.

Texto completo: The Japanese conglomerate is said to be reconsidering the part of its bailout of WeWork that would have left founder Adam Neumann with a huge payday.
SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate, is threatening to withdraw an offer to acquire a much larger stake in WeWork, according to a person familiar with the matter. The surprise move comes as the coronavirus outbreak diminishes demand for the troubled company's shared office space.
SoftBank, the largest outside shareholder in WeWork, in October agreed to a multibillion-dollar bailout after the company nearly ran out of cash. As part of the transaction, SoftBank agreed to buy up to $ 3 billion in stock from existing WeWork shareholders, including nearly $ 1 billion from Adam Neumann, WeWork's co-founder who stepped down as chief executive in September. SoftBank also invested $ 1.5 billion as part of its rescue package and agreed to lend up to $ 5 billion to WeWork, a commitment that it has not withdrawn.
While SoftBank is still supporting WeWork, the possibility that it may own a smaller than expected share of the company could dent confidence in the business at a critical time. As more businesses ask employees to work from home and freelancers choose to avoid shared office spaces, WeWork could, over time, lose many of its paying customers.
In a letter sent to WeWork shareholders on Tuesday, SoftBank offered several reasons the deal might not go through by its scheduled April 1 closing date, according to the person familiar with the matter. Among the reasons SoftBank cited were investigations into WeWork by the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and attorneys general in New York and California. The two sides have also failed to agree on the terms for consolidating a WeWork joint venture in China.
A WeWork representative declined to comment. News of SoftBank's threat was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.
Mr. Neumann left WeWork as it was trying to salvage an initial public offering, which it later withdrew. Investors balked at his leadership and transactions WeWork did with him that created potential conflicts of interest.
The terms of the rescue agreement were not made public. Going into the deal, Mr. Neumann had a strong hand because he was the largest individual shareholder in the company, and his shares entitled him to more than one vote each on corporate decisions. The person familiar with the letter said Mr. Neumann transferred his votes to WeWork's board in return for a $ 185 million payment that was agreed to last year.
Still, as recently as December a SoftBank executive said it was important for the conglomerate to amass a bigger stake in WeWork.
"In order for us to have the economic interest that we want, we have to buy shares," Marcelo Claure, WeWork's executive chairman and a senior SoftBank executive, told The New York Times in December.
SoftBank may have toughened its position as a negotiating tactic to force Mr. Neumann and other shareholders to sell their stock for a lower price.
WeWork's business was already facing great uncertainty. The company was set to almost double its locations this year, many of which may not be profitable for months or years. WeWork could try to renegotiate leases with landlords, but property owners might not be willing to cut the company a better deal because they are hurting financially themselves and don't expect an upturn in demand for real estate for the foreseeable future as many white-collar workers are confined to their homes.

Texto completo: The announcement comes weeks after President Trump limited the number of Chinese citizens who can work in the United States for five state-run Chinese news organizations.
In a sharp escalation of tensions between the two superpowers, China announced on Tuesday that it would expel American journalists working for The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post. It also demanded that those outlets, as well as the Voice of America and Time magazine, provide the Chinese government with detailed information about their operations.
The announcement, made by China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, came weeks after the Trump administration limited to 100 the number of Chinese citizens who can work in the United States for five state-run Chinese news organizations that are widely considered propaganda outlets.
China instructed American journalists for the three news organizations whose press credentials are due to expire this year to "notify the Department of Information of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs within four calendar days starting from today and hand back their press cards within ten calendar days." Almost all the China-based journalists for the three organizations have press cards that expire this year.
The announcement went on to say that the American journalists now working in mainland China "will not be allowed to continue working as journalists in the People's Republic of China, including its Hong Kong and Macao Special Administrative Regions." The two territories are semiautonomous and in theory have greater press freedoms than the mainland.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the decisions "are entirely necessary and reciprocal countermeasures that China is compelled to take in response to the unreasonable oppression the Chinese media organizations experience in the U.S."
The statement also accused the United States of "exclusively targeting Chinese media organizations," adding that it was "driven by a Cold War mentality." The new limits imposed by the Trump administration effectively forced 60 Chinese employees of the state-run organizations to leave the country.
Reporters at foreign news outlets in China were among those who aggressively reported on the coronavirus epidemic in January and February, including in its earliest days, when it was a regionalized outbreak in central China and the Chinese government sought to play down its severity.
The news organizations have also reported in the past year on other issues deemed extremely sensitive by Chinese officials, including the mass internment of Muslims in the Xinjiang region and the shadowy business dealings of family members of leaders, including President Xi Jinping.
Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The Times, condemned the expulsion of U.S. reporters in a statement, calling it "especially irresponsible at a time when the world needs the free and open flow of credible information about the coronavirus pandemic."
"It is critical that the governments of the United States and China move quickly to resolve this dispute and allow journalists to do the important work of informing the public," he said. He noted that The Times has more journalists in China than anywhere else internationally.
Matt Murray, the editor in chief of The Wall Street Journal, and Martin Baron, the executive editor of The Washington Post, also condemned China's decision.
American officials had been bracing for a retaliatory move by Beijing. On March 3, after the Trump administration announced the new regulations on five Chinese state-run news organizations, Hua Chunying, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, wrote on Twitter, "Now the U.S. has kicked off the game, let's play."
Orville Schell, a longtime American writer on China and a former dean of the U.C. Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism who is now at the Asia Society, said of the move: "There's been nothing on such a grand scale."
"Throwing out the big papers is one notch below closing down an embassy," he added. "It's a devastatingly dangerous spiral that we're falling into here. The already compromised musculature between the two countries is being rent apart."
Tensions between Washington and Beijing have risen quickly in recent years, mainly fueled by a trade war that President Trump started in 2018 and that the two sides paused with a truce in December. Beyond trade, both countries have been pushing against each other on a broad range of strategic and economic issues, including the coronavirus outbreak.
The cycle of escalation involving news organizations began last month.
On Feb. 18, the Trump administration announced that five state-run Chinese news organizations -- Xinhua, CGTN, China Radio, China Daily and People's Daily -- would be regulated as foreign government functionaries, subject to rules similar to those applying to Chinese missions.
The next day, China announced that it would expel three Journal staff members based in Beijing in retaliation for the headline of an earlier opinion column, "China Is the Real Sick Man of Asia," which criticized the Chinese government's handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Two of the Journal reporters, Josh Chin, an American, and Philip Wen, an Australian, flew out of Beijing the next week. A third reporter, Chao Deng, an American, had been reporting in the virus containment zone of Wuhan and could not leave.
The Journal has been in the cross hairs of the Chinese government since last year. In August, the Foreign Ministry refused to renew the visa of a Singaporean reporter for the newspaper's Beijing bureau, Chun Han Wong, effectively expelling him. Mr. Wong and Mr. Wen, the Australian reporter, had co-written an investigative story on a cousin of Mr. Xi, the president.
The forced departures of the Journal reporters last month were believed to be the first outright expulsions of foreign journalists by the Chinese government since 1998.
But in recent years, it has become common for the government to harass foreign journalists and their families, in part by requiring them to undergo onerous processes to renew their visas, according to a report published this month by the Foreign Correspondents' Club of China. Recently, the report said, some journalists had been working under visas shorter than the standard one-year duration: six months, three months, even one month.
It counted nine journalists who had effectively been thrown out of the country, whether via outright expulsion or through the unexplained refusal to grant a visa, since 2013, after Mr. Xi took power.
Almost all the American reporters for the three news organizations named in the Tuesday announcement have press cards and visas or residence permits that expire this year. The press cards are needed to maintain residency, and turning them in effectively means the journalists would need to leave the country. Reporters who were recently given a press card and residence permit that do not expire until 2021 can presumably continue to work.
All three news organizations also have full-time reporters based in China who are not American citizens.
The announcement does not indicate that any Hong Kong-based newsrooms of the organizations would need to stop operations, even if the journalists expelled from the mainland are not allowed to report there. The Times and The Journal both have large newsrooms in Hong Kong that serve as editing hubs and bases for reporters. The Washington Post's Southeast Asia bureau chief is also based in Hong Kong. Those reporters do not operate under the same regulations as the ones based in the mainland.
In Washington on Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he hoped China would reconsider the expulsions, which he called "unfortunate." But he scoffed at Beijing's statement that the action was being taken in reaction to the restrictions that the State Department announced last month against the Chinese news agencies.
"This isn't apples to apples," Mr. Pompeo told reporters at a State Department briefing that was scheduled before the Chinese Foreign Ministry released its statement. "You all get to ask me whatever question you want and I give you the answer. We know that that kind of freedom doesn't exist inside of China."
He maintained that the Chinese news agencies working in the United States were part of Beijing's propaganda machine -- not independent journalism outlets.
Mr. Pompeo, who started the briefing by referring to the "Wuhan virus," also said that press freedoms are in the interest of the Chinese people "in these incredibly challenging global times, where more information, more transparency are what will save lives."
Mr. Pompeo has denounced reporters on occasion, and Mr. Trump does so frequently, calling them the "enemy of the people." Officials in China and other authoritarian nations have embraced a term popularized by Mr. Trump, "fake news," to criticize journalists.
The fact that Beijing is trying to prevent the expelled reporters from reporting out of Hong Kong and Macau is a sign of the further erosion of press freedoms in those territories.
In October 2018, Hong Kong officials refused to renew the work visa of the Asia editor of The Financial Times, Victor Mallet, in what appeared to be an effort by the government to coerce foreign journalists to limit their activities and reporting.
In late 2013, China threatened to not renew the press cards for all reporters in the mainland bureaus of The Times and Bloomberg News because of investigative stories they had done, which would have led to their de facto expulsions. That prompted then Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to defend the organizations in meetings in Beijing with Chinese leaders.
Online access to many news outlets, including The Times, The Journal, Bloomberg and Reuters, has been blocked for years in China. In 2019, The Washington Post and The Guardian were added to the list of blocked publications.
Susan L. Shirk, the chair of the 21st Century China Center at the University of California, San Diego, said she worried about the "nasty, unseemly, self-defeating" tit-for-tat between the two countries.
"I think it's time for a truce," she said. "Our foreign ministers should get on a Zoom call and start to negotiate some of these contentious but symbolic issues."

Texto completo: Chinese authorities announced Tuesday that U.S. journalists from The Washington Post, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal will effectively be expelled from the country as part of retaliation for Trump administration limits on U.S.-based Chinese state media.
The move widens another rift in U.S.-China relations already strained by trade disputes and questions over how the world's two biggest economies will recalibrate their ties after the coronavirus pandemic.
In a statement published Tuesday, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the three U.S. outlets, plus Voice of America and Time magazine, will be designated as "foreign missions" and must report information about their staffs, finances, operations and real estate in China.
The statement did not mention pulling credentials for Time and the VOA, but it was unclear whether China would take further action.

The moves came after the United States took measures in February against Chinese Communist Party-controlled news outlets operating in the United States. Later, China expelled three Wall Street Journal reporters.
"I regret China's decision today to further foreclose the world's ability to conduct free-press operations that frankly would be really good for the Chinese people," Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters. "This is unfortunate. I hope they'll reconsider."
The new rules would reshape foreign journalism in China.
The statement said that U.S. citizens working for The Post, the Times and the Wall Street Journal, whose press credentials are due to expire before the end of 2020, must hand back their press cards. They will not be able to go to Hong Kong or Macao as a base for work, it said.
That will mean that many journalists will be forced to leave. An initial review by The Post suggested that the Chinese order would apply to one of the newspaper's correspondents, Gerry Shih, who is a U.S. citizen, said Douglas Jehl, foreign editor at The Post.
"We unequivocally condemn any action by China to expel U.S. reporters," said Martin Baron, executive editor of The Post.
"The Chinese government's decision is particularly regrettable because it comes in the midst of an unprecedented global crisis, when clear and reliable information about the international response to covid-19 is essential," he continued.
"Severely limiting the flow of that information, which China now seeks to do, only aggravates the situation," Baron said.
The new rules take aim at some U.S. media outlets but not others. The Associated Press and Bloomberg News have offices in Beijing, for instance, as do major U.S. broadcasters including CNN, ABC, NBC and CBS.
Some U.S. media outlets base their East Asian teams in Hong Kong, where press freedom has been largely protected under a "one country, two systems" agreement since the territory returned to Chinese control in 1997.
The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal have large newsrooms in Hong Kong. The Post has a bureau there.
There is no indication from the Chinese ministry statement that Hong Kong operations will be affected.
China has long had a complicated relationship with foreign media.
Over the past decade, Beijing has delayed or revoked press credentials to punish news outlets for lines of coverage that it does not like - such as reports on repression in Xinjiang or investigations into the wealth of the country's leaders.
The United States has struggled to respond, wary that placing restrictions on Chinese media in the United States might hurt U.S. journalists in China.
That U.S. caution ended last month. The State Department announced on Feb. 18 that it would now treat the U.S. operations of five Chinese news organizations as official government entities, or "foreign missions." The U.S. list included the state-run news agency Xinhua and the China Daily.
The next day, China fired back. Beijing expelled three Wall Street Journal reporters, marking the first time since Mao Zedong's rule that multiple foreign journalists were kicked out at once.
Beijing cast the move as a response to a Feb. 3 headline on an opinion section piece in the Journal that referred to China, while it battled the novel coronavirus, as "the real sick man of Asia."
Matt Murray, the paper's editor in chief, said the Journal will keep reporting.
"We oppose government interference with a free press anywhere in the world," he said. "Our commitment to reporting fully and deeply on China is unchanged."
Dean Baquet, executive editor of the New York Times, called the Chinese order "especially irresponsible at a time when the world needs the free and open flow of credible information about the coronavirus pandemic."
"It is critical that the governments of the United States and China move quickly to resolve this dispute and allow journalists to do the important work of informing the public," he added. "The health and safety of people around the world depend on impartial reporting about its two largest economies, both of them now battling a common epidemic."
Baquet said it was a "grave mistake for China to move backward and cut itself off from several of the world's top news organizations."
At the VOA, director Amanda Bennett said the organization is reviewing China's statement. She noted that the VOA operates under a "congressionally mandated firewall, which prohibits editorial influence or control by the U.S. government."
"We remain committed to continuing to serve as a consistently reliable, trusted and authoritative source of news to our Chinese-speaking audiences," Bennett said.

New York Times's Paul Krugman claims Trump to blame for slide in stock market, predicts plunge will doom presidency

Texto completo: New York Times columnist Paul Krugman blamed recent dips in the stock market and U.S. economy on President Trump's response to a nationwide outbreak of the coronavirus.
"America’s catastrophically inadequate response to the coronavirus can be attributed largely to bad short-term decisions by one man," Krugman wrote Monday. "At every stage, Donald Trump minimized the threat and blocked helpful action because he wanted to look good for the next news cycle or two, ignoring and intimidating anyone who tried to give him good advice."
Krugman repeated a claim made recently by Trump's critics that the president "disbanded the National Security Council’s pandemic response team in 2018," an action an NSC official denied ever happened.
The Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist lamented there were now only two "potential loci of intelligent economic policymaking left in Washington": the Federal Reserve and Democratic congressional leadership.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell slashed interest rates Sunday to nearly zero amid fears the U.S. economy could severely slow with businesses feeling the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak.
Under Nancy Pelosi's leadership, the House over the weekend passed an economic relief bill, which Krugman called "still clearly inadequate."
"Democrats set the shape of the bill, even as Trump was proposing the grandiose notion of a payroll tax holiday, which has been panned even by conservative economists," Krugman wrote.
During a press conference Monday, Trump said the U.S. economy "may be" heading toward a recession.
In a tweet Monday, Krugman predicted such an event would doom the president's legacy in the White House.
"Economists, myself included, often make a point of saying that the stock market is not the economy, which it isn't," he said. "It *is*, however, pretty much the Trump presidency. Take away his magic talisman and there's nothing left."

China adopts war footing to control COVID-19 narrative, expels American journalists

Texto completo: The Chinese Communist Party is fighting the coronavirus information war like an actual war, going so far as to expel American journalists from China, Hong Kong, and Macau.
China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs claims the expulsions are a "reciprocal" response to American hostilities. But the timing, the weak stated rationale, and the fact that the expulsions are not, in fact, "reciprocal" suggest that this is more about China's broader effort to avoid blame for COVID-19.

“[I]n response to the U.S. slashing the staff size of Chinese media outlets in the U.S.,” the Chinese government announced Tuesday, “which is expulsion in all but name, China demands that journalists of US citizenship working with the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post whose press credentials are due to expire before the end of 2020 notify the Department of Information of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs within four calendar days starting from today and hand back their press cards within ten calendar days.
"They will not be allowed to continue working as journalists in the People's Republic of China,” the ministry added, stressing that the expulsions will apply also to American journalists working in Hong Kong and Macau.

Members of China’s state-run media have been subjected to “discriminatory restrictions” in the United States by the federal government, the ministry complained Tuesday. The U.S. had also designated five Chinese state-run media groups as "foreign missions” last month (that is, Chinese government-controlled intelligence and propaganda entities) and imposed a cap on the number of employees who are allowed to operate in the states.

“[I]n response to the U.S. designation of five Chinese media agencies as ‘foreign missions,’” the ministry explained Tuesday, “China demands, in the spirit of reciprocity, that the China-based branches of Voice of America, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, and Time declare in written form information about their staff, finance, operation, and real estate in China.”

China alleges the U.S. government’s efforts to limit the Chinese Communist Party’s propaganda operations in America have subjected members of China’s state-run media “to growing discrimination and politically motivated oppression." China also characterizes the cap on the number of employees who are allowed to work in the U.S. as “outrageous treatment.”

“[I]n response to the discriminatory restrictions the U.S. has imposed on Chinese journalists with regard to visa, administrative review, and reporting, China will take reciprocal measures against American journalists,” the communist country’s government warned Tuesday.
Naturally, the ministry did not let it go at just that. It also accused the U.S. of having a “Cold War mentality” and referred to the expulsion of American journalists as an “entirely necessary” act of “self-defense.”

“What we reject is ideological bias against China, fake news made in the name of press freedom, and breaches of ethics in journalism,” the ministry said, warning elsewhere, “Should the U.S. choose to go further down the wrong path, it could expect more countermeasures from China.”

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, for his part, scoffed Tuesday at the idea that China is merely fighting for press freedoms.

“This isn’t apples to apples,” he told reporters at a State Department. “You all get to ask me whatever question you want, and I give you the answer. We know that that kind of freedom doesn’t exist inside of China.”

The Chinese Communist Party has adopted a war footing for its broader effort to win the COVID-19 narrative. It is literally rewriting history to absolve itself of responsibility for the viral pandemic it created. It is deluging news media around the world with disinformation portraying China as more capable, responsible, and competent than the U.S. And it is now punishing American journalists in an all-too-obvious effort to win protections for its propaganda operations in the U.S.

American leadership would be wise to get on a similar footing.

As the rest of the world grapples with a burgeoning virus outbreak, China's ruling Communist Party has turned to its propaganda playbook to portray its leader as firmly in charge, leading an army of health workers in a "people's war" against the disease.

NYT columnist predicts soaring firearms sales amid coronavirus outbreak will lead to more murders and suicides

Texto completo: New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof predicted a nationwide surge in gun sales during the coronavirus outbreak will lead to more deaths across the country.
"One way in which the coronavirus will lead to more deaths," Kristof tweeted. "It is leading to a rush to buy guns, which will lead to more murders, suicides and accidents."
Tweet
The veteran columnist shared a New York Times story reporting an uptick in the sales of guns and ammunition in stores across the country in recent weeks.
“We attribute it mainly to the virus scare,” said Larry Hyatt, a gun shop owner in North Carolina, who told the Times he has seen sales increase 30% to 40% since late February. “People have a little lack of confidence that if something big and bad happens, that 911 might not work. We saw it with Katrina."
David Liu, the owner of Arcadia Firearm & Safety in San Gabriel Valley, California, told Newsweek he had seen 10 times more customers since the COVID-19 virus outbreak began.
"One example is on March 3 and 4, I had 50 plus people come in here to take their firearms safety test and every one of them bought a gun. That's quite unusual for my small shop," Liu said.
Liu said many of the people coming in to buy guns are of Asian descent.
"They're all coming in because the media is telling them that Asians are being targeted, Chinese are being targeted," he said.
Ammunition suppliers have said they are also seeing an increase in sales since fears of the virus rapidly spreading have begun. Ammo.com told the Times it recorded two-thirds more transactions in the 11 days after Feb. 22.
Over the weekend, a photo of a line outside a gun shop in Los Angeles went viral on social media.
Tweet
So far, more than 3,400 cases of the virus in the United States have been reported, including 68 deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The COVID-19 pandemic shows our elite pundit class is completely worthless

Texto completo: The coronavirus outbreak has laid bare not only the deficiencies of the federal government, but it has destroyed also whatever remained of the facade of expertise and credibility that the pundit class had built for itself.

From the opinion sections of the New York Times to the Los Angeles Times, those who make up the ranks of America’s elite commentariat have failed utterly to provide audiences with measured and well-researched information regarding the COVID-19 disease. They have chosen instead to indulge in their worst, shallowest inclinations, spreading panic, ignorance, and fear almost as quickly as the infection itself.

The general failure of the pundit class to serve even a moderately useful purpose in the time of the coronavirus pandemic has manifested itself in several forms.

First, there is the class of commentator that has given up entirely on the idea of being measured and has chosen instead to embrace hysterical panic.

“Can we talk about [one] of the few topics I may actually know too much about: homicide?” MSNBC legal analyst Glenn Kirschner asked Tuesday. “Specifically, whether Donald Trump may have criminal exposure for some level of negligent homicide or voluntary/involuntary manslaughter for the way he’s mishandled the coronavirus crisis.”

He goes on in that vein for quite some time. I will spare you.

Earlier this week, another MSNBC legal analyst, Neal Katyal, had this to say: “Idea: Trump resigns for grave incompetence. George W Bush and Obama run this thing together.”

He added, “We can figure out how to do this constitutionally. It’s tough but possible. Doesn’t actually even need Trump to resign, he just needs to get out of the way [and] let the pros do the hard work.”

Unlike Kirschner, Katyal is not just some anti-Trump “resistance” lunatic. He served as a solicitor general for the Obama administration. He is fairly respected by both sides of the aisle. Yet, this is how he has chosen to respond to the COVID-19 virus, not with a restrained, knowledgeable response but with conspiracymongering and wish-casting.

There is also the class of commentator that sees the pandemic as the perfect opportunity for partisan ax-grinding.

“Trump won’t be able to deflect and project and create a daft alternative narrative,” the New York Times’s Maureen Dowd wrote in late February for an article titled “Trump Makes Us Ill.”

She adds, “The virus won’t respond to conspiracy theories from Rush Limbaugh or nasty diatribes from Sean Hannity or nicknames from Donald Trump."

Earlier, on Feb. 26, Dowd’s New York Times colleague Gail Collins authored an op-ed titled “Let’s Call It Trumpvirus.”

There is nothing I can say that will bring greater shame on Collins than her own headline, so let’s just leave it at that.

Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin also claimed this week that there is a “particular cruelty" and an "irony” in the likelihood that more Republicans than Democrats will die from the virus because Republicans watch Fox News.

"[T]here will be less Democrat deaths because there will be less mass gatherings, there will be less opportunities for people to congregate and share this horrible disease," she said.
Fox Business anchor Trish Regan, meanwhile, did something a little different. On March 9, she used the pandemic as an opportunity to attack Democrats and the news media.

Regan dismissed fears over the virus, telling her viewers the pandemic is yet “another attempt” by Democrats and their allies in the news media “to impeach the president.”

Democrats are creating “mass hysteria to encourage a market sell-off,” and it is all being done “to demonize and destroy the president,” Regan claimed while an on-air headline flashed: “Coronavirus Impeachment Scam.”

The network placed her on hiatus until further notice following her remarks.

Next, there is the class of commentator that sees the pandemic as a perfect excuse to police for problematic language and other culture war favorites. This class includes the Atlantic’s David Frum, who believes that it is racist to refer to the virus by the name of the country and city where it originated.

“Nobody calls the 1919-20 pandemic the Spanish flu anymore,” Frum said this week on social media, “and not because we are soft on the Inquisition. It's just not a useful way to name a disease.”

Everyone calls it the “Spanish flu,” including David Frum.

“The reason sensible people resist Trump's urging to call coronavirus ‘China infection’ or ‘Yellow Peril’ or whatever name he's test-marketing tonight is that it's just too blinking obvious that his purpose is to redirect attention from his failure to do his job competently,” the Atlantic columnist also complained this week.

The president has never called the virus “China infection” or “yellow peril.” He has called it the “China virus.”

Lastly, there is the class of commentator that has responded to the virus by acting as the unofficial public relations arm of the Chinese Communist Party.

“How uncomfortable is it,” NBC News’s Chuck Todd asked last weekend, “that perhaps China’s authoritarian ways did prevent this? Meaning, had China been a free and open society, this might have spread faster?”

Elsewhere, the New York Times published an op-ed titled “China Bought the West Time. The West Squandered It.”

Imagine having a platform as large and influential as NBC News or the New York Times and then squandering it to take cheap shots or praise the Chinese Communist Party, which is responsible for the pandemic in the first place.

If nothing else, the viral outbreak has shown that the U.S. pundit class is no more informed or credible than your average comments section. Our commentariat is a collection of irredeemable zealots, partisan guttersnipes, and all-around know-nothings, which makes them not only the most useless class of person to be involved in the public discourse surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, but also one of the most dangerous.

China pulls credentials of journalists working for New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Time, and VOA

Texto completo: China is banning journalists from five American media outlets in retaliation for President Trump’s requirement that Chinese state-run media organizations register as foreign missions.
“They will not be allowed to continue working as journalists in the People's Republic of China, including its Hong Kong and Macao Special Administrative Regions,” China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced through state-run media.
The new policy affects five organizations: Voice of America, a U.S.-funded outlet; the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, and Time magazine. Employees of those organizations must hand in their press badges within 10 days, according to the announcement.
“Relationship truly entering free fall when the world can least afford it,” Rush Doshi of the Brookings Institution's China Strategy Initiative tweeted in response. “And I should add, the Soviets saw the value in having *US journalists* from the country’s top papers — not only international press.”
Chinese officials blamed the United States. “What the US has done is exclusively targeting Chinese media organizations, and hence driven by a Cold War mentality and ideological bias,” the announcement added. “It has therefore exposed the hypocrisy of the self-styled advocate of press freedom.”
The expulsions come on the heels of another diplomatic dispute, as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other State Department officials have rebuked Chinese officials for lying about the origins of the coronavirus outbreak. Chinese officials have begun to allege that the U.S. Army started the outbreak, even though Beijing has faced weeks of criticism at home for censoring the doctors who tried to sound the alarm about the emergence of the coronavirus in Wuhan.
“The Chinese government’s decision is particularly regrettable because it comes in the midst of an unprecedented global crisis, when clear and reliable information about the international response to COVID-19 is essential,” Washington Post Executive Editor Marty Baron responded Tuesday afternoon. "Severely limiting the flow of that information, which China now seeks to do, only aggravates the situation.”

Texto completo: “This is an unprecedented moment in American history,” Bernie Sanders said on Sunday night. It certainly produced an unprecedented debate, the singularity of which was captured in a superficially odd but profound bit of business near the start.
Both Sanders and Joe Biden volunteered proudly that they hadn’t shaken hands. Both sang the praises of soap. And both spoke of hand sanitizer as if it were holy water.
The pandemic caused by the coronavirus changed and governed everything about the evening, in ways overt and oblique. It determined the first question that the two candidates were asked. It informed the last. It was the focus of many of their remarks in between.
Above all, it was the terrifying context in which their inevitable policy disagreements, aspersions on each other’s characters and exhumations of each other’s records took on a wholly different cast. All that stuff was unquestionably important — and yet.
There was a life-threatening, nation-shuttering, wealth-decimating crisis at hand. Did Biden’s decades-old comments about Social Security or onetime support of the Hyde Amendment matter even an eighth as much? Did Sanders’ long-ago votes on gun control or kind words about Fidel Castro?
And wasn’t the most important takeaway that neither of the candidates dwells in the truth-free, information-barren, delusion-rich bubble surrounding our current president, whose irresponsibility is having epic consequences? The two Democrats’ criticisms of each other, which grew heated at times, seemed almost immaterial next to what needed to be said — and sometimes was — about the denier in chief, Donald Trump.
That dynamic favored Biden, for several reasons. He’s now the far-and-away front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, with a lead in delegates that Sanders probably can’t overcome, so any sense of urgency for the party to unite in common cause against Trump becomes a summons to send Biden into the general election in the strongest shape imaginable. I suspect many Democrats tuned into this debate, almost certainly the last of the Democratic primaries, not to see Biden tested but to will him onward unscathed.
Biden’s position in the race, coupled with his message of national healing, meant that he more than Sanders had an interest in floating above the details of issues and painting a larger, gauzier picture. That approach suited this moment of utterly warranted panic.
So practiced riffs that were somewhat pat before the pandemic were wholly pertinent, such as Biden’s recognition that while he and Sanders differ on how to improve health care or tackle other problems in America, “We don’t disagree on the principle. We fundamentally disagree with this president on everything.”
“So,” he added, “this is much bigger than whether or not I’m the nominee or Bernie’s the nominee. We must defeat Donald Trump.”
And Biden was able to portray Sanders’ grander plans for transforming the American economy as luxuries unaffordable in the face of a scourge, as distractions from the emergency upon us. “People are looking for results, not a revolution,” Biden said.
Barring some remarkable, unforeseeable development, Sunday night was likely the valediction to Sanders’ bid for the Democratic nomination. That’s not because there was any particular, glaring deficiency in Sanders’ performance, a thorough and sometimes fierce grilling of Biden that correctly identified his evasions, inconsistencies and episodes of flawed judgment.
Sanders projected passion and self-assurance. He defended himself well against Biden’s attacks. And he raised fair, even necessary questions about whether, on issues like climate change, Biden’s proposals were more timid than the stakes demanded.
But there was something strained and strange about Sanders’ repeated pivots from the pandemic to income inequality, from the pandemic to corrupt pharmaceutical executives, from the pandemic to how many millionaires and billionaires have contributed to Biden’s campaign. The world has been transformed; the script remains the same.
And he couldn’t claim the kind of experience that Biden repeatedly did, the intimate knowledge of what it’s like to be at the center of crucial national decisions.
Biden smartly understood that his eight years beside the last Democratic president and his foreign-policy seasoning are probably more reassuring to voters now than they were a month or even a week ago. So he marinated in them.
And to guarantee further that the media wouldn’t fixate on who had got the better of whom, he threw in some major news, promising outright that he would pick a woman as his running mate. Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg: You can officially stand down.
There were also bad moments for Biden: selective retellings and lavish sugarcoating of votes and comments he’d made in the past. But they weren’t nearly enough to alter the current trajectory of the Democratic contest.
And Biden provided a mostly reassuring answer to perhaps the biggest question coming into this debate: With only one opponent sharing two full hours and a whole lot of talking to do, could he communicate his thoughts sharply enough, make his points with sufficient force and keep his sentences from running out of gas on a road to nowhere?
Squaring off against Sanders was a preview of squaring off against Trump, not because Sanders and Trump are anything alike, but because the initially crowded nature of the Democratic contest meant that Biden’s debates until now were populous affairs, when he was on the hook for maybe 20 minutes total and not the only or even the main candidate under fire.
But Sunday night’s debate was a two-person face-off, of the kind bound to occur in a general election. Did the extra time mean added peril? Biden was plenty repetitive and occasionally misspoke, but it was nothing to bolster team Trump’s gross caricature of him as a barely animated corpse.
Biden mostly came across as calm and resolute in the face of dire circumstances that had forced a relocation of the debate to Washington from Phoenix, the elimination of an audience and the addition of an extra few feet between his lectern and Sanders’.
The two candidates may have stood at a greater distance from each other than they normally would, but somehow they were closer together. Even during the debate’s bitterest exchanges, I never got the sense that either of them was really and truly intent on savaging the other.
You can’t tell Americans to pull together at this frightful juncture if you’re pushing them apart. The Democrats seem to get that. If only the president did, too.

Paul Krugman: Will Republicans allow Powell and Pelosi to save the economy?

Texto completo: America’s catastrophically inadequate response to the coronavirus can be attributed largely to bad short-term decisions by one man. And I do mean short-term: At every stage, Donald Trump minimized the threat and blocked helpful action because he wanted to look good for the next news cycle or two, ignoring and intimidating anyone who tried to give him good advice.
But here’s the thing: Even if he weren’t so irresponsibly self-centered, he has denuded the government of people who could be giving good advice in the first place.
Trump disbanded the National Security Council’s pandemic response team in 2018, although he now, with his characteristic refusal to accept responsibility for anything, says that he knew nothing about it. And he has in general staffed his administration with obsequious toadies who never tell him anything he doesn’t want to hear.
What’s now becoming clear is that when it comes to dealing with the economic fallout from COVID-19, the situation may be even worse. There are still some competent professionals holding senior positions at federal health agencies, who could give Trump good advice if he were willing to listen. But serious economic thinking has effectively been banned from this administration, if not the whole Republican Party. As far as I can tell, the Trump team is utterly incapable of formulating a coherent response to the gathering economic crisis.
As a result, there are only two potential loci of intelligent economic policymaking left in Washington. One is the Federal Reserve; the other is the congressional Democratic leadership. At this point, in other words, it’s pretty much up to Jay Powell, the Fed chairman, and Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the House; the question is whether Trump and Senate Republicans will let them save the economy.
Powell, of course, slashed interest rates and announced a large asset-buying program on Sunday. He was right to do so. But it’s painfully obvious that these moves won’t be sufficient, indeed will probably do little to stop the economy’s tailspin. Remember, in 2007-8 the Fed cut rates five times as much as it did Sunday, and it still wasn’t able to prevent the worst slump since the Great Depression.
In fact, Powell himself basically acknowledged as much, declaring that he and his colleagues “don’t have the tools” to reach those most in need of help, and that “fiscal responses are critical.”
Fiscal responses, of course, have to come from Congress. True, in another time, under another president, the White House would have played a crucial role in shaping crisis legislation. But last week, as the House drafted and then passed an economic relief bill — one that was helpful, if still clearly inadequate — it was almost entirely a Democratic effort. Democratic staff members put together the key elements of the bill — paid sick leave for many (though not enough) workers, enhanced unemployment benefits, increased federal contributions for Medicaid and more.
True, Steve Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, negotiated with Pelosi, basically to make the bill a bit worse. But Democrats set the shape of the bill, even as Trump was proposing the grandiose notion of a payroll tax holiday, which has been panned even by conservative economists.
As Greg Mankiw, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under George W. Bush, wrote, “a payroll tax cut makes little sense in this circumstance, because it does nothing for those who can’t work. … President Trump should shut-the-hell-up.”
And while the White House was basically out of the loop, Republican senators have been actively obstructionist, offering no serious proposals of their own but holding up a vote on the House bill, even though that bill passed with overwhelming bipartisan support.
Why are Republicans useless at best in the face of an economic crisis? As I’ve pointed out before, there are many competent center-right economists, but the GOP — not just Trump, but the whole party — doesn’t want their advice. It prefers hacks and propagandists, the people Mankiw famously called “charlatans and cranks,” whose only idea is tax cuts. The party truly has nobody left who is capable of putting together a plausible economic rescue package.
The Senate probably will eventually pass Pelosi’s bill. But with all signs pointing to a steep economic dive, we need a much bigger stimulus package — perhaps along the lines being developed by Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader — as soon as possible. This package shouldn’t include tax cuts; it should focus overwhelmingly on cash grants, perhaps a basic grant to every legal resident plus additional grants to those in special need.
And since there’s nobody left in the GOP who can put together a coherent stimulus plan, Democrats will have to do the job, perhaps with help from the Federal Reserve intervention to stabilize highly stressed financial markets.
I admit to being somewhat worried that Democrats won’t go big enough. But my bigger worry is that Republicans will undermine their efforts. It’s now up to Powell and Pelosi to rescue the economy, and Trump and company need to get out of their way.

Ruchir Sharma: This is how the coronavirus will destroy the economy

Texto completo: Though the Federal Reserve moved over the weekend to slash rates and buy treasuries, markets around the world fell on Monday anyway. The coronavirus threatens to set off financial contagion in a world economy with very different vulnerabilities than on the eve of the global financial crisis, 12 years ago.
In key ways the world is now as or more deeply in debt as it was when the last big crisis hit. But the largest and most risky pools of debt have shifted — from households and banks in the United States, which were restrained by regulators after the crisis, to corporations all over the world.
As businesses deal with the prospect of a sudden stop in their cash flows, the most exposed are a relatively new generation of companies that already struggle to pay their loans. This class includes the “zombies”— companies that earn too little even to make interest payments on their debt, and survive only by issuing new debt.
The dystopian reality of deserted airports, empty trains and thinly occupied restaurants is already badly hurting economic activity. The longer the pandemic lasts, the greater the risk that the sharp downturn morphs into a financial crisis with zombie companies starting a chain of defaults just like subprime mortgages did in 2008.
Over the last century, recessions have almost always been started by a sustained period of higher interest rates. Never a virus: The damage such contagions inflicted on the world economy typically lasted no more than three months. Now this once-in-a-century pandemic is hitting a world economy saddled with record levels of debt.
Central banks around the world are waking up to the prospect that the cash crunch can beget a financial crisis, as in 2008. That’s why the Federal Reserve took aggressive easing measures on Sunday that were straight out of the 2008 crisis playbook. While it is unclear whether the actions of the Fed will be enough to prevent the markets from panicking further, it’s worth asking: Why does the financial system feel so vulnerable again?
Around 1980, the world’s debts started rising fast as interest rates began falling and financial deregulation made it easier to lend. Debt tripled to a historic peak of more than three times the size of the global economy on the eve of 2008 crisis. Debt fell that year, but record low interest rates soon fueled a new run of borrowing.
The easy money policies pursued by the Federal Reserve, and matched by central banks around the world, were designed to keep economies growing and to stimulate recovery from the crisis. Instead, much of that money went into the financial economy, including stocks, bonds and cheap credit to unprofitable companies.
As the economic expansion continued, year after year, lenders grew increasingly lax, extending cheap loans to companies with questionable finances. Today the global debt burden is again at an all-time high.
The level of debt in America’s corporate sector amounts to 75 percent of the country’s gross domestic product, breaking the previous record set in 2008. Among large American companies, debt burdens are precariously high in the auto, hospitality and transportation sectors — industries taking a direct hit from the coronavirus.
Hidden within the $16 trillion corporate debt market are many potential troublemakers, including the zombies. They are the natural spawn of a long period of record low interest rates, which has sent investors on a restless hunt for debt products that offer higher reward, with higher risk. Zombies now account for 16 percent of all the publicly traded companies in the United States, and more than 10 percent in Europe, according to the Bank for International Settlements, the bank for central banks. A look at the data reveals that zombies are especially prevalent in commodity industries like mining, coal and oil, which may spell upheavals to come for the shale oil industry, now a critical driver of the American economy.
Zombies are not the only potential source of trouble. To avoid regulations imposed on public companies since 2008, many have gone private in deals that typically saddle the company with huge debts. The average American company owned by a private equity firm has debts equal to six times its annual earnings, a level twice what ratings agencies consider “junk.”
Signs of debt stress are now multiplying in industries impacted by the coronavirus, including transportation and leisure, auto and, perhaps worst of all, oil. Slammed on one side by fear that the coronavirus will collapse demand, and on the other by fears of a supply glut, oil prices have fallen to below $35 a barrel — far too low for many oil companies to meet their debt and interest payments.
Though investors always demand higher returns to buy bonds issued by financially shaky companies, the premium they demand on U.S. junk debt has nearly doubled since mid-February. By last week the premium they demand on the junk debt of oil companies was nearing levels seen in a recession.
Though the world has yet to see a virus-induced recession, this is now a rare pandemic. The direct effect on economic activity will be magnified not only by its impact on balky debtors, but also by the impact of failing companies on the bloated financial markets.
When markets fall, millions of investors feel less wealthy and cut back on spending. The economy slows. The bigger markets get, relative to the economy, the larger this negative “wealth effect.” And thanks again to seemingly endless promises of easy money, markets have never been bigger. Since 1980 the global financial markets (mainly stocks and bonds) have quadrupled to four times the size of the global economy, above the previous record highs set in 2008.
On Wall Street, bulls still hold out hope that the worst can pass quickly and point to the encouraging developments in China. The first cases were reported there on Dec. 31, and the rate of growth in new cases peaked on Feb. 13, just seven weeks later. After early losses, China’s stock market bounced back and the economy seemed to do the same. But the latest data, released today on retail sales and fixed investment, suggest the Chinese economy is set to contract this quarter.
While China is no longer center stage, as the virus spreads worldwide there are renewed fears that the crisis could circle back to its shores by hurting demand for exports. Over the last decade China’s corporate debt swelled fourfold to over $20 trillion — the biggest binge in the world. The International Monetary Fund estimates that one-tenth of this debt is in zombie firms, which rely on government-directed lending to stay alive.
In other parts of the world, including the United States, calls are growing for policymakers to offer similar state support to the fragile corporate sector. No matter what the policymakers do, the outcome is now up to the coronavirus, and how soon its spread starts to slow.
The longer the coronavirus continues to spread at its current pace, the more likely it is that zombies begin to die, further depressing the markets — and increasing the risk of wider financial contagion.

Texto completo: China banned all American nationals working in the country for the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post, as part of an escalating media war with the United States that follows restrictions placed by the Trump administration on Chinese media companies operating in the U. S. , its foreign ministry announced Tuesday.
"The U. S. government has placed unwarranted restrictions on Chinese media agencies and personnel in the U. S. , purposely made things difficult for their normal reporting assignments, and subjected them to growing discrimination and politically-motivated oppression," the ministry said in a statement, published in English.
China instructed U. S. journalists whose press credentials are due to expire before the end of 2020 to notify the foreign ministry in Beijing within four calendar days, beginning on Tuesday. It asked them to hand over their press cards within ten days.
In early March, the Trump administration ordered several Chinese media organizations to dismiss dozens of U. S. -based Chinese nationals as part of what U. S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo described as "our goal" of "reciprocity. " Pompeo said that the move was part of "long-overdue" efforts by Washington to achieve a "level playing field" following years of harassment by China of American and western journalists.
Reacting to Tuesday's announcement Pompeo said that China’s actions were misguided and served only to highlight the lack of press freedoms inside China.
"The Chinese will tell you that they want … people to know more about the country, and yet they continue to take actions like the one you see today, where they deny the world the capacity to know what's really going on inside of their country," he said.
As part of its new demands, China asked the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post, as well as the Voice of America and Time magazine, to provide the Chinese government with detailed information about their operations.
The U. S. move in March came in the wake of a decision in late February by authorities in Beijing to revoke the press credentials and order the expulsion of three Wall Street Journal reporters in retaliation for a headline on an opinion column about the coronavirus outbreak that China said was racist. That Feb. 3 column was written by Walter Russell Mead, a professor at Bard College. It argued that "Chinese authorities are still trying to conceal the true scale of the problem" of the virus that has now sickened more than 170,000 people and killed more than 7,000 worldwide. "China’s initial response to the crisis was less than impressive," Mead wrote, an assessment that China has now accepted.

China's move in February, in turn, came a day after the Trump administration said it would begin treating five major Chinese state-run media entities with U. S. operations – Xinhua, CGTN, China Radio, China Daily and Hai Tian Development – as foreign embassies. These media companies are now required to register their employees and U. S. property with the U. S. State Department. A similar U. S. Justice Department measure is in place for some Russian state-backed media working in the U. S. such as Russia Today, an English-language TV network.
The top editors of the Wall Street Journal, Washington Post and the New York Times spoke out against the expulsions.
"We unequivocally condemn any action by China to expel U. S. reporters," said Washington Post executive editor Marty Baron, after Tuesday's action by China.
"The Chinese government's decision is particularly regrettable because it comes in the midst of an unprecedented global crisis, when clear and reliable information about the international response to covid-19 is essential," he said in a tweet.
In a statement, Wall Street Journal Editor in Chief Matt Murray called the expulsion an "unprecedented attack on freedom of the press. "
"Our commitment to reporting fully and deeply on China is unchanged," he said.
New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet called the expulsion "especially irresponsible" when the free flow of information about coronavirus was necessary.
"It is a grave mistake for China to move backwards and cut itself off from several of the world's top news organizations," he said in a statement.
All three news organizations were at the forefront of reporting on the coronavirus outbreak in China at a time when the government tried to suppress information about the pandemic.
Fact check: Coronavirus originated in China, not elsewhere, researchers and studies say
Tensions between Beijing and Washington have fluctuated since President Donald Trump took office. The world's two largest economies have been locked for months in difficult trade talks that have precipitated on-and-off trade tariffs, and each side has accused the other of espionage. Many international outlets are inaccessible from China, which operates what is known informally as the "Great Firewall of China. "

Texto completo: BEIJING—China said it would revoke the press credentials of Americans working for three major U.S. newspapers in the largest expulsion of foreign journalists in the post-Mao era, amid an escalating battle with the Trump administration over media operating in the two countries.
China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Wednesday it was demanding that all U.S. nationals working for The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times and the Washington Post whose press credentials expire by the end of the year turn those credentials in within 10 days.
The measure would affect most of the American journalists working at those newspapers in China, which typically issues press credentials for up to 12 months and has recently been limiting them to six months and, in some cases, as little as one month.
The affected reporters won't be allowed to report anywhere in China, including the semiautonomous territories of Hong Kong and Macau, the statement said.
It also ordered the three newspapers and two other media outlets—Voice of America and Time magazine—to submit information about staff, finances, operations and real estate in China.
Beijing's move heightens tensions between the U.S. and China, the world's two biggest economies, which have been engaged in a trade war over the past two years. The fight recently spilled into the media sphere as the two countries forced the departure of journalists or staff from each others' media outlets.
The U.S. National Security Council, in a pair of tweets on Tuesday, criticized China's latest action. "The Chinese Communist Party's decision to expel journalists from China and Hong Kong is yet another step toward depriving the Chinese people and the world of access to true information about China," the NSC wrote. In another tweet, the White House called on China to instead focus on helping the world combat coronavirus, which the NSC pointedly described as the "Wuhan coronavirus."
The actions are "reciprocal countermeasures that China is compelled to take in response to the unreasonable oppression the Chinese media organizations experience in the U.S.," China's Foreign Ministry said.
On March 2, the Trump administration announced a personnel cap on four state-run Chinese media outlets—Xinhua News Agency, China Radio International, China Global Television Network and China Daily—forcing them to reduce their Chinese employees in the U.S. to 100 in total, from 160.
That move came shortly after China expelled three Journal reporters in response to a headline on an Opinion column.
Before that the White House had reclassified state-run Chinese media news organizations as "foreign missions," requiring them to declare their personnel and property to the State Department.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo disputed the Chinese government's contention that its action came in response to the Trump administration's measures.
"This isn't apples to apples," Mr. Pompeo told reporters at the State Department. "You all know the press freedoms you have…We know that that kind of freedom doesn't exist inside of China."
He said the individuals affected by the U.S. policy decision are employed not by independent media organizations, but by "Chinese propaganda outlets." He said he hoped Beijing would reconsider its decision.
Although Chinese officials claim to want others to better understand events inside China, Mr. Pompeo said, Beijing works to "deny the world the capacity to know what's really going on" there.
Matt Murray, editor in chief of the Journal, said in a tweet : "China's unprecedented attack on freedom of the press comes at a time of unparalleled global crisis. Trusted news reporting from and about China has never been more important. We oppose government interference with a free press anywhere in the world."
"Our commitment to reporting fully and deeply on China is unchanged," Mr. Murray added.
The Journal had previously condemned the expulsion in February of three reporters over an opinion headline, "the real sick man of Asia"—a phrase used historically to refer to the exploitation of a weakened China by European powers and Japan in the late 1800s and early 1900s. China's Foreign Ministry and state-media outlets had repeatedly called attention to the headline, which prompted widespread anger in China, and threatened unspecified consequences.
Washington Post Executive Editor Marty Baron said the paper condemned Tuesday's expulsion of U.S. reporters.
"The Chinese government's decision is particularly regrettable because it comes in the midst of an unprecedented global crisis, when clear and reliable information about the international response to covid-19 is essential. Severely limiting the flow of that information, which China now seeks to do, only aggravates the situation," Mr. Baron said.
New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet condemned the move, noting that reporters from his paper had worked in the country since the 1850s. "It is critical that the governments of the United States and China move quickly to resolve this dispute and allow journalists to do the important work of informing the public. The health and safety of people around the world depend on impartial reporting about its two largest economies, both of them now battling a common epidemic," he said.
Time magazine Editor in Chief Ed Felsenthal said the magazine opposes restrictions on the free press anywhere in the world.
Voice of America Director Amanda Bennett said: "We remain committed to continuing to serve as a consistently reliable, trusted and authoritative source of news to our Chinese-speaking audiences."
China has become increasingly combative with foreign media in recent years under leader Xi Jinping, as the government has attempted to exert greater control over information. Prior to the three Journal reporters in February, China hadn't expelled a credentialed foreign correspondent since 1998.
Steven Butler, the Asia program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists, urged Beijing and Washington to "negotiate to solve their differences and stop taking measures that cripple news reporting during a global pandemic, when the public's need for accurate information is greater than ever."
Some 37 American news organizations had 98 accredited reporters based in China, primarily in Beijing, according to a roster published by China's foreign ministry in July last year. The tally doesn't account for the ejections of four Wall Street Journal reporters since then, or for other changes in personnel.
In China, press credentials are issued by the Foreign Ministry to non-Chinese journalists. The credentials are necessary to receive a journalist visa in China. The Wednesday announcement didn't mention the visas themselves, but the revocation would effectively deprive the American journalists of the legal authorization to work in China.

Texto completo: MAIDUGURI, Nigeria - The six young women set down their bombs and stood around the well, staring into the dark void.
As captives of Boko Haram, one of the deadliest terror groups on Earth, the women had been dispatched for the grimmest of missions: go blow up a mosque and everyone inside.
The women wanted to get rid of their bombs without killing anyone, including themselves. One of them, Balaraba Mohammed, then a 19-year-old who had been blindfolded and kidnapped by Boko Haram a few months earlier, came up with a plan: They removed their headscarves and tied them into a long rope. Mohammed attached the bombs and gingerly lowered them into the well, praying it was filled with water.
She let go.
"We ran for our lives," Mohammed said.
In the decadelong war with Boko Haram that has coursed through northeast Nigeria and spread to three neighboring countries, more than 500 women have been deployed as suicide bombers or apprehended before they carried out their deadly missions - a number that terrorism experts said exceeds any other conflict in history.
Some, like Mohammed and the women at the well, have resisted, foiling the extremists' plans in quiet and often unheralded ways.
But most women who broke away from Boko Haram keep their abductions secret, knowing they would be stigmatized as terrorist sympathizers even though they were held against their will and defied the militants. They walk the streets of Maiduguri, Nigeria, in the shadow of billboards celebrating the heroism of Malala Yousafzai, who was shot for standing up to the Taliban.
The women are often forgotten, not unlike the more than 100 schoolgirls kidnapped from the village of Chibok who remain missing - nearly six years after their abduction caused such global alarm.
Dozens of women interviewed by The New York Times have said that Boko Haram gave them a terrible choice: "marry" the group's fighters or be deployed as bombers. Captives have said some women chose instead to blow up only themselves.
But some survived and want to tell their stories. Mohammed is one.
Mohammed said she arrived at the Boko Haram camp in a daze in 2012. Boko Haram had murdered her husband in front of her after he criticized the group. Days later they came back for Mohammed, throwing her baby to the ground and abducting her. She thought her daughter was dead.
New female captives would arrive every time fighters left the camp. Some of them were raped and forced to take birth control pills, she said. Some of them were used to test suicide vests.
Mohammed considered suicide, but she thought of her ailing grandmother who needed her as caretaker. To get out of being married off to a fighter, she said she feigned sickness. To get out of weapons training, she faked mental illness.
When fighters gave her a bomb, she said, "I felt as if I was dead." She knew she would have to go or be shot.
Which is how she found herself with five others at the edge of that well.
The bombs didn't detonate, and the young women, scared and unsure what to do, ran back to the Boko Haram camp, Mohammed said. They swore on a Quran to their captors they had accomplished their mission and that they ran so fast to escape that they lost their hijabs on the way.
Cheers went up from the fighters.
The six women, two of them barely teenagers, had outsmarted Islamic extremists.
For women trying to escape Boko Haram's clutches, all the options are bad. Those trying to surrender to authorities are sometimes killed by nervous soldiers, according to UNICEF.
After the trick at the well, fighters sent Mohammed and the other women on a second suicide mission along with a new captive. She said their target was to be a market in Banki, a once-bustling town. One of the fighters planned to escort the women. But the new captive assured the militants she was from Banki and knew her way through the countryside.
Again, the women collected their bombs and used their hijabs to lower them into the well. They sprinted back to the fighters' camp expecting the same joyous reception.
But fighters were shocked to see them so soon.
Just then, the radio crackled with news: a bombing had been reported in Banki - but in a small village outside the main town, not in the market. The fighters turned on the new captive, thinking she had led the women to the wrong place.
They shot her to death.
Days went by, and fighters came and went, engaging in fierce battles that claimed some of their lives.
Mohammed was locked in a tin shack with other captives as they listened to fighters preparing for vigilante forces to invade the camp.
"I was saying in my heart that 'Oh God, even if I would die, let my relatives find my corpse,' " she said.
She heard gunshots and a loud noise. She lost consciousness.
Hadiza Musa, who had joined the local vigilante force to avenge the Boko Haram capture of her sister, arrived to find a horrific scene: The entire camp was on fire, and there was carnage everywhere. In an attempt to distract the vigilantes, Musa said, it appeared that Boko Haram had blown up their own camp and their captives and fled.
Musa said she sifted through the dead and came across Mohammed, who was unconscious with burns covering her body and blood pouring from what looked like a bullet wound to her leg. Musa cried as she helped ferry Mohammed to a hospital.
Musa stayed by Mohammed, caring for her until she was conscious. She tracked down her grandmother and told Mohammed the first good news she had heard in months: Her baby, Hairat, was alive.
Musa and Mohammed now consider themselves sisters. Mohammed still bears scars from burns to her face, arms and legs. In Maiduguri, where she lives with Hairat, who is now in first grade, some neighbors who know she was abducted think she might be loyal to Boko Haram.
"The best thing is for you to be killed," a neighbor told Mohammed.
She tries to ignore those kinds of comments. She knows none of the ordeal was her fault. She pays for Hairat's schooling by knitting caps and selling soft drinks from a rented mini-refrigerator. She makes regular trips to the morgue to search for her brother's body.
Mohammed has started training to become a nurse. She couldn't afford fees for recent exams after an uncle kicked her out of his house, still suspicious of her time with militants.
Until she can save up money for the exam, she keeps a first aid kit with her.

Men who hoarded sanitizer donate their stockpile

Texto completo: NASHVILLE, Tenn. – Two Tennessee men who hoarded more than 17,000 bottles of hand sanitizer have donated their stockpile amid backlash and a price gouging investigation.
On Sunday morning, Matt Colvin, an Amazon seller outside of Chattanooga, helped volunteers from a local church load two-thirds of his stockpile of hand sanitizer and antibacterial wipes into a box truck for the church to distribute to people in need across Tennessee, according to The New York Times.
Officials from the Tennessee attorney general's office took the other third. The office is investigating him for price gouging.
Colvin and his brother Noah became the subject of national scorn after the Times published a story about how they cleaned out stores of sanitizer and wipes in an attempt to profit off the public's panic over the coronavirus pandemic.
The article says while people across the country have stockpiled items such as hand sanitizer or antibacterial wipes, internet companies such as Amazon and eBay have enacted strict measures to stop those looking to price gouge.
Noah Colvin, of Hixson, took a 1,300-mile road trip in early March across Tennessee and Kentucky, racking up thousands of bottles of hand sanitizer to resell online.
Meanwhile, Matt stayed at home, waiting for pallets of antibacterial wipes and even more sanitizer to be shipped, according to a Times article.
The two then sold sanitizer online at a steep markup – $8 to $70 a pop. Amazon quickly removed their listings.
The Tennessee Attorney General's Office ordered the brothers to stop buying and selling medical goods and products following the reports of possible price gouging while an investigation into their actions is underway.
"We will not tolerate price gouging in this time of exceptional need, and we will take aggressive action to stop it," said Attorney General Herbert H. Slatery III.
"During this pandemic, we ask that you report suspicious activity to the Division of Consumer Affairs and refrain from threatening or hostile communication with individuals or businesses you may suspect are price gouging. Our team will review complaints closely and we are prepared to act to protect Tennesseans."
The Colvins told The New York Times that Noah Colvin hit "little hole-in-the-wall dollar stores in the backwoods. The major metro areas were cleaned out."
Matt Colvin said he was simply fixing "inefficiencies in the marketplace." Some areas of the country need the products more than others, he said to the Times, and he's helping send the supply toward the demand.
On Sunday he expressed remorse for his actions and said he didn't realize the gravity of the coronavirus outbreak, or the severe shortage of sanitizer and wipes when he began buying the supplies.
"I've been buying and selling things for 10 years now. There's been hot product after hot product. But the thing is, there's always another one on the shelf," he told the Times. "When we did this trip, I had no idea that these stores wouldn't be able to get replenished."

After the trick at the well, fighters sent Mohammed and the other women on a second suicide mission along with a new captive. She said their target was to be a market in Banki, a once-bustling town. One of the fighters planned to escort the women. But the new captive assured the militants she was from Banki and knew her way through the countryside.
Again, the women collected their bombs and used their hijabs to lower them into the well. They sprinted back to the fighters' camp expecting the same joyous reception.
But fighters were shocked to see them so soon.
Just then, the radio crackled with news: a bombing had been reported in Banki - but in a small village outside the main town, not in the market. The fighters turned on the new captive, thinking she had led the women to the wrong place.
They shot her to death.
Days went by, and fighters came and went, engaging in fierce battles that claimed some of their lives.
Mohammed was locked in a tin shack with other captives as they listened to fighters preparing for vigilante forces to invade the camp.
"I was saying in my heart that 'Oh God, even if I would die, let my relatives find my corpse,' " she said.
She heard gunshots and a loud noise. She lost consciousness.
Hadiza Musa, who had joined the local vigilante force to avenge the Boko Haram capture of her sister, arrived to find a horrific scene: The entire camp was on fire, and there was carnage everywhere. In an attempt to distract the vigilantes, Musa said, it appeared that Boko Haram had blown up their own camp and their captives and fled.
Musa said she sifted through the dead and came across Mohammed, who was unconscious with burns covering her body and blood pouring from what looked like a bullet wound to her leg. Musa cried as she helped ferry Mohammed to a hospital.
Musa stayed by Mohammed, caring for her until she was conscious. She tracked down her grandmother and told Mohammed the first good news she had heard in months: Her baby, Hairat, was alive.
Musa and Mohammed now consider themselves sisters. Mohammed still bears scars from burns to her face, arms and legs. In Maiduguri, where she lives with Hairat, who is now in first grade, some neighbors who know she was abducted think she might be loyal to Boko Haram.
"The best thing is for you to be killed," a neighbor told Mohammed.
She tries to ignore those kinds of comments. She knows none of the ordeal was her fault. She pays for Hairat's schooling by knitting caps and selling soft drinks from a rented mini-refrigerator. She makes regular trips to the morgue to search for her brother's body.
Mohammed has started training to become a nurse. She couldn't afford fees for recent exams after an uncle kicked her out of his house, still suspicious of her time with militants.
Until she can save up money for the exam, she keeps a first aid kit with her.

Texto completo: MAIDUGURI, Nigeria - The six young women set down their bombs and stood around the well, staring into the dark void.
As captives of Boko Haram, one of the deadliest terror groups on Earth, the women had been dispatched for the grimmest of missions: go blow up a mosque and everyone inside.
The women wanted to get rid of their bombs without killing anyone, including themselves. One of them, Balaraba Mohammed, then a 19-year-old who had been blindfolded and kidnapped by Boko Haram a few months earlier, came up with a plan: They removed their headscarves and tied them into a long rope. Mohammed attached the bombs and gingerly lowered them into the well, praying it was filled with water.
She let go.
"We ran for our lives," Mohammed said.
In the decadelong war with Boko Haram that has coursed through northeast Nigeria and spread to three neighboring countries, more than 500 women have been deployed as suicide bombers or apprehended before they carried out their deadly missions - a number that terrorism experts said exceeds any other conflict in history.
Some, like Mohammed and the women at the well, have resisted, foiling the extremists' plans in quiet and often unheralded ways.
But most women who broke away from Boko Haram keep their abductions secret, knowing they would be stigmatized as terrorist sympathizers even though they were held against their will and defied the militants. They walk the streets of Maiduguri, Nigeria, in the shadow of billboards celebrating the heroism of Malala Yousafzai, who was shot for standing up to the Taliban.
The women are often forgotten, not unlike the more than 100 schoolgirls kidnapped from the village of Chibok who remain missing - nearly six years after their abduction caused such global alarm.
Dozens of women interviewed by The New York Times have said that Boko Haram gave them a terrible choice: "marry" the group's fighters or be deployed as bombers. Captives have said some women chose instead to blow up only themselves.
But some survived and want to tell their stories. Mohammed is one.
Mohammed said she arrived at the Boko Haram camp in a daze in 2012. Boko Haram had murdered her husband in front of her after he criticized the group. Days later they came back for Mohammed, throwing her baby to the ground and abducting her. She thought her daughter was dead.
New female captives would arrive every time fighters left the camp. Some of them were raped and forced to take birth control pills, she said. Some of them were used to test suicide vests.
Mohammed considered suicide, but she thought of her ailing grandmother who needed her as caretaker. To get out of being married off to a fighter, she said she feigned sickness. To get out of weapons training, she faked mental illness.
When fighters gave her a bomb, she said, "I felt as if I was dead." She knew she would have to go or be shot.
Which is how she found herself with five others at the edge of that well.
The bombs didn't detonate, and the young women, scared and unsure what to do, ran back to the Boko Haram camp, Mohammed said. They swore on a Quran to their captors they had accomplished their mission and that they ran so fast to escape that they lost their hijabs on the way.
Cheers went up from the fighters.
The six women, two of them barely teenagers, had outsmarted Islamic extremists.
For women trying to escape Boko Haram's clutches, all the options are bad. Those trying to surrender to authorities are sometimes killed by nervous soldiers, according to UNICEF.
After the trick at the well, fighters sent Mohammed and the other women on a second suicide mission along with a new captive. She said their target was to be a market in Banki, a once-bustling town. One of the fighters planned to escort the women. But the new captive assured the militants she was from Banki and knew her way through the countryside.

SHOPPING, STOCKPILING AND PRICE GOUGING

Texto completo: Over the weekend, The New York Times published a much shared story about a Tennessee man who was, until the day after the story ran, sitting on 17,700 bottles of hand sanitizers he originally planned to sell at marked-up prices.
It was such an obnoxious scheme that Amazon, which owes its whole existence to collective greed and obnoxious schemes, stepped in to put an end to the Amazon seller's fantasy of late-stage morality-free capitalism online in the middle of a pandemic.
The attorney general's office in Tennessee began an investigation for price gouging that was guaranteed not to end well for the would-be entrepreneur who initially justified his actions as an attempt to correct the "inefficiencies of the market."
Noah Colvin, the man whose garage and storage locker were bulging with products most of the nation was desperately scouring the shelves for at that moment, sprinkled the reporter with many rationalizations: "Just because it cost me $2 in the store doesn't mean it's not going to cost me $16 to get it to your door," he said even after admitting he had already sold 2,000 packs of surgical masks from $40 to $50 each after getting them for $3.50 a pack.
Incredibly, Mr. Colvin, a former Air Force technical sergeant, allowed himself to be photographed for the story and claimed he was cornering the market in much-needed supplies to take care of his wife and young children, as if his love for his immediate family somehow expunged the stain on his soul.
The reaction to Mr. Colvin and other black market pirates interviewed for the Times story was swift - national outrage, mockery and threats of legal sanctions because almost everyone in America was out searching for Purell, surgical masks, handy wipes and toilet paper.
Following as it did President Donald Trump's soon-to-be iconic statements that he takes absolutely "no responsibility" for the failures of his administration to address the COVID-19 outbreak in a timely and competent manner, Mr. Colvin's utter disregard for humanity felt like it was tailor-made for this moment and could only have happened under a presidency as appallingly shameless as this one. At least he decided to "donate" most of his ill-gotten goods to the states of Tennessee and Kentucky after a day of national shaming.
At times like these, more high-minded columnists than myself comb their bookshelves looking for parallels in literature or history they can casually drop into 30 inches for the edification of the masses about the rapid fall of civilization and its aftermath.
We know the drill: perfunctory references to Cormac McCarthy's "The Road," Emily St. John Mandel's "Station Eleven," Octavia Butler's "The Parable of the Sower," Richard Matheson's "I Am Legend" - even references to William Golding's "The Lord of the Flies," which is technically not post-apocalyptic at all.
Golding's novel chronicles the breakdown of order among British schoolchildren who separate into warring tribes after becoming stranded on an island without adult supervision. Despite their privilege and elite education, they become feral within days and were soon smearing themselves with pig blood, berries and dirt to fit into the lawless, post-Edenic status quo.
When I saw video footage of a big, middle-aged woman trying to snatch a six-pack of paper towels from a frail, elderly woman to add to her already bulging supermarket shopping cart, the high-culture part of me muttered "Lord of the Flies," but I was really thinking "The Walking Dead."
We're too far into this pandemic to pretend references to St. John Mandel's or Butler's novels will mean anything since they haven't been made into movies yet.
Let's be honest. Most Americans haven't picked up a book since graduating from high school, but the majority of Americans have seen at least one episode of "The Walking Dead," which is enough to make it the No. 1 drama on cable television for nearly a decade.
In fact, I would go so far as to say most of us know what we think we know about how to survive the looming apocalypse from watching "The Walking Dead" and passively absorbing its morality all of these years.
A quick primer for those who have avoided the contamination of watching a long-running series about zombies all of these years: "The Walking Dead" takes place in the present after something believed to be a virus of unknown origin infects everyone on the planet. The origin of this pathogen is never explained.
People who die are soon "reanimated" by the virus and become stumbling, flesh-eating undead who can be stopped only if their skull/brains are pierced by sharp objects or bullets.
If you're unlucky enough to be bitten but not fully consumed by a "walker," you'll be transformed into one of their soulless tribe within a few hours as zombie antibodies activate the zombie antibodies dormant in your body.
In "The Walking Dead," the law of exponential growth kicks into high gear, turning the majority of ordinary people across the planet into walkers or food for walkers in a relatively short period. Civilization collapses, leaving only ragtag groups and rugged, but often crazy individuals to fend for themselves in the apocalyptic wasteland.
Heroic protagonists like Rick Grimes, a former Georgia county sheriff, leads one community of survivors against bandits and rival communities led by narcissists and ruthless despots who spring from the ashes once civilization collapsed.
The series' most consistently entertaining "villain" is called Negan, the leader of the Saviors. Negan is an avaricious and cunning warlord who was a sadistic gym teacher before the end of the world gave him a darker, higher purpose.
Negan once commanded a large army of conscripted survivors bullied into following his orders. Whenever the Saviors came across smaller, weaker communities, they demanded tribute - half the food and amenities gathered by those survivors on a monthly basis or face certain destruction. Before Rick Grimes figured out a way to defeat Negan, it didn't matter how many guns a community had if they were outnumbered by the even more heavily armed Saviors.
The understated moral of "The Walking Dead" is that everything you selfishly stockpile today or scavenge after civilization collapses will eventually be taken from you by someone like Negan, or some other villain inspired by the novels of Ayn Rand anyway, so you might as well try to be a decent human being while you can.
Still, I must confess that as I read the story about Mr. Colvin posing in front of a garage full of hand sanitizers in Tennessee, this uncharitable thought did cross my mind: "Where the hell is Negan when you need him?"

What did Bob Weinstein know? Harvey Weinstein's accusers and others now ask whether his brother facilitated.

Texto completo: Harvey Weinstein, the once powerful movie mogul, was the picture of disgrace. On Wednesday, after the convicted rapist was sentenced to 23 years in prison, he was handcuffed in his wheelchair and rolled off to jail for processing.
He now awaits extradition to California, where he is charged with multiple counts of sexual assault stemming from two alleged attacks in Los Angeles and Beverly Hills in 2013.
While activists and many of Weinstein's accusers expressed "vindication" and satisfaction with the verdict, one issue remains unsettled among them: the publicists, agents and handlers who in their view either aided Weinstein's litany of abuse or turned a blind eye to it.

Chief among them, his accusers and former associates say, is Bob Weinstein, Harvey's younger brother, longtime business partner and co-founder of Miramax Films and Weinstein Co.
Since the bombshell allegations of sexual abuse against Harvey, 67, first came to light in 2017 in the New York Times and the New Yorker, Bob, 65, has largely avoided the spotlight, distancing himself from his brother, insisting that although he believed his sibling was unfaithful to his wife, he had no idea about the extent of Harvey's predatory behavior.
Last Monday, the Manhattan Supreme Court unsealed a trove of documents revealing emails in which Bob, according to reports, excoriated his brother. In one he wrote: "U deserve a lifetime achievement award for the sheer savagery and immorality and inhumanness, for the acts u have perpetrated." In another he fumed, "I pray there is a real hell. That's where u belong."
Harvey Weinstein has denied having nonconsensual sex with the women who have accused him of misconduct.
Still, the question nags, what did Bob know?
In recent months, the younger brother has quietly been staging a comeback. In October, he announced the launch of a New York-based production company, Watch This Entertainment, focusing on comedies, family fare and high-end adult thrillers.
He tapped Pantea Ghaderi, a former publicity executive at Weinstein Co., as president of creative development. Their first project is the animated feature "Endangered," with the actress Tea Leoni producing and lending her voice. The French animation collective Illogic, nominated for an Oscar in 2018 for the animated short "Garden Party," will direct.
Yet despite Bob's protestations and decoupling from his brother, those with claims against the company and former associates balk at his current rehabilitation attempt. Some believe that Bob may have gotten a pass, maintaining that questions remain about what he knew and if and how he facilitated his brother's abuse. After all, he paid out a settlement agreement involving two of his brother's victims, according to the women.
Many of Harvey's accusers say a code of conduct clause in his last contract approved by Bob and other board members suggests he had knowledge of his brother's behavior. Drawn up in 2015, it has a clause allowing for a scale of fines from $250,000 to $1 million that Harvey was required to make if his "misconduct results in the Company making Obligated Payment to a person damaged by such misconduct," according to a provision in his contract reviewed by The Times.
"I think that Bob is on the top of a pyramid of the many men and women who were Harvey Weinstein enablers," said Rowena Chiu, a former assistant for Harvey who had worked in Miramax's London office. She alleges that Harvey attempted to rape her during the 1998 Venice International Film Festival. Chiu and another London assistant, Zelda Perkins, who accused Harvey of rampant bullying and sexual harassment, split a $316,000 settlement. That payment, as was first reported in the New Yorker, came out of Bob Weinstein's personal bank account.
"Bob was the closest to Harvey, more than his lawyer," Chiu said. "He didn't sneeze without Bob knowing about it." She contends that although Bob may say he wrote these checks to cover up his brother's adultery, she believes otherwise.
"Whatever narrative he wants to tell himself, he was not covering up an affair; [Harvey] was sexually assaulting women and [Bob] was paying women to silence them."
Bob Weinstein and Ghaderi did not respond to requests for comment.

Brothers' bonds
Bob and Harvey Weinstein have always had a complicated, codependent and volatile relationship.
The sons of a Manhattan diamond cutter and a housewife, they grew up sharing a bedroom in Queens. After Bob dropped out of college, he joined his brother in Buffalo, N.Y., where Harvey made a name for himself as a local concert promoter. The younger brother took up promoting film festivals.
In 1979, they founded Miramax Films. Launched as a film distributor and named after their parents Miriam and Max, the brothers' venture changed the game for commercially successful indie movies. During the 1990s they dominated the market, churning out award-winning, critically acclaimed hits like "The English Patient" and "Shakespeare in Love ."
Harvey Weinstein held sway over the art house films while his brother ran the numbers and Dimension Films, which produced commercially successful action, horror and comedy films like the "Scream" and "Scary Movie" franchises.
Harvey had a sixth sense for cultural storytelling; Bob had a head for numbers. Harvey was the more flamboyant of the pair, schmoozing with political figures and power players from Hollywood to D.C. Bob was frequently referred to as the "quiet brother."
After they sold Miramax to Walt Disney Co. in 1993 for $60 million and subsequently established Weinstein Co., Bob remained in the background.
"Bob had his own skill set," Bill Mechanic, a movie producer and former studio executive who worked with the brothers after they joined Disney, told The Times in a 2017 interview. "He was making movies he liked. They were rougher, they were horror action pictures. He had a more commercial sensibility."
Relations between the two ricocheted from contentious to volatile.
A former senior Miramax executive who reported to both Harvey and Bob described the atmosphere in the office as abusive and belittling and working for them as like being with "two rival siblings who wanted to date the same person." While "Bob could be rough around the edges and had his issues," one of the major differences between the two brothers was that Bob could admit when he was wrong, noted the former executive.
"Harvey could never admit that or that someone did a better job," noted the executive, who asked not to be identified because he works in the industry. "I found Bob the far better, more fair guy to work with, although he was not the perfect boss."
Over time, the brothers' relationship deteriorated.
In 2011, Harvey punched his brother in the face, knocking him to the ground in the presence of several Weinstein Co. executives in an argument about studio resources. Bob cited the incident in a letter he sent to his brother in 2015 that appeared in the book "She Said," written by the New York Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, in which he also urged Harvey to seek help for what he called "misbehaviors."
Yet while Harvey has been variously described as a beast, Bob was no beauty. One person who worked for them described Harvey as a potent mix of charm and anger; Bob, they explained, was absent the charm. In the wake of the blockbuster allegations against Harvey, numerous accounts surfaced about Bob's own behavior.
During the Wall Street Journal's WSJ D.Live technology conference in 2017, Jeffrey Katzenberg, who ran Disney's movie studio after it acquired Miramax, said, "Bob Weinstein was genuinely abusive to people in my company." He added, "The one person who revealed himself in a way that was unacceptable to me was, in fact, Bob."
In 2012, the New York Daily News reported that Bob's wife, Anne, filed for divorce and sought an order of protection because she feared "bodily harm." He denied any abuse.
--
Fallout continues
Following the revelations of Harvey's rampant sexual misconduct in the fall of 2017, the Weinstein Co. board, including Bob, fired him. Bob attempted to hold on to the film studio, but the scandal soon torpedoed that bid.
A $500-million deal to sell the company and avoid bankruptcy fell apart after the New York attorney general accused Weinstein Co. of complicity in Weinstein's behavior, singling out its chief operating officer, David Glasser, for his failure to respond to complaints about Harvey's treatment of women. In February 2018, the board fired Glasser.
A month later, Weinstein Co. filed for bankruptcy protection. By the summer, the Dallas-based private equity firm Lantern Capital Partners bought the studio for $289 million, including its 277-film library. Last March, former Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Chief Executive Gary Barber joined Lantern Entertainment to create a new company, Spyglass Media Group, out of what was left of Weinstein Co. As the film studio was sold off for pieces and the number of Weinstein accusers swelled, several civil lawsuits were filed against Harvey, including a federal class-action suit. Last year, after months of wrangling, infighting and uncertainty, a controversial $47-million settlement was reached between Weinstein, his former film studio's board and several women who accused the disgraced movie mogul of sexual misconduct, according to attorneys involved in the negotiations.
Under terms of the deal, about $25 million would be allocated to the accusers, another $7.3 million to unsecured creditors and former Weinstein Co. employees, and about $12.2 million was earmarked to pay legal fees of the studio's directors and officers, according to a copy of the settlement term sheet obtained by The Times. (Under the proposed settlement, Bob Weinstein would pay the company's debtors 20% of the net proceeds recovered from Lantern Entertainment). A judge has yet to approve the proposed settlement.
The tentative agreement has drawn fire for offering inadequate compensation to the victims while enabling Weinstein and the directors of the now-defunct movie studio, including Bob, to evade accountability or liability. Attorneys for two of the accusers have publicly rejected the proposal.
Last week, seven victims penned an open letter to New York Atty. Gen. Letitia James objecting to the civil settlement, calling it "insulting to all of the survivors in that it represents a small fraction of what should be paid by Mr. Weinstein, his former directors and officers, and large multi-billion dollar insurance companies." They complained that too much of the settlement originally intended for victims "will instead be paid to lawyers for Harvey Weinstein (a now-convicted felon), his brother Robert Weinstein and other ultra-wealthy former members of the board of directors of the Weinstein Company, who turned a blind eye, allowing Harvey Weinstein to victimize us and so many others."
Thomas Peter Giuffra, an attorney representing Alexandra Canosa, a producer on the Netflix series "Marco Polo" who alleges that Harvey Weinstein raped and abused her over several years, contends this settlement is "unfair" and thinks that Bob Weinstein's role in his brother's behavior requires more scrutiny.
"They worked closely," he said. "He was aware of what his brother was up to. It seemed all Hollywood was aware; they were making jokes at the Academy Awards for God's sake."
Giuffra's client has a pending civil suit against Harvey. In a recent letter filed in Manhattan federal court, the attorney said he would depose Bob among others. "We want to see what he knew at the time and if he had any involvements in any prior complaints," Giuffra said. "We want to know about the whole history of this whole mess and what his knowledge is."
So far, true to his moniker, Bob Weinstein has remained quiet. His new film company, which has an office in New York and was formed as a limited liability corporation in Nevada, has no publicly listed financial backers; it aims to develop two to three films per year.
"I hope he has as much success as Rowena and I and the many other Weinstein victims have had in gainful employment in the movie industry," said Perkins, Harvey's former Miramax assistant in London who broke her nondisclosure agreement to speak out about his treatment.
A signatory to the open letter to the New York attorney general, she added, "Our careers were totally ruined. Let's see if Bob receives the same treatment that those of us who left Miramax and the Weinstein Co. had."

Texto completo: The coronavirus continues to spread worldwide, with over 173,800 confirmed cases and over 7,200 dead. In the United States, there have been at least 3,927 cases and more than 68 deaths, according to a New York Times database.
Coronavirus is here, and it's spreading quickly. Older Americans, those with underlying health conditions and those without a social safety net are the most vulnerable to the infection and its societal disruption.
Though life as we know it is sharply off kilter, there are measures you can take.
Most important: Do not panic. With a clear head and some simple tips, you can help reduce your risk, prepare your family and do your part to protect others.
Stay home if you can.
Even if you have no underlying health conditions, and no symptoms, be extra cautious to protect other people
You can do your part to help your community and the world. Do not get close to other people.
This is called "social distancing" or "physical distancing," and is basically a call to stand far away from other people. Experts believe the coronavirus travels through droplets, so limiting your exposure to other people is a good way to protect yourself.
Avoid public transportation when possible, limit nonessential travel, work from home and skip social gatherings. Don't go to crowded restaurants or busy gyms. You can go outside, as long as you avoid being in close contact with people.
That might be hard to follow, especially for those who can't work from home. Also, if you're young, your personal risk is most likely low. The majority of those who contract coronavirus do not become seriously ill, and it might just feel as if you have the flu. But keeping a stiff upper lip is not only foolhardy, but will endanger those around you.
If you develop a high fever, shortness of breath or another, more serious symptom, call your doctor. (Testing for coronavirus is still inconsistent -- there are not enough kits, and it's dangerous to go into a doctor's office and risk infecting others.) Then, check the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website and your local health department for advice about how and where to be tested.
Wash your hands. With soap. Then wash them again.
It's not sexy, but it works
Wash your hands, wash your hands, wash your hands. That splash-under-water flick won't cut it anymore.
A refresher: Wet your hands and scrub them with soap, taking care to get between your fingers and under your nails. Wash for at least 20 seconds (or about the time it takes to sing "Happy Birthday" twice), and dry. Make sure you get your thumbs, too. The C.D.C. also recommends you avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands (tough one, we know).
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers, which should be rubbed in for about 20 seconds, can also work, but the gel must contain at least 60 percent alcohol. (No, Tito's Handmade Vodka doesn't work.)
Also, clean "high-touch" surfaces, like phones, tablets and handles. Apple recommends using 70 percent isopropyl alcohol, wiping gently. "Don't use bleach," the company said.
To disinfect any surface, the C.D.C. recommends wearing disposable globes and washing hands thoroughly immediately after removing the gloves. Most household disinfectants registered by the Environmental Protection Agency will work.
Try to stand away from other people, especially if they seem sick. Wave, bow or give an elbow bump, rather than shake hands. Maybe skip the kiss on the first date.
Stay informed.
Knowing what is accurate can protect you and your family
There's a lot of information flying around, and knowing what is going on will go a long way toward protecting your family.
[Stay Informed: The New York Times is providing free coverage of the crisis .]
Johns Hopkins has a comprehensive web guide, as does Harvard Medical School. The C.D.C. has up-to-date information, and your local health department is a great resource for questions.
With children, keep calm, carry on and get the flu shot.
The good news is that cases in children have been very rare
Right now, there's no reason for parents to worry, the experts say; coronavirus cases in children have been very rare.
The flu vaccine is a must, as vaccinating children is good protection for older people. And take the same precautions you would during a normal flu season: Encourage frequent hand-washing, move away from people who appear sick and get the flu shot.
As with airplanes, it's always best to make sure your metaphorical oxygen mask is on before helping others. When talking to your children about an outbreak, make sure that you first assess their knowledge of the virus and that you process your own anxiety. It's important that you don't dismiss their fears and that you speak to them at an age-appropriate level.
Be sure to be in communication with your child's school, including about early dismissals or possible online instruction. Be prepared for schools to close; many districts and universities around the world have already taken that step.
Communicating with your workplace about child-care concerns that you have is suggested as well.
If your children are stuck at home, get some games going, turn on a movie and try to make it feel a little like a vacation, at least for the first few days.

Don't stockpile masks.
Unless you are already infected, face masks won't help
Face masks have become a symbol of coronavirus, but stockpiling them might do more harm than good.
First, they don't do much to protect you. Most surgical masks are too loose to prevent inhalation of the virus.
(Masks can help prevent the spread of a virus if you are infected. The most effective are the so-called N95 masks, which block 95 percent of very small particles.)
Second, health care workers and those caring for sick people are on the front lines. Last month, the surgeon general urged the public to stop stockpiling masks, warning that it might limit the amount of resources available to doctors, nurses and emergency professionals.
But do stock up on groceries, medicine and resources.
Preparation is the best way to protect your family and loved ones
Stock up on a 30-day supply of groceries, household supplies and prescriptions, just in case.
That doesn't mean you'll need to eat only beans and ramen. Here are tips to stock a pantry with shelf-stable and tasty foods. (Don't forget the chocolate.)
If you take prescription medications, or are low on any over-the-counter essentials, go to the pharmacy sooner rather than later.
And, in no particular order, make sure you're set with soap, toiletries, laundry detergent, toilet paper and diapers, if you have small children.

Texto completo: Republicans, it turns out, can't do economic policy.
America's catastrophically inadequate response to the coronavirus can be attributed largely to bad short-term decisions by one man. And I do mean short-term: At every stage, Donald Trump minimized the threat and blocked helpful action because he wanted to look good for the next news cycle or two, ignoring and intimidating anyone who tried to give him good advice.
But here's the thing: Even if he weren't so irresponsibly self-centered, he has denuded the government of people who could be giving good advice in the first place.
Trump disbanded the National Security Council's pandemic response team in 2018, although he now, with his characteristic refusal to accept responsibility for anything, says that he knew nothing about it. And he has in general staffed his administration with obsequious toadies who never tell him anything he doesn't want to hear.
What's now becoming clear is that when it comes to dealing with the economic fallout from Covid-19, the situation may be even worse. There are still some competent professionals holding senior positions at federal health agencies, who could give Trump good advice if he were willing to listen. But serious economic thinking has effectively been banned from this administration, if not the whole Republican Party. As far as I can tell, the Trump team is utterly incapable of formulating a coherent response to the gathering economic crisis.
As a result, there are only two potential loci of intelligent economic policymaking left in Washington. One is the Federal Reserve; the other is the congressional Democratic leadership. At this point, in other words, it's pretty much up to Jay Powell, the Fed chairman, and Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the House; the question is whether Trump and Senate Republicans will let them save the economy.
Powell, of course, slashed interest rates and announced a large asset-buying program on Sunday. He was right to do so. But it's painfully obvious that these moves won't be sufficient, indeed will probably do little to stop the economy's tailspin. Remember, in 2007-8 the Fed cut rates five times as much as it did Sunday, and it still wasn't able to prevent the worst slump since the Great Depression.
In fact, Powell himself basically acknowledged as much, declaring that he and his colleagues "don't have the tools" to reach those most in need of help, and that "fiscal responses are critical."
Fiscal responses, of course, have to come from Congress. True, in another time, under another president, the White House would have played a crucial role in shaping crisis legislation. But last week, as the House drafted and then passed an economic relief bill -- one that was helpful, if still clearly inadequate -- it was almost entirely a Democratic effort. Democratic staff members put together the key elements of the bill -- paid sick leave for many (though not enough) workers, enhanced unemployment benefits, increased federal contributions for Medicaid and more.
True, Steve Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, negotiated with Pelosi, basically to make the bill a bit worse. But Democrats set the shape of the bill, even as Trump was proposing the grandiose notion of a payroll tax holiday, which has been panned even by conservative economists.
As Greg Mankiw, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under George W. Bush, wrote, "a payroll tax cut makes little sense in this circumstance, because it does nothing for those who can't work. ... President Trump should shut-the-hell-up."
And while the White House was basically out of the loop, Republican senators have been actively obstructionist, offering no serious proposals of their own but holding up a vote on the House bill, even though that bill passed with overwhelming bipartisan support.
Why are Republicans useless at best in the face of an economic crisis? As I've pointed out before, there are many competent center-right economists, but the G.O.P. -- not just Trump, but the whole party -- doesn't want their advice. It prefers hacks and propagandists, the people Mankiw famously called "charlatans and cranks," whose only idea is tax cuts. The party truly has nobody left who is capable of putting together a plausible economic rescue package.
The Senate probably will eventually pass Pelosi's bill. But with all signs pointing to a steep economic dive, we need a much bigger stimulus package -- perhaps along the lines being developed by Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader -- as soon as possible. This package shouldn't include tax cuts; it should focus overwhelmingly on cash grants, perhaps a basic grant to every legal resident plus additional grants to those in special need.
And since there's nobody left in the G.O.P. who can put together a coherent stimulus plan, Democrats will have to do the job, perhaps with help from the Federal Reserve intervention to stabilize highly stressed financial markets.
I admit to being somewhat worried that Democrats won't go big enough. But my bigger worry is that Republicans will undermine their efforts. It's now up to Powell and Pelosi to rescue the economy, and Trump and company need to get out of their way.

Grieving for My Sick City

Texto completo: For those who revel in urban life, it's hard to believe it can just stop.
There is a lot to mourn right now. Many thousands of people all over the world are mourning dead loved ones. People are mourning lost jobs, lost savings, lost security. Senior citizens in locked-down nursing homes are mourning the loss of visitors. I'm lucky; I'm just mourning the city.
To live in a city like New York, where I've spent most of my adult life, is to trade private space for public space. It's to depend on interdependence. I don't have a dining room, but I've been able to eat in thousands of restaurants. I have no storage space, but everything I needed was at the bodega. I don't have a home office, but I could work at coffee shops.
Now those supports are gone. The coronavirus disaster is going to devastate communities all over the country, even if many in red America don't realize it yet. But it poses particular challenges for urbanites, and not just because the disease spreads more easily where people are packed close together.
Historically, cities have made it easier for people to live alone without experiencing constant loneliness. "For single women, with or without children, cities offer domestic infrastructure," my friend Rebecca Traister wrote in her book "All the Single Ladies: Unmarried Women and the Rise of an Independent Nation." "The city itself becomes a kind of partner, providing for single women the kind of services that women have, for generations, provided men."
In times of stress in New York -- Sept. 11, the 2003 blackout, the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy -- people gather for comfort and mutual assistance. When Donald Trump was elected and many New Yorkers felt the ground beneath their feet crumbling, they rushed to mass meetings.
Now the ground beneath our feet is crumbling again, but many of us are stuck in at least semi-isolation. Togetherness, once a balm, has become a threat. This mass withdrawal is like social chemotherapy, damaging the fabric of our communal life while trying to save it.
Social distancing is brutal for everyone, but it's a particular difficulty for people in cities, especially those who live alone and those packed into tiny spaces. Steven Taylor, a University of British Columbia professor and author of "The Psychology of Pandemics: Preparing for the Next Global Outbreak of Infectious Disease," told me that some people quarantined during the SARS epidemic developed PTSD. "Self-isolation is like a milder version of quarantine," he said.
And where you're isolated matters. "It's going to be a fundamentally different experience if you're able to stroll around your 10-acre farm and pick the produce you've been growing," Taylor said, than if you're "living in a one-bedroom apartment with your three roommates."
When this emergency is over, people are likely to emerge into fundamentally changed cities, with economies in crisis and beloved restaurants, businesses and cultural institutions gone for good. "We all need to be worried about the corner diner and the new coffee shop and the bodega and the small nonprofit organizations," said Eric Klinenberg, a sociology professor at New York University and the author of "Palaces for the People: How Social Infrastructure Can Help Fight Inequality, Polarization, and the Decline of Civic Life." "There's just countless operations that are vulnerable right now because everyone is pulling in."
New York City is launching a loan program for small businesses, and hopefully state and federal governments will follow with more substantial rescue packages. But Gregg Bishop, commissioner of the New York City Department of Small Business Services, told me, "There's probably going to be some businesses that may not be able to recover from this."
I wonder if our cultural romance with urban living will recover either. In recent decades, millennials, who tend to be more averse to suburbia than their parents and grandparents, have helped fuel an urban resurgence. If the shock of the coronavirus is devastating enough, that could change, as more people seek their own personal bunkers.
"We have lots of previous historical experiences that generated new anxiety about the city and pushed people out into the suburbs," said Klinenberg. "There was a post-World War II anxiety about nuclear war that gave some people the fantasy that the suburb would be a safer place. Before that there were anxieties about infectious diseases, or public health hazards like cholera, that pushed people out of the city as well."
Klinenberg is far from convinced that this will happen again. "What I hope for is that this rising generation learns to appreciate just how deeply connected we are to each other, just how valuable it is to invest in public goods, and how precious and important shared experiences in public spaces are," he said.
I hope so too. Maybe when this ends, people will pour into the restaurants and bars like a war's been won, and cities will flourish as people rush to rebuild their ruined social architecture. But for now it's chilling to witness an entire way of life coming to a sudden horrible halt. So many of the pleasures and consolations that make dwelling in cramped quarters worth it, for those privileged enough to choose city life, have disappeared. Even if they all come back, we'll always know they're not permanent.

Texto completo: For the foreseeable future, MinnPost will be providing daily updates on coronavirus in Minnesota, published following the press phone call conducted by the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) each afternoon.
Here are the latest updates from March 16, 2020:
* 19 new cases, 54 total
* Who should be tested and why you should stay home
* Will bars and restaurants close?
* How many hospital beds and ventilators Minnesota has
* Only gather in groups of 50 or fewer* 19 new cases, 54 total
Minnesota confirmed 19 new cases of COVID-19 Monday, for a statewide total of 54.
The age range of the new cases are 21 to 71 and the counties where the 19 cases reside with number of new cases announced Monday are:
* Hennepin (10)
* Dakota (2)
* Ramsey (2)
* Olmsted (1)
* Washington (1)
* Blue Earth (1)
* Anoka (1)
* Benton (1)
The Minnesota Department of Health hasn’t completed investigations from all the cases but says the nine out of 19 new cases it has exposure and risk information from have recent histories of foreign or domestic travel.
A reporter on the call asked whether there was any additional information about Blue Earth County’s first case. Infectious Disease Director Kris Ehresmann said:
“We’re unable to give specific information about cases because we do have to protect patient confidentiality. I think it’s important for people to realize if there’s a case in your community, it’s very likely we’ll see additional spread.”
MDH has said it will give more aggregate information once there are more cases.
Three out of Minnesota’s 54 confirmed COVID-19 cases are hospitalized. One of them, who is not in critical condition, is among the people announced Sunday as having likely picked up the virus through community spread. One Minnesotan remains in critical condition.
Minnesota’s counties with cases now include: Anoka, Benton, Blue Earth, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Olmsted, Ramsey, Renville, Stearns, Waseca, Washington and Wright.
[A note from your friendly neighborhood daily update reporter: These numbers are very likely to go up every day for a while and yes, it is stressful! I’ve been trying to not focus on worrying about that, and focus instead on telling everyone I know to stay home as much as possible to prevent spread so everyone who gets a bad case of COVID-19 doesn’t have to go to the hospital at the same time. Also go outside and get some fresh air if you can. We’re all in this together.]
Who should be tested & staying home when sick
MDH said it’s asking people who are hospitalized and those who work in health care to be prioritized when it comes to COVID-19 testing. Ehresmann said this is because whether or not these people test positive has direct implications for health care.
Moreover, she said there’s no need to be tested if you’re in a situation where you’re managing your symptoms at home.
Think about it this way: Best to stay home with upper respiratory symptoms and consider seeking care (first consulting with providers over the phone) if your symptoms become so acute you would have sought care before the COVID-19 outbreak.
Again, one of the most critical guidelines is to stay home if you’re sick.
After you’re sick, stay home for three days after your fever has subsided without using fever-reducing medications, Ehresmann said.
“If you had an illness that lasted four days, you could be fever-free for three days and you could be out in the world after seven days,” she said.
Will bars and restaurants close?
Lots of states and local governments have shut down bars and restaurants in an effort to “flatten the curve.” Will it happen in Minnesota? It might.
“We are in discussion with the governor’s office on that, that is something we are having conversations about,” Ehresmann said.
This just in: Mayor Jacob Frey has declared a local public health emergency in Minneapolis. “He’s going to ask bars, restaurants, night clubs and coffee shops to close or limit their hours,” per MinnPost local government reporter Jessica Lee.
Hospital beds, ventilators
MDH said it is monitoring the number of ICU hospital beds and ventilators across the state but is not making those numbers public. There is a strategic national stockpile that includes ventilators that Minnesota may request supplies from.
Still, Ehresmann said this disease presents challenges not seen before in Minnesota, and it’s critical to slow the spread so systems can respond better.
Only gather in groups of 50 or fewer*
Last week, MDH recommended canceling or postponing events with 250 or more participants. After the CDC issued updated guidelines for events with more than 50 participants, Minnesota followed suit. Read the updated MDH guidelines here.
*Remember, if you go to a smaller event, you should still stay 6 feet away from people.

Texto completo: A member of the New York Times editorial board tweeted partial comments President Trump made to governors, during which he told them to start obtaining respirators on their own, with the board member failing to include his subsequent statement that they have the administration’s backing.
In a video call on Monday, Trump told governors, “Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment — try getting it yourselves,” according to a transcript obtained by the New York Times.
The outlet's Mara Gay tweeted out the quote but did not include the second half of Trump’s statement in which he said, "We will be backing you, but try getting it yourselves. Point of sales, much better, much more direct if you can get it yourself."
"Trump told governors this morning they are on their own," Gay wrote, linking out to a New York Times story that included the full quote.
Tweet
In a Monday press conference, Trump told reporters that if states can get ventilators and respirators “directly, it's always going to be faster if they can get them directly if they need them, and I have given them authorization to order directly.”
The president accused journalists of spreading “fake news” the day before, saying “it would be great if we could really give the news correctly. It would be so, so wonderful.”
Earlier this month, Gay erroneously claimed that former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg could have given $1 million to every American instead of spending $500 million on his failed presidential bid.
The New York Times did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Washington Examiner.

'Irresponsible': New York Times editorial board member blasted for mischaracterizing Trump coronavirus quote

Texto completo: Conservatives blasted New York Times editor Mara Gay after she tweeted a truncated version of President Trump's remarks to governors on the coronavirus pandemic.
While the president was discussing state efforts to contain the coronavirus pandemic with governors on Monday, he suggested they seek certain medical equipment from wherever source it is available rather than solely relying on the federal government.
“Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment — try getting it yourselves. We will be backing you, but try getting it yourselves. Point of sales, much better, much more direct if you can get it yourself," he said in a conference call at the White House. "We will be backing you, but try getting it yourselves. Point of sales, much better, much more direct if you can get it yourself."
Mara Gay, a member of the newspaper's editorial board, shared the story on social media along with just the first half of Trump's quote, failing to provide important context to the conversation.
"Trump told governors this morning they are on their own: 'Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment — try getting it yourselves,' Mr. Trump told the governors during the conference call, a recording of which was shared with The New York Times," she tweeted.
Conservatives were swift in their criticism of Gay's tweet, with some mentioning a slip-up from early this month when she mistakenly claimed former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg could have given a million dollars to every American with the $500 million he spent on his failed 2020 presidential campaign.

New York Times editorial board spreads fake news about White House response to COVID-19

Texto completo: A New York Times editorial board member has graduated from not understanding basic arithmetic to telling lies on social media about the White House’s response to the coronavirus pandemic.

The New York Times’s Mara Gay tweeted Monday afternoon, “Trump told governors this morning they are on their own: ‘Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment — try getting it yourselves,’ Mr. Trump told the governors during the conference call, a recording of which was shared with The New York Times.”
Tweet
Her tweet, which has been shared by more than 5,000 social media users, is a lie of omission.

President Trump did not tell the governors they are on their own. He told them they can streamline their respective responses by taking specific actions at the state level. He also made sure to tell them they have the support of the White House.

I understand that adding and subtracting are not Gay's strengths, but she really should have tried harder to include the part where the president clearly did not say what she suggested he said.

The note that Gay shared with her more than 72,000 followers includes a link to the New York Times’s collection of live updates on the COVID-19 virus. That collection includes the relevant portion of Trump’s remarks to governors.

It reads: “Mr. Trump told a group of governors that they should not wait for the federal government to fill the growing demand for respirators needed to help people diagnosed with coronavirus.”

Trump told them specifically, “Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment — try getting it yourselves.”

“We will be backing you, but try getting it yourselves,” he said, according to the New York Times. “Point of sales, much better, much more direct if you can get it yourself.”

This is nowhere near what Gay’s tweet suggested the president had said to the governors. There is no other way to characterize her tweet than to call it "fake news." It is intentionally false information, disseminated broadly on social media with the explicit intent of misleading people. The only real difference between Gay's tweet and the sort of stuff the Russians pumped onto social media during the 2016 presidential election is that Gay is an American citizen.

Bret Stephens: Trump meets Nemesis, the punisher of hubris

Texto completo: The word “nemesis” is too often misused. We tend to think of it as meaning a powerful, nefarious but ultimately conquerable enemy: Vader; Voldemort; the Wicked Witch of the West. But the original Nemesis was not a villain. She was a goddess — an implacable agent of justice who gives the arrogant, insolent and wicked what they deserve.
As a matter of public health, nobody should ever suggest that the novel coronavirus represents any form of justice, divine or otherwise. It’s a virus that must be stopped.
As a matter of politics, however, it’s hard to think of a mechanism so uniquely well-suited for exposing the hubris, ignorance, prejudice, mendacity and catastrophic self-regard of the president who is supposed to lead us through this crisis.
A few points to mention.
Alternative facts. In recent days, conservative pundits appear to have been scandalized by the suggestion that the coronavirus is Donald Trump’s Chernobyl. They miss the point, which is not that the virus is a nuclear furnace. It’s that the same absence of trust that pervaded the relationship between the Soviet regime and its people also pervades the relationship between much of America and its president.
A leader who cannot be believed will not be followed, even, or especially, in periods of emergency. If Trump’s supporters now wonder why Americans won’t rally around the president as they did around George W. Bush after 9/11, there’s the answer.
America First. Trump didn’t fail to insert his favorite catchphrase into his speech Wednesday. As usual, it managed to combine jingoism with bad policy. Instead of boasting, he could have learned from South Korea how to test better. Instead of trying to talk down the threat, he could have learned from Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu to speak about it far more honestly. Instead of offering rosy guesses of what the ultimate case fatality rate might be, he could have learned from Germany’s Angela Merkel to teach Americans some sobering math.
Putting America First — a slogan — first, means putting Americans — real ones — last.
Build the wall. “The virus remains low-risk domestically because of the containment actions taken by this administration since the first of the year.” So said a White House spokesman late last month, following the president’s monomaniacal belief that there’s hardly a problem in America that can’t be fixed by building a wall, shutting a port, booting a migrant, imposing a tariff or blaming a foreigner — right down to a “foreign virus.”
Except that containment turned out to have dwindling returns once the virus moved beyond China, squandering time and resources while creating a false sense of geographic immunity. Had the White House abandoned its ideological obsession a month ago and instead urged or mandated social distancing from the start, we’d be in a better place now.
Drain the swamp. The administration’s other core belief is that America is in the evil grip of the “administrative state.” But while it’s one thing to pare federal bloat and curb bureaucratic overreach, what we have now is a White House that can’t distinguish between muscle and fat, essential government and excess.
Hence the disconnect between the president’s airy promise that the coronavirus test is available to all who need it and the sobering reality that kits are in critically low supply. Hence also the astonishing congressional testimony this week by the White House’s acting budget director that he’s sticking to his proposal to slash the budget of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as part of broader cuts to the Department of Health and Human Services.
Very stable genius. Millions of Trump’s supporters aren’t blind to the president’s clownishness and ignorance. But they’ve been relatively indifferent to both because they find the first entertaining and the second irrelevant to his overall performance. Who cares what a president knows about epidemiology so long as the markets are up?
They care now. The coronavirus has exposed the falsehood of so many notions Trump’s base holds about the presidency: that experts are unnecessary; that hunches are a substitute for knowledge; that competence in an administration is overrated; that every criticism is a hoax; and that everything that happens in Washington is BS. Above all, it has devastated the conceit that having an epic narcissist in the White House is a riskless proposition at a time of extreme risk.
Will Trump’s declaration of a national emergency change this?
Maybe, and the president has a belated opportunity to demonstrate seriousness he has lacked so far. But nobody should forget that such seriousness would only be a function of political expediency. Should coronavirus recede in warmer weather, you can depend on Trump to declare his premature victory — not warn that winter is coming.
It should not have had to take a deadly virus to expose this presidency for what it is. But it’s fitting that it has. A man who thinks he can twist every truth to suit his needs has at last discovered that he cannot twist the truths of nature and of one of nature’s gods. Her name remains Nemesis.

Texto completo: Washington • Paging Proust. For me, this is the week when memories rush back from childhood: watching my parents get gussied up for St. Patrick’s Day parades and banquets, green carnations pinned to their lapels; the family’s annual excursion to the Tidal Basin to catch the fleeting pink splendor of the cherry blossoms.
Washington’s most beautiful season is blooming outside while we get herded inside, making the dread and decay feel particularly disorienting.
The landscape is flourishing while a scary plague — and the fumbling response to it by Donald Trump and parts of the federal government — is infecting our nation, causing it to wilt and contract.
The most totemic parts of America — Broadway, Hollywood, Disneyland, March Madness, the Masters, baseball spring training, the Met, late-night comedy shows, tours of the Capitol, Tom Hanks — are shut down as we struggle to figure out what, exactly, we’ve got on our Purell-soaked hands here. Meanwhile, the specter of death speeds across the globe, “Appointment at Samarra”-style, ever faster, culling the most vulnerable.
Cruise ships are docked, schools are closed and the presidential primaries are at risk, with Louisiana becoming the first state to delay its vote. Even my bosses at The New York Times put a lid on the newsroom and told us all to scram into cyberspace.
The stock market, our swaggering symbol of financial health and Trump’s best asset, has become a neurasthenic Victorian lady prone to taking to her fainting couch.
The days grow longer even as the darkness spreads, throwing into harsh relief just how tattered our social safety net has become for so many Americans, who are now panicked about how to pay bills, keep businesses open and safeguard the lives of parents and grandparents.
The cataclysmic changes this past week have been a shocking and humbling reminder of how fragile we humans are, as we see our entire ecosystem vanish when confronted with a deadly pathogen pretty enough when seen under a microscope to be a spring blossom.
Until now, Trump has mostly succeeded in covering up things that could damage him — from taxes to payoffs to paramours during the campaign to blocking evidence and witnesses in his impeachment to his conversation with Vladimir Putin where the interpreter’s notes disappeared.
But a global pandemic is different.
He can’t cover up his lack of empathy, his instinct to mislead, his refusal to do his homework and his blame-shifting. And the idea that Trump could soothe a nation went out the window a long time ago.
He can’t cover up the fact that he is not interested in public policy fixes or ending his juvenile sniping across the aisle. After he woodenly said in his national address Wednesday that “we must put politics aside, stop the partisanship and unify together as one nation and one family,” he jumped back on Twitter to trash Barack Obama and Joe Biden, this time criticizing their response to the swine flu virus.
Trump is only interested in spinning public appearances to create the impression that he’s in charge. As always, such forums offer a fantastic floor to show just how low Mike Pence will limbo. By now, Trump is surely jealous of Pence’s good reviews and requires extra obeisance.
Even when the president stopped being so blithe about the virus, even after his error-ridden national address and his press conference Friday declaring a national emergency — “two very big words” — his attempt at maturity was crystallized in one sound bite. “No, I don’t take responsibility at all,” Trump said, when asked about the egregious lag in testing.
It was far from his tweet in 2013, when he loved trolling Obama: “Leadership: Whatever happens, you’re responsible. If it doesn’t happen, you’re responsible.”
Under the pink blossoming trees Friday, he trumpeted, “We’ve learned a lot, tremendous amount has been learned.”
Neat! But think of the tremendous amount he could have learned much sooner had he not disbanded the White House pandemic office in 2018. When Yamiche Alcindor of PBS asked him about the valuable time lost because of that inexplicable decision, Trump bristled at the sound of a voice that dared pierce his cocoon of sycophancy.
“I just think it’s a nasty question,” he snapped back. “When you say me, I didn’t do it. We have a group of people. I could ask perhaps my administration” because “I don’t know anything about it.”
Even surrounded by the experts, Trump continued to send mixed signals. Despite the fact that he has come in contact with people who have tested positive for the virus, he was procrastinating on getting a test, refusing to self-isolate and still shaking hands with the corporate chieftains he had summoned.
Just like the address Wednesday, Trump’s press conference began to fall apart in real time, as he fell into his natural role as snake-oil salesman.
He bloviated about a website that Google was developing that was going “to be very quickly done unlike websites of the past,” presumably a dis on Obama’s crash-happy health care website.
Trump’s fabulous website was, of course, too good to be true. A Google rep tweeted that the site was “in the early stages of development” and that the company planned to roll out testing in the San Francisco Bay Area “with the hope of expanding more broadly over time.”
Not exactly quick relief, Donald. For once, you are right. You don’t take responsibility at all.

Lujan Grisham to Trump: States need more help

Texto completo: SANTA FE — Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham bluntly urged President Trump during a conference call Monday to provide more help for states struggling to expand their testing capacity as the coronavirus sweeps the globe, according to summaries released by her staff and national media reports.
The New York Times, which obtained a recording of the call, reported that Lujan Grisham and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee reacted angrily after Trump told a group of governors to try getting respirators and other equipment on their own, rather than waiting for the federal government to fill the growing demand.
“If one state doesn’t get the resources and materials they need, the entire nation continues to be at risk,” Lujan Grisham said, according to the New York Times account.
She told the president and others on the call that a lack of federal help is keeping New Mexico and other states from expanding their testing capacity — even when they try to act on their own, as the president suggested, according to a summary provided by the Governor’s Office.
New Mexico, for example, is working to purchase a machine to expand its testing capacity but needs federal help to secure some of the material used to conduct the tests, said Tripp Stelnicki, a spokesman for the governor.
She demanded a follow-up call from Vice President Mike Pence, Stelnicki told the Journal.
She and Pence subsequently talked in a second call, and the vice president committed to getting New Mexico what it needs to expand testing capacity, Stelnicki said.
Lujan Grisham said the federal government’s response has forced states to compete with each other for resources, according to Stelnicki.

Texto completo: NASHVILLE, Tenn. – Two Tennessee men who hoarded over 17,000 bottles of hand sanitizer have donated their stockpile amid backlash and a price gouging investigation.
On Sunday morning, Matt Colvin, an Amazon seller outside Chattanooga, helped volunteers from a local church load two-thirds of his stockpile of hand sanitizer and antibacterial wipes into a box truck for the church to distribute to people in need across Tennessee, according to The New York Times.
Officials from the Tennessee attorney general’s office took the other third. The office is investigating him for price gouging.
Colvin and his brother Noah became the subject of national scorn after The New York Times published a story about how they cleaned out stores of sanitizer and wipes in an attempt to profit off the public’s panic over the coronavirus pandemic.
The article says while people across the country have stockpiled items such as hand sanitizer or antibacterial wipes, internet companies like Amazon and eBay have enacted strict measures to stop those looking to price gouge.
Coronavirus live updates: Death toll surges, schools close and a warning - CDC says no large gatherings for 8 weeks
Noah Colvin, of Hixson, took a 1,300-mile road trip in early March across Tennessee and Kentucky, racking up thousands of bottles of hand sanitizer to resell online.
Meanwhile, Matt stayed at home, waiting for pallets of antibacterial wipes and even more sanitizer to be shipped, according to a New York Times article.
The two then sold sanitizer online at a steep markup – $8 to $70 a pop. Amazon quickly removed their listings amid a larger effort to stop coronavirus-related price gouging.
The Tennessee Attorney General's Office ordered the brothers to stop buying and selling medical goods and products following the reports of possible price gouging while an investigation into their actions is underway.
"We will not tolerate price gouging in this time of exceptional need, and we will take aggressive action to stop it," said Attorney General Herbert H. Slatery III. "During this pandemic, we ask that you report suspicious activity to the Division of Consumer Affairs and refrain from threatening or hostile communication with individuals or businesses you may suspect are price gouging. Our team will review complaints closely and we are prepared to act to protect Tennesseans. "
The Colvins told The New York Times that Noah Colvin hit “little hole-in-the-wall dollar stores in the backwoods. The major metro areas were cleaned out. ”
Matt Colvin said he was simply fixing “inefficiencies in the marketplace. ” Some areas of the country need the products more than others, he said to the Times, and he’s helping send the supply toward the demand. On Sunday he expressed remorse for his actions and said he didn’t realize the gravity of the coronavirus outbreak, or the severe shortage of sanitizer and wipes when he began buying the supplies.
“I’ve been buying and selling things for 10 years now. There’s been hot product after hot product. But the thing is, there’s always another one on the shelf,” he told the Times. “When we did this trip, I had no idea that these stores wouldn’t be able to get replenished. ”

Debating virus terminology is waste of energy

Texto completo: Amid all of the well-placed urgency and occasionally misplaced panic of the COVID-19 pandemic, many have decided there's a pressing need to debate whether terms such as "Wuhan virus" or "Chinese coronavirus" are racist.
On one side is a broad coalition that includes liberal pundits, Democratic politicians, the World Health Organization and the Chinese government.
"Calling it the 'Chinese coronavirus' isn't just racist," Sen. Kamala Harris tweeted, "it's dangerous and incites discrimination against Asian Americans and Asian immigrants."
Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.), chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, says, "Calling the 2019 novel coronavirus the 'Chinese' or 'Wuhan' coronavirus is as descriptive as calling it the 'CPAC coronavirus' - that is to say not descriptive at all."
MSNBC host Chris Hayes opined that it's "just astoundingly gross to call it the Wuhan virus."
The Chinese government agrees.
"Despite the fact that the WHO has officially named this novel type of coronavirus, certain American politicians, disrespecting science and the WHO decision, jumped at the first chance to stigmatize China and Wuhan with it," Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said. "We condemn this despicable practice."
I think on the merits all of these people are mostly wrong. Many illnesses have been named after the place where they originated or were first identified. As my American Enterprise Institute colleague Lyman Stone points out, the Hong Kong flu, Asian flu, Russian flu, Berlin flu, Marburg virus and Zika virus (just to name a few) all derive their names from where they were first isolated. (Zika was named for a forest in Uganda.) Even Lyme disease derives its name from Old Lyme, Connecticut.
Moreover, as T. Becket Adams of the Washington Examiner has chronicled, many of the media outlets condemning the practice of referring to it as the "Chinese coronavirus" or the "Wuhan virus" used the same terminology until fairly recently, when the WHO coined the official name "COVID-19." The New York Times posted a link to a Jan. 21 article, tweeting: "The first U.S. case of the Wuhan coronavirus has been confirmed in Washington State." Even the Chinese government called it the "Wuhan virus" at first.
This also leaves out the fact that China deserves to be blamed for this turning into a pandemic. It initially tried to cover up the outbreak, refusing to cooperate with international health agencies and going so far as to arrest doctors who tried to notify the public of the dangers. Why people should be so eager to carry water for China's PR cleanup operation is beyond me.
So on one level the woke warriors are just wrong. But there's another dynamic at work as well.
While it's not racist to refer to it as the Chinese coronavirus or Wuhan virus, there are people on the right eager to play into the very stereotype the left is decrying by refusing to use the official name. This brouhaha started in large part because of a "Wuhan virus" tweet by Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), a crackpot fond of playing footsie with white supremacist idiots. (He's claimed, among other things, that the 2017 "Unite the Right" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, was a left-wing stunt possibly funded by George Soros.)
Mr. Gosar is a special case, but plenty of more mainstream people enjoy using an unofficial label simply to troll the politically correct and elicit cries of "racism!"
Others have a more serious agenda. Some people, deeply committed to the new nationalist cause and the effort to paint China as an enemy of the United States, have jumped on this crisis as an opportunity to further stigmatize China. After all, a crisis is a terrible thing to waste. That's why President Trump tweeted on Tuesday, "We need the Wall more than ever!"
In his address to the country Wednesday night, Mr. Trump said, "This is the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history." The response played out along the same lines as the virus-name controversy, with opponents decrying xenophobic bigotry and defenders noting that the statement is literally true.
The defenders are right, but the same problem applies. Why call it a "foreign virus"? Have we gone to greater lengths to defeat "domestic" viruses? Would we act differently if this wasn't some invasive plague?
The need to troll China or piggyback an anti-China agenda (whatever its merits) as well as the need to decry the "real problem" of racism both strike me as desperate efforts to exploit a crisis or find comfort in more familiar arguments.
And it's a spectacular waste of time and energy.

Texto completo: One by one, beginning Wednesday night and all through Thursday, the pillars of the American athletic landscape toppled, unceremoniously, to the ground, marking one of the most astonishing nights and days in United States sports history.
Professional basketball disappeared first, then the college game followed; hockey melted away; baseball went on indefinite hiatus; and soccer took leave as well.
Before Thursday, Americans could have held some hope that the country's traditional sports leagues would, in the coming weeks, supply moments of needed respite and emotional escape from the weighty concerns of the coronavirus pandemic.
Instead, within a matter of hours, a sudden, stunning void opened upon the sports scene, as it became clear that no subsection of society -- even seemingly shatterproof, multibillion-dollar sports leagues populated by so many of the nation's larger-than-life public figures -- would go untouched by the outbreak.
The disruptions and postponements and cancellations, which had started last week at a drip-drop pace, a game here and there, swelled Thursday into large, devastating waves that seemed poised to cause far-reaching competitive and financial repercussions for nearly everyone associated with these games and this business for years.
The NHL paused play in the final stretch of its regular season, vowing to resume "as soon as it is appropriate and prudent" to crown a champion for the 2019-2020 season.
Major League Baseball canceled its spring training schedule midswing and delayed its opening day, scheduled for the end of March, by at least two weeks.
Major League Soccer postponed all of its matches for 30 days, and the national soccer teams declared they would not step on a field at least through April.
And late in the afternoon, the NCAA's national basketball tournaments, among the most anticipated sporting events of the season, were canceled, planting a dramatic exclamation point onto a relentlessly depressing day.
Then at night, the PGA Tour announced that it was canceling the Players Championship, which was supposed to start its second round Friday, and all other competition before the Valero Texas Open, which begins April 2.
"I don't think in my lifetime I've seen a reaction anything like this," said Fay Vincent, who was born three years before World War II and served as commissioner of baseball from 1989 to 1992. "It's really a health and business crisis."
The leagues were following in the wake of the NBA, which had put its own season on hold late Wednesday night. Two of its players have tested positive for the virus.
It was almost unreal to see the sports leagues buckle under the pressure of an unseen, outside force. These institutions are more often seen throwing around their considerable financial might and cultural capital, and are frequently viewed as secure in their near-religious place in American society. And for a time, it even seemed they might resist the coronavirus too: various half-measures -- like locker rooms closed to the news media, arenas closed to fans, games transferred to neutral sites in areas less affected by the virus -- were pursued in recent days as solutions to keep athletes safe and sports afloat through the pandemic.
But little by little, over the course of the week, the decision to play on seemed to be clawed from their hands. The pressure came from all over.
Local and state governments increasingly took actions that left the leagues with little to no wiggle room. Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio on Thursday announced a ban on public gatherings of more than 100 people. In New York, a similar restriction was placed on gatherings of 500, which effectively forced the closing not only of sports arenas in the city but also its theaters and museums.
A solemn address on Wednesday night from the Oval Office by President Donald Trump, who had previously played down the severity of the coronavirus, seemed to settle, once and for all, the severity of the moment, as if the roiling of the world's financial markets hadn't already.
And once one of the professional leagues decided to shut down operations, it appeared inevitable that others would follow like tumbling dominoes.
"There is an enormous concern in the sports world not to be left out there to be criticized," Vincent said. "One thing about a herd is if it all merges together, there's some safety in it. That's why it exists."
Such swift, dramatic actions produced a series of sometimes bizarre vignettes around the country's sports arenas, and even some overseas.
The Baltimore Orioles were aboard their team bus, headed to Fort Myers, Fla., for a spring training baseball game against the Minnesota Twins when it was halted and turned around.
St. John's and Creighton had played a half of basketball in the Big East tournament quarterfinals at Madison Square Garden before their game was called off and everyone was sent home.
The Utah Jazz's Rudy Gobert, the first athlete on a major American professional team to test positive for the virus, apologized on a social media account about a video that showed him jokingly touching microphones with his hands during a news conference earlier in the week, before his positive diagnosis.
In Joensuu, Finland, members of the U.S. biathlon team preparing for a tournament there this weekend were awakened in their hotel rooms by staff members at 3 a.m. -- just after Trump announced a travel ban from Europe -- and told to gather their belongings. Less than three hours later, they were on a series of flights arranged by the team's leadership -- to Helsinki, then Munich, then to the United States -- to bring them home.
"They packed their bags quick," said Max Cobb, president of the biathlon federation, who made the decision to recall the athletes. "We didn't ask them. There wasn't time. We felt like if we were going to get these guys out today we needed to make the decision and go for it. And we did.
"This is something way bigger than sport," Cobb said.
That notion -- that sports should take a back seat to graver concerns at a time like this -- was commonly espoused on Thursday.
But it remained to be seen what effect the disappearance of sports from American stadiums and television sets would have on the nation.
Vincent noted that baseball continued to be played during other national crises, including World War II, filling an important role in asserting the identity of the country and steadying morale through periods of public anxiety.
In recent days, as recommendations of "social distancing" put more strains on the connective fabric of American society, the collective act of watching sports seemed to have had the potential to help hold it together, if only through screens and social media feeds.
A deadly pandemic demanded a different sort of action. And the American sports landscape, in period of less than 24 hours, was left utterly denuded.

Texto completo: Jeremy P. ("Jerry") Mulderig of Chicago died peacefully on March 7, 2020, at Amita/Presence St. Joseph Hospital, from complications related to cancer.
He was 69.
Mulderig was born in Kingston, PA in 1950, the first child of Gerald A. and Mary F. Mulderig.
He graduated second in his class of 1968 from Central Catholic High School in Kingston.
At the University of Scranton, he was Editor of The Aquinas, the University student newspaper.
In 1972, shortly after his graduation with high honors from the University, he moved to Germany, as a Fulbright Fellow, for advanced study at the University of Cologne.
In 1973, he entered the English doctoral program at The Ohio State University, from which he received his Ph.D. in 1978.
What followed was a distinguished 40-year career of scholarship and teaching in the areas of rhetoric and writing, 19th century literature and biography, and LGBTQ studies.
Mulderig's college-level teaching career began at Graceland College in Lamoni, Iowa, in 1978.
He taught at Oakland University in 1981-1982, then moved to the Newcomb College of Tulane University in 1982.
In 1988, he accepted a position as Associate Professor in the English Department of DePaul University.
From 1990 to 1997, he was Chair of DePaul's English Department.
In 2004, in recognition of his excellence in teaching he was awarded membership in the prestigious Society of Vincent de Paul Professors, and upon his retirement in 2014, he received the Via Sapientiae, the University's highest honor.
A truly gifted writer, Mulderig was the author of many published academic research papers, and of multiple editions of The Heath Handbook.
In the last five years of his life, he published two books with The University of Chicago Press, in each of which he edited and annotated the writings of Samuel Steward.
The first of these, Philip Sparrow Tells All, was widely reviewed, including in the New York Times.
The second, The Lost Autobiography of Samuel Steward, was launched in April 2018 to high acclaim from both popular and academic reviewers, including a review in the London Review of Books published weeks before his death.
In 2004, Mulderig purchased an apartment in Berlin, and subsequently enjoyed splitting his time nearly equally between his Chicago and Berlin homes.
Family and friends are planning a memorial service to be held in Chicago at some point in the future.
Mulderig is survived by a loving family: his brother Bob Mulderig and sister-in-law Karen Garman, and nephew and niece Patrick Mulderig and Emily Mulderig, all of Washington, DC; and sister Maureen Mulderig and brother-in-law Michael Johnson of State College, PA, and step-niece and -nephew Jennifer Johnson and Bryan Johnson.
Equally important, he is survived by a community of hundreds of devoted former students, academic colleagues, and friends throughout the nation and around the world, many of whom have offered testimony to the significant role Jeremy Mulderig played in their lives.
His impact on this world was profound, and he is, and will be, dearly missed.

A silver lining? Homeowners consider refinancing mortgages after interest rate cuts in response to virus

Texto completo: From credit unions to banks, loan officers in South Florida are on the phones with homeowners, many of whom have one question: When can I refinance my mortgage?
The burning desire to redo mortgages had already been high since the first of the year, as falling interest rates moved them to revise their repayment terms - downward. Then, the Federal Reserve on Tuesday announced an emergency interest rate cut designed to curb the economic damage from the burgeoning coronavirus. It was the first emergency cut by the Fed since the 2008 financial crisis. The central bank made a similar move after the 9/11 terror attacks.
"If you're trying to look for a solitary positive aspect of this crisis, the decline in mortgage interest rates is probably one of the few standouts," said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst for Bankrate in Washington.
The action only intensified the consumer phone traffic for South Florida banks and credit unions, executives said this week.
"Last month was our best month in three years, and this month should be even better," said Doug Leever, mortgage sales manager at Tropical Financial Credit Union in Miramar. "This is a great time to buy or refinance or get a home equity loan."
"The refinance business is absolutely booming," he added.
In Coral Gables, John O'Rourke III, vice president of private banking and wealth adviser at First American Bank, said he helped a high-end client obtain a loan so he could move from one home to another. Before the Fed's action, the rate was 3.75%. Afterward, 3% became the charm.
"In the latter part of last year, who would have thought you were looking at a 3% interest rate?" O'Rourke asked. He told the client: "The stars had aligned."
By week's end, the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage had fallen to 3.29%, according to the finance giant Freddie Mac. For a 15-year term, it dipped to 2.79%.
"These rates are historically low rates," Leever said. "You can afford a more expensive home with low rates."
According to the Mortgage Bankers Association in Washington, the 30-year fixed mortgage was at its lowest level in more than 7 years.
Mortgage rates track the yields of 10-year Treasuries, which slipped below 1% for the first time ever after the Fed took its action.
More downward action could well be on the way "amidst increasing concerns regarding the economic impact from the spread of the coronavirus, as well as the tremendous financial market volatility," the mortgage association said in a statement.
"Refinance demand jumped as a result, with conventional refinance applications increasing more than 30%," said Mike Fratantoni, the association's chief economist. "Given the further drop in Treasury rates this week, we expect refinance activity will increase even more until fears subside and rates stabilize."
The decision to refinance depends on an owner's personal financial situation and future living plans. How long do you plan to stay in the home? How much do you owe? Will a new deal bring the savings you expect?
If you expect to be in the home for only two or three more years, it's probably not worth the effort.
"But if they have a longer term and you can save some money and recoup the cost [of the refinancing] it might be worthwhile," said Craig Garcia, president of Capital Partners Mortgage, the mortgage affiliate of The Keyes Company.
Overall, it's smart for owners to at least review their current financial situation and consider changes that can improve the future, financial advisers say. For many, the home is the biggest investment an individual will ever make.
"It's wise to look at the debt that you have and look at refinance opportunities on that front," said Mason Williams, managing director and chief investment officer of Coral Gables Trust Co. "I expect home refinancings to spike higher in the coming couple of months, and it's definitely a time to buy a house and locking in the rate is going to be wise to do."
Home equity loan, anyone? Borrowing against the equity built up in the home is also a goal of many owners.
"We can loan up to 90% of a person's value of the home minus the first mortgage balance," said Leever of Tropical. "We can go up to that depending on the [owners'] credit."
Tropical doesn't charge any closing costs for loans of up to $250,000, nor does it charge appraisal or title fees or prepayment penalties.
Along with the refinance boom, Hamrick said low rates help to fuel home sales and home construction. "That all feeds into furniture purchases and home improvements."
But there is a dark side to rate downdraft."The not so elegant part of it is how it affects savers," he said.
While borrowers pay less, savers will get less for their deposits.
Said Mason: "Savers are going to get punished."

Texto completo: Former Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum announced Sunday he is entering a rehabilitation facility for treatment of alcohol abuse.
On Thursday, Miami Beach police found Gillum in a hotel room with two other people and three small plastic bags containing suspected crystal meth.
The former Tallahassee mayor later confirmed his presence in the hotel room but denied the use of methamphetamines.
Gillum stated he was in town for a wedding and had too much to drink. First responders were called to the hotel room to assist one of his friends, he said.
But a police report said authorities were called to the hotel room in response to a possible drug overdose. Gillum was "unable to communicate with officers due to his inebriated state," the report said.
"This has been a wake-up call for me," Gillum said in a statement Sunday. "Since my race for governor ended, I fell into a depression that has led to alcohol abuse."
Gillum's statement included an apology to his family, friends and supporters in Florida.
"I am committed to doing the personal work to heal fully and show up in the world as a more complete person," he said.
Gillum won the 2018 primary and became the first black major-party nominee for governor in Florida's history. He went on to narrowly lose the November election to Republican Ron DeSantis by 0.4% of the vote.
Since then, Gillum has been involved in movements to engage voters and increase registration.
"I now need to firmly focus on myself and my family," he said. "I will be stepping down from all public facing roles for the foreseeable future."

More hospitals needed, Cuomo says

Texto completo: Gov. Andrew Cuomo called on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Sunday to transform buildings across the state into hospital facilities, saying the hospital system will likely be overwhelmed by the amount of people needing beds and ventilators as the coronavirus spreads.
Cuomo in a press conference at the state Capitol discussed the oft-mentioned "curve," which must be flattened through social distancing to allow hospitals to keep up with the demand for medical care. But he now sees the curve as a wave.
"The wave could break on the hospital system," he said. "We need to try to reduce the size of that wave."
The ask comes as the number of coronavirus cases in New York hit 729, mainly in Westchester County and New York City. Three deaths have been reported, including a 79-year-old woman who died in New York City hospital Sunday. She was described as having had "multiple medical conditions."
Cuomo also asked businesses to either shutter to reduce the spread of the virus or to allow staff to work from home.
Reducing the wave will be done by maximizing the capacity of current hospitals, providing more staff, including retired nurses and doctors, and developing a reserve staff for when healthcare workers fall ill.
UR Medicine and its affiliates and practices — a group encompassing Strong Memorial, Highland and FF Thompson hospitals, as well as UR Medicine surgery centers — announced Sunday that it had begun rescheduling some patient appointments and surgeries between now and March 29 as it redeploys staff "to ensure treatment of acute care needs at its hospitals, clinics, and physician offices."
Patients whose appointments are changing will hear from their doctor's office. There is no plan to close facilities. Visitors already have been restricted to one per patient at a time, and hospital officials added that means only one visitor per patient could be inside the hospital at a given time.
"Reducing the volume of office appointments and elective procedures will enable the system to continue providing necessary care with fewer staff members—some of whom will be unable to work because schools and child-care facilities are closed, some of whom can be redeployed to care for other patients, and some of whom may need to be quarantined for potential exposure to novel coronavirus," UR Medicine officials said in a statement.
But the demand will soon outpace the capacity of medical buildings themselves, Cuomo said.
The state currently has about 53,000 regular hospital beds and 3,100 Intensive Care Unit beds, which have accompanying ventilators. But 80% of the ICU beds are occupied, which means there are only about 620 beds left across New York.
In a New York Times opinion piece addressed to President Donald Trump Sunday, Cuomo outlined his requests to mobilize federal resources to retrofit existing buildings for medical care.
"States cannot build more hospitals, acquire ventilators or modify facilities quickly enough," Cuomo wrote.
The best solution is to utilize the Army Corps of Engineers to leverage its expertise, equipment and workforce to take facilities like military bases or college dormitories and turn them into temporary medical centers, he argued.
Cuomo would work to provide staff for the new facilities, perhaps from medical schools. The question remains about new ventilators, which are difficult, if not impossible to find, he said.
His estimation is that the state will be short thousands of ICU beds and thousands of ventilators.
"The only way to prevent (overwhelming hospitals) today, given the time constraint, is to deploy the Army Corps of Engineers, and use that capacity to retrofit existing facilities to free up hospital beds," he said.
Cuomo also asked the federal government to remove regulatory barriers to coronavirus testing to widen the scope of high-volume labs and methods that can be used.
On Friday, Trump greenlighted testing at local and automated labs; automated testing, versus, manual testing, can increase the numbers of tests being done from 30 to 1,000 tests per day, said Cuomo.
But that's not enough to keep up with the demand, he said, and labs that use testing machines other than those currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration should be allowed to move forward with testing.
While testing mainly concerns those interacting with medical facilities, the spread of the virus must be slowed through social distancing measures.
Cuomo asked businesses to "aggressively consider work from home strategies and aggressively consider voluntarily closures."
He appears to have no plans to close schools statewide, but said that it's a good step for local communities if they can mitigate the negative effects of closing schools, such as the lack of child care, meals for students and the potential loss of essential workers as they care for their children at home.
"If you can address the negatives of closing schools, then close the schools," he said."It's up to the locality to come up with a plan to do it."

Men who bought thousands of bottles of hand sanitizer ordered to stop sales

Texto completo: As cleaning supplies and hand sanitizer fly off grocery store shelves in a rush of coronavirus panic shopping, two Tennessee men are being ordered to stop hoarding and reselling in-demand products online.
Noah Colvin, of Hixson, Tennessee, took a 1,300-mile road trip in early March across Tennessee and Kentucky, racking up thousands of bottles of hand sanitizer to resell online.
Meanwhile, his brother Matt stayed at home, waiting for pallets of antibacterial wipes and even more sanitizer to be shipped, according to a New York Times article.
The two then sold sanitizer online at a steep markup — $8 to $70 a pop. But Amazon quickly removed their listings amid a larger effort to stop coronavirus-related price gouging.
Now, the brothers reportedly have over 17,000 bottles of hand sanitizer and nowhere to go — and two attorneys general who demand they stop buying more.
On Saturday night, Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery announced his office had ordered the Colvins to stop buying and selling while they're investigated for price gouging.
"We will not tolerate price gouging in this time of exceptional need, and we will take aggressive action to stop it," Slatery said in a press release.
Tennessee and Kentucky have anti-price gouging laws to prevent necessities from being sold at a markup during states of emergency — a status that both states are under to fight the coronavirus. An online petition calling on Slatery to prosecute Matt Colvin has thousands of signatures.
"This is a time where we have to focus on helping our neighbors, not profiting from them," said Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron. "We're not going to tolerate selfish actions that put the health of Kentuckians at risk, and I'm grateful for Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery's partnership in bringing an end to this harmful scheme."
The Colvin brothers did have at least one Kentucky lawmaker on their side: U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie. In a tweet Saturday afternoon, Massie defended the free market and called on online retailers to change their policies.
"If @amazon and @eBay are concerned about public welfare, they should waive their commissions on hand sanitizer and face masks instead of limiting the sales of said essential items at inflated prices," Massie tweeted. "Anti-gouging laws and price-fixing will lead to shortages and suffering."
Matt Colvin defended his practice in The Times profile, saying there is "crushing overwhelming demand" for products like sanitizer.
"The Dollar General in the middle of nowhere outside of Lexington, Ky., doesn't have that," he continued.
Harrison County, the site of the first and the majority of Kentucky's COVID-19 cases, is a rural area north of Lexington.
After The Times article published, Colvin said he was exploring ways to donate the bulk items.
And later on Sunday, officials from the Tennessee attorney general's office were spotted clearing out hand sanitizer from Colvin's storage unit, according to reports from news outlets.
Suspected price gouging in Kentucky can be reported to the consumer protection hotline at 888-432-9257.

Texto completo: Gov. Andrew Cuomo called on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Sunday to transform buildings across the state into hospital facilities, saying the hospital system will likely be overwhelmed by the amount of people needing beds and ventilators as the coronavirus spreads.
Cuomo in a press conference at the state Capitol discussed the oft-mentioned "curve," which must be flattened through social distancing to allow hospitals to keep up with the demand for medical care.
But he now sees the curve as a wave.
"The wave could break on the hospital system," he said. "We need to try to reduce the size of that wave."
The ask comes as the number of coronavirus cases in New York hit 729, mainly in Westchester County and New York City.
Three deaths have been reported, including a 79-year-old woman who died in New York City hospital Sunday. She was described as having had "multiple medical conditions."
Cuomo also asked businesses to either shutter to reduce the spread of the virus or to allow staff to work from home.
Steps to fight coronavirus in New York Reducing the wave will be done by maximizing the capacity of current hospitals, providing more staff, including retired nurses and doctors, and developing a reserve staff for when healthcare workers fall ill.
But the demand will soon outpace the capacity of medical buildings themselves, Cuomo said.
The state currently has about 53,000 regular hospital beds and 3,100 Intensive Care Unit beds, which have accompanying ventilators. But 80% of the ICU beds are occupied, which means there are only about 620 beds left across New York.
In a New York Times opinion piece addressed to President Donald Trump Sunday, Cuomo outlined his requests to mobilize federal resources to retrofit existing buildings for medical care.
"States cannot build more hospitals, acquire ventilators or modify facilities quickly enough," Cuomo wrote.
The best solution is to utilize the Army Corps of Engineers to leverage its expertise, equipment and workforce to take facilities like military bases or college dormitories and turn them into temporary medical centers, he argued.
Cuomo would work to provide staff for the new facilities, perhaps from medical schools. The question remains about new ventilators, which are difficult, if not impossible to find, he said.
His estimation is that the state will be short thousands of ICU beds and thousands of ventilators.
"The only way to prevent (overwhelming hospitals) today, given the time constraint, is to deploy the Army Corps of Engineers, and use that capacity to retrofit existing facilities to free up hospital beds," he said.
Request for the federal government on COVID-19 Cuomo also asked the federal government to remove regulatory barriers to coronavirus testing to widen the scope of high-volume labs and methods that can be used.
On Friday, Trump greenlighted testing at local and automated labs; automated testing, versus, manual testing, can increase the numbers of tests being done from 30 to 1,000 tests per day, said Cuomo.
But that's not enough to keep up with the demand, he said, and labs that use testing machines other than those currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration should be allowed to move forward with testing.
While testing mainly concerns those interacting with medical facilities, the spread of the virus must be slowed through social distancing measures.
Cuomo asked businesses to "aggressively consider work from home strategies and aggressively consider voluntarily closures."
He appears to have no plans to close schools statewide, but said that it's a good step for local communities if they can mitigate the negative effects of closing schools, such as the lack of child care, meals for students and the potential loss of essential workers as they care for their children at home.
"If you can address the negatives of closing schools, then close the schools," he said."It's up to the locality to come up with a plan to do it."

Texto completo: In a matter of days life has changed dramatically in Louisiana.
Parades and concerts have been cancelled. University students are being asked to move out of their dorms as classes move online for the remainder of the school year. On Friday, parents across the state learned that all schools will be closed until April 13 and many churches learned they couldn't offer Sunday services.
The measures come as the number of cases in Louisiana continue to increase, with the majority concentrated in the New Orleans area in what is believed to be community spread of the virus.
While these closures may seem jarring and will certainly impact people's livelihoods and daily routines, public health officials stand firm that these measures are the best way to contain the spread of a virus that has become a global threat in mere months.
Epidemiologists call this "social distancing." It's a public health measure that's put in place to try to limit the number of people exposed to a virus once it has started spreading in a community.
Public health workers say these measures also serve the ultimate goal of damping down the number of new infections that could end up overwhelming emergency rooms, intensive care units, and medical staff in the region.
"There are finite health resources wherever you go," said Dr. Susan Hassig, an associated professor of epidemiology at the Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine. "We want to keep the level of transmission down for as long as we can."
The concern is real. Mayor Latoya Cantrell said she is looking for more space to care for the sick in case hospitals become overloaded — the old Veterans Administration hospital building or maybe even tents to triage patients.
As more cases are identified in Louisiana, epidemiologists are trying to learn from the health crisis in Italy where the number of new cases fast eclipsed the capacity of hospitals in the most affected regions of the country. Italy is now considered the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in Europe with more than 15,000 cases and more than 1,000 deaths.
"We need time," Massimo Puoti, the head of infectious medicine in one of Milan's largest hospitals told the New York Times days ago, explaining that his goal right now is to halt the number of new infections as the country continues to battle the virus.
Time is exactly what Louisiana doctors are hoping to get as the number of new suspected cases continues to increase.
"It's a really difficult thing for many Americans to wrap their heads around when you see physicians were making decisions about treating younger people rather than older people," said Hassig.
By stretching out the new numbers of cases over a period of several months rather than seeing a big jump in a short period of time, the healthcare system has the time to adjust and prepare.
Dr. Jay Kaplan, the medical director of care and transformation at LCMC Health System in New Orleans, called this the bell shape curve. Health officials hope to "flatten the curve," which would mean reducing the number of new cases and stretching them out over a longer period of time rather than having a sudden spike of cases.
"You have, generally speaking, a rapid increase of new cases where it reaches a peak before it gradually falls. The question is how high is that peak," he said.
He said the public can take steps to lower the number of new cases. While younger, healthy people are less likely to get severely ill from this virus, the trouble is many people can be infected and not show any symptoms, according to Kaplan.
"That's the danger. Most people with influenza-like illness, cough, fever, muscle ache, know well enough they should not go to a public place. A person can still be asymptomatic and transmit it," he added.
The LCMC Health System, which operates a network of five hospitals in the New Orleans-area, has joined hospitals across the state in taking measures to limit the spread of the virus and protect its workers and patients.
LCMC offers expanding telemedicine services so that patients can check in with doctors over their online portals. LCMC and Ochnser health system have started expanding the capacity of their urgent care centers to take in patients.
"Public health officials are asking the public to call their primary care provider before going to an emergency room or doctor's office. People without a primary care provider who have questions about COVID-19 or feel like they may be developing symptoms can contact 1-211 or text LACOVID to 898-211 for information.

Texto completo: Gov. Andrew Cuomo called on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Sunday to transform buildings across the state into hospital facilities, saying the hospital system will likely be overwhelmed by the amount of people needing beds and ventilators as the coronavirus spreads.
Cuomo in a news conference at the state Capitol discussed the oft-mentioned "curve," which must be flattened through social distancing to allow hospitals to keep up with the demand for medical care. But he now sees the curve as a wave.
"The wave could break on the hospital system," he said. "We need to try to reduce the size of that wave."

Three deaths have been reported, including a 79-year-old woman who died in New York City hospital Sunday. She was described as having had "multiple medical conditions."
Cuomo also asked businesses to either shutter to reduce the spread of the virus or to allow staff to work from home.
Steps to fight coronavirus in New York Reducing the wave will be done by maximizing the capacity of current hospitals, providing more staff, including retired nurses and doctors, and developing a reserve staff for when health care workers fall ill.
UR Medicine and its affiliates and practices – a group encompassing Strong Memorial, Highland and FF Thompson hospitals, as well as UR Medicine surgery centers – announced Sunday that it had begun rescheduling some patient appointments and surgeries between now and March 29 as it redeploys staff "to ensure treatment of acute care needs at its hospitals, clinics, and physician offices."
Patients whose appointments are changing will hear from their doctor's office. There is no plan to close facilities. Visitors already have been restricted to one per patient at a time, and hospital officials added that means only one visitor per patient could be inside the hospital at a given time.
"Reducing the volume of office appointments and elective procedures will enable the system to continue providing necessary care with fewer staff members – some of whom will be unable to work because schools and child-care facilities are closed, some of whom can be redeployed to care for other patients, and some of whom may need to be quarantined for potential exposure to novel coronavirus," UR Medicine officials said in a statement.
But the demand will soon outpace the capacity of medical buildings themselves, Cuomo said.
The state has about 53,000 regular hospital beds and 3,100 Intensive Care Unit beds, which have accompanying ventilators. But 80% of the ICU beds are occupied, which means there are only about 620 beds left across New York.

Texto completo: "There are finite health resources wherever you go. ... We want to keep the level of transmission down for as long as we can."
Dr. Susan Hassig
An associated professor of epidemiology at the Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine
In a matter of days life has changed dramatically in Louisiana.
Parades and concerts have been cancelled. University students are being asked to move out of their dorms as classes move online for the remainder of the school year. On Friday, parents across the state learned that all schools will be closed until April 13 and many churches learned they couldn't offer Sunday services.
The measures come as the number of cases in Louisiana continue to increase, with the majority concentrated in the New Orleans area in what is believed to be community spread of the virus.
While these closures may seem jarring and will certainly impact people's livelihoods and daily routines, public health officials stand firm that these measures are the best way to contain the spread of a virus that has become a global threat in mere months.
Epidemiologists call this "social distancing." It's a public health measure that's put in place to try to limit the number of people exposed to a virus once it has started spreading in a community.
Public health workers say these measures also serve the ultimate goal of damping down the number of new infections that could end up overwhelming emergency rooms, intensive care units, and medical staff in the region.
"There are finite health resources wherever you go," said Dr. Susan Hassig, an associated professor of epidemiology at the Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine. "We want to keep the level of transmission down for as long as we can."
The concern is real. Mayor Latoya Cantrell said she is looking for more space to care for the sick in case hospitals become overloaded - the old Veterans Administration hospital building or maybe even tents to triage patients.
As more cases are identified in Louisiana, epidemiologists are trying to learn from the health crisis in Italy where the number of new cases fast eclipsed the capacity of hospitals in the most affected regions of the country. Italy is now considered the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in Europe with more than 15,000 cases and more than 1,000 deaths.
"We need time," Massimo Puoti, the head of infectious medicine in one of Milan's largest hospitals told the New York Times days ago, explaining that his goal right now is to halt the number of new infections as the country continues to battle the virus.
Time is exactly what Louisiana doctors are hoping to get as the number of new suspected cases continues to increase.
"It's a really difficult thing for many Americans to wrap their heads around when you see physicians were making decisions about treating younger people rather than older people," said Hassig.
By stretching out the new numbers of cases over a period of several months rather than seeing a big jump in a short period of time, the healthcare system has the time to adjust and prepare.
Dr. Jay Kaplan, the medical director of care and transformation at LCMC Health System in New Orleans, called this the bell shape curve. Health officials hope to "flatten the curve," which would mean reducing the number of new cases and stretching them out over a longer period of time rather than having a sudden spike of cases.
"You have, generally speaking, a rapid increase of new cases where it reaches a peak before it gradually falls. The question is how high is that peak," he said.
He said the public can take steps to lower the number of new cases. While younger, healthy people are less likely to get severely ill from this virus, the trouble is many people can be infected and not show any symptoms, according to Kaplan.
"That's the danger. Most people with influenza-like illness, cough, fever, muscle ache, know well enough they should not go to a public place. A person can still be asymptomatic and transmit it," he added.
The LCMC Health System, which operates a network of five hospitals in the New Orleans-area, has joined hospitals across the state in taking measures to limit the spread of the virus and protect its workers and patients.
LCMC offers expanding telemedicine services so that patients can check in with doctors over their online portals. LCMC and Ochnser health system have started expanding the capacity of their urgent care centers to take in patients.
While Lafayette has not reported any suspected cases of coronavirus so far, Lafayette General Hospital has limited the number of visitors allowed in its buildings with the exception of their pediatric wards. Our Lady of Lourdes Regional Medical Center has taken similar steps.
"We are not saying you can't have visitors but there is going to be a methodical and organized approach for the safety of everyone," said Joan Stokes the vice president of quality and clinical risk management for Lafayette General Health.
The hospital has also restricted vendors from coming in for the time being.
"Public health officials are asking the public to call their primary care provider before going to an emergency room or doctor's office. People without a primary care provider who have questions about COVID-19 or feel like they may be developing symptoms can contact 1-211 or text LACOVID to 898-211 for information.

Texto completo: Lebanon splendid, if you can afford it
I entirely agree with William Koppenheffer that Lebanon City Hall is fawningly attentive to the concerns of the wealthy, the well-connected and the socially prominent citizens within its purview (“Making Lebanon a great place to live,” March 10).
The rest of us may eat worms, and like ’em.
We must deal with irate City Council members affronted that we expect them to keep city streets safe for those who must use them in winter. (Is this Lebanon’s own contribution to voter suppression?) When they’re not irate, they’re sorrowful, insisting that their council colleagues just ignore their plaintive urgings to do the right thing.
Lebanon is a splendid place to live if you can afford to own and maintain a nice home; to drive where you need or want to while encouraging the rest of us to go car-free as much as ever we can; to pay $3 for four radishes at the farmers market; to keep your children well-occupied with wholesome and expensive after-school activities while other people’s children can do without essential improvements to the buildings where they receive their educations.
You want to claim you’re a city? Expect to provide appropriate municipal services to your residents and figure out how to pay for it. You’re the smart guys, right?

Taxes are too high: Assess budgets
For the third time in as many years, Lebanon’s voters declined to approve a $20 million-plus building package for our schools. Speaking for myself, as a “no” voter, it’s not that I don’t value education — of course I do. My vote expresses my conviction that Lebanon’s property taxes are already too high and that we need to find ways to improve the ratio of services we receive from our local, county and state governments — and not only in the area of school budgets, but across the board.
My property is assessed at $253,700. Last year’s property tax was $7,704. My previous home in New Hampshire (not in Lebanon) had a value of about twice my current home, and taxes on it were about half what I pay here. By way of comparison, last week’s New York Times real estate section included three homes that sold for about $300,000, along with the property taxes on each:
A condo in Miami Beach sold for $299,000. Property tax: $2,724.
A house in Wiscasset, Maine, sold for $310,000. Property tax: $5,357.
A house in Carlottesville, Va., sold for $310,000. Property tax: $2,172.
Perhaps before again putting an item on the school ballot that would result in a more than $200 increase in my taxes (to almost $8,000!), we need to conduct a careful analysis of the budgets of both the school SAU and our local, county and state governments, to see how cost effective they are and where they can be improved.

Businesses show leadership in sustainability
Congratulations to three important Upper Valley businesses for their leadership in sustainable practices.
At the New Hampshire Businesses for Social Responsibility’s inaugural Sustainability Awards, held earlier this month, Mascoma Bank won the award for sustainable workplace practices. Hypertherm won the Cornerstone Award, which “exemplifies the concepts of corporate social responsibility within their organization and promotes the concepts of corporate social responsibility to the greater community within the State of New Hampshire,” and Hanover Co-op Food Stores was a finalist in three categories: community, environment and governance.
As a member of New Hampshire Businesses for Social Responsibility and a Lebanon resident, I’m thrilled to have these purposeful, ethical companies in our community. They help us all strive to be better for people, planet and profit.

Rich are coming after your money
Are you better off today than you were four years ago? Today you probably owe more in bills and credit cards. President Donald Trump has been tweeting that there’s more money in your paycheck. That is only because a large percent of what you were paying in taxes now goes into your paycheck instead of to the IRS.
This extra money was already yours. You earned it. Granted, the money that used to be taken out was like an interest-free savings account. What you don’t see you can’t spend. You used to get it back in your income tax refund check every April. Now you get nothing, or you have to pay in because you made too much.
The reason the stock market was doing so well, at least before the current crisis, is because the rich who got the $1.6 trillion tax cut are playing with your money in the market, not theirs. When this money is used up, the rich will be eyeing the trillion dollars in your 401(k) accounts. They will be coming after this money.
Wake up, America. Trump and his friends would not give you the time of day. You will learn your lesson the hard way.

LOOKS LIKE A RADICAL, WORKS LIKE A PRAGMATIST OCASIO-CORTEZ IS BUILDING BRIDGES WITH MODERATES

Texto completo: When Sen. Elizabeth Warren dropped out of the presidential race last week, the path for Sen. Bernie Sanders was clear: He would need to win over her supporters to have any chance of stopping former Vice President Joe Biden and the moderates coalescing behind him. The Sanders camp would need to reach out to those who had opposed them and persuade them to join his cause. This idea was anathema to some of his most ardent backers.
"Warren supporters have exhausted me," tweeted writer Nylah Burton, who added that up until recently she was planning to vote for Ms. Warren. "Y'all made us talk about snake emojis for 2 months," she wrote, in reference to the snake emoji Sanders supporters tweeted to Ms. Warren after a debate in January.
One radical took a different path. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. - known for refusing to compromise with centrists, opposing them in primaries, grilling their allies in committee rooms and endorsing Mr. Sanders in October - sought to build bridges. She declared herself a "Bernie supporter who builds with Warren supporters." She called a viral "Saturday Night Live" video of Ms. Warren "legendary" (even as others took the chance to denounce Ms. Warren, as well as Ms. Ocasio-Cortez for offering a kind word).
"Maybe it's not a great idea for the Sanders campaign to have one of their top surrogates continuously trying to make nice with an opposing candidate who keeps attacking Sanders," journalist Walker Bragman tweeted about the congresswoman's outreach.
Although Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is often labeled a "progressive firebrand" and a "liberal bomb thrower," she is, in reality, a pragmatist. She wants results, and she's willing to bend to get them. Her efforts to mend the rupture between Warren and Sanders supporters are typical. And the instincts behind them will, in the long run, equip her to forge ties among the Democratic mainstream that Mr. Sanders cannot. Her efforts at outreach today are not just good for Mr. Sanders, they are good politics. If done deftly, they could do more than help Democrats electorally. They might draw a few left-wing ideas into the Biden campaign.
Mr. Sanders promises to expand the Democratic electorate and drive turnout, but so far, new voters have not been appearing at the polls to award him delegates. That means he'll need to win over centrist and undecided Democrats, building relationships with allies who can reach traditional liberals. This goes against the ethos his movement appears to have cultivated. The campaign seems to recognize this blind spot, though it might already be too late. Last week, Mr. Sanders' campaign made its first real effort to embrace former president Barack Obama, airing a new ad highlighting Mr. Obama's praise of him.
Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, by contrast, has acted practically since her 2018 election. Before she was sworn in to the House, she advocated for the Green New Deal by rallying protesters in front of Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office. (In 2019, Ms. Pelosi wrote off Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and her allies, saying: "They didn't have any following. They're four people and that's how many votes they got.")
But when it came time to re-elect the speaker or recruit a challenger, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez made the safe choice, voting for Ms. Pelosi and noting that most of Ms. Pelosi's challengers were more conservative than she is. "So long as Leader Pelosi remains the most progressive candidate for speaker, she can count on my support," the freshman congresswoman said.
Despite Fox News' caricatures of the congresswoman, her politics - which focus on the economic issues affecting everyday, working-class Americans well beyond the confines of her New York district - appeal to voters outside of her base. She doesn't run on identity politics, and her approach to holding the Trump administration accountable has centered on asking tough questions, not speechifying on cable news shows. During the House Oversight Committee's hearing with Mr. Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen, while Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., ignited a dispute with a Republican colleague, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez chose to focus her questioning on the president's finances.
Similarly, when Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was invited by Rep. Garland "Andy" Barr, R-Ky., to meet with Kentucky coal miners to see how her Green New Deal would affect miners in the state, she accepted. And when Mr. Barr rescinded the invite, she continued to express interest in visiting, despite the potential for a contentious meeting.
Even instances in which she has appeared to hold the left's line have ended in practical achievements. After she supported a primary challenger to Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-Mo., in Missouri in 2018, Mr. Clay co-sponsored Ms. Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal legislation. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez's decision to back Mr. Sanders while he recovered in a hospital from a heart attack turned out to be one of the most consequential endorsements in the 2020 primary. It injected new energy into his campaign and significantly consolidated the left. This shows her grasp of the fact that, to rack up electoral wins, her wing of the party will have to demonstrate the kind of solidarity that establishment Democrats and the rich can deploy overnight.
If she could strengthen the progressive coalition by both building its left fringe and making inroads with establishment Democrats such as Ms. Pelosi, she is a different kind of politician than the avatars of ideological purity many have seen in her.

Texto completo: Betsy Byars, wrote of deserted children
Betsy Byars, who drew from life to write award-winning children's books that often portrayed young people grappling with abandonment, died Feb. 26 at her home in Seneca, S.C. She was 91.
Her daughter, Nan Byars, said the cause was complications after a fall in November.
Betsy Byars' more than 60 books, usually aimed at readers on the cusp of adolescence, included "The Summer of the Swans" (1970) - which won the Newbery Medal, one of the most prestigious awards in children's literature, in 1971 - and "The Night Swimmers" (1980), which won the National Book Award for children's books in 1981.
According to an article in The Christian Science Monitor, Ms. Byars told an audience at the Smithsonian Institution in 1984 that she found many of her characters by "going through life like a pickpocket - I do a lot of creative stealing." She regularly placed her characters in tense situations, with a pronounced absence of adult support.
"Other authors have used the gimmick of getting rid of the parents, but none of them have done it with the zest I have," Ms. Byars said. "I've sent them down turquoise mines, had them running from the FBI and made them into country-western singers."
"The Summer of the Swans," about children who live with an aunt after their mother dies, follows an awkward adolescent girl's search for her brother, who has mental disabilites, when he disappears. The novel, which Ms. Byars wrote after volunteering for a time as a tutor for mentally challenged children, conveys the insecurity and angst that plague the protagonist, Sara, along with her fear for her vanished brother, Charlie.
Ms. Byars' other books include "Wanted . Mud Blossom" (1991), which won an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America in 1992; and "The Two-Thousand-Pound Goldfish" (1982).

A full-blown recession need not be

Texto completo: It's inevitable: To contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic and save thousands of lives, the economy is going to take a hit. As shutdowns disrupt businesses large and small, we may even fall into recession.
The Federal Reserve gets that we are at a critical moment, one on par with the 2008 financial crisis. On Sunday, the central bank cut its benchmark rate by a full percentage point to near zero — back where it sat for years during the Great Recession and beyond — and said it would purchase $700 billion in Treasury debt and mortgage-backed securities.
The moves, which came less than two weeks after policy makers lowered rates by a half-point, are designed to help restore stability to stressed credit markets and ensure that banks have enough cash to lend, even as the world seems to fall apart. They won't send money directly to consumers or businesses.
The White House, by contrast, botched its initial response to the public health emergency, and the administration and Congress underwhelmed with their reaction to the looming economic crisis. As a New York Times editorial pointed out over the weekend, the bill passed by the House early Saturday to provide paid sick time and family leave for employees affected by the coronavirus has exemptions that limit its scope.
To be fair, the legislation, which President Trump supports, includes measures that would certainly help: free virus testing for those with no insurance, beefed-up unemployment benefits and food assistance, and more federal Medicaid funds.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said it was just a first step by Congress.
But unless she, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, and Trump can agree on a massive fiscal plan to cushion the coming blow, it's likely the stock market panic will metastasize into a full-blown economic crisis, despite the Fed's actions. While much of the financial aid may not be needed tomorrow, quick agreement would help restore confidence among consumers and businesses.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Sunday that he doesn't expect a recession, which is defined as two straight quarters of negative growth.
That's no surprise, given that his boss's reelection bid could be derailed if the economy tanks. But independent economists say a contraction isn't a foregone conclusion.
“Under the ideal scenario, the US economy or at least a huge part of it will shut down to slow the spread of the virus with the goal of allowing the health care system to cope.
Then, in a few weeks, as the threat passes, schools, businesses, and life in general would re-open and get back to normal," Peter Ireland, an economics professor at Boston College, said in an e-mail.
“Realistically, though, we can't count on everything working out that smoothly."
Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, an economics professor at the University of California Berkeley, cautions that even with a relatively quick return to business as normal, the damage could be significant.
In a March 13 paper, he said US gross domestic product could be cut by 6.5 percent on an annualized basis under a scenario in which economic activity is reduced by 50 percent for one month and 25 percent for a second.
“As a point of comparison, the decline in output growth in the US during the 2008-09 `Great Recession' was around 4.5%. We are about to witness a downturn that could dwarf the `Great Recession,' " he wrote.
Gourinchas's solution?
Policies that would mitigate the economic losses, much like aggressive social distancing measures can reduce the stress on the health care system.
“It will require a massive program," he wrote on Twitter. “No tinkering at the margins will do."
With help from Gourinchas and others, here's what the feds should focus on:
It's time to put the people first
Workers need to get paid even if they can't get to their jobs because of lockdowns, they get sick, or they must stay home to take care of family members.
The Pelosi package is an OK start, but more is needed to help people through this unprecedented situation.
“I'd love to find every Uber driver who is getting fewer rides or every coffee stand guy who is selling less coffee," said Megan Greene, an economist and senior fellow at the Mossavar-Rahmani Center of Business and Government at the Harvard Kennedy School.
But since that's not really feasible to be so targeted, she said, “I am in the camp that says just send checks. We've done it before. Other countries are doing it now."
Greene was referring to an idea proposed by Harvard economist Jason Furman in a Wall Street Journal op-ed ­column: a one-time payment of $1,000 to every adult US citizen or taxpaying US resident, and $500 to every child who meets the same criteria.
The payments would be fairer and more efficient than cutting payroll taxes, an idea that Trump has floated, wrote Furman, who was chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers during ­Barack Obama's second term.
Nation's businesses come second
During the 2008 financial crisis, corporations — most notably banks and automakers — got bailed out, while ordinary people lost their jobs and homes. That was a mistake, but it doesn't mean companies shouldn't get some help this time around.
Otherwise, layoffs will surge as employees seek to reduce expenses and avoid bankruptcy.
The government is increasing the money available through Small Business Administration loans, but, again, it's not enough.
Greene suggests that the Federal Reserve be allowed to increase lending to small and medium-size businesses by offering cheap money to banks, with the loans guaranteed by the federal government. The European Central Bank has done this for years.
“The Fed can set up a similar program, though it has never been before," Greene said. “It only works if the government goes ahead and provides loan-loss guarantees."
Trump has suggested he would consider bailouts for the airlines and other industries directly impacted by the pandemic. Air carriers have been pounded by government travel restrictions, moratoriums on business travels, and consumers just staying home.
But where would industry bailouts end? Cruise lines and hotels are getting killed, too. But I worry more about smaller businesses, which have much fewer resources to survive until we get back to normal.
Don't forget the financial system
People have been saying this isn't a financial crisis. But it could become one if too many companies can't pay back their loans and banks respond to the losses by reducing lending. That explains why the Fed has taken emergency action between its regularly scheduled meetings.
“As banks begin to suspect that customers will be unable to repay loans on a timely basis this could cause banks to raise borrowing costs and to tighter financial conditions which could cause a spiral of slower growth," wrote Michael Klein and Miriam Wasserman in an analysis by EconoFact, a project of the Edward R. Murrow Center for a Digital World at the Fletcher School.
The Fed's monetary moves can do only so much, and its chairman, Jerome Powell, said it is likely the economy will contract for at least one quarter.
Credit was cheap before the crisis emerged, and the central bank's lower rates will take months to work their way through the economy to consumers.
US stock futures fell more than 4 percent when the trading began at 6 p.m. on Sunday.
On the government-stimulus side, no package — no matter how expansive and well-designed — will be able to save every job and keep every company afloat.
But Congress and the White House need to act nonetheless. Not to would be irresponsible and heartless.
How much will it all cost? More than $1 trillion, easily. Where will the money come from? Federal government borrowing. Now isn't the time to suddenly be worried about deficits.
“With interest rates so low, investors are almost begging the government to borrow," said Greene, the Kennedy School fellow.
Without aggressive action, the odds of a long and deep ­recession increase. If we do nothing, the costs —human and financial — will be far more staggering.

Texto completo: Two health care providers at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston are infected with the coronavirus, and the hospital is contacting patients and staff who may have been exposed.
In a memo to staff Saturday, hospital leaders said they are in close contact with state and city public health officials and are following their guidance about how to proceed.
“As the novel coronavirus spreads across the globe, it is inevitable that health care workers will be infected, as is now the case at the Brigham," wrote Dr. Charles Morris, associate chief medical officer and incident commander. ''We are in the process of contacting patients and staff who may have been exposed.''
"While this news is unsettling, please be assured that our Brigham community has been preparing for this eventuality, and we will continue to take every precaution to protect our patients, their loved ones and our staff throughout this unprecedented pandemic,'' wrote Morris. The memo was also signed by Julia Sinclair, senior vice president of clinical services and incident commander.
Brigham spokeswoman Erin McDonough said the providers did not work while symptomatic. She said the hospital can not identify or release details about the providers or their specific jobs because of privacy rules. Another person with knowledge of the situation said they are both doctors.
McDonough said in an e-mail that the hospital undertook “intensive tracing" that involved a detailed review of every patient and employee the providers interacted with during a particular time period.
Staff who had close contact with either provider — 15 minutes or more at a distance of less than 6 feet — are quarantined at home for 14 days and undergo twice-daily symptom monitoring, she said. Those with no close contact are allowed to work but must wear a mask and monitor themselves for symptoms for 14 days.
Patients with close contact are monitored for symptoms. An environmental services team has been deployed to thoroughly clean the areas where the providers have spent time, McDonough said.
Doctors and nurses are at high risk for contracting the virus, especially if they treat patients who they do not know are infected.
At Berkshire Medical Center, where at least five patients have been hospitalized with the virus, about 70 nurses are quarantined at home after being exposed to those patients, according to the Massachusetts Nurses Association.
There was a gap of several days after the patients were admitted and before they tested positive for Covid-19, during which nurses were not wearing the highest level of protective equipment, hospital executives have said.
At New York-Presbyterian Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville, N.Y., a lawyer from New Rochelle, N.Y., was admitted and had contact with dozens of health care workers before he was diagnosed with the virus. At least one staff member has tested positive for Covid-19 and many others were sent into quarantine, The New York Times reported.

Texto completo: A formidable advocate for modernist music, high culture, and the composer's worth, Charles Wuorinen was awarded a Pulitzer Prize in music in 1970 at age 32 and was confident about the impact he would have.
“If my friends and I decide today that there will be no orchestras, there won't be in 50 years," he said in 1973. “Our influence is long-range. We are the future."
Mr. Wuorinen was 81 when he died Wednesday in Manhattan. His publicist, Aleba Gartner, said the cause was complications of a fall suffered in September.
While composing works for major orchestras, including the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the San Francisco Symphony, he maintained a prickly yet charming public persona.
He received a surge of attention in 2004 when the New York City Opera premiered his opera “Haroun and the Sea of Stories," based on the novel by Salman Rushdie. That was followed by a commission to compose an opera based on Annie Proulx's short story “Brokeback Mountain," which also was the source material for the 2005 movie of the same name.
Mr. Wuorinen gained a reputation as a combative proponent of 12-tone composition, a cerebral idiom he mastered in hundreds of eloquent works.
In the opening to “Simple Composition," his 1979 guidebook for composers, he wrote: “While the tonal system, in an atrophied or vestigial form, is still used today in popular and commercial music, and even occasionally in the works of backward-looking serious composers, it is no longer employed by serious composers of the mainstream. It has been replaced or succeeded by the 12-tone system."
Despite such pronouncements, he strenuously denied that he was part of a domineering atonal vanguard, as some critics suggested. “It's not that a bunch of beady-eyed theoreticians are forcing innocent students to do terrible, nameless things," he said in 1997.
Mr. Wuorinen was remarkably prolific, with a corpus of 279 pieces often suffused with brainy wit as well as influences from Renaissance and medieval music. Over time, his output became less forbidding than his reputation.
“His music used to be chilly and desiccated, a hothouse product, wearing its dissonance as a spiky shield to dissuade all comers," the critic Tim Page wrote in 1986, describing a new orchestral work, “Movers and Shakers."
“Mr. Wuorinen's harmonic language is still uncompromising," he added, “but 'Movers and Shakers' has passages of aching lyricism, and many moments of sheer, visceral excitement."
Charles Peter Wuorinen was born on June 9, 1938, in Manhattan. His father, John, emigrated from Finland and worked in factories before earning a doctorate at Columbia University, where he was subsequently chairman of the history department. His mother, Alfhild Kalijarvi, earned a master's in biology from Smith College.
Charles grew up in the elite intellectual environs of Manhattan's Upper West Side, where he developed a deep connection to the classical canon and began writing music at age 5. Though his parents discouraged a career in composition, he found support from the eminent historian Jacques Barzun, a family friend.
From an early age, he studied with Columbia composers, including Vladimir Ussachevsky and Jack Beeson. He won a Young Composers' Award from the New York Philharmonic at 16.
Receiving an undergraduate degree from Columbia in 1961, and a master's in music there in 1963, he soon became a major voice on the academic scene, with icy, dense pieces such as his String Trio and Piano Variations.
Mr. Wuorinen constructed a system of lucid, hyper-intellectual 12-tone writing in which intervals between notes structured a piece's rhythm and form. His style elaborated the theories of his colleague Milton Babbitt; it also combined the rhythmic vitality of Igor Stravinsky with the atonal vocabulary of Arnold Schoenberg.
In 1962, with the flutist and composer Harvey Sollberger, Mr. Wuorinen founded the Group for Contemporary Music, a pioneering ensemble dedicated to the exacting realization of complex works.
But his academic career remained at times uncertain: As a result of departmental politics, he was denied tenure at Columbia in 1971, only a year after he had was awarded the Pulitzer for his innovative electronic work “Time's Encomium." He went on to teach at many universities, including Princeton, Yale, and Rutgers, as well as at the Manhattan School of Music. He was both beloved and feared by his students.
At Tanglewood, where Mr. Wuorinen taught in the early 1970s, his “Concerto for Amplified Violin" caused something of a stir at a 1972 performance because at that time, pairing amplified and acoustic instruments represented a relatively novel technique.
In the 1980s, he held a major residency with the San Francisco Symphony and became a reliable interview subject for journalists seeking a contrarian and recondite perspective on the state of the arts.
“We have reached the stage, under the impulse of cultural populism, where we are incapable of measuring or acknowledging artistic merit except in terms of commercial success," he told The New York Times in 1991.
As minimalism and neo-Romanticism began to find new audiences and institutional support, eclipsing his style of choice, Mr. Wuorinen was not quiet about his concerns. “What we have is the quick fix, the need for instant self-gratification," he told the Los Angeles Times in 1989. “And that accounts for this utterly unchallenging, unprovocative kind of music."
He would deliver such remarks with a sly smile, knowing that they were bound to rankle. He clung steadfastly, if at times predictably, to his conservative beliefs; in 2018 he said that awarding the Pulitzer to the hip-hop musician Kendrick Lamar marked “the final disappearance of any societal interest in high culture."
He was awarded a MacArthur fellowship and was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He wrote six scores for the New York City Ballet, and his vast catalog also includes notable works for voice as well as percussion.
Under the direction of Gerard Mortier, City Opera commissioned Mr. Wuorinen to write “Brokeback Mountain." But the company folded before it could be presented.
In his reimagining of Proulx's story, a tale of doomed love between two Wyoming cowboys, the character Ennis sings in Schoenberg's technique of sprechstimme, a cross between speaking and singing, but slowly opens up into lyrical lines as he falls in love with the bold Jack.
“In older operas there would be an illegitimate child or difference of social classes," Mr. Wuorinen told The Guardian. “Same-sex love, especially when it takes place in an environment where it's absolutely forbidden, is a contemporary version of the same eternal problem."
In recent decades, conductor James Levine became a champion of Wuorinen's music, commissioning major works including a cogent Fourth Piano Concerto for the Boston Symphony and “Time Regained," a fantasia and homage to early music, for the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra. Both works featured pianist Peter Serkin, who died this year.
Levine and the BSO also commissioned and premiered the composer's Eighth Symphony.
When the Met fired Levine over allegations of sexual misconduct, Mr. Wuorinen publicly defended him. In 2018 he asked: “Can't you ever distinguish between the man and his work? Whatever happened about innocent until proven guilty?"
Mr. Wuorinen leaves his husband, Howard Stokar, with whom he lived for decades in a grand brownstone on the Upper West Side.

Texto completo: Mr. Biden criticized President Trump for his decision to develop a new coronavirus test when one was already available.
"No, the World Health Organization offered testing kits that they have available to give to us now. We refused them. We did not want to buy them. We did not want to get them from them. We wanted to make sure we had our own."
True. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did decide to develop its own coronavirus test, despite the existence of one already created by the World Health Organization. As The New York Times reported, the federal government "designed its own test as it typically does during an outbreak." That test, however, produced faulty results and ultimately delayed local public health departments' ability to test a large number of patients for the novel disease. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization made its test widely available, and more than 60 countries decided to use that product. Mr. Biden claimed he could immediately pass legislation to create a so-called public option that would allow all Americans to enroll in Medicare.
"A Medicare option. We can do that now. I can get that passed. I can get that done, if I'm president of the United States of America."
This is exaggerated. Mr. Biden tried to argue that his health care plan, which would let Americans sign up for Medicare while leaving private coverage intact, had a more realistic path toward becoming legislation than Senator Bernie Sanders's Medicare-for-all proposal. In truth, both policies would face long odds in Congress, where Republicans currently hold a majority in the Senate and oppose both ideas. Even if Democrats were to control both houses, the public option would still be far from easy to enact into law: Many wanted to include it in the Affordable Care Act passed under President Barack Obama, but it ultimately fell out of the legislation after intense lobbying from the health insurance industry. Mr. Biden wrongly said Mr. Sanders voted against the auto bailout.
"Also part of that was bailing out the automobile industry. Saving thousands of jobs. Tens of thousands of jobs over time. He voted against that as well."
This is misleading. Mr. Sanders actually supported the $ 14 billion auto rescue plan in December 2008. "The problem is if you don't act in the midst of a growing recession, what does it mean to create a situation where millions of more people become unemployed and that could spread? And I have serious concerns about that. I think it would be a terrible idea to add millions more to the unemployment rolls," Mr. Sanders told Vermont Public Radio at the time.
But the bill failed in the Senate, prompting the Bush administration to propose using funding from the Troubled Asset Relief Program -- which passed in October 2008 to bail out Wall Street and which Mr. Sanders opposed -- to also aid automakers. Once the bailouts were lumped together, Mr. Sanders opposed the overall package.

Texto completo: Federal officials said many more drive-through testing sites, along with expanded processing of tests by commercial labs, would help ease a bottleneck.
Federal officials are moving ahead with plans to address the screaming shortage of testing for the coronavirus by setting up many more drive-through testing centers around the country and speeding the capability of commercial laboratories to process multiple samples at once.
Adm. Brett P. Giroir, the assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services, said at a White House briefing with Vice President Mike Pence that starting on Monday, 2,000 commercial labs would begin to perform coronavirus tests using high-speed machines that can process many samples at once. Those labs are expected to add somewhere from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tests a week to the nation's capacity, and 1.9 million tests should be available by the end of the week, Admiral Giroir said.
Some experts who have closely followed the government's testing stumbles were skeptical that the federal government could meet such ambitious goals so quickly.
"We obviously welcome all the testing we can get our hands on right now in order to better elucidate what's going on in our communities," said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. "But given the experience of the last four to five weeks of promised testing that didn't develop, I wait anxiously to see if this can be developed. Many of us will believe the testing ability when it happens."
Until now, the testing has been done manually, and labs could perform only 40 to 60 tests a day.
In addition to the added high-speed laboratories, the government will help set up many more drive-through testing centers around the country so that people do not have to go to emergency rooms or doctors' offices to be tested. The centers will be set up in store parking lots and other such locations and operated by states in conjunction with members of the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps. Each should be able to screen 2,000 to 4,000 people a day, Admiral Giroir said. The units, created by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, are known as points of distribution, or PODs.
"The sites will roll out progressively over the week," Admiral Giroir said. "This is not make believe, it is not fantasy. We will start shipping gear and deploying officers Monday and Tuesday."
Mr. Pence said that more than 10 states had already set up their own drive-through test sites. But some have had waiting times several hours long and had to turn people away.
Admiral Giroir said the first priority in testing would be given to health care workers, first responders and people who are particularly vulnerable, including those over 65 with symptoms and others with underlying conditions that weaken their immune systems. Regions with high numbers of cases will get first priority for the testing centers, he added.
Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the White House's coronavirus response coordinator, and Admiral Giroir, whom Alex M. Azar II, the health and human services secretary, last week put in charge of coordinating testing efforts across federal agencies, appealed to the public not to seek testing unless symptoms and a real need were present.
Dr. Birx warned that as testing increases -- Admiral Giroir described a regimen that "can test many tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of individuals per week and maybe even more" -- there will be a spike in the number of reported cases.
The shortage of tests and the long delay in starting to correct the problem have left doctors and patients frustrated and frightened, and experts say the lag in identifying cases helped hide the spread of the virus and slowed efforts to stop it.
Dr. Osterholm said that testing would play an important role in determining whether efforts to control the virus were working.
When schools are shut down, restaurants and bars are closed and Broadway has gone dark, how will authorities know when it is time to let things get back to normal? he asked.
"We need a trigger to turn things on, and a trigger to turn them off," he said. "You need testing for that."
In an email, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the former head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said, "Testing is not a panacea."
He warned that demands for widespread testing could even do harm. In areas where the virus is spreading, he said, people with mild or no symptoms "will take up the time, protective equipment, and lab materials of health facilities," possibly becoming infected in the process.
Dr. Frieden added, "Testing is crucially important to find when the virus is spreading, control outbreaks in health facilities, care for people with pneumonia, and understand the virus better."
But he emphasized that it's important to understand the limits of testing.
"Whether the people with symptoms are positive or not, they must isolate themselves, especially from medically vulnerable people: the test could be falsely negative, or could become positive the next day. Furthermore, in a communitywide outbreak, there's no way public health workers will be able to identify and track contacts of all people who test positive."

Lil Yachty featuring Drake and DaBaby, 'Oprah's Bank Account'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
We'll look back at Lil Yachty's rap career as a means to an end. His new single "Oprah's Bank Account" has a plinking charm, just like his breakthrough hits "1 Night" and "Minnesota." Beats like these -- soft shuffles with chirpy melodies -- suit him the most neatly. But what he does best atop them isn't anything specifically technical -- he's more character actor than rapper. Hence, this video, a nine-minute comedy sketch in which Yachty plays an Oprah-like talk show host giving Drake and DaBaby the third degree. That they're game for the elaborate shtick means they hear something in Yachty, and that they see something more than can be heard. JON CARAMANICA
Ava Max, 'Kings & Queens'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
It has been ... checks watch ... barely a dozen years since Lady Gaga restored shimmery disco 4.0 maximalism to pop music. Ava Max is in a hurry to revive the revival. "Kings & Queens" continues her brazen, loyal-little-monster updating of Gaga's glitter. CARAMANICA
Margo Price, 'Twinkle Twinkle'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Too often on Margo Price's first two albums, her ambition was undercut by her production, which was faithful and often polite. Finally, "Twinkle Twinkle" -- from her forthcoming third album, "That's How Rumors Get Started," produced by Sturgill Simpson -- has a sound to complement the particular tang of her voice. Simpson assembled a band both ferocious and grimy: Matt Sweeney, Pino Palladino, James Gadson, Benmont Tench. They're uproarious support for Price, whose singing is looser and tarter than ever. CARAMANICA
Natalia Lafourcade, 'La Malquerida'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Released on International Women's Day, "Malquerida" ("Unloved Woman") is a campfire singalong by the Mexican songwriter Natalia Lafourcade. She strums a Venezuelan cuatro, a small guitar, and sings a waltz about the age-old mistreatment of poor, hardworking women: "Without looking at my eyes they silenced my words." Quietly, and then with resolve, the women and girls flanking her join in to sing, "Ay, que dolor": "What sorrow." JON PARELES
The Seshen, 'Wander'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"Wander" is the two-minute track that ends "Cyan," the new album by the Seshen, a band from the San Francisco Bay Area. It's less a song than a bit of slow-motion vertigo: a whorl of overlapping, interlocking instruments and Lalin St. Juste's multilayered vocals, with a three-beat pulse and no clear boundaries between loops and improvisation. PARELES
Tones and I, 'Bad Child'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Tones and I -- the Australian songwriter Toni Watson -- conquered the world last year with "Dance Monkey," and she follows it up with a variation on its music and attitude: plinking piano chords and her annoyed-child voice carry her from petulance to righteous pugnacity. This time, instead of singing about a rapacious audience, she's confronting insecurities implanted by her family -- ones she hasn't entirely conquered. PARELES
Mara Rosenbloom, 'Dream of a Common Language -- Irruption'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
There's a low-lying restlessness about Mara Rosenbloom's piano playing: Each moment, for her, seems best understood as something to escape from. But with her new trio, Flyways, featuring the vocalist and percussionist Anaïs Maviel and the bassist Rashaan Carter, Rosenbloom leaves loads of empty space; she's inviting you to relax inside her restlessness. The first thing -- and ultimately, one of the only things -- that you hear on "Dream of a Common Language -- Irruption," from Flyways' debut album, is a repeated, five-note pattern in the left hand. Maviel and Carter soon join in, each taking things one note at a time. "No one lives in this room/Without confronting the whiteness of the wall," Maviel sings, sounding cool but tender. Eventually, as the song continues, Rosenbloom starts to adorn that low pattern with chords in the right hand; eventually it disappears completely, as a cloud of electronics fills the air around her. The space feels finally welcoming as Maviel sings in long, slowly fading tones: "The true nature: the drive to connect." GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO
Noveller, 'Effektology'
With her electric guitar and an array of effects, Noveller (a.k.a. Sara Lipstate) summons the tones of bells, choirs, orchestras, calliopes and distant tsunamis. "Effektology" begins as a hazy, airborne, awe-struck reverie and adds just enough of a pulse to propel it toward its resolution. PARELES
Sam Gendel, 'Saxofone Funeral'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
If Sam Gendel is playing his instrument into its own grave on "Saxofone Funeral," then he should be pleased with what he's found there. It's more of a tomb than a grave, adorned for the afterlife with electronic accouterments, curved mirrors and history folding back upon itself. This piece comes from "Satin Doll," an album of electronically warped jazz standards (like the title track) and originals (like this one). Together with the bassist Gabe Noel and the electronic percussionist Philippe Melanson, Gendel builds a rubbery sound-space out of the influences of U.K. jungle, ambient music, underground hip-hop and American Minimalism.

Texto completo: Genesis achieved cult notoriety leading the British rock bands Throbbing Gristle and Psychic TV, and later pushed the limits of gender in a surgical project to merge identities with her wife.
Genesis Breyer P-Orridge, the provocative British musician, writer and visual artist who pushed the limits of gender and the self, often using her own skin as her medium, has dropped her body.
At least, that is how she might have described the transition. Even in death, she would not have wanted to be held to drab social norms.
Genesis's daughters, Genesse and Caresse P-Orridge, announced her death in a statement shared on Facebook by her manager, Ryan Martin. They said Genesis died of leukemia on Saturday at her home on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. She was 70.
Genesis led the influential British rock bands Throbbing Gristle and Psychic TV, dabbled as a dominatrix in New York, ran a soup kitchen in Kathmandu, hid out from Scotland Yard, organized a cultlike fan club that asked initiates to send in their bodily fluids, and undertook a long-running surgical project to merge identities with her wife, Jacqueline Mary Breyer, in a single nongendered being they called a "pandrogyne."
It was a full life. "We've not squandered it," Genesis said in 2018, using the plural pronoun to convey that she spoke for this dual identity. "We've utilized it to the maximum we could."
She was born Neil Andrew Megson on Feb. 22, 1950, in Manchester, England, the second of two children of Ronald and Muriel Megson, who both worked briefly as semiprofessional actors.
Sickly as an adolescent, she had what she described as a tortured passage through England's elite public school system, never comfortable with her body and gender. When, as a teenager, she discovered the Surrealist drawings of Max Ernst, which mashed together heads of one species with bodies of another, it gave her an early taste of the liberation she would pursue for the next five decades.
"I'd grown up thinking that the world was what I saw, and then I realized it wasn't -- it could be anything at all," she told The New York Times in 2018.
It was the dawn of the psychedelic 1960s, and she saw that she could create herself in a new form, as an alter ego she called Genesis P-Orridge, who became a canvas for a wide range of experiments: artistic, pharmaceutical, surgical and spiritual.
After art school she formed a confrontational performance group called COUM Transmissions, which shocked the British art world with a 1976 exhibition called "Prostitution" at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts. The exhibition included pornography, strippers and used tampons, and led one member of Parliament to call the group "wreckers of civilization."
The core members of COUM morphed into Throbbing Gristle, an often abrasive experimental band that coined the term "industrial music" to describe its repetitive, amelodic soundscapes.
As with COUM, performances might involve nudity, self-mutilation, dead animals and Holocaust imagery; the band's best-known single, "Zyklon B Zombie," referred to the poison gas used in Nazi death camps. (At the time, Genesis lived with the band's guitarist, Cosey Fanni Tutti, who later described her as domineering and abusive, an accusation Genesis denied.)
Thus began a career that moved from street theater and small rock clubs to established art galleries and museums.
Tim Mohr, who was helping Genesis write her autobiography, described her as "a Zelig-like character" who "connects to the Beats, was friends with William Burroughs and Brion Gysin, then in the midst of the hippies with Timothy Leary."
"But she didn't see herself squarely in any of those groups," Mr. Mohr said in an interview. "Basically she was obsessed with not repeating things. So big changes were not daunting. She accepts that changes will cause periods of difficulty."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Genesis kept evolving. After achieving cult notoriety in Throbbing Gristle, she found a broader rock audience in the 1980s with the occultist psychedelic band Psychic TV. The group's followers formed a cultlike network called Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth, with members instructed to wear paramilitary uniforms and explore realms of magic and the occult. But in 1991, with the band and the fan club becoming too draining, Genesis relocated to Kathmandu with her first wife, Paula, and their daughters, Genesse and Caresse.
In addition to her daughters, she is survived by a granddaughter.
Another page turned: In her absence, the authorities raided Genesis's home in Brighton, on the English coast, and confiscated materials that were splashed on the news as evidence of a supposed satanic cult. Though no charges were filed, the family went into voluntary exile, ultimately landing in California and the orbit of Mr. Leary, the LSD pioneer, who became a friend and influence.
There, as Genesis's first marriage unwound, she found another unlikely identity, as a single father of two girls, attending P.T.A. meetings in a silver miniskirt and thigh-high boots. "They were good meetings," she said.
On a trip to New York, she met Jacqueline Breyer, a dominatrix and nurse. Their love was so consuming that they wanted to fuse into a single entity, freed from the binary divisions of gender. After Genesis was severely injured in a fire in the California home of the music mogul Rick Rubin in April 1995, the couple moved to New York for her recovery.
They shared clothes and makeup. After Genesis won a lawsuit for the injuries sustained in the fire, they had money and time to push their "pandrogyne" project further. They got matching breast implants. Lady Jaye, as she was known, got a chin implant and had surgery on her nose.
"We'd go to our plastic surgeon and say, what else can we do now to look more alike?" Genesis said.
Then, in 2007, Lady Jaye died of an acute heart arrhythmia. Her death left Genesis alone, one half of an art project that no longer had a second half.
All along, Genesis was writing, painting, creating collages and sculptures that explored gender and sexuality. Once declared a destroyer of civilization, she found her work embraced by the fine art world, including the Tate Britain in London and the Rubin Museum of Art in New York.
Her quest, she felt, remained the same: to pull things apart and put them back together, questioning why they were a certain way. Holding it all together was her most inspired creation, the changing canvas that was herself.
"Some people take their lives and turn them into the equivalent of a work of art," she said. "So we invented Genesis, but Gen forgot Neil, really. Does that person still exist somewhere, or did Genesis gobble him up?
"We don't know the answer. But thank you, Neil."

Texto completo: Readers, American and Canadian, take issue with an Op-Ed article.
To the Editor:
"The Fantasy of Medicare for All," by Scott W. Atlas (Op-Ed, March 10), did not mention that doctors are exhausted, dissatisfied and cynical dealing with private insurers' regulations.
Pre-authorizations for medications, CAT and M.R.I. scans, and referrals to specialists, along with recording office visits on computers, have taken their toll on doctors. Patients suffer as well, for office visits are often rushed and impersonal, and patients leave without feeling that they have been listened to.
Worse, medical errors are more likely.
Patients do better when they feel that they have been treated as people and not as diseases. The chances of this happening would be greater with Medicare for All, which, although it would not be perfect, would have fewer regulations, fewer burned-out doctors, fewer unhappy patients and fewer risks of medical error.
So I strongly disagree with the statement that Medicare patients would be better served by the 28 private insurers that offer them private plans.
Edward Volpintesta

The writer is a general practitioner.
To the Editor:
The true fantasy is Scott W. Atlas's insinuation that the Canadian system delivers a lesser product; this is absolute conjecture (read: nonsense) on his part.
True, availability to a family doctor and wait times for tests or elective surgery may be issues, but it is not true that Canadians have restricted access to cancer and heart disease treatment.
It is not true that the same drugs are restricted north of the border. It is not true that Canadians have worse health care outcomes. It is not true that significant numbers of our citizens have died because of wait times.
Canada has some of the finest hospitals and medical schools in the world. Canadians have a longer life expectancy than Americans. Yet socialized medicine probably won't be successful in the American capitalist system.
Peter Butler

To the Editor:
Scott W. Atlas's analysis of Medicare for all makes it clear that the only ones engaging in fantasy thinking on health care are those, like him, who believe that our present system is serving us well.
When I debate conservative friends and family members on universal health care initiatives, I ask them one question. If universal health care is so horrible, why is it that countries like Britain, Canada and Australia don't ever exchange their "socialist" systems for ours?
The answer is obvious, even with all of the problems and challenges they present: Universal health systems are preferable to ours.
Health care is a right. It's time to take the profit out of the system and ensure that all Americans rich, poor or otherwise have access to quality care.

Texto completo: President Trump's investments in stocks and bonds are holding up no better than the S&P 500.
President Trump, the first self-proclaimed billionaire to occupy the White House, has long asserted that he is one of the world's best businessmen and investors.
But these days, as stocks tumble because of the coronavirus outbreak, he's losing money like everyone else.
Mr. Trump doesn't have a lot of his wealth in the stock or bond markets. What money he does have invested there -- scattered across two dozen stock and bond funds -- appears to be performing no better than the S&P 500 during this year's financial crash.
The S&P 500, which recently entered a so-called bear market, has lost about 16 percent of its value this year as investors brace for a global economic downturn. Mr. Trump's investments, concentrated in mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, appear to be down between 15 percent and 16 percent, according to a New York Times analysis of his most recent financial disclosure form and performance data from Morningstar and the funds' websites.
Before Mr. Trump became president, his investment accounts at Deutsche Bank and Barclays were stuffed with blue-chip stocks, which have been decimated this year. When he closed those accounts, his only exposure to the stock and bond markets was through three family trusts. The investments in those trusts are managed by an outside trustee, not by Mr. Trump.
Mr. Trump's last financial disclosure form was filed in May. The form listed the specific funds in which the three Trump trusts had money, but it provides only ranges of the amount invested in each fund, not precise values. It's possible that money has been added or withdrawn from those accounts since then.
But last spring, Mr. Trump had somewhere between $ 597,000 and $ 2.4 million in the markets through the three trusts. If those holdings were unchanged, Mr. Trump has lost somewhere between $ 97,705 and $ 360,246 this year.
Those losses would barely dent Mr. Trump's fortune. In addition to his extensive real estate holdings, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, he reported having at least $ 47 million in several checking, savings and money-market accounts. (That is offset by the hundreds of millions of dollars that Mr. Trump owes to Deutsche Bank and other financial institutions.)
The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.
Before the S&P 500 soared more than 9 percent on Friday, as Mr. Trump declared a national emergency because of the coronavirus, his investments were slightly beating the broader market. They were down between 18 percent and 21 percent for the year, while the S&P 500 was down 23 percent.
In any case, there is nothing to suggest that Mr. Trump has figured out how to beat the markets. "Stock Market starting to look very good to me!" he wrote on Twitter on Feb. 24. Since then, the S&P has fallen 16 percent.

Texto completo: Mr. Sanders said former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had supported cuts to Social Security.
"You were in the Senate for a few years. Time and time again, talking about the necessity with pride about cutting Social Security, cutting Medicare and veterans programs."
True but lacks context. Mr. Biden at multiple points in his Senate career praised measures to reduce the federal budget deficit, including some that would have reduced the spending growth in Social Security. He has also vowed to protect the program at other times, including in the Senate, in a 2012 vice-presidential debate and in his current campaign, where he has proposed expanding the program.
In 1984, Mr. Biden supported a one-year freeze to cost-of-living adjustments in federal spending that would have applied to Social Security. In 1995 he voted for a federal balanced budget amendment that did not explicitly shield the program from cuts. He said in 2007 that he was open to raising the eligibility age for receiving benefits from the program, and he and President Barack Obama tried to negotiate a so-called grand bargain on federal spending that would have reduced the growth of Social Security spending over time. Mr. Sanders inflated the degree to which he and former President Barack Obama were united in opposition to an immigration bill in 2007.
"That bill was opposed by LULAC, the largest Latino organization in America. They called the guest worker program akin to slavery. The bill was killed because it was a vote on the amendment. I think it was 49 to 48. You know who voted with me? Barack Obama."
This is misleading. Mr. Sanders was referring to immigration reform legislation in 2007. The bill, which ultimately failed in the Senate, would have given legal status to millions of undocumented immigrants, established a temporary worker program, strengthened border security and limited family-based immigration in favor of a skills- and education-based system.
Mr. Sanders was right that the League of United Latin American Citizens said the bill would exploit immigrant workers. And he and Mr. Obama, then a senator, both voted for an amendment that would have scaled back the guest worker program in early June 2007.
But later, Mr. Obama voted to invoke cloture -- ending debate and allowing the Senate to take a final vote on the whole bill -- three times, while Mr. Sanders voted against it all three times. Mr. Biden accused Mr. Sanders of voting against a Russia sanctions bill. Mr. Sanders said he voted against the bill because it included new sanctions on Iran that could undercut the 2015 nuclear deal.
Mr. Sanders: "It was undermining the Iranian agreement."
True on both counts. The argument centers on a vote that the Senate took in June 2017 to impose sanctions on Russia for its interference in the 2016 election. The bill also included sanctions on Iran, at a time when the 2015 nuclear accord with Tehran was still fully in effect.
The bill passed 98 to 2; only Mr. Sanders and Senator Rand Paul voted against it. In a statement, Mr. Sanders said that "I am strongly supportive of the sanctions on Russia included in this bill," and that it was "unacceptable" that Russia interfered with the U.S. elections "or anywhere around the world." But he said he was concerned that new sanctions on Iran "could endanger the very important nuclear agreement that was signed between the United States, its partners and Iran in 2015."
Mr. Biden was a modest player in the Obama administration negotiation of that deal. But he supported it. In criticizing Mr. Sanders, he is essentially saying that the need to punish Russia should have overridden the concerns about undermining the Iran deal. Mr. Sanders came to the opposite conclusion.

Texto completo: A Tennessee man had planned to sell his stockpile at marked-up prices online. Now he is under investigation for price gouging.
A Tennessee man who became a subject of national scorn after stockpiling 17,700 bottles of hand sanitizer donated all of the supplies on Sunday just as the Tennessee attorney general's office began investigating him for price gouging.
On Sunday morning, Matt Colvin, an Amazon seller outside Chattanooga, Tenn., helped volunteers from a local church load two-thirds of his stockpile of hand sanitizer and antibacterial wipes into a box truck for the church to distribute to people in need across Tennessee.
Officials from the Tennessee attorney general's office on Sunday took the other third, which they plan to give to their counterparts in Kentucky for distribution. (Mr. Colvin and his brother Noah bought some of the supplies in Kentucky this month.)
The donations capped a tumultuous 24 hours for Mr. Colvin. On Saturday morning, The New York Times published an article about how he and his brother cleaned out stores of sanitizer and wipes in an attempt to profit off the public's panic over the coronavirus pandemic. Mr. Colvin sold 300 bottles of hand sanitizer at a markup on Amazon before the company removed his listings and warned sellers they would be suspended for price gouging.
As a result, Mr. Colvin was sitting on an enormous cache of sanitizer and wipes while much of the country searched in vain for them.
The article immediately sparked widespread outrage, with thousands of people posting angry comments across the internet about his actions.
Many of those people also contacted Mr. Colvin directly with hate mail and death threats, while one man even banged on the door at his home late Saturday night, according to Mr. Colvin and several messages he shared with The Times.
In an hourlong interview on Sunday, Mr. Colvin expressed remorse for his actions and said that when he decided to hoard the sanitizer and wipes, he didn't realize the gravity of the coronavirus outbreak or the severe shortage of sanitizer and wipes.
"I've been buying and selling things for 10 years now. There's been hot product after hot product. But the thing is, there's always another one on the shelf," he said. "When we did this trip, I had no idea that these stores wouldn't be able to get replenished."
He said the outpouring of hate has been scary for him and his family. He said people have incessantly called his cellphone, posted his address online and sent pizzas to his home. His inbox was flooded with ugly messages, he said. One email he shared with The Times said: "Your behavior is probably going to end up with someone killing you and your wife and your children."
"It was never my intention to keep necessary medical supplies out of the hands of people who needed them," he said, crying. "That's not who I am as a person. And all I've been told for the last 48 hours is how much of that person I am."
Now Mr. Colvin is facing consequences. On Sunday, Amazon and eBay suspended him as a seller, which is how he has made his living for years. The company where he rented a storage unit kicked him out. And the Tennessee attorney general's office sent him a cease-and-desist letter and opened an investigation.
"We will not tolerate price gouging in this time of exceptional need, and we will take aggressive action to stop it," Attorney General Herbert H. Slatery III of Tennessee said in a news release.
Tennessee's price-gouging law prohibits charging "grossly excessive" prices for a variety of items, including food, gas and medical supplies, after the governor declares a state of emergency. The state can fine people up to $ 1,000 a violation.
The language of the law could benefit Mr. Colvin. Gov. Bill Lee of Tennessee declared a state of emergency on March 12, activating the price-gouging law. The Colvin brothers bought all of the sanitizer and wipes in question before that date, and Mr. Colvin said he did not sell anything after it.
A spokeswoman for the Tennessee attorney general's office said that even if the Colvin brothers did not buy or sell any of the supplies after March 12, state authorities "will weigh all options under consumer laws."

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Re "'Never Trump' Biden Republicans," by Sarah Longwell (Op-Ed, March 10):
As a Never Trump Republican, I applaud Ms. Longwell's piece. And I would add that it is not sufficient for us Never Trumpers to sit back and plan to vote for Joe Biden in November. Rather, we need to take action now to assure that Mr. Biden is the Democratic nominee and to build momentum for his successful campaign in the fall.
I am a lifelong Republican who served in the Nixon and Ford administrations, and I am one of the founders of a Bipartisan Committee to Elect Joe Biden. Another founder of our committee is a former chair of the Republican Party in New York State, Sandy Treadwell. The committee originated to support Amy Klobuchar's candidacy, but when Senator Klobuchar withdrew and endorsed Mr. Biden, we were happy to follow her lead.
The focus of our committee has been our local community, Ojai, Calif. We hope that Never Trump Republicans, independents and Democrats in other cities and towns will follow our example and create their own bipartisan efforts. It could make a crucial difference.

Texto completo: She introduced the world to the highly stylized dance when she left her village in 1952 to lead a troupe on an international tour.
Overlooked is a series of obituaries about remarkable people whose deaths, beginning in 1851, went unreported in The Times.
PELIATAN, BALI, Indonesia -- She was a tiny 12-year-old girl with wide, darting eyes and a big headdress, undulating across the stage in the graceful, highly stylized dance of Bali.
Her arms floated and twined, as if they had no bones or joints, as she dipped and rose to the urgent syncopated gongs of a gamelan orchestra.
It was 1952 in New York, and almost no one in the land had experienced anything like it. It had been more than 20 years since the world had seen a live Balinese dance performance, at the Colonial Exposition, an event in Paris that was created to showcase the arts of the European colonies.
The young dancer's name was Ni Gusti Ayu Raka Rasmi. She had never before left her home village, Peliatan, with its small, mud-walled houses surrounded by bright green rice fields.
Now she was the star of the Bali Dancers, a troupe that had traveled more than 10,000 miles into the alien worlds of the United States and Europe.
The troupe included two other female dancers about her age, Oka and Anom, and an accomplished young male dancer named Sampih.
"I was the smallest," Raka Rasmi exclaimed in an interview at her home in Peliatan in 2008, as she paged through an album of pictures from the trip. "I was the cutest!"
The dancers were accompanied by a 40-piece gamelan orchestra in which players used mallets to produce rapid, rhythmic and hypnotic music on banks of percussion instruments.
Balinese dance, with roots in Hindu and traditional folk rituals, is central to the island's culture, performed in temples and courtyards for both religious and secular occasions.
It is characterized by slight, pivoting gestures of the head, hands, fingers and especially the eyes, which are virtually performers of their own, round, intense and expressive.
"When the music is dynamic you have to have a fierce look. You open your eyes wide. You can't smile," Raka Rasmi said. "When the music is soft and sweet, your eyes are also soft and sweet and you smile."
Brilliantly colored costumes and elaborate headdresses add a ceremonial feel to the performances.
On the tour, Raka Rasmi performed a delicate new dance called the Oleg Tamulilingan, or the Bumblebee, in which a male and female dancer circle each other as if courting.
Audiences were ecstatic. The performances received as many as seven curtain calls.
In reviewing the show, The Wall Street Journal called the dances "an exotic elixir of sound, color and movement" led by "a 12-year-old virtuoso who brought down the house."
John Martin, writing in The New York Times, called Raka Rasmi "an utterly lovely wisp of a girl, as serious as an owl until her smile breaks through." Her dancing, he wrote, "was truly superb, technically and dramatically."
Ed Sullivan featured them on his Sunday-night variety show, "Toast of the Town," just as 12 years later he would feature the Beatles on their concert tour of the United States.

The world tour would catapult Raka Rasmi into a lifelong career in dance. By the time of her death, at 79, on March 17, 2018, she would be known as one of the greatest Balinese teachers and performers of her generation.
In the years after the 1952 tour, Bali grew in popularity as a tourist destination and Balinese dance took its place as one of the world's distinctive dance forms.
"Ibu Raka was an excellent teacher and dancer, still performing till the day she died," said Rucina Ballinger, an American dance ethnologist who has spent decades in Bali teaching and dancing. (Ibu is a common honorific for an older woman.)
"As a teacher she was feisty and strong-willed," she added.
She embodied a quality the Balinese call "taksu," which Ballinger described as "charisma, spiritual power, something that exceeds technical brilliance and is seen as a sort of divine energy."
Well into her 70s, Raka Rasmi continued to train students and to perform on special occasions, though she said her aging knees forced her to modify some of the moves.
She was training a student in front of a cracked mirror in her garden during the interview in 2008, her hands fluttering and twittering as she moved, as supple as a girl.
"It's difficult to be a good Balinese dancer," she said, and she demonstrated one of the exercises with her student.
"They pull your shoulders back until you choke to make the bones in your back narrow," she said, pressing a knee into her student's back and pulling on her shoulders, "like that."
Raka Rasmi raised herself on her toes and wiggled her feet to demonstrate a movement. "That's what the doctor told me not to do," she said.
Ni Gusti Ayu Raka Rasmi was born on March 10, 1939, to a family of farmers and raised with no electricity and no radio link to the outside world.
She first learned to dance when she was 10. She was playing near the rice fields where she helped her family by shooing away birds in the planting season and joining in the harvest.
"I was looking for grasshoppers when the teacher came by and said, 'Raka, come here, why don't you hang out with us, why don't you learn to dance,' and we danced around," she said.
At first her parents were against it, she said. "'Why are you putting on makeup and not helping on the farm?"' she recalled her father asking her. "Sometimes they didn't give me food."
But, she said, "After I started bringing in money, they were happy. I was free then. They loved me again."
In 1952, John Coast, a retired British diplomat who had taken up residence in Bali, came to her village and proposed organizing an international tour for a troupe of dancers and musicians.
An executive of Columbia Artists Management, Frederick Schang, who would finance the American leg of the tour, came to see the dancers, and Raka Rasmi received her first rave review.
"The little darling -- oh, the little darling!" Mr. Coast quoted Mr. Schang as exclaiming in his book "Dancing Out of Bali" (1954)."Ni Gusti Raka -- that's your star! She's great. She's so sweet I could eat her with a spoon. All the little darlings -- the American public will go crazy about 'em."

In America Raka Rasmi discovered snow and Coca-Cola and vanilla ice cream. She met Walt Disney on a visit to Disneyland. In London she met the great ballerina Margot Fonteyn at Sadlers Wells. Later, she said, she shook hands with the actress Grace Kelly.
A high point of the trip, as she recalls it, was a visit to Hollywood, where together with the other two child dancers, she performed for Frank Sinatra, and he sang for them. "He was great!"
He invited them to his home, where she met Bob Hope and Bing Crosby, who had just completed the filming of a jokey movie about their homeland called "Road to Bali."
The girls found the film hilarious, Coast wrote. "The movie had nothing of Bali in it, but everybody, and especially the little girls, loved the film," he wrote. "'Itu Bob!' they exclaimed to one another helplessly -- 'That Bob!"'
In her photo album Raka Rasmi saved a picture of Bob Hope in a ski cap and Bing Crosby in a funny hat mimicking the gestures of Balinese dance, with three Balinese girls watching them and laughing.
Decades later, in 2008, she said she still practiced two or three times a week, in the morning and sometimes in the evening, to keep her body flexible, and to make her happy.
"If I couldn't dance I would cry, because I love dancing," she said. "I do it without music because I already have it in my head. I've memorized it. And even in bed, it's still there in my mind when I'm sleeping."

Texto completo: The United States says it will share any vaccine breakthroughs with the world, but German officials appeared rattled by its reported overture to a biotech firm.
BERLIN -- The Trump administration attempted to persuade a German firm developing a possible vaccine for coronavirus to move its research work to the United States, German officials said, raising fears in Berlin that President Trump was trying to assure that any inoculation would be available first, and perhaps exclusively, in the United States.
The offer arose from a March 2 meeting at the White House that included the chief executive of the German firm CureVac, Daniel Menichella. President Trump briefly attended the meeting and Vice President Mike Pence, who heads the White House coronavirus task force, was also there.
"We are very confident that we will be able to develop a potent vaccine candidate within a few months," Mr. Menichella said in a statement on the day of the meeting.
But four days ago, CureVac announced that Mr. Menichella, an American, was leaving the biotechnology company, which he had headed for two years.
The announcement gave no reason for his sudden departure and said one of the firm's founders, Ingmar Hoerr, would succeed him. It thanked Mr. Menichella for a variety of accomplishments, including "the recent start of our coronavirus vaccine program."
On Sunday, the company issued a statement in Germany describing its vaccine work. "CureVac refrains from commenting on current media speculations and clearly rejects claims about the sale of the company or its technology," it said.
White House officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But two senior American officials said that some of the German news accounts first reporting the story were overblown, particularly with regard to any effort by the United States to secure exclusive access to a vaccine.
The Trump administration has spoken with more than 25 companies that say they can help with a vaccine, one of the American officials said, and is open to speaking with others. Any solution, he said, would be shared with the world.
Nevertheless, Germany's interior minister, Horst Seehofer, said that Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has a famously testy relationship with Mr. Trump, will lead a crisis meeting with ministers on Monday that will include discussion of a German defense strategy for the firm.
The coronavirus is no longer merely a health crisis, but "a question of national security," Mr. Seehofer said Sunday. It is up to the government, he said, to ensure not only security of its borders and its food supply, but also "our medical products and our medicines."
Asked by a reporter to confirm that the U.S. administration had tried to take over a German company researching vaccines, Mr. Seehofer responded that he had heard about the effort "from several members of the government and it will be discussed tomorrow in the crisis team."
Another official, who asked not to be identified because he is not authorized to speak to the media, said the company was offered a "large sum" of money.
The privately held biotechnology firm has its headquarters in the southwestern city of Tübingen, Germany. It also has an office in Boston, where many of the nation's leading biotech firms have operations around the Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology campuses.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt am Sonntag, which first reported the story on Sunday, Mr. Trump offered CureVac roughly $ 1 billion in exchange for exclusive access to the vaccine. The newspaper quoted an unnamed German government source who said Mr. Trump wanted the resulting vaccine "only for the United States."
But another German official, reached by The New York Times, said it was unclear whether the administration simply wanted the research work, and for any resulting production to be on American soil.
Mr. Menichella was one of several industry executives invited by the White House to meet Mr. Pence, members of the coronavirus task force and pharmaceutical executives and discuss strategies to quickly develop a vaccine, the company said on its website.
CureVac started research on a number of different vaccines and is now picking the two best prospects for clinical trials, the firm's website indicates. The company hopes that by June or July it will have an experimental vaccine that could go into trials. Many other companies are also working on vaccines.
The Trump administration has been unusually aggressive in attempting to get American control of companies that deal in technology Mr. Trump views as central to American security.
In February, Attorney General William P. Barr suggested in a speech that the United States should find a way to take over two European telecommunications makers, Ericsson and Nokia, which are the main competitors of Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant that is wiring up nations around the world for 5G, or fifth generation, networks.
Mr. Pence later played down that suggestion. But the idea that the Trump administration was seeking to take control of a major European technological asset sent unsettling ripples across Europe.
And the move to secure the intellectual property of CureVac, whether for exclusive or general use, is bound to inflame that debate.
Die Welt reported that the German government was making counterbids to the company to persuade it to stay. German lawmakers began to issue statements on Sunday.
"The exclusive sale of a possible vaccine to the USA must be prevented by all means," Karl Lauterbach, a German lawmaker who is also a professor of epidemiology, said on Twitter. "Capitalism has limits."
Adding to the dismay in Germany was the fact that CureVac works closely with a taxpayer-funded government research organization, the Paul Ehrlich Institute for vaccines and biomedicines.
Peter Altmaier, Germany's economy minister, praised the company for not being tempted by any American offer. "It was a great decision," he said in a television talk show on Sunday night. "Germany is not for sale."
Mr. Altmaier said the government would "make sure that the necessary help is available" to the company in developing the vaccine. And he warned that if any hostile offer was attempted, Germany would step in.
"When it's about important infrastructure and national and European interest," he said, "we will also act if we have to."
CureVac's main investor ruled out giving exclusive access to a future vaccine to one country.
"We want to develop a vaccine for the whole world, and not for individual states," Christof Hettich, chief executive of Dievini Hopp Biotech Holding, told the newspaper Mannheimer Morgen.
German officials sounded unsure about the reassurances that the United States would share a vaccine if it were developed.
A spokesman for the German health ministry said that German government officials were in regular contact with CureVac, confirming a quote in the original Die Welt article.
"The federal government is very interested in vaccines and antiviral agents against the novel coronavirus being developed in Germany and Europe," the spokesman was quoted as saying in the original article. "In this regard the government is in an intensive exchange with the company CureVac."

Texto completo: A reader says the Never Trumpers need to make sure that Joe Biden is the Democratic nominee. Also: Advice for choosing a running mate; keeping track of children.
To the Editor:
Re "'Never Trump' Biden Republicans," by Sarah Longwell (Op-Ed, March 10):
As a Never Trump Republican, I applaud Ms. Longwell's piece. And I would add that it is not sufficient for us Never Trumpers to sit back and plan to vote for Joe Biden in November. Rather, we need to take action now to assure that Mr. Biden is the Democratic nominee and to build momentum for his successful campaign in the fall.
I am a lifelong Republican who served in the Nixon and Ford administrations, and I am one of the founders of a Bipartisan Committee to Elect Joe Biden. Another founder of our committee is a former chair of the Republican Party in New York State, Sandy Treadwell. The committee originated to support Amy Klobuchar's candidacy, but when Senator Klobuchar withdrew and endorsed Mr. Biden, we were happy to follow her lead.
The focus of our committee has been our local community, Ojai, Calif. We hope that Never Trump Republicans, independents and Democrats in other cities and towns will follow our example and create their own bipartisan efforts. It could make a crucial difference.

Choosing a Running Mate
To the Editor:
Re "Momentum Builds for Woman on Democratic Ticket" (news article, March 9):
The Democratic nominee for president needs to consider two critical issues before making a selection for the vice-presidential slot:
1) Prior national exposure in a campaign -- see Thomas Eagleton, Geraldine Ferraro, Dan Quayle and Sarah Palin -- to assess the impact of candidates who have not been vetted on a national scale. The first rule needs to be, "No rookies allowed, no matter how good their C.V.s are."
2) Selecting a sitting senator from a state with a Republican governor would make it almost impossible for the Democrats to gain control of the Senate.
There are highly qualified women who fall outside these two constraints and who would make for a winning ticket, and an excellent president, should the need arise.

Location Trackers for Children?
To the Editor:
In "The Rise of Location Trackers for Kids" (Sunday Review, March 8), Jessica Grose argues that location trackers cost children "breathless, joyful freedom." She longs for the days of her youth when she and a pack of friends were trusted to walk the mile from school, with detours for play.
I, too, was allowed to wander far and wide when I was in grade school. But attitudes have changed, and many parents have become very cautious, and some laws codify this caution. That is why there is a growing "free range" kids movement that gives children independence, with limited supervision.
So the trade-off is not whether to track children or not. The choice is whether children are let out of the house or not.

Texto completo: Wash your hands, wash your hands, wash your hands. That splash-under-water flick won't cut it anymore.
A refresher: Wet your hands and scrub with soap, taking care to get between your fingers and under your nails. Wash for at least 20 seconds (or about the time it takes to sing "Happy Birthday" twice), and dry. The C.D.C. also recommends you avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands (tough one, we know).
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers, which should be rubbed in for about 20 seconds, can also work, but the gel must contain at least 60 percent alcohol. (No, Tito's Handmade Vodka doesn't work.)
Also, clean "high-touch" surfaces, like phones, tablets and handles. Apple recommends using 70 percent isopropyl alcohol, wiping gently. "Don't use bleach," the company said.
To disinfect any surface, the C.D.C. recommends wearing disposable gloves and washing hands thoroughly immediately after removing the gloves. Most household disinfectants registered by the Environmental Protection Agency will work.
Try to stand away from other people, especially if they seem sick. Wave, bow or give an elbow bump, rather than shake hands. Maybe skip the kiss on the first date. Amelia Nierenberg

One blogger recognized no news was bad news

Texto completo: The news seemed so intriguing - and so potentially alarming - that Sharon Sanders stayed up almost until dawn on Dec. 31 to keep track of it.
From her home in Winter Haven, Fla., Sanders began compiling reports of public comments by health officials in China's Hubei province. The officials, Sanders reported on her blog, FluTrackers, had announced an outbreak of an unusual cluster of pneumonia cases, caused by a mysterious virus.
The disease apparently had spread among merchants in a seafood market in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people. "A number of people from hospitals in Wuhan said that the current cause is not clear," read one of FluTrackers' first, uncertain posts about the outbreak.
Although few Americans saw the reports and even fewer reacted with urgency, Sanders's blog began to track, in minute detail, what would soon explode into a pandemic. As eventually became clear, the illnesses chronicled by the blog were the first caused by a new strain of coronavirus.

Only a few mainstream news outlets, mostly in Asia, had picked up the story, echoed in brief reports that first went out on wire services such as Associated Press and Reuters on Dec. 31. Major American news outlets, however, were slower to grasp what Sanders watched unfold in those early morning hours.
The New York Times on Jan. 6 took note of a "pneumonia-like illness" that had sickened 59 people in Wuhan; two days later, The Washington Post , the Times and AP published staff stories about the outbreak after Chinese researchers determined that the illnesses in Wuhan - later dubbed covid-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO) - were the result of a previously unknown coronavirus. Even so, the story wasn't big news. That first Times story was published on page 13 of its print edition; The Post put its first story on A14.

The story didn't fully enter mainstream discussion in the United States until later in the month. Fox News anchor Neil Cavuto, for example, brought it up in an interview with an emergency-room physician on Jan. 20, noting the potential for rapid transmission. "So, I'm beginning to wonder now whether the genie is out of the bottle here," he said.
The slow-building reaction suggests the Western media underplayed what was unfolding, certainly in the first weeks after the Chinese disclosed it. Even after SARS, swine flu and other outbreaks of recent vintage, a small but novel infection halfway around the world might not have seemed like a very compelling story, especially when other stories - including the impeachment trial of the president - were at the top of the agenda.
When news outlets finally devoted more attention to the story in late January and early February, President Trump and his allies responded by criticizing the coverage as hype, branding it a Democratic conspiracy to undermine Trump's reelection chances.
To be sure, much of the early reporting about the virus was tentative and sometimes inaccurate, as is often the case with breaking news events. The authorities involved often don't have a full understanding yet of what's unfolding, leaving the journalists who are reporting on them equally in the dark.
But the first reports and commentary about the outbreak were further complicated by questions about the credibility and candor of Chinese officials - the same questions that arose with the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China in 2003. During that contagion, WHO accused Chinese officials of covering up the number of cases.
The reports flagged by FluTracker, in fact, were based on government statements about patients who had already been sick for weeks. Efforts to sound the alarm earlier were suppressed; eight doctors in Wuhan who raised concerns before the official announcement on Dec. 31 were detained by police. One of the whistleblowers, Li Wenliang, became a national hero in China before he died of the virus.
Sanders, however, recognized quickly that there was something unique about this outbreak - in part because it seemed highly unusual for Chinese officials to even be acknowledging a health crisis in the first place.
"Local officials and media in China need government approval before they can disclose negative information," she said in an interview. "Any type of disease outbreak is considered negative [news] and may impact social order."
When Chinese officials admit to a problem, she said, they tend to undersell it - a red flag that there's far more to the story. This is what prompted her to stay up late on the night of Dec. 31. But Sanders said she had no idea where the story of the pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan would lead.
Her blog's contributors - who include some medical professionals, though many are merely "self-trained" disease-detection enthusiasts - routinely submit links to local news reports, medical journals and other data from around the world, with an eye toward unusual patterns. One of the tipoffs to the seriousness of the Wuhan situation was the absence of data: After the initial disclosures from officials on Dec. 31, the statements stopped.
"China always reports their good news," she said. "When you don't hear anything for five days, it warrants more investigation. . . . We knew something was unusual, because we follow China and look for trends."
The details pointed to a far more serious situation than Chinese officials had described. Sanders and her contributors soon started picking up "things we had never seen before" from a hodgepodge of sources, including doctors in Hong Kong, local media accounts and ordinary people in Wuhan. The bits and pieces were shocking: hospital wards with health-care workers dressed in full patient-protective suits, teams disinfecting entire streets, body bags stacked in vehicles outside hospitals.

It quickly became clear that the problem wasn't isolated or contained. "It appeared to be an infectious and dangerous agent, [an] ominous sign for the world," she said.
Sanders, herself a self-trained disease-tracker after working in finance and real estate, co-founded the site in 2006 as a hobby - or, as she describes it, "a fun way to meet interesting and intelligent people online."
Her timing was pretty sharp: Soon after the blog launched, a series of global disease shocks began to break, from the avian flu in 2006, the H1N1/swine flu pandemic in 2009, and the H7N9 bird flu outbreak in China in 2013. The blog aggregated research papers, local reports and obscure documents translated by contributors from multiple languages.
Soon, officials from WHO, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, the National Institutes of Health and international agencies were logging on, sometimes several times a day.
Sanders doesn't take advertising or sell anything on her site. She funds the whole enterprise out of her pocket; her overhead is just a few thousand dollars a year for server time. The rest, she says, is "a labor of love."
These days, more than a few people seem interested. Since the outbreak in Wuhan, Sanders says, FluTrackers has attracted nearly 353,000 unique visitors who have clicked on the site 15.5 million times, far more than the 11.6 million recorded during all of 2019.

Texto completo: Donald Trump made one of the biggest mistakes of his presidency in the spring of 2017, when he offered an unconditional embrace to the then-emerging 31-year-old ruler of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, and adopted his agenda of aggressively confronting Iran. Three years later, as Trump grapples with the greatest crisis he has faced, that choice is costing him dearly.
Trump's slow and stumbling response to the novel coronavirus pandemic helped accelerate last week's stock market dive and mounting public uncertainty. But the trouble in the markets was also turbocharged by the latest reckless moves by the Saudi crown prince. Against the advice of his own ministers, Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS, moved to flood markets with cheap Saudi oil, causing the global price to plunge and endangering the U.S. oil industry.
That, no doubt, prompted the phone call Trump made to MBS last Monday, as stocks were plunging. It's an easy guess that the president's message resembled the public statement of his Energy Department, which decried "attempts by state actors to manipulate and shock oil markets."
Yet MBS's reaction was to thumb his nose at the U.S. president. On Wednesday, his oil minister announced another big increase in petroleum production. U.S. stocks swooned again.
Then came the rocket attack by an Iranian-backed militia on a base in Iraq, which killed two U.S. servicemen. That set off a tit-for-tat cycle of U.S. airstrikes and new rocket attacks that has brought Trump back to the brink of war with Iran - a resumption, at the worst possible moment, of an entirely unnecessary conflict that he embarked upon at the behest of MBS and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Since making Riyadh the site of his first foreign trip as president, Trump has stubbornly defended the Saudi ruler through multiple misadventures, from the disastrous war in Yemen and failed boycott of neighboring Qatar to the murder of U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The big Saudi purchases of U.S. weapons that MBS promised Trump have not materialized. Instead, the president's reward is to be stiffed by his supposed ally at his moment of greatest need, with U.S. markets whipsawing and U.S. soldiers dying.
The Saudis claim that MBS is not intentionally seeking to sabotage Trump. The crown prince's real quarrel, they say, is with Russia's Vladimir Putin, who refused to go along with a Saudi proposal to cut oil production to stabilize prices, thus prompting MBS to rashly pump more while cutting prices.
Yet, in doing so, the crown prince is merely abetting a prime Putin aim, which is to drive the fragile U.S. fracking industry out of business. Not surprisingly, the Russians reacted calmly to MBS's dumping gambit, saying they could live with rock-bottom oil prices for six to 10 years. U.S. frackers can't - nor, for that matter, can MBS, who has already strained the kingdom's finances to the breaking point.
One of the most consistent themes of Trumpian rhetoric has been the ways in which U.S. allies have supposedly exploited Washington's weakness to pursue their own interests at America's expense. In one of his first ventures into foreign policy, Trump bought an ad in the New York Times in 1987 to make that case against, among others, Saudi Arabia, "a country whose very existence is in the hands of the United States." He wrote: "The world is laughing at America's politicians as we protect ships we don't own, carrying oil we don't need, destined for allies who won't help."
Saudi Arabia still depends on the United States for its survival. U.S. warships are still protecting tankers carrying Saudi oil in the Persian Gulf, even though the United States needs imported petroleum far less than it did in 1987. What's more, Trump has dispatched thousands of U.S. troops to the kingdom to defend oil fields from Iranian attack, escalating tensions that have now led to multiple U.S. deaths and injuries.
And yet, Trump has been curiously passive as MBS has repeatedly worked against U.S. interests. Consider the case of Saud al-Qahtani, the close aide to the crown prince who is believed to have overseen the murder of Khashoggi and a hacking campaign targeting MBS's foreign critics. Senior U.S. officials have repeatedly pushed MBS to hold Qahtani accountable, or at least sideline him; yet as Ben Hubbard of the New York Times reports, "he is still commanding armies of bots and overseeing the kingdom's electronic spying operations."
Or consider Trump, with his reelection prospects in danger of crumbling along with the U.S. economy, asking the crown prince to act in his own, as well as the U.S., interest and stop pushing down oil prices amid a market panic - and then remaining silent as a dictator he has coddled for three years does the opposite. Surely, Vladimir Putin is laughing.

Newsroom pushed to the brink in Cleveland

Texto completo: News organizations everywhere are under immense pressure as a pandemic sweeps the globe.
Reporters scurry to cover an eruption of breaking news: deaths, illness, fear, cancellations and Oval Office pronouncements that may or may not be true. Editors, meanwhile, are trying not only to get the news out but to keep their staffs safe - sometimes by instructing them to work remotely.
But if there were a competition for the American newsroom enduring the most hellish month, the Plain Dealer in Cleveland would be among the finalists.
Consider: Tim Warsinskey started his new job as the paper's top editor on March 1. Eight days later, he announced deep staff reductions at the news organization where the former reporter and union vice chairman has worked for the past 30 years.
The paper, he said, would cut 22 newsroom employees, which by some accounts meant that its reporting ranks might drop to as few as 14.
Even at a time when local newspapers are in free fall, this is shocking. After all, the Plain Dealer as recently as the late 1990s boasted a robust, prizewinning staff of more than 300 reporters, editors, photographers, designers and other newsroom personnel.
The staff news was profoundly upsetting, especially because some see it as a union-busting maneuver by the ownership, Advance Publications, which also owns a more abundantly staffed sister publication: the nonunion Cleveland.com. The Plain Dealer prints a newspaper daily but since 2013 has delivered to homes only four days a week; the print paper often contains reporting from Cleveland.com, the sister news site whose reporters have also been covering the virus story aggressively and well.
But few had time to think deeply about the staff cuts, said Warsinskey, who declined to give specifics on staff numbers or corporate strategy, though he did blame the changes on the undeniable demise of the paper's business model.
"We're doing what journalists always do in a crisis - putting blinders on to everything else and just doing the work," Warsinskey said. And he said he was proud of what his small staff has produced: a steady stream of stories keeping readers informed about each new development and how the virus is affecting the community.
Reporters are working, in some cases, "from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m." and getting up to do it again, he said. (The most thorough and expert local coverage I saw was written by Plain Dealer health reporter Ginger Christ - who also happens to be the union's current chairwoman.)
As of Saturday afternoon, the state had 36 confirmed cases of the coronavirus - several in Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland.
The world-famous Cleveland Clinic was making national news by putting itself in the forefront of testing, with plans to test 1,000 people a day. And one Ohio health official estimated that there could be as many as 100,000 in the state already infected with the disease.
Local stories don't get much bigger or more significant than that.
There was an unending rush of political news, too. The Cleveland rallies by candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders were canceled last week. And the Democratic presidential primary is scheduled for Tuesday - all this in a swing state that purged hundreds of thousands of voters from its rolls in 2019, prompting charges of voter suppression.
In other words, there's more than enough work for even a large regional newspaper to do. But, as in so many American cities, that no longer exists in Cleveland - though the staffs of the two news organizations do plenty of admirable work.
Josh Crutchmer, who was an assistant managing editor at the Plain Dealer from 2014 to 2017, called it gut-wrenching.
"It's so depressing to think about the Plain Dealer right now," said Crutchmer, now the New York Times's print planning editor. "I know it's tough everywhere, but what they're doing to that newsroom is bad even by 2020 standards."
That's especially true, he said, because in better days, the paper put emphasis on its enterprising health coverage. But such specialties are hard to maintain when the ranks become so thin.
It's no consolation to know this journalistic carnage is happening in many American cities.
The Vindicator in Youngstown, Ohio - just 60 miles from Cleveland - abruptly went out of business last summer. And across the country, more than 2,000 local papers, mostly weeklies, have folded since 2004.
And while, thankfully, some of the slack is being taken up by nonprofit newsrooms, by public radio and by local television stations, it's simply not enough.
We didn't need a pandemic to tell us that, but it makes the reality that much more clear.

Texto completo: In hindsight, Joyce Gordon's calling card was there all along, waiting for her to see it. But hindsight is 20/20, unlike her vision, which was decidedly farsighted.
When Ms. Gordon embarked on a career as a commercial pitchwoman in the 1950s, women simply did not wear glasses on television. Instead of reading from a prompter, Ms. Gordon memorized her lines. One day during a rehearsal, an ad agency representative suggested that she put on her spectacles. If the sponsor objected, he promised to smooth things over.
Ms. Gordon agreed. She became one of the first women to wear glasses while appearing as herself on TV, upending prevailing notions of feminine beauty and, to judge from her voluminous fan mail, giving other American women the confidence to wear their glasses as they would earrings or any other bauble - in style.
"I know I'm not a glamour girl - most women aren't," she told an interviewer in 1961. "But I'm not underrating myself. I'm an attractive, up-to-date young woman - glasses and all."
Glasses and all, Ms. Gordon, who died Feb. 28 in New York City at 90, enjoyed a successful career as a pitchwoman. She appeared on television programs including "The Jack Paar Show" and "The Price Is Right," becoming known by the early 1960s as "the girl with the glasses" - a moniker that became obsolete as women as well as men increasingly accepted that bespectacled could be beautiful.
Her claims to fame did not end there, however. Ms. Gordon, who also did extensive voice-over work, may well have had one of the most familiar voices in the United States: For years, anyone who mis-dialed a telephone was greeted by a recording made by Ms. Gordon, informing them that they had called the wrong number.
Joyce Gordon was born in Des Moines on March 25, 1929. Her father founded the National Barber and Beauty Manufacturers Association.
She grew up in Chicago and moved to New York at 18 or 19 with the hope of becoming an actress, appearing on radio and television shows including "Studio One," "Robert Montgomery Presents" and "Search for Tomorrow," according to SAG-AFTRA, the screen actors' union.
By her mid-20s, Ms. Gordon was working full-time in commercials for brands such as Crisco and Duncan Hines. The career move did not displease her. Unlike acting, commercials allowed her to "be myself and talk to people as I really am," she wrote in an essay published in TV Week in 1960.
After her ophthalmological coming out, commercial sponsors realized that Ms. Gordon's glasses made her a believable, memorable representative for their products. As she put it, glasses gave her "identity and authority."
Once, Hugh Downs invited Ms. Gordon to appear alongside Hungarian-born actress Eva Gabor in a panel discussion on NBC's "The Tonight Show," where Downs was Paar's sidekick.
"To my knowledge this was the first time a commercial spokeswoman had ever been invited to participate as a guest on the show," Ms. Gordon wrote in TV Week. "Eva told me how nice my glasses looked, and Hugh echoed the fact that I was the only commercial spokeswoman on network television to wear them."
According to SAG-AFTRA, Ms. Gordon was the first woman to do network promos and to serve as an announcer for a political convention on national TV. She was active in the union and, in 1966, became the first woman to lead one of its chapters when she was elected president of the New York branch.
"Her stature as a pitchwoman and voiceover talent was indispensable in convincing the advertising industry to take seriously the concerns of commercial performers in the early days of that contract," SAG-AFTRA President Gabrielle Carteris said in a statement.
Ms. Gordon's husband of more than 50 years, Bernard Grant, a star of soap operas including "Guiding Light," died in 2004. Survivors include two children, Melissa Grant of Los Angeles and Mark Grant of New York; a sister; and a grandson. Melissa Grant confirmed her mother's death but did not cite a specific cause.
Ms. Gordon also had a successful run as a dubbing artist, serving as the English-language voice of actresses including Jeanne Moreau and Annie Girardot.
If her work as a bespectacled pitchwoman allowed Ms. Gordon to be herself, dubbing was in many ways the opposite. "You have to try to crawl into the other actor's body, to understand how a shrug, a raised eyebrow, a way of breathing can affect the performance," she told the New York Times in 1982.
Such was her skill that when she dubbed the Tunisian-born Italian actress Claudia Cardinale in director Sergio Leone's "Once Upon a Time in the West" (1968), a reviewer praised Cardinale's stellar English.
Later in her career, Ms. Gordon appeared in the NBC procedural "Law and Order" as a trial judge. But she remained best known as a pitchwoman.
In her heyday, she had as many as eight pairs of glasses and selected each day the set that best matched her attire.
"Day by day, she is erasing, in at least a small segment of the American mind, the image of the spinsterish, unattractive female usually associated with glasses," a reporter wrote in 1961. "At least half of her fan mail mentions her glasses, and many women make it clear that she gave them the necessary shot-in-the-arm in the struggle between vanity and the desire to see clearly."

Finding ways to respond to an onslaught of uncertainties

The Ides of March was the Roman deadline for settling debts. On this March 15, a lot of unsettling stuff is swirling around the country. One political party is marching in lockstep to the beat of an authoritarian drum, while the other is seemingly intent on tearing itself asunder. The global economy is flashing code-red alerts in which a nose-diving Dow Jones industrial average is only one disconcerting sign among many. Then, oh yeah, there's the constant tintinnabulation of the warning bells signaling that a pandemic is racing uncontrollably around the planet. Has the Big Get Even finally come to collect mankind's long-accumulated debts?
I am spooked. And figuring out how to respond to the onslaught of uncertainties isn't easy. I can't just hole up in my bedroom and binge on Netflix. So I'm searching, trying to scramble my way to a mind-set in which I can stare down what's coming, and nevertheless get on with things.
The Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard offers some advice. In his writings, he argues that there are three ways - stages of development, actually - that illustrate how people deal with whatever life hurls at them. The least evolved individuals are those who simply give up, surrendering to life's daunting challenges. At the highest level is the "knight of faith." On this elevated plane, even if you have every reason to believe that doom threatens, you can still believe that things are somehow, some way, going to work out just fine. It's one part absurdist, Joan Didion-like magical thinking, to another part steadfast belief in a benevolent divine will. It's recognizing, as a steely Didion does, that sometimes "life changes fast. Life changes in an instant" for the worse, yet still finding reason to hope.
But it's the third Kierkegaard option that does the trick for me. Maybe my Bronx roots have left me too combative to run from a fight, and I've grown too old (and watch cable news too often) to believe in happy endings.
It's this interim stage, the one nestled between his two extremes, that I'm trying to settle into as I attempt to navigate through these dicey times. I'm doing my best to try to emulate Kierkegaard's "knight of infinite resignation." That is, I see what's lurking out there, all right, but I'm trying, with mixed success, to whistle my way insouciantly through the potential apocalypse.
That attitude has me turning to poems I haven't thought about for years. I'm looking for guidance and solace in books I hadn't taken off the shelf in ages, some with underlining and notations made a lifetime ago in college. Consider:
There's a chilling beauty of a poem by W.H. Auden, stark lines conceived in 1940 as Europe was plunging into the terrible mystery of war. " Time will say nothing but I told you so . / Time only knows the price we have to pay ," he flatly contends, full of a hard-edged bravery, in "If I Could Tell You." Whatever is in store for us, well, it's coming and so we might as well not try to put the unseen pieces of the puzzle together; just deal with it when it arrives.
A similarly stoic resolve was more bitterly expressed by Robert Frost in 1920 as he considered mankind's fate after World War I. " Some say the world will end in fire, / Some say in ice ," he begins. But ultimately the weary, reconciled poet decides that it's really pretty much a toss-up, since either fire or ice will quite effectively get the job done.
Still, Nikki Giovanni managed to find comfort - love, in fact! - in a decidedly more upbeat, less menacing surrender. In "Resignation," she accepts the inescapable logic of things beyond her control " because the Earth turns round the sun / because the North wind blows north ."
And then there's the reliably gloomy Philip Larkin, reminding us in "Aubade" that " Most things may never happen: this one will ." It's the singular flaw we all share - there's nothing anyone can do to escape when our time comes.
These are the words, frank and uncompromising though they may be, that are nonetheless helping me to get by. I've deleted Bob Dylan's end times "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" from my playlist, but now I find myself listening to his "A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall" with a new sense of recognition. I'm heading into the spring wearing the solid armor of a knight of infinite resignation, but I'm also spending a lot of time washing my hands.

Texto completo: As of 4:30 p.m. Sunday, March 15, seven Maine residents have been confirmed positive and five others are presumed positive for the coronavirus, according to the state.
Here's a roundup of today's COVID-19 news in Maine and New England, as of 8:50 p.m. To read all of our coverage, click here.
-- Janet Mills declared a civil state emergency on Sunday. Read the full declaration here.
-- Mills' emergency order allows the governor to assume more power over the outbreak, including suspending the enforcement of laws, establishing emergency reserves of certain products and entering into mutual aid agreements with other states or countries.
-- Mills recommended stopping classroom instruction in Maine -- though many have announced they will close this week -- and halting gatherings of more than 50 people or 10 people if seniors are involved.
-- "Things are likely to get worse before they get better, but they will get better and together, we will get through this," Mills said.
-- Seven positive tests for coronavirus have been confirmed by federal health officials and another five people are likely to have it, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
-- Four of Maine's latest so-called presumptive positive cases appeared in Cumberland County and one in Lincoln County.
-- The virus is likely being transmitted to and by people who have not traveled internationally, which is known as " community spread," said Nirav Shah, the director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
-- Right now, that's happening in Cumberland County but he expected it to continue into other parts of Maine.
-- The first presumptive positive case in the state for someone under 18 is a male residing in Cumberland County who is now isolated at home. According to a letter to parents from the Cape Elizabeth School District Superintendent Donna H. Wolfrom on Sunday evening, the boy is a student at Cape Elizabeth Middle School.
-- A male in his 80s who tested positive is a resident at Oceanview in Falmouth, a senior living community. His spouse also tested positive.
-- A Cumberland County woman in her 70s is isolated at home.
-- A Lincoln County health care worker in her 30s is isolated at home.
-- The fifth presumptive positive person is a male in his 40s.
-- One case identified Friday as a preliminary presumptive positive has been reclassified as negative.
-- Here's what else we know about the Mainers who have tested positive for coronavirus.
-- Janet Mills announced she would submit an emergency bill to extend unemployment benefits to people affected by the new coronavirus.
-- Coronavirus could also affect campaigns and voter registration in Maine since traditional forms of traditional campaign activities such as town halls, door-to-door canvassing and high-dollar fundraisers are in conflict with social distancing guidelines.
-- Despite being in direct contact with people who later tested positive for coronavirus, President Donald Trump tested negative for the new coronavirus, according to the president's personal physician.
-- Weary travelers returning to the U.S. amid coronavirus-related travel restrictions were greeted by long lines and hourslong waits for required medical screenings at airports.
-- More schools are suspending in-person classes. The first Aroostook County schools announced closures on Sunday.

-- Internet, wireless, cable, water and other companies say they are suspending shutoffs for nonpayment during the coronavirus outbreak, with some adding extra services to help Mainers get by.
-- Here's how to make your food last longer during the coronavirus.
-- As ski resorts across the United States grappled with how to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, industry giants Vail Resorts and Alterra Mountain Company decided to close 34 ski resorts, including Attitash and Wildcat in New Hampshire. Sunday River, Sugarloaf Mountain, Hermon Mountain and Shawnee Peak ski areas also announced they would be suspending operations.
-- Maine celebrated its 200th birthday -- without a birthday party.

Texto completo: New York Times columnist David Brooks said President Trump is bungling the federal government's response to the coronavirus pandemic.
While comparing the situation to the government's response to Hurricane Katrina, which was widely criticized, Brooks called Trump a "sociopath."
"I feel a deep sense of anger that our government has responded so badly," he said on PBS News Hour. "Frankly, this is what happens when you elect a sociopath as president, who doesn't care, who's treated this whole thing for the past month as if it's about him."
Brooks said Trump has not "done the normal things that a normal human being would do" and recommended the president focus more on listening to his advisers instead of worrying about the stock market.
"He's even created an information distortion field around him," Brooks said, later adding, "We've got a dysfunctional process at the heart of the administration at a time of great national crisis."

Fauci says 'it's possible' hundreds of thousands or millions of US citizens could die from coronavirus

Texto completo: America’s top infectious disease expert said “it’s possible” that thousands or even millions of U.S. citizens could die during the coronavirus outbreak.
Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, appeared on CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday and was asked if estimates that millions of people dying from illnesses related to the COVID-19 virus pandemic were realistic.
“It’s possible,” Fauci responded, “because when you do a model, you have a worst-case scenario, the best-case scenario, and the reality is how you react to that will depend where you’re going to be on that curve. So obviously, we are clearly gonna have more infections.
“There’s going to be more problems with regard to morbidity and mortality,” he added.
Fauci has earned bipartisan praise and has taken a leading role in President Trump’s response to the outbreak. The doctor said the main goal right now is to stop a rapid increase in cases that could overwhelm the healthcare system.
“I’ve said many times if you just leave it alone and let the virus to its own devices, it'll go way up and come down naturally over a period of several weeks," Fauci said, later adding, “Our challenge right now is to do two things, is to prevent the new influx of cases, hence the travel restrictions, and for what we’re dealing with right now, is to know that we’re gonna get more infections but blunt it so that we don’t have that sharp peak, that we have more of a smaller hump.”
On Friday, Trump, with Fauci standing by his side, declared the pandemic a national emergency. He also placed travel restrictions on much of Europe earlier in the week and added the United Kingdom and Ireland to the list on Saturday, after placing restrictions on China in January and Iran in February.
As of Sunday morning, at least 2,759 people have tested positive for the COVID-19 virus, and 59 people have died from the pandemic in the United States, according to the New York Times. Worldwide, there are 155,000 cases and almost 6,000 deaths.

Biden vs. Sanders could be the final debate of 2020

Texto completo: Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders will clash in a head-to-head matchup for the first time this weekend, but the debate could be the last of the 2020 Democratic primary election cycle.
Biden and Sanders met for the Democratic primary's 11th debate on Sunday in Washington, D.C., an event moved from Phoenix to a CNN studio without a live audience over coronavirus concerns.
The debate was temporarily in doubt as results from last week's round of voting rolled in, and the conjecture will likely arise again after the March 17 series, when Biden is expected to win big in Arizona, Florida, Illinois, and Ohio.
Assuming Biden is the Democratic nominee, he's set to face off against President Trump in three general election debates this fall. Vice President Mike Pence is also scheduled to debate his Democratic rival, once selected by the party's nominee.
Presidential debates have been held every four years, beginning in 1976. But there's no law saying presidential candidates have to debate, and Trump has cast doubt on whether he would participate.
Heading into the general election, Trump has already voiced concerns with the Presidential Debates Commission, describing the nonprofit bipartisan body that has organized the forums since 1988 as being "stacked with Trump Haters & Never Trumpers." His attack last December was in response to a New York Times report suggesting the White House incumbent would skip the events. The president denied the article.
“As President, the debates are up to me, and there are many options, including doing them directly & avoiding the nasty politics of this very biased Commission,” Trump tweeted, adding he would “make a decision at an appropriate time.”
American Politics Research's Costas Panagopoulos said it was "doubtful" Sunday's debate would be the final one of the year.
"Trump may not want to debate the Democratic nominee, but there will be considerable pressure to do so. It's risky for Trump, as it is for other candidates, if his performance is lackluster, but so is the perception of being too cowardly to debate. Both can hurt," he told the Washington Examiner.
But Panagopoulos pointed to historical precedents of candidates boycotting the forums, including Richard Nixon, who refused to take part in 1968 and 1972 after his dismal performance against John F. Kennedy in 1960. And even in 1980, it was an open question into late into the general election whether Democratic President Jimmy Carter would face off against Republican nominee Ronald Reagan. The pair debated once, a week before Election Day, an event that turned the tide decisively in favor of Reagan, who won in a landslide.
"Debates don't typically shift preferences by much, but they can be consequential in very close races, which 2020 is likely to be," Panagopoulos added.
Sanders, the Vermont senator, underperformed in all but one of the six states where Democrats on March 10 weighed in on their party's contest, narrowing his path to securing the nomination. But he decided to carry on so he could debate Biden in a one-on-one setting.
Plans for the 12th debate, which has been scheduled for April since December 2018, are still in the works, according to the Democratic National Committee, which has been convening the nationally televised affairs.
Yet between now and April, Sanders's road to the White House becomes trickier, with Democrats in Arizona, Florida, Ohio, and Illinois going to the polls on March 17. Sanders lost all four states in 2016 to then-Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, and public opinion surveys suggest history will repeat itself next week when they decide how to allocate their combined 577 pledged delegates.
The commission has already announced that the University of Notre Dame, the University of Michigan, and Belmont University will hold the general election debates between Sept. 29 and Oct. 22.
Trump missed a January 2016 primary debate hosted by Fox News over complaints regarding then-network personality Megyn Kelly. He's also still upset with the commission concerning its handling of the first presidential debate against Clinton that September because of a defective microphone.

Texto completo: President Trump told GOP donors last weekend he does not mind critical media coverage of his administration's coronavirus response as long as he wins reelection in November.
“We’ve done good,” Trump said at a fundraiser at this Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, a guest relayed to the Washington Post. “But no matter what we do, it will never be good for the press. Because they’re using this to try and win an election.”
He added, “They’re trying to scare everybody, from meetings, cancel the meetings, close the schools — you know, destroy the country. And that’s okay, as long as we can win the election. But I really believe that if they see that the Trump administration is handling this virus in a professional, competent way, I don’t believe that’s going to hurt us.”
Trump attended several fundraisers last weekend and introduced Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro to some of the donors.
The president began facing questions about taking a test for the coronavirus after it was revealed that an aide to Bolsonaro, with whom Trump came into close contact, later tested positive for the COVID-19 virus. Reports on Friday said Bolsonaro tested positive for the virus, but the Brazilian president, along with his son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, denied the "fake news" reports and said he tested negative.
A Saturday memo from Sean Conley, the physician to the president, said Trump tested negative for the coronavirus.
Nearly 155,000 people have tested positive for the virus around the world, killing at least 5,700 people, according to the New York Times. In the United States, there are more than 2,750 confirmed cases of the virus, which has killed at least 59 people.

Texto completo: CNN media pundit Brian Stelter rebuked Surgeon General Jerome Adams after he called for a de-escalation in political rhetoric surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and criticized the way the media have portrayed the outbreak.
"What Adams called 'bickering' and 'criticism' is what most of us call accountability," Stelter wrote in his weekend newsletter. "I hear him saying 'stop exposing the Trump administration’s failures.' There is value in all of the coverage. And government officials don’t get to decide that — readers and reporters and whistleblowers and editors do."
Adams condemned the media on Saturday for their negative coverage of the Trump administration's response to the outbreak.
"We really need you all to lean into and prioritize the health and safety of the American people," Adams told reporters. "No more bickering. No more partisanship. No more criticism or finger-pointing."
At least 3,400 people in America have tested positive for the virus as of Sunday evening, and 62 people have died, according to the New York Times.
Trump declared a national emergency as a result of the pandemic on Friday.

Texto completo: A top official in former President Barack Obama's administration attacked President Trump after he blamed hang-ups in the rollout of coronavirus testing kits on his predecessor.
"I think, importantly, what Obama did leave Trump is a global health infrastructure that we had set up informed by the lessons of the Ebola outbreak,” former White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said during an interview on MSNBC. "And what we did is set up, in the White House ... an office that was responsible for managing pandemics, managing global health threats that was shut down two years ago by President Trump."
During a news conference Friday, Trump said he does not take responsibility for the lag in available testing kits across the country because "we were given a different set of rules, regulations ... from a different time."
Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, called it a "failing" of the federal government that more testing kits were not made available in the wake of the COVID-19 virus outbreak.
At least 2,800 people in America have tested positive for the virus as of Sunday morning, and 59 people have died, according to the New York Times.

Texto completo: The nation's largest school system will begin to shut down this week in response to the coronavirus.
Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Sunday that public schools would shut down in New York City in an aggressive effort to stem the spread of COVID-19 cases. He had been pressured to close schools for days as cases of the coronavirus in the city grew.
“I’m very, very concerned that we see a rapid spread of this disease, and it’s time to take more dramatic measures,” de Blasio said Sunday. “This is a decision I have taken with no joy and a lot of pain.”

De Blasio faced widespread criticism from local officials and teachers planning a "mass sickout" for refusing to close schools in the Big Apple.
New York City’s school system is the country’s largest, with 1.1 million students. The move comes after other states have shuttered all K-12 schools. De Blasio said that the schools would be closed for students on Monday and that teachers would be trained later this week on how to continue to teach students remotely.
“These children need you,” the mayor said, directing his remarks to teachers. “Keep their education going.”
De Blasio said the goal is to reopen schools by April 20, although he said there is a chance that schools won't reopen at all before the end of the school year. He said teachers will be asked to come in to work this week to receive training on how to provide remote learning.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo also said Sunday that schools on Long Island and in Westchester County would also be shut down.
“I believe that the New York City schools should be closed, period,” Cuomo told the New York Times. “We also need an immediate plan to provide child care for essential workers and for food programs for the children.”
The Federal Reserve lowered its interest rate target to zero on Sunday in an emergency move to safeguard the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Sunday that “it’s possible” that thousands or even millions of U.S. citizens could die during the outbreak, which has killed at least 62 people and infected more than 3,200. De Blasio said Sunday that five people in New York City have died from the coronavirus.
