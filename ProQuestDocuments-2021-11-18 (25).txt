Texto completo: It’s easy to find an obvious motive for President Trump’s well-documented and much-ballyhooed “war” on California. After all, this state in 2016 gave Hillary Clinton a margin of more than 3 million votes over Trump and he’s felt hurt and angry over it ever since.
He’s taken action after action against this state’s best interests, one example his September attempt to eliminate California’s unique authority the early-1970s Clean Air Act to regulate its own air quality. Even though Trump and his handpicked chief of the federal Environmental Protection Agency moved the other day to revoke that ability, most legal authorities say he can’t actually do it because California’s right to fix its air was granted by Congress, not the President of that time, Republican Richard Nixon.
Presidents have a lot of executive authority, those legal experts say, but they cannot unilaterally reverse acts of Congress.
Showing its whimsical nature, Trump’s administration shortly after announced it would withhold highway funds from dozens of California areas because they don’t meet federal clean air standards – even though some of the affected areas do in fact meet those standards. So Trump wants to penalize California for having dirty air at the same time he seeks to take away its ability to clean up that same air. Go figure, or as Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein deadpanned, the combined moves “seem counterintuitive.”
Trump also threatens to withhold federal grants from police in California’s many “sanctuary cities.” He warned he would cut federal wildfire aid and penalize San Francisco because its homeless population allegedly dumps human waste and hypodermic needles into the Pacific Ocean and San Francisco Bay. Except they don’t do that.
Time after time, Trump trumpets actions against California, with the state’s attorney general, Xavier Becerra, reacting with lawsuits like a Pavlovian laboratory dog.
But does Trump really mean all this seriously, when he’s had so little success at it? Or is another agenda at work here?
This question arises because the pre-presidency Trump was in effect a carnival barker, always aware of the legendary circus impresario P.T. Barnum’s observation that “There’s a sucker born every minute.” Trump the showman understood while running his reality television show that, as a New York Times television critic observed, “the only rule is that there are no rules.”
He carried this sense over into his presidency, where a day rarely goes by without some crisis, be it a threat to bomb Iran or one to punish California. Trump also knows that California-bashing is a longtime, popular national pastime everywhere outside the Golden State.
So when Trump blasts America’s longtime allies and cozies up to the most murderous of foreign dictators, it may all be for show, with the sense that as long as he keeps America entertained, he can get on with his real interest, which is making profits.
It’s an approach completely unlike any previous President, and one whose ultimate consequences are unknown as an impeachment inquiry gets started. But it is fairly clear that Trump stands little chance of making good on most of the attacks he’s made against California.
Top state officials say they are fairly certain of that, despite a Supreme Court that’s upheld some other unprecedented Trump actions, like his condoning the caging of small immigrant and refugee children.
Said Gov. Gavin Newsom, who seems to enjoy sparring with Trump, and so is part of the President’s new show, “If Trump prevails, we will have more asthma in California…and other diseases. But that’s the state of things today in this country…We will fight back when he goes after our Dreamers and our health standards. And we will win in the courts.”
Added Becerra, “If the arguments in the President’s tweets are the arguments they will use to propel (legal actions), then we’re looking pretty good and we will enjoy facing them in court.”
The trick here is to see Trump’s real apparent motive: Less to hurt California or the potential victims of his actions than to keep the spotlight constantly on himself, impeachment investigation or not, and thereby help ensure another presidential term and even more personal profits while he steers government and foreign spending to his many properties.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump pushed the Australian prime minister to help Attorney General William P. Barr gather information for a Justice Department inquiry that Trump hopes will discredit the Mueller investigation, the New York Times reported Monday.
Trump held a state dinner for Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Sept. 20 and two days later met with him again in Wapakoneta when the two world leaders toured Pratt Industries, an Australian-owned company.
Trump’s overture was made during a telephone call, the Times reported, citing two American officials with knowledge of the call.
The White House restricted access to the call’s transcript to a small group of the president’s aides, one of the officials told the Times, an unusual decision that is similar to the handling of a July call Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. That call is at the heart of House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry into Trump.
A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the latest development, the Times said.
In making the request, the Times reported Trump was in effect asking the Australian government to investigate itself. The FBI.’s counterintelligence investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election began after Australian officials told the bureau that the Russian government had made overtures to the Trump campaign about releasing political damaging information about Hillary Clinton.

Joe Biden hostility toward the media doesn't seem to bother journalists

Texto completo: Imagine for a second that President Trump, even before he was elected, sent a letter to TV news anchors demanding that they adjust their editorial content so that it was more to his liking.
If that ever happened, at least eight national newspapers would devote multiple editorials each decrying Trump’s “authoritarian tendencies.” Jim Acosta would don his cape, and every hour on the hour he would look daringly into CNN’s camera to say in his best newsman voice, “No, Mr. President! We will not be caving to your demands!” And Dan Rather would emerge from his tomb to type out a grave Facebook message on the importance of a free press.
That’s just a hypothetical because Trump hasn’t actually done that but Joe Biden’s campaign just did and so far, there hasn’t been a peep out of the New York Times or any other national media outlet.
The Daily Beast reported Sunday night that top aides to Biden’s campaign sent a letter to addressed to “the heads of the major news and cable networks, as well as top news anchors” criticizing them for booking Trump’s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.
The letter said that the intent of the note was “to demand that in service to the facts, you no longer book Rudy Giuliani, a surrogate for Donald Trump who has demonstrated that he will knowingly and willingly lie in order to advance his own narrative.”
This is apparently part of Biden’s strategy to blunt any interest that the press might have in that potentially corrupt arrangement his son Hunter Biden held with a gas company in Ukraine, and his own conflict of interest in dealing with it.
Last week, Politico reported that Biden’s campaign was in engaged in a “war” with the media in an attempt to divert any and all scrutiny. “It’s all designed to focus coverage squarely on allegations that Trump asked a foreign leader to investigate the Biden family — and away from the president’s attempts to highlight Biden’s son Hunter’s business activities in Ukraine,” read the report.
That game plan was on display several days ago when Biden was asked by a reporter whether he had ever spoken with his son about his international business dealings. Biden responded with an unconvincing “never” and then waved his finger in the reporter’s face while demanding that he “ask the right questions.”
Once again, imagine if it were Trump shoving his finger in a reporter's face. CNN media avenger Brian Stelter would hold a candlelight vigil in memory of the First Amendment.
Trump calls the overwhelmingly negative, usually unfair coverage of his administration “fake news,” and we’re told that this complaint is the unraveling of democracy. Biden and his campaign make explicit demands about their coverage in an effort to control the editorial content of specific news outlets and — well, what can ya do?!
Journalists in the national media shouldn’t feel like they now have to summon new outrage over Biden’s hostility toward the free press. But maybe they could drop the act when it comes to Trump, too.

Probe the Effort to Sink Kavanaugh

Texto completo: The effort to sink Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation cries out for investigation. The Senate Judiciary Committee has already made a criminal referral to the Justice Department regarding alleged material misstatements by lawyer Michael Avenatti and his client Julie Swetnick. And a new book by two New York Times reporters contains a potentially explosive revelation.
In "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh," Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly report that Leland Keyser -- who was unable to corroborate high-school friend Christine Blasey Ford's allegation of youthful sexual misconduct -- says she felt pressured by a group of common acquaintances to vouch for it anyway. The book quotes an unnamed male member of the group suggesting in a text message: "Perhaps it makes sense to let everyone in the public know what her condition is" -- a remark the reporters describe as reading "like a veiled reference" to Ms. Keyser's "addictive tendencies." (The authors quote her as saying she told investigators "my whole history of using.")
A concerted effort to mislead the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Senate, especially if it involved threats to potential witnesses, could violate several federal criminal statutes, including 18 U.S.C. 1001 (lying to federal officials), 18 U.S.C. 1505 (obstruction of official proceedings) and 18 U.S.C. 1622 (subornation of perjury). Investigating and, if the evidence is sufficient, prosecuting such offenses would deter similar misconduct in the future.
It's bad for the country when nominees are subjected to what Bill Clinton calls "the politics of personal destruction." It intensifies political polarization and bitterness, traduces due process, dissuades good people from government service, and injures the reputation of the judiciary and other institutions.
The Senate and FBI could also consider changing the background-check process for nominees. Justice Kavanaugh's opponents seem to have expected a full-fledged criminal-style inquiry into Ms. Ford's allegations, although Senate Democrats had sat on them for months. But that's not how background investigations work. They're carried out by a special unit whose job is to verify information the nominee has provided and gather additional information that may reflect on his character and reputation. This process does not involve the same sort of searching questions that are characteristic of a criminal investigation. Nor do FBI background investigators routinely assess individual witness credibility. They reach no conclusions but collect information and then forward it to the White House and Senate. It is then up to the elected officials to decide who and what to believe. It is a political, not a criminal, process.
This is a matter of practice and tradition, not law. The FBI could be asked to conduct background investigations in a manner more comparable to its criminal and intelligence work, where agents will assess witness credibility and use those assessments to guide the focus and course of the inquiry. It should be especially vigilant to the possibilities of collusion and witness tampering, which are uniquely troubling in high profile confirmation battles.

Why California Has Better Data Protections

Texto completo: While Congress has stalled on new privacy bills, a real estate developer is pushing for broader data rights in the Golden State.
Each week, we review the week's news , offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry.
Greetings from New York Times HQ in Midtown Manhattan. I'm Natasha Singer, a tech reporter covering privacy, and I'm bringing you the week's tech news.
While many eyes were focused on the impeachment saga playing out in Washington, one person in San Francisco was taking on the entire tech industry. Again.
In 2017, Alastair Mactaggart, a wealthy real estate developer, founded and started financing a push for data rights for Californians. The effort led California lawmakers to enact the nation's most comprehensive state consumer privacy law last year. Ever since then, tech companies and industry groups have maneuvered to water down its consumer protections.
Now Mr. Mactaggart is back with a new campaign.
He's starting a ballot initiative that would amend the new law, the California Consumer Privacy Act, which takes effect on Jan. 1. He wants broader data control rights for Californians and new requirements on companies.
Among other things, his amendments would triple the law's fines for violations of children's privacy.
The ballot initiative also has a political component. It would require companies that profited from using Californians' personal data for election influence campaigns to disclose their practices to consumers and the state authorities.
When it comes to privacy protections, it seems, Californians have a big advantage over many other Americans. And not just because California was the first state to pass laws requiring companies to disclose data breaches and the first to grant minors the right to erase their online posts and photos.
The privacy laws illustrate differing governmental views on citizens' rights.
The United States Constitution, for instance, does not explicitly grant an inalienable right to privacy. Although the Fourth Amendment protects people from unreasonable government searches and seizure, it does not safeguard us against intrusive and ubiquitous snooping by tech giants and other corporations.
The Constitution of California, however, grants a right to privacy -- putting it on equal footing with the rights to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, freedom of speech and freedom of religion.
The Charter of European Union goes even further. It recognizes privacy and, separately, the protection of personal data as fundamental human rights.
"If you think about our other fundamental rights as a country, no one is spending millions and millions of dollars trying to undermine the First Amendment or the freedom of religion," Mr. Mactaggart told me. "But people are actually spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to undermine privacy because there's so much money in it for corporations."
For more practical tips on protecting your privacy, read my colleague Brian X. Chen's new column on how to use Apple's new privacy tools.
Limiting the right to be forgotten
While Mr. Mactaggart was working to expand the right to privacy in California, Europe's highest court issued landmark decisions narrowing it.
The rulings involved a law, popularly known as the "right to be forgotten," which gives people in the European Union a legal means to delete certain personal information about them online. In practical terms, that means Europeans can use their right to be forgotten to require Google and other search engines to delete links to news articles or sites containing personal details about them that are outdated, inaccurate or not in the public interest.
But on Tuesday, as my colleague Adam Satariano reported from London, the European Court of Justice ruled that the right to be forgotten does not apply outside the European Union. The court also said the right to delete certain personal data must be balanced against the public's right to know.
The ruling was a victory for Google and other search engines, Adam wrote. It means that the tech giant will not be required to take down links outside the European Union. It may also give Google and other companies more leeway to refuse certain deletion requests in the name of the public interest.
But defending the public's right to know can also have intended consequences.
In a riveting article, Adam profiled a journalist in Italy, Alessandro Biancardi, who lost a legal battle to preserve an article about a pair of brawling brothers. The story covered the stabbing of one brother by another at a seaside restaurant.
The brother who was stabbed wanted the article about the incident deleted and sued the journalist, citing his right to be forgotten, Adam reported. The journalist, however, refused to take down the article.
The European court's new ruling limiting the right to be forgotten may help local publications in the European Union defend and preserve such news coverage.
But for Mr. Biancardi, it is too late.
The journalist lost the lawsuit over the article about the brawling brothers. Faced with many other privacy and article-deletion demands, including 40 lawsuits, Mr. Biancardi shut down his news site last year.

Texto completo: Scholars have traditionally looked to the era's social conditions to understand the rise of Nazism. Two new biographies take a different approach.
When not at work on a book about the roots of anti-Semitism in his country, the German historian and Holocaust expert Peter Longerich has been thinking about 1923.
In that year, Longerich explained, Germany faced a severe crisis. The economy teetered, separatist movements accelerated in multiple states and, in November, the upstart politician Adolf Hitler attempted a putsch in Bavaria. Still, "the Weimar Republic managed to get through the crisis and stabilize itself."
A decade later, another crisis had a very different outcome: Hitler became Reich Chancellor, quickly eliminated institutional checks on his power, and launched a dictatorship.
How was Hitler able to turn a democratic nation into an autocracy organized around race-based hatred? In recent years, as much of the Western world has seen a notable, sometimes violent turn toward nationalism and anti-Semitism, that question has become one of broad, anxious interest. This fall, two new books seek answers: Longerich's "Hitler: A Biography" and the Cambridge historian Brendan Simms's "Hitler: A Global Biography." Both were underway well before the tumult of current events, but both biographers recognize that recent political trends have made their subject especially charged.
"The questions that Hitler was addressing -- inequality, migration, the challenge of international capitalism -- they're as salient as they were when he set out to provide his peculiarly destructive and demented answers," Simms said. "In a very alarming and upsetting way, Hitler is actually less strange today than he was 20 or 30 years ago."
For Longerich, only a few factors separate the events of 1923 and 1933. An alliance between conservative factions that lasted just long enough. A steady degradation of the country's constitution to prime the path. Most important, a leader who, through acumen, willpower and charisma, united a movement given to immobilizing infighting.
For decades, prevailing scholarly attitudes have de-emphasized the centrality of that leader, preferring instead to examine the structures that enabled the broad terror of the Third Reich. "The individual events that were happening, from Warsaw to Norway, from Italy to France, and deep into the Soviet Union, cannot be explained simply by central decision-making," said Jürgen Matthäus, head of research at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.
But Longerich and Simms are among several historians to reassess that attitude lately. (Another is Volker Ullrich, author of a recent two-volume biography of Hitler.) It's not the case that "dangerous developments only stem from social movements or structural trends," Longerich said. "It can also be, simply, that a person has the abilities to use a certain political situation to set a new agenda."
In a 2018 volume of the German Yearbook of Contemporary History devoted to new research on Hitler, the editors Elizabeth Harvey and Johannes Hürter identified a recent "Hitler boom," an unexpected increase in German research into Hitler beginning around 2013. But they're wary of ascribing that upswing to public concerns. Academics, Harvey said, are largely not responding to "the worrying upsurge today of right-wing extremism, anti-Semitism, racism, right-wing populism, extremist leader figures" by thinking, "Right, I'm going to go write a better biography of Hitler to cure that."
Indeed, professional historians are wary of drawing too many parallels between Hitler and authoritarian-minded present-day leaders. "History," Matthäus said, "is probably more complex than these analogies would like to have it."
Simms shares that view. "I don't think there are any simple partisan points you can make today drawing on the findings of these books," he said. "If there's a comparison or a lesson, it's to take seriously and look closely at what people say and what they argue before they come to power, and not to assume they will be tamed by the structures." In writing about Hitler's furious obsession with German emigration to America, Simms (who is British) did include one reference to the contemporary landscape: "The president is mentioned in the book, but only in the context that his grandfather, Frederick Trump, was one of those Germans that left Germany," he said.
Simms is a political scientist and a professor of international relations; this is his first biography and his first book to focus on World War II. A significant motivation was personal: "My mother is German, and I grew up for quite a lot of my childhood in Germany," he said. "My grandfather served in the Second World War on the German side."
Longerich -- whose previous books include biographies of the Nazi leaders Heinrich Himmler and Joseph Goebbels, as well as "Holocaust: The Nazi Persecution and Murder of the Jews" -- has personal reasons for his interest as well. "Of course, you ask yourself: Why are you doing this?" he said. "Why are you so obsessed with this period?"
One reason, he said, is that he was born in Germany only a decade after the war ended. "My teachers actually served in the Wehrmacht. My history teacher was a former SS man. It's difficult to see, the elderly people you know were actively involved in this system." That difficulty, for him, turned to curiosity over "how rapidly the democratic Weimar Republic, center of modern culture, could turn into a dictatorship -- and how quickly this dictatorship could be transformed, again, into a relatively normal democratic society."
Academic caution aside, that curiosity isn't detached from action; Longerich and Simms have both joined the growing ranks of historians speaking publicly about threats they see in contemporary society. Longerich helped lead a 2012 German parliamentary commission examining anti-Semitism in the country, and Simms is the president of a think tank, the Project for Democratic Union, that supports the constitutional creation of a single European state.
"For historians working on the history of National Socialism," Elizabeth Harvey said, there's "a feeling of obligation to intervene in current debates." The timing of history is delicate, and the life of Hitler remains one of the most incomprehensible examples of how quickly the touch of the wrong person, at the wrong time, can shatter an order that appeared stable. "It was unimaginable," Longerich said, "how the world I grew up in, only 25 years before, could be so different."

IT’S NOT EASYBEING GREEN

Texto completo: On Jan. 1 of this year, I began cooking as a vegetarian. Not because I became vegetarian - that would be professionally untenable - but because my younger child did, thus upending most of my hard-won weeknight cooking strategies.
I didn’t think of myself as an animal-centric cook, just your basic modern omnivore. Steaks and lamb chops were an occasional treat, not a routine dinner. But I soon realized that I’d been relying on shortcuts like bacon, anchovy paste, pancetta and fish sauce.
At the same time, I began research on a project about how to cook and eat with less impact on the environment. What I learned made me want to eat not only less meat but also less dairy, which can be just as harmful. It didn’t seem right to simply replace recipes that call for a pound of meat with recipes that call for a pound of cheese, so vegan cooking was also newly intriguing.
It didn’t seem impossible. I knew about putting vegetables at the center of the plate, I had mastered “put an egg on it,” and we already ate salad most nights. So I collected a fresh batch of recipes, laid in a supply of legumes and embarked on my new kitchen life.
The first few weeks, I did what felt normal: I cooked a couple of different things on the nights we all sat down to eat together. But dinner was never on the table before 9 p.m., the food was strangely unsatisfying and the kitchen was absolutely wrecked.
I tacked toward one-dish and one-pot meals. This worked for a while. We had penne with tomatoes and eggplant, followed by pad Thai, followed by macaroni and cheese, at which point there was a mutiny. Noodles every night were not the solution.
So I reached out to my trusted plant-based sources to find out why my omnivore’s skills produced vegetarian fails, and to reteach me how to cook. Here are their critiques:
To make sure dinner was filling, I was stuffing everyone with starch.
“A plant-based diet is not going to work exactly like a meat-based one,” said Rich Landau, chef and co-owner of Vedge and other vegetarian restaurants in Philadelphia and Washington. “It’s just not going to fill you up the same way.” In other words, it’s likely that a plant-based dinner at 7 p.m. may not carry everyone over until breakfast the next day. “Herbivores are grazers,” he added.
The fact that my kids were peckish at 9:30 p.m. didn’t mean that I had failed at dinner. It simply meant that I needed to lay in more substantial snacks and let go.
I needed to push more flavor into everything.
For meat eaters, the natural umami in meat and fish is satiating; even if the roasted potatoes alongside are plain and the salad dressing is basic, the savoriness brings satisfaction. Without that to lean on, everything on the plate wants to be thoroughly and thoughtfully seasoned, including basics like grains and beans.
“Just using enough salt will get you halfway there,” said Raquel Pelzel, author of “Umami Bomb” (Workman, 2019), a new book of vegetarian recipes built around umami-rich ingredients: cooked tomatoes, mushrooms and Parmesan cheese. Then, she said, build elements like sweetness, heat, acid and smoke. (Smoked paprika is vegan sorcery, used in everything that I once flavored with bacon. I picked up a new trick for the spice from “Sababa,” a new cookbook of Israel-inspired food: The author, Adeena Sussman, recommends stirring it in the end of cooking, to preserve its bright taste.)
Marinate everything that can be marinated, garnish everything that can be garnished (preferably with crunchy things like nuts and croutons) and season your cooking liquids (when you’re pressed for time, throw in a vegetable bouillon cube).
I was avoiding meat and dairy substitutes for no good reason.
Growing up among hippies made me perpetually suspicious of anything offered as a healthier substitute for something good. The fact is that there are many products on the market that are delicious on their own terms, and more and more foods that are doing a good job of pretending to be meat and dairy. Go out and try them. Thanks to the recipes in “I Can Cook Vegan,” a new book from chef Isa Chandra Moskowitz, coconut oil is my new best friend.
I was trying to cook too many things.
I phoned a fiendishly good home cook of my acquaintance, whose children have been through vegan, vegetarian and pescatarian stages. She spoke some hard truths. “The thing about a vegetable is that you can’t just unwrap it, salt it, sear it and put it in the middle of the plate,” she said. Washing, peeling, cutting and sometimes even blanching must be done before you get to the cooking. “Vegetables just take more work,” she said.
We can’t let that dissuade us from cooking them, but we can remember that one or two vegetables to work with on a weeknight is plenty for most home cooks. A bunch of roasted carrots with yogurt and the nutty spice mix dukkah is dinner; a pile of lemony broccoli or broccoli raab on grilled bread is dinner; spicy tomato soup with bread and cheese is most definitely dinner.
I was being snobbish about frozen vegetables.
Pulling off a weeknight vegetarian dinner with variety, like a sheet-pan dinner, a vegetable stew or a stir-fry, means having some parcooked vegetables on hand. New vegetarians are often advised to do a big vegetable shop once a week and prep everything at once. I did it, but was discouraged by the fact that at the end of all that labor, I still had to cook everything as the week went on.
Bhavna Patel, a home cook in Lake City, Florida, with a popular YouTube channel, grew up in Gujarat, India, where a majority of people are vegetarian or vegan. She has streamlined her family’s recipes, she said, and often relies on homemade frozen vegetables. If you are peeling and cutting them anyway, it’s just as easy to boil them in salted water and freeze them in resealable bags. Or, find a brand you like and buy them. The route to dinner is much faster. Her go-to meal for her sons, pav bhaji, is a vegetable curry served on toasted buttered buns.
I also needed to read recipes differently.
Even if a vegetarian recipe has a manageable number of ingredients and a short cooking time (like a stir-fry), it may take a while to get it on the table. That’s because many food publications, including NYT Cooking, measure the cook time starting at the point where the ingredients are already assembled and prepped. (There’s such a wide range of kitchen skills, it wouldn’t be possible to say how long it takes a given cook to do that work.) So a recipe that begins with a pound of washed, stemmed and sliced kale, two cups of chopped onions and six minced garlic cloves is always going to take longer than the estimated time.
I had to stop living in fear.
I felt guilty when my eyes strayed toward the stash of chicken stock in the freezer, and worried about adding fish sauce to a vegan recipe. But your kitchen is not a restaurant, and you are not a giant corporation subject to labeling laws. If everyone decides that the Caesar salad dressing needs anchovies this week, no one will break down your door or take away your membership card. You still get to decide how to cook in your home.

Texto completo: One of television's most important cultural roles the last 70 years has been in helping shape national memory. For better or worse, the medium tells us what is worth remembering by the events it chooses to commemorate.
Some choices are obvious and easy: D-Day, 9/11, the moon landing, Pearl Harbor.
Most TV channels, networks and shows simply follow the consensus of dominant culture and those in power. But the great and daring ones remind us of events some might not want to even admit took place.
PBS Frontline is a great and daring journalistic TV franchise. It was the first to revisit the brazen Tiki torch march and murderous acts of white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia., on the first anniversary of those ugly events, which took place in August 2017. And it did so with a documentary investigating the neo-Nazis and racists engaged in the demonstrations who had not been brought to justice by Virginia or federal law enforcement authorities.
Tuesday night at 9, Frontline returns for a new season by remembering the death of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered on Oct. 2, 2018, and then had his body hacked to pieces by a team of operatives from Saudi Arabia inside that country's consulate in Istanbul. Khashoggi, a Saudi native then living in Washington, had gone to the consulate to obtain a certificate saying he was divorced, a document he needed to marry his Turkish fiancée.
As it did with Charlottesville, Frontline commemorates Khashoggi's death by doing what it does best: investigating the forces and parties responsible for the crime, in this case most notably, Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, and his former close aide, Saud al-Qahtani. The gruesome brutality and repressive barbarism of the two are at odds with the image promoted by President Trump and some of his family members and top aides of a young prince bringing prosperity and reform to his country. Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have steadfastly refused to publicly accept the finding of the CIA that Mohammed bin Salman, or MBS as he is known, was responsible for the death of Khashoggi.
Trump plays a prominent role in this hard-hitting report on the rise of MBS and the horrible repression this so-called reformer has inflicted on the real reformers fighting for some freedom of expression and basic rights for women in his country.
Khashoggi was banned from writing or using Twitter while still working in Saudi Arabia following a piece he did criticizing Trump after the reality TV star was elected president. As the documentary shows, Trump and MBS are one, big mutual admiration society, with America's president dancing the sword dance at a ceremony with the Saudi royals, while regularly tweeting support of the prince even after the role of MBS in the death of Khashoggi was impossible to deny by any fair-minded individual.
And, oh, how Trump loves those billion-dollar arms deals: our weapons for Saudi dollars. Remember how the president said he didn't want to do anything to jeopardize those sales when pressed on his unwillingness to denounce MBS in the wake of Khashoggi's murder.
One of the keenest insights in this report involves the way MBS went from using Twitter to weaponizing it under the direction of al-Qahtani. And I don't mean weaponizing just in a metaphorical sense.
In the film, Deborah Amos, of NPR, describes the arc of Twitter in Saudi Arabia as MBS started using it for political control as going from "an open platform where people felt comfortable expressing opinions to something that was more an instrument of repression." As successful as Trump was in using Twitter to attack his opponents in 2016, he has to take a backseat to the way it is being used in Saudi Arabia to create a "Black List" of MBS critics and to track and attack them with an army of fake accounts, barrage of threats and sometimes imprisonment.
The popular phrase in Saudi Arabia for the Twitter bot mobs is an "army of flies," only these can prove deadly to those on the "Black List," with some singled out for torture and other forms of physical harm. Nor am I using the term "deadly" metaphorically.
This is a chilling report on a monstrous young leader who has been sold to much of the world as a charismatic and even progressive figure. Wait until you see the great video and photos of the coast-to-coast PR tour he took in the U.S. in 2018 starting with a big White House launch from Trump and then going straight through to the embrace of the titans of Silicon Valley and Hollywood who all wanted to get some of those Saudi dollars. Check out all the cultural leaders shown smiling and shaking hands with MBS.
One of my favorite visual moments shows a huge crowd of young Saudis dancing and singing. It is the kind of visual I have seen used to promote the prince as progressive for allowing such displays of music and dance in Saudi life. Except what they are singing is, "MBS, MBS, MBS." Call it mass indoctrination, a Trump rally on steroids with lots of dancing.
The superb editing of those carefully gathered visuals and interviews is one of the reasons this two-hour film moves so fast. And I mean fast by nonfiction standards. After a day of tracking Trump's helter-skelter behavior on cable TV, I sat down wondering if i had two hours of watching another lying, dangerous politician in me. But it felt like "The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia" went by faster than my favorite one-hour Netflix drama. And I wanted more.
Beyond the deep research, rich archive imagery and deft editing, one of the other things that makes this investigation so compelling to watch is the presence of veteran journalist Martin Smith as correspondent. I understand how all TV personas, even for journalists, are constructions. I get that.
But, to me, Smith has become a kind of onscreen ideal of the best of TV journalism, relentlessly searching for answers, stalking the truth, asking tough questions without a touch of showboating or hotdog in any of his work. In TV terms, he's the hard-eyed, no-nonsense lawman in a TV western or the detective in a TV cop show focused simply on delivering justice.
Smith's persistence does pay off in the documentary with an interview with MBS. You can judge for yourself how much you trust the words of such a man. To me, the interview is not what matters in this report.
While the ultimate timeliness of "The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia" is primarily in the way it helps us remember and reflect on the monstrous and evil act committed against Khashoggi a year ago, it is further made relevant this week in the wake of remarks by Trump and A.G. Sulzberger, publisher of the New York Times.
Sulzberger in a talk given at Brown University and published as an op-edit piece in the Times, chronicles with real-life examples how dangerous life has become for correspondents abroad during the Trump administration. Read it and be chilled at the administration's callous indifference to a Times request for help with a correspondent in danger.
Then read the Los Angeles Times report of Trump on Thursday calling reporters "scum," "animals" and some of the "worst people you will ever meet." He leveled the attack at a private breakfast for diplomatic officials.
Don't miss "The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia." Understand, thanks to the great and daring work of Frontline, how real the threat to free speech and a free flow of information is not just in Saudi Arabia, but also here at home.
And that's all the more timely give Sulzberger's speech this past week

Texto completo: A town of bookstores.
It sounds like it must be a myth, a Shangri-La, but I'm here to tell you that there is a town filled with bookstores, and reader, I have been there.
Hay-on-Wye in county Brecknockshire, Wales, is actually no secret. I first heard of it in "Sixpence House: Lost in a Town of Books" by Paul Collins, a 2003 memoir of the Collins family's move/the story of Collins moving his family from San Francisco to Hay-on-Wye. Collins spent a year working for Richard Booth, the "King of Hay" and the man who dreamed up the idea of making a small Welsh town a tourist destination by focusing on used books. Booth recently died and was memorialized in a New York Times obituary as an iconoclast.
Because our trip was not planned around a visit to Hay-on-Wye, I had only a few hours to experience the place. There are many many bookstores -- around two-dozen -- but there are also nice little restaurants, other shops, and a fudge place that could've been worth the trip all by itself.
A few hours was just enough to experience awe at the sheer volume of books in the world that have wound up at the stores in this village. I hit a half-dozen spots, each one a little different in personality. Some had nice, tall shelves, wide aisles, books categorized and alphabetized, generally where one would expect them to be.
In others, great piles of titles were mixed and stacked on the floors and tables and shelves, leaving the impression that you might find treasure lurking at the bottom. I was particularly and powerfully drawn to old copies of the 1950s Penguin pocket paperbacks with the orange covers, envisioning rows of them on the empty bookshelves I do not have, the little Penguin colophons lined up like they're marching through the living room.
Probably luckily for me, in addition to not having a lot of time, I also didn't have room in my luggage. If we'd been closer to the end of the trip, I might've jettisoned some clothes. I can just imagine arriving back in the United States, and the customs official asking if I had anything to declare. I would have to confess:
"I have a problem with books."
Instead, I picked up a U.K. first edition of Frederick Barthelme's "Two Against One," a book I haven't read by a writer I admire.
I thought that would be it, but as I left the Hay Cinema Bookshop, I perused the shelves outside, where all books were priced at a pound or less. Toward the end of the row was a fraying copy of "The Thurber Carnival," a compendium of works by James Thurber, best known for "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" and his years of contributions to The New Yorker. The pages were falling out and it smelled vaguely of mold. I used a pound coin to liberate it and brought it home with me.
In "Sixpence House," Collins spends his days moving books around Richard Booth's bookstore, ruminating on what it means for these books to exist, likely to have found a final resting place on the shelves, never to be touched by readers again.
I don't need to read this copy of "The Thurber Carnival." I've read James Thurber already, but when I unpacked my bag at home and saw it there at the bottom, I was pleased that the book and I had found each other.

AG Barr smells less rosy after Ukraine phone call memo

Texto completo: One of the most shocking revelations in the transcript of President Donald Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was that so much of what Trump had to say on the call focused just on getting Ukrainian officials to investigate his political opponents. Another surprise was that Trump said repeatedly that Attorney General William Barr would be running point, working with Trump's private attorney Rudy Giuliani, on these matters.
These facts now implicate the attorney general, the nation's chief law enforcement officer, directly in the commission of acts that many of the country's leading legal experts consider federal crimes — whether as election law violations, bribery or other offenses concerning public corruption.
Even Barr seems to understand the extreme impropriety of what the transcript suggests. Hence Barr's formal statement suggesting that what Trump told Ukraine's president about the attorney general's role was essentially false.
What's even more egregious here is to think of the transcript in relation to what else Barr may have been doing in handling the Ukraine matter.
It's deeply concerning to now know that Barr's Justice Department told the director of national intelligence to withhold the whistleblower's complaint from Congress, while Barr admits he knew at the time that he was named on the phone call at the heart of the whistleblower's allegations. Perhaps that would be excusable if the Justice Department's advice to the director was ordinary and well within the law.
Layer onto all of these concerns another revelation in Wednesday's news — according to The New York Times, the director of national intelligence and the inspector general of the intelligence community each referred the whistleblower's complaint to the Justice Department for a possible criminal investigation into the president's actions. Within a matter of days, Barr's Justice Department somehow reached the conclusion that the complaint could not trigger an investigation because the allegations could not involve a crime.
Barr's Justice Department came up with the idea that "the information discussed on the call didn't amount to a 'thing of value' that could be quantified," according to BuzzFeed News. That logic flies in the face of what the nation's foremost legal experts, including Trump's deputy solicitor general, concluded in the Mueller report. In the case of Ukraine, just chalking up all of Giuliani's out-of-pocket expenses in the hunt for fake dirt on Biden would likely show the immense value that he and Trump placed on the information.
Finally, what makes matters worse for Barr is that the president has twice publicly discussed having the attorney general investigate allegations involving Ukraine, Clinton and Biden. And the attorney general famously tried to avoid answering Sen. Kamala Harris' simple question whether the White House ever asked him to investigate anyone. After the release of the Ukraine-gate transcript, the cloud over Bill Barr is thick. There's one way for him to remove it. Step aside.

Where They Like to Eat in New York

Texto completo: Whether it's for a celebration, or for some familiar food, cooking experts and Times journalists share their top places.
A good restaurant provides comfort, a place to meet a friend, or a way to celebrate a milestone. Here, some familiar names share their go-to restaurants.
Pati Jinich
Cookbook author and PBS chef
I can never have enough slices of the Spicy Spring pizza from Prince St. Pizza. Especially if it is in between meals or late at night. The Spicy Spring has a generous amount of Fra Diavolo sauce (I like my pizza saucy!), tons of spicy pepperoni that comes out from the oven perfectly crisp around the edges and with a soft, greasy and meaty center and enough melted fresh mozzarella to sink your teeth into. It is just the perfect ratio of everything I need in a pizza.
The first thing I crave when I get out of the train from D.C. into Penn Station is a full order of the steamed Kimchee Mandoo dumplings at Mandoo Bar. They are filled with kimchee, tofu, pork and vegetables. I prepare a mixed soy sauce with their vinegar and spicy sauce and eat them in just a few minutes. It is a very low-key place, they serve super fast and I always have fun chatting with the waiters.
When I head back home, this is an even more low-key place, but so New York to me, I stop at Gardenia Deli. The same guy is always there and he sees me and knows exactly what I will bring back on the train: toasted whole wheat sandwich with baked ham, swiss, mayo, mustard, ripe avocado and lots of pickled jalapeños that I requested they carry -- and they did after I asked just once!
When I come to New York with any of my boys, I treat them to Buvette for some amazing coffee (for me) and the best ever chocolate mousse and tarte tatin (for us all!).
Will Guidara
American restaurateur
4 Charles Prime Rib: I can't actually explain how much I love this restaurant. Small, intimate, gracious, delicious -- it makes me feel so special every time I walk through their doors, as if you're going back in time and the past is pure perfection. Start with a martini, get a cheeseburger, a French dip sandwich and every single side. It's as close to a perfect restaurant as there is.
Crown Shy: a reasonably new place by our former chef James Kent and my really good friend Jeff Katz. You have to travel down to the financial district, but everything about that restaurant makes it worth the trip. The restaurant appears casual, understated, but everything is done with intention. The service is on point, and the food is incredible. Bread service is one of the best in the city, and the chicken is exceptional.
Rezdôra: I've only been once, but I loved it so much. The entire team is so lovely. So many people can cop an attitude after getting as much praise as they've gotten, but the vibe there is so welcoming. It's really refreshing. And the pasta? Some of the best in New York City. Check it out soon if you haven't already.
Frank Bruni
Columnist and former restaurant critic, The New York Times
During the five and a half years when I was The Times's restaurant critic, I was often -- maybe too often -- looking for and swooning over food that stopped me in my tracks. Ever since, I've been more taken with food that keeps stride with me.
I mean food that gives me great pleasure without asking me to bow down to it or demanding so much attention that it competes with the conversation or with the blissed-out jig in my brain as I get to the bottom of my martini. I mean food that doesn't let the element of surprise completely crowd out the air of the familiar. And I mean food working in concert with the setting, the combined force of which should make me feel relaxed as well as special.
I find this in New York City at Upland, at Lilia, at 4 Charles Prime Rib, at Uncle Boons, at Charlie Bird, at Cookshop. It helps that in most of these places I'm a regular. I'm falling into familiar arms whose embrace I know and can trust. In an era this suffused with anxiety and a city this agitating, that means everything to me.
Sam Sifton
Food editor, The New York Times
There is no higher restaurant pleasure than being a regular customer, particularly after being The Times's restaurant critic and eating in different restaurants every night. So now I bounce between Houseman and Prune, Fort Defiance and, lately, the Red Hook Tavern, and thrill to meals at RedFarm, Yun Nan Flavour Garden, 456 Shanghai.
And then there I am again, inexorably, at Frenchette, my wallet squealing. I can't help thinking Lee Hanson and Riad Nasr, the chefs and owners, are cooking better than they ever have in their careers -- and that includes at Balthazar and Minetta Tavern, and even way back when at Daniel, when they first met, in 1993. I sit at a corner table there and think: This is the greatest restaurant city in the world.
Ruth Reichl
Former restaurant critic, The New York Times, and author, "Save Me the Plums: My Gourmet Memoir"
I'm a New Yorker, so some of my favorite places are pure nostalgia. I love the counter at the Oyster Bar, where the same men have been making incredible oyster stew for most of my lifetime. Just the warm, round smell of that stew reminds me of my childhood. Afterward, I go outside and whisper into the echoing walls.
I like Gray's Papaya hot dogs for the same reason. It is, to me the purest flavor of New York. I even like the papaya drink (although I suspect you have to be a native to appreciate the taste).
For new restaurants, my favorite is Atomix; it is an astonishing homage to the culture of the chef's native Korea. A beautiful experience in every way.
Estela is another favorite; Ignacio Mattos is a fascinating chef who never puts a foot wrong. His food is simple, but in his hands a simple salad becomes something exciting and new.
But for a taste of the future -- and a modicum of hope -- there's nothing like Blue Hill at Stone Barns, in Westchester County. Everything is raised right here, and everything is recycled. In this elegant atmosphere, Dan Barber aims to serve more than simply a great meal: His goal is to offer you food for thought that will linger long after the flavors have become mere memories.
Andrew Zimmern
Host, "Bizarre Foods"
I was born in New York City in 1961 and will always consider myself a lifelong New Yorker despite living in my adopted home state of Minnesota for the last 28 years. Technically I think my legal address is listed as airport; at least that's how it feels most of the time.
Because my heart is in New York, because it's the greatest city on the planet, because my work still happens there, I make it a point to be in town every month for at least a few days. I wish I could tell you what the hot new places in town look, feel and taste like. I have no clue.
I tend to dine at my favorite restaurants, the ones I have always spent time in, most of which four generations of Zimmerns have dined in: Nom Wah Tea Parlor, JG Melon, Russ & Daughters, Katz's Deli, Jing Fong, Gregory's 26 Corner Taverna, Barney Greengrass, Di Fara, Randazzo's, Charles Country Pan Fried Chicken, Spumoni Gardens for a trio of corner slices, Wo Hop, Sylvia's, Peter Luger's and so on.
There are a bunch of "new" classics I deeply love, too: Gramercy Tavern, New Wonjo, Golden Mall in Flushing, SriPraPhai, Marea, Le Bernardin, Daniel as well as Boulud Sud, Red Rooster, Daxi, The Grill, Cote, all the Momofukus, Misi, Empellón, Cosme, Frenchette, Upland, Shuko, Don Angie, Crown Shy, The Dutch, Toro, Butter, and about a hundred others that I am blanking on as I sit on a plane fearing the wrath of my friends' emails excoriating me for leaving their place off my list. I hate lists.
Kim Severson
National food correspondent, The New York Times
I don't live in New York anymore, but I visit a lot for work and sometimes for play. I always try to eat at the most promising new restaurants, but I have a few nostalgic stops I make. Because I live in a city without a lot of great Sichuan food, I like to grab at least a lunch with some colleagues at Szechuan Gourmet, China Xiang or, if I can talk someone into a quick trip to the east side, Land of Plenty.
When I travel with my young daughter (or even when I don't!) I try to grab a recession special at Gray's Papaya, with a papaya drink. And a really good trip back would include a bialy from Kossar's and a slice from Upside Pizza or Joe's in the Village.
Julia Moskin
Food reporter, The New York Times
There are countless restaurants to love in New York. A small subset of those qualify for my "only in New York" label. Have breakfast downtown with the beautiful people (after 10 a.m., please) at Atla or La Mercerie, or at Russ & Daughters Cafe. Pick up lunch: a slice at Scarr's or Upside, where N.Y.-style pizza has recently been perfected, or noodles from Xi'an or the original Momofuku Noodle Bar.
Eat dinner at a place that combines New York creativity and cool with food from somewhere else: Shuko for sushi; 886 for Taiwanese; Il Buco Alimentari or Café Altro Paradiso for Italian; Le Coucou for French classics that barely exist in France anymore.
Ginia Bellafante
Columnist, The New York Times
I live in Brooklyn and I have managed to concentrate my eating there so effectively that when friends come in from out of town and want me to recommend Manhattan restaurants, they might as well be asking where to go out in Tupelo, Miss.
To anyone amenable to a bridge crossing, I go on and on about La Vara. It's a fantastic Spanish restaurant on a beautiful residential street in Cobble Hill. The culinary roots are Jewish and Moorish. I love the quietly glam room, the warm, happy spirit that emanates from the big hearts of husband-and-wife chef-owners Alex Raij and Eder Montero, and the fried artichokes that always leave me begging for a second order.
When it's time to celebrate something big -- or when someone else is generously offering to pick up the tab -- I head in the opposite direction, down the hill to Dumbo and take in the easy formality of the River Café, which has sat on a barge in the East River since the 1970s. Hurricane Sandy knocked it around seven years ago, and it returned better than ever.
I've got a regular dinner thing going with a group of moms and teachers at my son's school. Inevitably we end up at Rucola in Boerum Hill, a neighborhood Northern Italian place with a country-house aesthetic. Pretty much everything is delicious and the loud, cramped room means our gesticulating -- the inevitable result of gossiping about 9-year olds -- never feels out of place.
When I am craving pizza, I am craving pizza from Lucali, but the problem is that lots of other people are craving it, too. When you get there and time things right and get a table, you really feel like you are winning at life.
If I haven't see you in a long time -- if we are recapping the end of your first marriage, the long divorce and the uncertainty surrounding the new person you met on Bumble -- I'm going to want to go to Periyali. It is a grown-up and subdued Greek place in the East 20s (yes, in Manhattan) where the food is reliably simple and good and where you can have the increasingly rare experience of hearing the person across the table from you.
Sam Kass and Alex Wagner
Former White House chef; co-host of "The Circus"
Diner is a beacon of light and the place to celebrate birthdays, new years, new jobs and everything else over their fries and steaks -- especially the fries and especially late at night.
Uncle Boon's is a place of deep inspiration -- amazing betel leaves and eye-wateringly hot banana blossom salad that make both of us hiccup with delight.
Nom Wah Tea Parlor will definitely shape our children's earliest food memories: We go here regularly for the chicken and pork shumai, steamed shrimp and snow pea leaf dumplings and sautéed Chinese greens.
I Sodi is essentially the perfect date -- incomparable negronis, perfect artichokes and heavenly pasta limone or their million-layer lasagna.
Estela has such spectacular and perfect food -- lamb ribs, mussels escabeche, salads with amazing things hiding underneath them! What's not to love?
Decoy. If we ever go to jail (separately or together), our last meal will be this Peking Duck. It is sublime, the stuff of emperors and kings. The only thing stopping us from each eating an entire one is the fact that the ducks are limited in number. But we have tried.
Shake Shack, Terminal 4 at J.F.K. Airport. Both of us travel an insane amount, and while we wish our lives were all crisped artichokes and steaming shumai and burrata salads, the reality is that we also have to eat a lot on the road. Shake Shack is an oasis -- especially at breakfast, where you can catch either (or both) of us waiting for a fried egg and sausage sandwich (double egg for Sam) and pushing our boarding time to the last minute possible. We have almost missed flights for a Shack sandwich, no joke.

Keyser other victim of the Kavanaugh saga

Texto completo: Every good story needs a hero, and the saga of Brett Kavanaugh's rise to the Supreme Court has provided one: Leland Keyser.
She also became a victim when her longtime friend, Christine Blasey Ford, decided to hit refresh on a decades-old high school incident that apparently only Ford remembers.
Keyser is the other female student whom Ford named as having been at the small party where Kavanaugh allegedly pinned her down on a bed and groped her. She is also the friend who swore under penalty of perjury that she doesn't recall such a party or, in fact, ever having met Kavanaugh. Her comments echoed those of the other partygoers Ford named, none of whom remembered such a gathering.
This isn't what places Keyser on the heroes' roster. What earns her that distinction is her steadfastness, at great personal suffering, in refusing to change her story despite what she describes as pressure to rethink her initial statement. According to a new book, "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh" by New York Times reporters Kate Kelly and Robin Pogrebin, some of Keyser's erstwhile friends and acquaintances tried to persuade her to say she didn't remember the party, not that it didn't happen.
Keyser, reportedly a registered Democrat, has become increasingly convinced that Ford's story isn't true and doesn't make sense, according to the book. Given their close friendship during their school days, isn't it likely that Ford would have told her about such an attack? And, had Keyser been at the alleged party, since she already had her driver's license and often gave Christine a ride, wouldn't she have taken her younger friend home?
According to the book, Ford's team of friends and advisers apparently saw Keyser as an obstacle to Ford's narrative and brainstormed ways for her to get onboard. The book cites a group text among Ford's acquaintances from soon after her testimony. Cheryl Amitay, who attended the same girls' high school as Ford, wrote: "Maybe one of you guys who are friends with (Keyser) can have a heart-to-heart." And, "I don't care, frankly, how f---ed up her life is."
A man who had gone to a neighboring boys' school chimed in: "Perhaps it makes sense to let everyone in the public know what her condition is." To which Amitay responded, "Leland is a major stumbling block."
Keyser, a former professional golfer who has undergone numerous operations on her back and neck, has suffered addiction during her adult life. Although recovering, she told Kelly and Pogrebin she was concerned that this history would be used against her if she didn't come up with a more-acceptable recollection of events. When pressed, however, she refused to take the easy route and protect herself.
For her integrity and valor under perceived pressure, she has been punished. Even Ford seemed to turn on her old friend, mentioning Keyser's "significant health challenges," during her testimony, and seeming to suggest that her friend might have diminished capacities: "I'm happy that she's focusing on herself and getting the health treatment that she needs."
This may have been one of the sweetest condemnations in the history of tossing inconvenient friends under the bus. But, importantly, Ford planted a seed of doubt about Keyser's credibility, which has been cultivated by the Times writers. On CNN's "Reliable Sources" Sunday, Kelly pointed to Keyser's "memory issues ... because she has a history of substance abuse, which she acknowledges."
Oof. What a gut punch. If no one in recovery can ever be trusted again, then the world of rehabilitative addiction therapy may as well shutter its doors.
In fact, Keyser remembers very well the summer of 1982, when Ford believes the alleged incident occurred. It was the year after her grandmother introduced her to golf and Keyser became consumed with the sport, according to another book published this past summer, "Justice on Trial," by Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino. Keyser worked full-time in the golf pro shop at a Washington-area country club and had little time for socializing. Her hard work at school and in sports paid off with stellar grades, seven varsity letters, and acceptance to the University of Virginia, followed by a professional golfing career and a coaching position at Georgetown University.
Today, Keyser keeps a low profile, as was always her preference. She is, indeed, in fragile health from her injuries and surgeries. But Keyser can stand tall for having remained true to her convictions despite being exposed and pressured by those who seemed to have used her struggles against her. In my book, that's heroic.

Texto completo: Rudy Giuliani, el abogado personal de Donald Trump, es una de las personas que acabaron en el centro de una gran tormenta política que involucra actualmente al presidente de Estados Unidos. Un viaje que el letrado hizo a España este verano podría representar uno de sus encargos recientes que más dolores de cabeza podría costarle.
El nuevo escándalo que embistió a Trump estalló después de que un informante anónimo denunciara en una queja dirigida al Congreso que el presidente intentó presionar a su homólogo de Ucrania para que este lo ayudara con un plan para investigar a Joe Biden , político demócrata y actualmente destacado rival político. Giuliani, quien fue alcalde de Nueva York entre 1994 y 2001, tuvo un papel clave en esta maniobra política, según el denunciante.
Mientras que la Cámara de Representantes la mayoría demócrata abrió una investigación de juicio político contra el mandatario para averiguar si abusó de su poder, seis abogados que trabajaron con Giuliani en el Departamento de Justicia, donde el actual abogado personal del presidente cubrió distintos cargos, aseguraron a NBC News que creen que el letrado, una de las personas más cercanas a Trump, cometió crímenes en esas circunstancias.
En su viaje de finales de julio a la capital del país ibérico, Giuliani se reunió con un asesor de Volodymyr Zelenskiy, el presidente ucraniano, según el informante. El encuentro se produjo un día después de que Trump llamara a su homólogo para pedirle que investigara a Biden y su hijo Hunter, involucrado en negocios en el país eslavo, por posibles actos de corrupción. Y la misión servía supuestamente para afianzar ese plan.
“Ciertamente, este no es el Giuliani que conozco”, afirmó a NBC Jeffrey Harris, quien trabajó como asistente principal de Giuliani cuando estaba en el Departamento de Justicia durante la administración del presidente Ronald Reagan. “Creo que el Giuliani que conozco pondría bajo juicio al Giuliani de hoy”.
El excompañero del abogado de Trump , que ahora ejerce la profesión privadamente, agregó que el Gobierno de EEUU tiene “todo un aparato” que está configurado para tratar con funcionarios extranjeros. “Y Rudy Giuliani no es uno de ellos”, dijo.
La queja del informante anónimo asegura que el abogado también tuvo otros contactos con oficiales ucranianos. “Si esto se considerara como uso de recursos del Gobierno para beneficio propio, esta conducta estaría asociada a una serie de delitos.”.
NBC contactó en total a siete ex colegas de Giuliani. Uno no contestó, pero todos los demás coincidieron en no defender su conducta. E indicaron una serie de delitos que podría haber cometido, desde la violación de leyes electorales federales hasta el soborno y la extorsión.
Bruce Fein, quien trabajó en el Departamento de Justicia con Giuliani a principios de la década de 1980, dijo que cree que Giuliani podría ser procesado por violar las leyes federales de elecciones si se demuestra que intentó influir en la campaña de las presidenciales de 2020, en las que Biden quiere postularse como adversario a Trump.
“Las leyes electorales federales hacen que sea ilegal solicitar algo de valor de un Gobierno o ciudadanos extranjeros para influir en el resultado de una elección”, sostuvo. Fein dijo que Giuliani también podría exponerse a cargos por soborno ya que Trump supuestamente retuvo fondos militares para presionar a Ucrania. “Si Giuliani estuviera al tanto de eso, podría ser cómplice de Trump al conspirar para solicitar un soborno”, dijo.
Daniel Richman, quien trabajó con Giuliani en la Oficina del Fiscal de los Estados Unidos en Manhattan a fines de la década de 1980, dijo que necesitaba ver más evidencia antes de tomar una determinación concluyente. Pero estuvo de acuerdo en que un esfuerzo por ayudar en un complot para retener fondos de una potencia extranjera a cambio de un favor personal o político podría exponer al abogado de Trump a cargos criminales que podrían ir del fraude a la extorsión.
Otros ex fiscales que trabajaron con Giuliani plantearon la cuestión de que aparentemente influyó en la política exterior estadounidense, lo que podría suponer violación de la antigua Ley Logan, aprobada en 1799, que prohíbe a los ciudadanos privados negociar con un gobierno extranjero en nombre de los EEUU.
GIULIANI NIEGA
Giuliani calificó estas opiniones de “tonterías”. “No saben de qué están hablando. ¿Qué crímenes?”. También dijo que no pudo haber sobornado a nadie porque no ofreció nada de valor a los ucranianos. “¿Son estos tipos abogados o son imbéciles?”, preguntó en referencia a sus excompañeros, antes de negar que haya ejercido algún tipo de influencia en las elecciones.
El exfiscal federal John Flannery, que trabajó con él a mediados de la década de los setenta, dijo que estaba desconcertado por lo que describió como un flagrante abuso de la ley por su parte.
“Se ha puesto en una posición de ayudar e incitar, y tal vez dar comienzo, a un intercambio de favores con un gobierno extranjero para una campaña política estadounidense a instancias del propio candidato”, dijo Flannery. “Ninguno de los dos lo niega, y de hecho lo están profusamente, repetidamente y dolorosamente admitiendo”.
Flannery dijo que el Giuliani de hoy no se parece en nada al hombre con el que trabajó hace unos 40 años. “Es una sombra del que fue el mejor Rudy, y no el gran abogado que pensé que sería”.
La llamada de Trump a su homólogo ucraniano fue descalificada esta semana, y su contenido difundido en un resumen. También se difundió públicamente la queja del denunciante. Fuentes de la Casa Blanca aseguraron a algunos medios (CNN, The New York Times, The Associated Press) que la administración restringió la accesibilidad al contenido de las conversaciones entre Trump y los líderes de Rusia, Vladimir Putin, y la familia real de Arabia Saudí .

Little doubt he did it, but should Trump be impeached?

Texto completo: Here's a take no one will like: I'm confident he did it. I'm confident it's impeachable. I'm just not so sure he should be impeached for it.
Let's start at the top. It's obvious to me that President Trump pressured the Ukrainian government to launch a probe of former Vice President Joe Biden in order to tarnish the image of the Democrat best positioned to defeat him in 2020.
In the rough transcript of his conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Trump says America has been very good to Ukraine, but he wants the relationship to be more "reciprocal." Zelenskiy agrees and asks for more anti-tank missiles to deter ongoing Russian military aggression. Trump responds by asking for a two-part "favor."
First, he asks Zelenskiy to look into the 2016 hacking of the Democratic National Committee's servers (a bat-guano-crazy request, but whatever). Then, Trump mentions "the other thing" he wants.
"There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution, and a lot of people want to find out about that, so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great," Trump says.
The context matters as much as the text. Trump had already blocked the transfer of congressionally approved military aid. Rudy Giuliani, his personal lawyer, had been hectoring the Ukrainians for months to go after Biden (and it remains his singular obsession even now). Giuliani even admitted it last May in an interview with the New York Times. He said he was lobbying the Ukrainians to investigate Biden because "that information will be very, very helpful to my client."
And that's why Trump asked Zelenskiy to work with Giuliani.
There's more context as well. There were reportedly other calls in which Trump importuned the Ukrainians this way. Trump's explanation for why he froze the military aid to Ukraine in the first place keeps changing. On Monday he said he blocked it out of concern over Ukrainian corruption (the only corruption in the world he's passionate about, apparently). On Tuesday he said the real reason was that he wanted our allies to pony up even more money for the government he claimed was too corrupt for our aid in the first place.
Normally you'd think an inadvertent confession would settle things. But when Trump said of his call with Ukraine, "There was no pressure put on them whatsoever. But there was pressure put on with respect to Joe Biden," the assumption was that he misspoke.
We also learned Thursday that the "whistleblower" alleges the White House took extraordinary measures to hide the transcript of the call, which, if true, suggests wiser heads understood that the conversation crossed a line.
Regardless, I think Trump did it. I think it's obvious he did it. I think as more facts come to light, it will become even more obvious he did it. I also think it's obvious that this is an impeachable offense.
However, that doesn't mean I'm persuaded he must be impeached over it.
Impeachment doesn't mean "removal from office." It's the political equivalent of a grand jury indictment, with the House fully empowered to impeach any action it deems impeachable. It's up to the Senate to decide whether a president should be removed.
The Federalist Papers are clear: Impeachment is a political process, not a legal one. Illegal acts are surely impeachable, but not all impeachable acts are illegal. If the president stood on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office and shouted obscenities on national television while dancing in the nude, that would be impeachable but not illegal (FCC violations notwithstanding).
Impeachment is ultimately a question of whether a president violated the public trust. But there's nothing in the Constitution that says a president must be impeached for violating the public trust. I can list any number of occasions when presidents have done that and it never even occurred to anyone that they should be impeached for it.
It's a prudential question with good arguments on both sides. If I were Nancy Pelosi, I'd be even more torn than she's clearly been. In the modern era, we've never had the drama of an impeachment process in a president's first term or in the run-up to a re-election. We've never had a lot of things that we've had under Trump.
Absent new facts, the GOP-controlled Senate will not remove Trump. The president would claim "exoneration," and his behavior would become normalized for future presidents. So I'm not sure Democrats are right to pursue impeachment. I'm sure Republicans are wrong to pretend that what Trump did was totally fine.

Diplomat who refuted Bush's claims of Iraqi WMDs dies at 69 Former President Clinton says Joe Wilson was 'a true patriot'

Texto completo: Joseph C. Wilson, a onetime diplomat who incurred the wrath of the administration of George W. Bush for questioning one of the primary reasons for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, then saw his wife at the time, Valerie Plame, exposed as a clandestine CIA officer in an apparent act of retaliation, died Sept. 27 at his home in Santa Fe, New Mexico. He was 69.
The cause was organ failure, Plame said. She and Wilson were divorced earlier this year.
Wilson, who had negotiated face-to-face with Saddam Hussein before the first Iraq War in the early 1990s, was retired from the State Department when he was sent by the CIA on a fact-finding mission to the African country of Niger in 2002 to investigate whether Iraq had purchased "yellowcake" uranium ore in Niger. Uranium is used in making nuclear weapons.
After eight days in Niger, which had been one of his first diplomatic postings in the 1970s, Wilson concluded there was no evidence that Iraq had obtained uranium and therefore would not be able to make weapons of mass destruction.
During the State of the Union address in January 2003, Bush said the opposite: "The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa." Under that pretext, U.S. military forces invaded Iraq two months later, resulting in a war that dragged on for years and claimed thousands of American lives.
In July 2003, Wilson wrote an op-ed column for the New York Times, "What I Didn't Find in Africa."
"Having encountered Mr. Hussein and his thugs in the run-up to the Persian Gulf War of 1991, I was only too aware of the dangers he posed," he wrote. But the Bush administration disregarded his findings about the uranium and instead relied on secondhand intelligence that was later shown to be erroneous.
"Did the Bush administration manipulate intelligence about Saddam Hussein's weapons programs to justify an invasion of Iraq?" Wilson pointedly asked in his op-ed.
Wilson immediately found himself a target of the administration's embarrassment and anger. Within days, syndicated columnist Robert M. Novak identified Wilson's wife as a CIA operative.
"It just felt like I got a sucker punch to the gut," Plame told NPR's "Fresh Air" in 2007.
With her cover blown, Plame was forced to resign from the CIA, her career ended. Over the next few years, she and Wilson appeared in public to describe how their lives were turned upside down by what they considered an act of betrayal and political revenge by the Bush administration. Since 1982, it has been a federal crime to reveal the identity of covert intelligence officers.
Wilson was seen by many as a patriotic whistleblower, but Bush officials viewed him as a political enemy. During the 2000 presidential election, he had contributed $1,000 to each campaign, but by 2003 he had endorsed Democrat John Kerry against Bush.
Wilson and Plame were called arrogant for posing in their Jaguar convertible, with the White House in the background, for a profile in Vanity Fair. Wilson published a memoir, "The Politics of Truth: Inside the Lies that Led to War and Betrayed My Wife's CIA Identity," in 2004, followed three years later by Plame's own memoir. The books formed the basis of a 2010 film, "Fair Game," in which Wilson was portrayed by Sean Penn and Plame by Naomi Watts.
In 2006, Wilson and Plame filed suit against Vice President Richard Cheney and Cheney's onetime chief of staff I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby, presidential adviser Karl Rove and State Department official Richard Armitage, asserting that they had illegally disclosed Plame's identity to Novak. The suit was ultimately dismissed.
Although Armitage was widely believed to be the first person to leak Plame's name, it was Libby who was convicted in 2007 of perjury, obstruction of justice and other charges. Bush commuted Libby's prison sentence, and President Donald Trump pardoned him in 2018.
Seeking to shield their two young children from the public glare and death threats, Wilson and Plame moved to New Mexico. He worked as a consultant on African business ventures and frequently appeared as a speaker around the country. She is a Democratic candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives from New Mexico.
Joseph Charles Wilson IV was born Nov. 6, 1949, in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and grew up in California. His parents were journalists.
He graduated in 1972 from the University of California, Santa Barbara, where he was a self-described "surf dude." He worked as a carpenter, but a facility with languages earned him a State Department position in 1976.
Wilson attended Eastern Washington University in the late 1970s as a graduate student in the school's Master of Public Administration program.
He worked in several African countries, including Niger, South Africa and Burundi, and in the mid-1980s served on the congressional staffs of Sen. Al Gore, D-Tenn., and Rep. Tom Foley, D-Wash.
From 1988 to 1991, he was the second-ranking diplomat at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, during the run-up to the 1991 Gulf War.
Iraqi officials then issued an edict that anyone harboring foreigners was subject to execution.
Wilson appeared at a news briefing with a noose around his neck. "If the choice is to allow American citizens to be taken hostage or to be executed," he said, "I will bring my own f---ing rope."
Before U.S. military forces launched bombs on Baghdad, Wilson strolled around the White House grounds with President George H.W. Bush.
"He's asking about how the other side feels, what was it like in Iraq, what are the people like," Wilson said. "The human questions that you want your leaders to think before they commit to the violence that is war."
Wilson served as U.S. ambassador to Gabon and later as President Bill Clinton's director for African affairs at the National Security Council.
"Joe Wilson was a good man, an honorable public servant, and a true patriot," Clinton said Friday in a statement. "Throughout his long career as a diplomat, he worked tirelessly to achieve peace and security, defend human rights, and build a world where America and our partners could rise together."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Sparring line by line over a whistleblower's complaint, the White House on Friday confirmed a key detail from the unidentified CIA officer who has accused President Donald Trump of abusing the power of his office. At the same time, Trump insisted anew that his actions and words have been "perfect" and the complaint might well be the work of "a partisan operative."

The White House acknowledged that a record of the Trump phone call that is now at the center of the House impeachment inquiry had been sealed away in a highly classified system at the direction of Trump's National Security Council lawyers.

Separately, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway told reporters that the whistleblower "has protection under the law," something Trump himself had appeared to question earlier in the day. He suggested then that his accuser "isn't a whistleblower at all."

Still at issue is why the rough transcript of Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president was put on "lock down," in the words of the whistleblower. The CIA officer said that diverting the record in an unusual way was evidence that "White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired" in the conversation.

The complaint alleges that Trump used his office to "solicit interference from a foreign country" to help himself in next year's U.S. election. In the phone call, days after ordering a freeze to some military assistance for Ukraine, Trump prodded new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to dig for potentially damaging material on Democratic rival Joe Biden and volunteered the assistance of both his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and U.S. Attorney General William Barr.

As for the Democrats, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Friday framed the impeachment inquiry as a somber moment for a divided nation.

"This is no cause for any joy," Pelosi said on MSNBC's "Morning Joe," and she said she was praying for the president.

"I would say to Democrats and Republicans: We have to put country before party."

Pelosi refused to set a deadline for the probe but promised to act "expeditiously."

The House intelligence committee could draw members back to Washington next week. The panel with other committees jointly issued a subpoena on Friday to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for documents in the Ukraine matter.

At the White House, it was a senior administration official who acknowledged that the rough transcript of Trump's conversation with Ukraine's Zelenskiy had been moved to a highly classified system maintained by the National Security Council. The official was granted anonymity Friday to discuss sensitive matters.

White House attorneys had been made aware of concerns about Trump's comments on the call even before the whistleblower sent his allegations to the intelligence community's inspector general. Those allegations, made in mid-August, were released Thursday under heavy pressure from House Democrats.

All the while, Trump was keeping up his full-bore attack on the whistleblower and the unnamed "White House officials" cited in the complaint, drawing a warning from Pelosi against retaliation.

Late Thursday, Trump denounced people who might have talked to the whistleblower as "close to a spy" and suggested they engaged in treason, an act punishable by death. Then on Friday, he said the person was "sounding more and more like the so-called Whistleblower isn't a Whistleblower at all."

He also alleged without evidence that information in the complaint has been "proved to be so inaccurate," though none of the allegations have been demonstrated to be incorrect.

Pelosi told MSNBC, "I'm concerned about some of the president's comments about the whistleblower."

She said the House panels conducting the impeachment probe will make sure there's no retaliation against people who provided information in the case. On Thursday, House Democratic chairmen called Trump's comments "witness intimidation" and suggested efforts by him to interfere with the potential witness could be unlawful.

Trump's Friday comment questioning the whistleblower's status seemed to foreshadow a possible effort to argue that legal protection laws don't apply to the person, opening a new front in the president's defense, but Conway's statement seemed to make that less likely.

The intelligence community's inspector general found the whistleblower's complaint "credible" despite finding indications of the person's support for a different political candidate.

Legal experts said that by following proper procedures and filing a complaint with the government rather than disclosing the information to the media, the person is without question regarded as a whistleblower entitled to protections against being fired or criminally prosecuted.

"This person clearly followed the exact path he was supposed to follow," said Debra D'Agostino, a lawyer who represents whistleblowers. "There is no basis for not calling this person a whistleblower."

Lawyers say it also doesn't matter for the purposes of being treated as a whistleblower if all of the allegations are borne out as entirely true, or even if political motives or partisanship did factor into the decision to come forward.

"What a whistleblower needs to have is a reasonable belief that the information they're disclosing and complaining about could be a violation of a law, rule or regulation," said Eric Bachman, another Washington lawyer who represents whistleblowers. "They do not need to be certain that there is a violation. It does not need to be proven in a court of law that there is a violation."

Republicans were straining under the uncertainty of being swept up in the most serious test yet of their alliance with the Trump White House.

"We owe people to take it seriously," said Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., a onetime Trump rival who is now a member of the intelligence committee.

"Right now, I have more questions than answers," he said. "The complaint raises serious allegations, and we need to determine whether they're credible or not."

Fresh questions were raised late Thursday about how the White House and the Justice Department handled the whistleblower complaint.

White House and Justice Department attorneys were aware of the concerns about Trump's call with Zelenskiy before the complaint was filed, according to a U.S. official and a person familiar with the matter. The intelligence official initially filed a complaint about Trump's dealings with Ukraine with the CIA, which then alerted the White House and the Justice Department, before filing with the intelligence community's inspector general, a process that granted the individual more legal protection.

The person familiar with the matter, as well as another person with knowledge of the case, confirmed that the whistleblower was a CIA officer.

The Associated Press is publishing information about the whistleblower's background because the person's credibility is central to the impeachment inquiry into the president. The New York Times first reported that the individual was a CIA officer.

The U.S. official and the two people familiar with the matter spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

The whistleblower's attorney, Mark Zaid, said publishing details about the individual places the person in a dangerous situation, personally and professionally. The CIA referred questions to the inspector general.

Texto completo: If we are concerned about U.S. officials inappropriately threatening aid to Ukraine, then there are plenty of figures other than President Donald Trump who have some explaining to do.
It got almost no attention, but in May, CNN reported that Sens. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., Richard Durbin, D-Ill., and Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., wrote a letter to Ukraine's prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, expressing concern at the closing of four investigations they said were critical to the Mueller probe.
In the letter, they implied that their support for U.S. assistance to Ukraine was at stake. Describing themselves as "strong advocates for a robust and close relationship with Ukraine," the Democratic senators declared, "We have supported [the] capacity-building process and are disappointed that some in Kyiv appear to have cast aside these [democratic] principles to avoid the ire of President Trump," before demanding Mr. Lutsenko "reverse course and halt any efforts to impede cooperation with this important investigation."
So, it's OK for Democratic senators to encourage Ukraine to investigate Mr. Trump, but it's not OK for the president to allegedly encourage Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden?
And then there is Joe Biden. In 2016, the then-vice president threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees to Ukraine if the government did not fire the country's top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin. According to The New York Times, "Among those who had a stake in the outcome was Hunter Biden ... who at the time was on the board of an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch who had been in the sights of the fired prosecutor general."
The Washington Post reports that it is "unclear how seriously Shokin - who was under fire by U.S. and European officials for not taking a more aggressive posture toward corruption overall - was scrutinizing Burisma [Holdings] when he was forced out."
But what is clear is that Mr. Biden bragged about getting him fired, declaring last year: "I looked at them and said, 'I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money.' Well ... he got fired."
Last weekend, Mr. Biden told reporters, "I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings." That is flatly untrue. Hunter admitted in an interview with The New Yorker that his father expressed concern about the Burisma post at least once: "Dad said, 'I hope you know what you are doing,' and I said, 'I do.'"
Moreover, The New Yorker reports that, "In December 2015, as Joe Biden prepared to return to Ukraine, his aides braced for renewed scrutiny of Hunter's relationship with Burisma. Amos Hochstein, the Obama administration's special envoy for energy policy, raised the matter with Biden."
So, Mr. Biden was fully aware of his son's involvement with Burisma when he pressured Ukraine to fire the prosecutor in 2016. He should have known that his using U.S. aid as leverage to force the prosecutor's dismissal would create, at a bare minimum, the appearance of a conflict of interest.
On Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced that Congress will initiate a formal impeachment inquiry over the Ukraine episode, a move Joe Biden endorsed in a speech, declaring, "It's time for the Congress to fully investigate the conduct of this president." Such an investigation will be far more damaging for Mr. Biden than the president. It will keep the story of Mr. Biden's conflict of interest in the news through the 2020 election. Senate Republicans can demand that Hunter Biden testify, and can subpoena Obama White House aides to explain under oath what the vice president knew and when he knew it.
Put aside the prosecutor's firing. Hunter took the position with a Ukrainian natural gas company just a few weeks after his father visited Ukraine in 2014 to urge its government to increase its natural gas production. He had no expertise in Ukraine or natural gas. It will not just be Republicans calling this suspicious; nonpartisan experts in ethics law will testify that this a major conflict of interest.
And the focus will not just be on Ukraine but also how, as The Post reported, "for more than two decades, [Hunter's] professional work often tracked with his father's life in politics, from Washington to Ukraine to China."
While Senate Republicans will not remove Mr. Trump from office, Democratic primary voters might decide that Mr. Biden and his troubles are a distraction they do not need. The irony is the Democrats' investigation might do more to deny Mr. Biden the presidency than Mr. Trump.

Top Banker Set to Lead Wells Fargo

Texto completo: Wells Fargo has finally found someone willing to take the hardest job in banking.
The scandal-plagued bank, which had spent months searching for a new chief executive, announced on Friday that the BNY Mellon leader Charles W. Scharf had agreed to take the post.
The hiring of Mr. Scharf, 54, makes good on a promise by Wells Fargo's board this year to look outside the company for a leader who would help the bank break from its recent past. The previous chief executive -- an internal hire promoted after the worst scandal in the bank's history -- stepped down in March after lawmakers in Congress grilled him over problems still plaguing an institution that once enjoyed a sterling reputation.
Mr. Scharf, who previously ran Visa, will take over on Oct. 21. He'll try to rebuild trust with consumers and regulators that began to erode three years ago when Wells Fargo revealed it had opened millions of fake accounts in customers' names.
In a statement, Mr. Scharf said he felt "energized" to take on his new role, and acknowledged that the bank was "in the midst of fundamental change."
It will be a monumental task. Wells Fargo has been operating under growth restrictions imposed by its regulators early last year in an effort to get the bank to root out bad management practices. The scrutiny has not abated: The bank's previous chief executive, Timothy J. Sloan, resigned abruptly on March 28 after his punishing appearance in Congress.
"I am committed to fully engaging with all of our stakeholders, including regulators, customers, elected officials, investors and communities," Mr. Scharf said in a statement.
Before spending two years as chief executive of Bank of New York and four years as head of Visa, Mr. Scharf held numerous top roles on Wall Street. He helped oversee JPMorgan Chase's private investment arm and was chief executive of its retail financial services division. Earlier in his career, he was chief financial officer at Citigroup's investment banking business.
While Mr. Scharf has had to make changes at Bank of New York and Visa and has experience running JPMorgan's consumer-facing bank, he has never faced a turnaround job like this one.
"This is a real interesting career opportunity for him because of what it will do for his reputation if he is able to get his arms around what is happening at Wells," said Bert Ely, a banking consultant. "This is the challenge of a lifetime."
Wells Fargo was long the envy of the banking industry, able to avoid scandals that hit its competitors. But its reputation crumbled after the bank disclosed that employees had opened millions of accounts its customers had not requested. Regulators said many workers had felt pressured by a compensation policy that rewarded the opening of new accounts.
Wells Fargo fired more than 5,000 employees over the account scandal, but it was not the only blemish on the bank's reputation. It was also accused of forcing customers to carry unnecessary car insurance and charging improper mortgage fees, and employees told The New York Times this year that they still felt pressure to squeeze extra money out of customers.
It's not clear the bank has even identified the full extent of its problems.
In August, The Times reported that Wells Fargo was continuing to charge some of its customers fees even after it had told them that their accounts were closed. That prompted Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, to call for a new round of investigations. Wells Fargo said it had begun an extensive review of its account-closing practices.
Kenneth Leon, an analyst at the Wall Street research firm CFRA, said Mr. Scharf's first order of business was likely to be deciding which members of Wells Fargo's senior leadership team to keep and which to replace. Mr. Leon said he expected that sort of change to be announced within three months.
"It would be standard fare for the new chief executive to make those changes sooner rather than later," he said.
Mr. Scharf's initial pay package, which includes a base salary of $ 2.5 million and a $ 5 million cash incentive, could be worth as much as $ 27 million in cash and stock. That's in the middle of the pay range set by his peers at other large United States banks. Last year, JPMorgan's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, took home $ 31 million while David Solomon, Goldman Sachs's new head, got $ 23 million.
Mr. Sloan, the previous chief executive, was paid more than $ 150 million over the course of his last eight years at the bank and received a retirement package worth about $ 24 million.
There were signs that Wells Fargo's board had sweetened the deal for Mr. Scharf. The bank said he would remain in New York rather than work at its San Francisco headquarters.
Wells Fargo's search for a leader was not easy. The bank needed someone willing to take on a serious turnaround project while enduring greater-than-normal scrutiny by regulators.
At times during the search, the most likely candidate seemed to be C. Allen Parker, the general counsel, who was made interim chief executive when Mr. Sloan left. But that would have required going back on the board's initial statement that it would look outside the organization, which was an apparent acknowledgment that promoting from within -- as the bank did when Mr. Sloan replaced John G. Stumpf after the fake-account scandal -- was not enough.
In a sign of the particular interest that Wells Fargo engenders, the bank's main regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, said it had informed the bank in writing that it did not object to the choice of Mr. Scharf.
That disclosure was rare. A spokesman for the regulator, Bryan Hubbard, said the agency's policy was not to comment on "specific supervisory matters pertaining to particular institutions."

Someone blew a whistle. It's now the hottest tune in D.C.

Texto completo: In Washington, there is no figure quite as recognizable as the anonymous figure. They've written best-selling books ("Primary Colors"); been primary sources for both history-altering stories (Deep Throat) and juicy tales of palace intrigue ( This account is the result of more than two dozen interviews ); and one has even written a viral op-ed in the New York Times about resisting President Trump from within the administration.
Yet, in the annals of anonymity, nothing seems quite as fraught, quite as intriguing or quite as dangerous as the whistleblower. On Thursday, the day after Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) and his colleagues on the House Intelligence Committee read a complaint regarding Trump's communications with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - ("very well written," Schiff opined) - the whistleblower's report was declassified and gobbled up by the masses. The president raged behind closed doors that it appeared to be a work of spycraft bordering on "treason," and the New York Times published hints about who, exactly, this person might be.
For once, this doesn't feel like just another version of D.C.'s favorite parlor game of Guess Who.
"It's important that we protect the identity of this whistleblower," Rep. Katie Porter, a freshman Democrat from California, said in a hallway interview.
"That's what we hope to do," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a news conference. "Protect the whistleblower."
"We will do everything we can to protect this courageous whistleblower," tweeted Schiff, who said his committee is trying to figure out a way for this person to testify.
"What I'd like to see with the whistleblower is," said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), "who this person is."
Whoever this person is, they've put Washington in a tizzy. The whistleblower alleged, among other things, that Trump had pressured the president of Ukraine to "initiate or continue an investigation into the activities of former Vice President" - and potential 2020 election opponent - "Joseph Biden and his son, Hunter Biden," and led the White House to release a summary of Trump's call with the Ukrainian president, which, oddly, seemed to back up parts of the complaint.
Before the whistleblower, Democrats couldn't even agree whether they were on the path to impeachment. After, Pelosi called Democrats together for an all-hands meeting and announced her support for an impeachment inquiry, which, according to the six committees already investigating Trump, was already underway.
"I think she is saying full steam ahead on an impeachment inquiry," Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington, said coming out of that Tuesday meeting. "Obviously we're in an impeachment inquiry, but there has been some confusion around exactly what that means."
What does it mean for Rep. Brad Sherman, a Democrat from California who introduced articles of impeachment more than two years ago?
"There is no great joy," he said. For all the celebrating on Resistance Twitter, and all caps diatribes from @RealDonaldTrump ("THE GREATEST SCAM IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN POLITICS!"), politicians on both sides of the aisle did their best to remain subdued. No talk about excitement from Democrats, just lip-biting grimaces and words like "sober," "somber" and "sad."
"It is not a matter of personal vindication," Sherman said. "There is no 'I told you so.' "
It would be a little early for that. There would still be time for plenty of plot twists before the end, if this were a film. And, according to Republicans, it is.
"We've seen this movie before," said Rep. Michael R. Turner, a Republican from Ohio.
"Many Americans have seen this movie too many times," said Rep. Brad Wenstrup, another Republican from Ohio.
The Ohioans were speaking from behind the dais Thursday at an Intelligence Committee hearing featuring the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, who handled the whistleblower's complaint. Of concern to the Republicans was their belief that Democrats were just continuing their singular quest to ruin the president and have now enlisted the help of an unnamed, unreliable narrator.
"The complaint relied on hearsay evidence," said Rep. Devin Nunes of California, the highest-ranking Republican on the committee. "The whistleblower displayed arguable, political bias against Trump."
It is true that in the report, the whistleblower admitted to not being "a direct witness to most of the events described" and that the inspector general found an "arguable political bias on the part of a rival candidate." But that didn't change the fact that the whistleblower - who was informed of "various facts" by "more than half a dozen U.S. officials" - provided a report that the inspector general found both "urgent" and "credible." But when the person at the center of a scandal is a blank canvas, politicians can try to paint him or her however they'd like.
So Republicans paint the whistleblower as a "partisan" with "second-hand" information or, worse, as a joke.
Rep. Steve Stivers, an oft-grinning Republican from Ohio known for his easy laughs and frequent jokes, whipped out a cellphone with a picture of President Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky in the Oval Office.
"Here's some breaking news!" he cracked on Thursday, holding up his cellphone for others to see near the House floor.
On the picture, the meme under Clinton read: "Everyone remembers my whistleblower."
He roared with laughter at people's appalled reactions.
Democrats don't think any of this is funny.
"Director, you don't believe the whistleblower is a political hack, do you?" Schiff asked Maguire.
"I don't know who the whistleblower is, Mr. Chairman," Maguire answered. "I've done my utmost to protect his anonymity."
Not everyone has been keen on keeping the secret. Rep. Dan Crenshaw, a freshman Republican from Texas and former Navy SEAL, said he's not so sure this whistleblower is actually a whistleblower.
"Not by the traditional definition," he said. When most of us think of a whistleblower, he said, we think of someone who was asked to do something illegal, refused and then sounded the alarm.
"I have an intelligence background, so I know what an intelligence analyst writes like," he continued. "This sounds like that, like they did their own investigation. And then developed their own report. So you have to ask yourself, is that really a whistleblower?"
Around the time Crenshaw posed this question, standing alone outside a Capitol Hill office building, the president was in a meeting with staffers and families of the delegation at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, with a similar theory.
"I want to know who's the person, who's the person who gave the whistleblower the information? Because that's close to a spy," Trump said, according to audio obtained by the Los Angeles Times. "You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now."
Just an hour after the Times published its report on these not-so-veiled threats from the president (one form of punishment for treason, historically, has been death), it published another bombshell - reporting that the whistleblower worked for the CIA and other details that could potentially identify him.
For more than a year now, the Times has managed to keep the author of its anonymous op-ed a secret. It's possible that the whistleblower won't be so lucky.
"Maybe the two are the same person," a Republican staffer in the Senate said. After requesting anonymity, of course.

Texto completo: CAIRO - The plainclothes security men stood every few yards along the bridge over the Nile, T-shirts tight across their muscled chests, guns at their hips, stopping young men to ask for identification and look through their phones. They were delivering a message that did not need to be spoken aloud.
Since a handful of surprise protests against President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi flared around Egypt last weekend, the largest since he came to power in 2014, the government has tightened its grip, arresting nearly 2,000 Egyptians, packing Cairo and other protest hot spots with security personnel and blocking news websites.
It is a crackdown harsh even by the standards of the el-Sissi era, when Egyptian jails have swollen with his political opponents, elections are predetermined and. opposition has been all but silenced, making shows of dissent extremely rare.
But no one knows if it will be enough to deter a second round of demonstrations that the protests' original instigator, a self-proclaimed whistleblower living in exile, has called for Friday.
"I just couldn't help myself. I had to protest, I had to let out my anger," said Mostafa, 20, a student who attended the protest in Cairo last Friday and, like most of those interviewed, declined to give his full name for fear of being arrested. "I'm sick of living in a fascist state, of being repressed politically and economically. These were supposed to be the best years of my life."
But he planned to stay away from any protests this Friday and was urging people he knew to do the same, afraid they might get arrested.
"I see a black future, even if a revolution erupts," he said. "Last Friday was the first time I truly felt scared. I don't know if that just means I've grown up, or if the situation really is that terrifying."
Egyptians interviewed this week were on edge. They said they were struggling under el-Sissi's economic policies, which have left a third of Egyptians in poverty, according to a July report by the country's official statistics agency. Yet they dreaded a return to the turmoil that many remember from protests that toppled their leaders in 2011 and 2013. Some were fed up with el-Sissi's zero-tolerance government, yet terrified of defying it.
Some young dissenters and Egypt analysts contended that no matter the turnout this Friday, the fact that people dared to chant for el-Sissi's ouster at all, at great personal risk, had deflated the president's appearance of absolute control.
"Whatever happens, the train has left the station already," said Ali Mohamed, 19, a protester whose parents took him to participate in the 2011 protests as a child. "It's been revealed that people are against Sissi. They're just repressed."
Even veteran opposition leaders, however, were wary of a street uprising. Egyptians have brought down two presidents in the last decade - Hosni Mubarak in 2011, and Mohammed Morsi, the country's first democratically elected leader, in 2013 - only to end up ruled by a general whose government is more repressive than Mubarak's.
"I think we need to learn our lesson that it's not enough just to call for the removal of the president without knowing the alternative," said Khaled Dawoud, a journalist and former head of Egypt's liberal Constitution Party, in an interview Saturday.
"There's definitely wide dissatisfaction, but we don't know what the alternative is. I'm not going to support 'get rid of Sissi' or 'get out Sissi' - what am I getting afterward?"
His caution made no difference. On Wednesday, a prominent lawyer reported that Dawoud had been arrested.

Texto completo: Tuberculosis struck 10 million people worldwide in 2017, killing 1.6 million of them - a toll greater than that of HIV, malaria, measles and Ebola combined. TB is the leading infectious killer around the globe; nearly 1.8 billion people are carrying the bacterium that causes the disease.
The world is sorely in need of new ways to prevent TB, not just treat it. Drugs to stave off the infection do exist, but the monthslong regimens are difficult and people often do not finish the prescribed courses.
That may soon change: A new drug course, lasting just one month, is just as effective as longer regimens at preventing TB, scientists reported earlier this year. The results have left experts hoping for new progress against a disease that has been an intractable enemy for centuries.
"I think it's a moment of really extraordinary promise," said Mike Frick, co-lead for TB at Treatment Action Group, an advocacy organization.
Among the plagues sweeping developing countries, TB has often taken a back seat to competing and urgent priorities, especially HIV. (The two are linked: HIV patients account for 1 in 5 TB deaths worldwide.)
In August, the Food and Drug Administration approved a new drug to treat the deadliest strain of TB - but it was the first approval for a TB drug in more than 40 years. Diagnostic tests for the infection are not sensitive and mostly rely on sputum, which many sick people struggle to produce.
And prevention? "It's really downplayed and it's ignored, and it's ignored to a degree that is scandalous," said Dr. Richard Chaisson, professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
One challenge is identifying those who should receive preventive drugs. The drugs are the clear choice for the most vulnerable groups: people with HIV; people whose immune systems are compromised because they take biologic drugs for Crohn's disease, arthritis or other diseases; and young children and others who share a home with someone infected.
Protection for these groups should last at least five years, studies suggest.
But 1 in 3 people worldwide harbor the TB bacteria, and just 1 in 10 will go on to develop the disease. Who among them should be treated?
"The biggest issue has been to identify those 10%," said Dr. Eliud Wand-walo, senior coordinator for TB at the nonprofit Global Fund. "We don't have any good indicator to show you which of these people who are infected might progress and become sick."
For many people who are healthy, or who simply feel healthy, the drugs have been a tough sell.
For decades, the standard course has been an antibiotic called isoniazid that kills the bacteria causing TB only when they are replicating. The drug must be taken daily for nine months, in the hope of catching the bacteria as they multiply, and it can cause numbness, nausea and fever. Isoniazid also can cause liver toxicity, so people taking it are advised not to drink alcohol for the entire nine months.
"Traditionally, completion rates have been very poor," said Alison Grant, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.
An alternative emerged in March, when Chaisson and his colleagues published a study in The New England Journal of Medicine showing that a regimen of isoniazid and rifapentine, taken daily for one month, is as effective at preventing TB, safer and more likely to be completed than the traditional nine-month course of isoniazid.
The World Health Organization met to review this new regimen in July and is expected to endorse it later this year. The study was conducted only in people infected with HIV, however, and it is likely that the WHO will approve the regimen only for those patients.
Chaisson thinks preventive drugs should be given to a far larger population.
"If we had an intervention for HIV that reduces mortality by 37%, the WHO would have an emergency meeting and it would be recommended for uptake in the entire world," he said. "But when it's for TB, people just sort of shrug."
"It's just a stolid world of never-changing practices - slow to adopt, slow to change, slow to evolve," Chaisson added.
Cost is another hurdle. The one and three-month courses both rely on rifapentine, made by Sanofi. In 2013, after a yearlong advocacy campaign to lower the costs, Sanofi dropped the price of rifapentine in the three-month course from $71 to $32.
The new one-month course requires more rifapentine overall than the three-month regimen, and so is more expensive. Advocates and global health organizations are in intense negotiations with Sanofi to lower the cost to just $15 for the entire one-month treatment course.
At least two companies are said to be developing generic versions, which also may bring down the cost. Without a lower price, donors like the federal government's President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief are unlikely to support the new course.
South Africa has shown what political will can accomplish, said Dr. Gavin Churchyard, a TB specialist based in Johannesburg. The country once had an abysmal TB preventive therapy program, with just a few thousand people taking the pills.
But in 2008, after Pakishe Aaron Motsoaledi, then the country's health minister, made TB prevention a national priority, the numbers began to rise dramatically. By 2011, 350,000 people were enrolled in preventive therapy. Today, South Africa still has the world's largest TB preventive therapy program, Churchyard said.
Chaisson did a "back-of-the-enve-lope" calculation, published in 2017 in the Lancet Global Health, suggesting that if such preventive therapy had been rolled out worldwide, several million deaths could have been averted.
"It makes the deaths that they incurred because of AIDS denialism in South Africa look so small," Churchyard said. "Really, our neglect has cost lives, unfortunately. And it's time - just as there was a time to end AIDS denialisrn, it's time to end the TB denialisrn."

Harvard endowment underwhelms again

Texto completo: Are you satisfied with how your investments are doing? If not, you've got some good company.
Harvard University, whose $40.9 billion endowment is the flushest in the academic world, said its fund returned 6.5 percent in the fiscal year ended June 30.
The performance lagged the Standard & Poor's 500 index, which had a total return including dividends of 10.4 percent for the period, and the Vanguard Balanced Index fund, which puts about 60 percent of its assets in stocks and 40 percent in bonds, which returned 8.8 percent. The Cambridge school also trailed New England rivals MIT (8.8 percent) and Dartmouth (7.5 percent), but beat Yale University for the first time since fiscal year 2010. Yale said Friday its fund rose 5.7 percent.
“I am encouraged by the progress our team has made to date," said N.P. “Narv" Narvekar, CEO of Harvard Management Co., who is about halfway through a five-year restructuring effort aimed at improving performance by streamlining the endowment and how it is managed. “But we are mindful that there is much left to accomplish in the years ahead to resolve legacy issues and position the endowment for long-term success," he said in a statement.
Harvard Management, which oversees the endowment, will release details on the fund's performance next month as part of the university's financial report. Last year's return was hurt by weakness in its emerging market and natural resources portfolios, a person with knowledge of the matter told the Globe.
Harvard's fund, once a reliable top performer, was crushed during the financial crisis and has since posted mixed results. Narvekar was recruited from Columbia University at the end of 2016 to turn things around.
Among the changes he has made: reducing Harvard Management's reliance on highly paid internal specialists, allocating more money to outside investment firms, and trimming some asset classes while adding to others.
It's a complicated undertaking because of the size of the portfolio, which rivals the largest hedge funds in the world, and its use of private investments, which can take a long time to sell compared with publicly traded securities.
“Narv has done as good as could be expected," said Charles Skorina, a longtime tracker of endowments whose firm recruits instititional investment executives. “He is simplifying the portfolio, which was spread into everything all over the world. At the same time, he's trying to make decent new investments. It all takes time."
Over the past several years, Harvard's endowment has provided more than one-third of the university's operating budget, or about $1.8 billion annually. But with a lackluster average investment return of 5.7 percent over the past five years, administrators have had to tightly control spending to stay within their budgets.
Moreover, Harvard, is one of about three dozen wealthy schools that will start paying a new federal 1.4 percent excise tax on investment income this fall. The levy was imposed on private school endowments with more than $500,000 in assets per student as part of the Republican-sponsored tax cut of 2017.
The increase in Harvard's endowment assets, from $39.2 billion in the previous year, reflects investment gains and gifts. The fund returned 10 percent in fiscal 2018.
Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated when Harvard Management planned to announce the fund's return.

Complaint alleges White House cover-up

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- White House officials took extraordinary steps to "lock down" information about President Donald Trump's summertime phone call with the president of Ukraine, even moving the transcript to a secret computer system, a whistleblower alleges in a politically explosive complaint that accuses the administration of a wide-ranging cover-up.

The whistleblower, in a 9-page document released Thursday, provides many new details about the phone call in which Trump repeatedly spoke of how much the U.S. had aided Ukraine and encouraged new President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to help investigate political rival Joe Biden and his son.

Accusations of efforts to pressure the leader of a foreign nation to dig for dirt on a potential 2020 Trump rival are now at the heart of a House impeachment inquiry against the president. The whistleblower's official complaint alleges a concerted White House effort to suppress the transcript of the call and describes a shadow campaign of diplomacy by the president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani that worried some senior administration officials.

"In the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to ‘lock down'

all the records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced as is customary by the White House situation room," the complaint says.

The previously secret document, with its detail and clear narrative, is likely to accelerate the impeachment process and put more pressure on Trump to rebut its core contentions and on his fellow Republicans to defend him or not. It also provides a road map for Democrats to seek corroborating witnesses and evidence , which will complicate the president's efforts to characterize the findings as those of a lone partisan out to undermine him.

In response, Trump threatened "the person" who he said gave information to the whistleblower as he spoke at a private event in New York with staff from the U.S. mission to the United Nations.

"I want to know who's the person, who's the person who gave the whistleblower the information? Because that's close to a spy," Trump said. "You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now."

The remarks were reported by The Los Angeles Times and The New York Times.

On his Twitter account, Trump insisted the entire controversy is political: "The Democrats are trying to destroy the Republican Party and all that it stands for. Stick together, play their game and fight hard Republicans. Our country is at stake." His tweet was in all capital letters.

Under pressure from House Democrats, the White House a day earlier released a rough transcript of the phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president. In it, Trump prodded Zelenskiy to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a potential 2020 election foe, and Biden's son Hunter, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.

But the complaint released Thursday offered a broader picture of what was happening in the White House and the administration at the time. In the aftermath of the call, according to the whistleblower, White House lawyers were concerned "they had witnessed the president abuse his office for personal gain," the complaint says.

The complaint has revived questions about the activities of Giuliani, who it says alarmed government officials by circumventing "national security decision making processes." Giuliani, a Trump loyalist who represented the president in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, repeatedly communicated with advisers of Ukraine's president in the days after the phone call.

The House intelligence committee released a redacted version of the whistleblower complaint Thursday ahead of testimony from Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence. Maguire acknowledged that the complaint alleged serious wrongdoing by the president but said it was not his role to judge whether the allegations were credible or not.

Maguire said he was unfamiliar with any other whistleblower complaint in American history that "touched on such complicated and sensitive issues." He praised the whistleblower as having acted honorably, said he recognized the complaint as immediately sensitive and important and insisted the White House did not direct him to withhold it from Congress.

"I believe that everything in this matter here is totally unprecedented," he said.

In the complaint, the anonymous whistleblower says that he or she was not present for Trump's Ukraine call, multiple White House officials shared consistent details about it.

Those officials told the whistleblower that "this was ‘not the first time' under this administration that a presidential transcript was placed into this codeword-level system solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive -- rather than national security sensitive -- information," the complaint said.

In this case, the complaint said, the officials told the whistleblower they were "directed" by White House lawyers to remove the electronic transcript from the computer system in which such transcripts are typically stored for coordination, finalization and distribution to Cabinet-level officials.

"This set of actions underscored to me that White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call," the official complaint said.

"If this was all so innocent," Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said in reaction, "why did so many officials in the White House, in the Justice Department and elsewhere make such large efforts to prevent it from being made public?"

The complaint also says multiple U.S. officials reported that Giuliani traveled to Madrid one week after the call to meet with one of Zelenskiy's advisers, and that the meeting was characterized as a follow-up to the telephone conversation between the two leaders

House Republicans largely steered clear of discussing the substance of the call during Thursday's hearing, spending more time criticizing Democrats than Trump.

One exception was Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio, who said, "Concerning that conversation, I want to say to the president, This is not OK. That conversation is not OK. It's disappointing to the American people."

Late in the day, Maguire went behind closed doors to speak to the Senate intelligence committee.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday endorsed an impeachment investigation in light of the Ukraine revelations. The president, she said, "betrayed his oath of office, our national security and the integrity" of America's elections.

The unidentified whistleblower submitted the complaint to Michael Atkinson, the U.S. government's intelligence inspector general, in August. Maguire then blocked release of the complaint to Congress, citing issues of presidential privilege and saying the complaint did not deal with an "urgent concern." Atkinson disagreed, but said his hands were tied.

The House and Senate intelligence committees have invited the whistleblower to testify, but it is uncertain whether the person will appear.

Texto completo: President Trump loves to talk tough, but it just may be that residents of his own hometown got under his skin Thursday.
He went off on a maniacal rant while addressing U.S. diplomats at a Midtown hotel, one of several stops punctuated by outraged New Yorkers with protest signs calling for the president's impeachment and middle fingers directed at the notoriously thin-skinned commander-in-chief.
His morning started with a motorcade ride from Trump Tower on Fifth Ave. and 57th St. to the InterContinental New York Barclay just six blocks away, to meet with members of the U.S. Mission to the United Nations as the UN General Assembly continued.
Trump immediately went into a tirade against the whistleblower, calling him "almost a spy" and fumed that he wants him exposed.
"I want to know who's the person, who's the person who gave the whistleblower the information? Because that's close to a spy," he reportedly said during the closed-door session. "You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now."
He also threw in some digs at one of his favorite targets, the news reporters, whom he called "scum" and "crooked."
Trump was speaking to about 50 diplomats and their families, according to The New York Times, hich noted some of them laughed at the president's off-the-rails remarks.
The polemic continued a pattern of Trump outlandishly - and baselessly - calling perceived opponents "traitors." He used the term to smear ex-FBI Director James Comey and former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, among others.
Contradicting Trump, acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire told the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday that the whistleblower "acted in good faith," "did the right thing" and "followed the law every step of the way."
After blowing off a lot of steam in front of U.S. diplomats, the president made for ritzy Cipriani for a fund-raiser. Along the way, a handful of protesters held up signs with slogans like "Impeach" and "Trump lies, democracy dies," according to a White House pool report.
It wasn't all anti-Trump vitriol, though.
An anonymous fan left an adoring message near the restaurant with the words "We love Mr. Trump" on a pizza box, according to the White House pool.
The Trump campaign said it raised $3 million at Cipriani, where Donald Trump Jr.'s gal pal Kimberly Guillfoyle was seen in the doorway as Trump's motorcade headed to the helicopter pad near Wall Street. Several angry New Yorkers gave Trump the bird along the way.
Trump took the Marine One chopper to Kennedy Airport, from where he flew back to the White House.

Texto completo: He shared a Pulitzer for detailing how George McGovern's initial running mate in 1972 had undergone electroshock therapy for depression.
Robert S. Boyd, a journalist who shared a Pulitzer Prize for uncovering evidence that Senator Thomas F. Eagleton had undergone electroshock therapy for depression, a revelation that compelled Senator George S. McGovern to jettison Mr. Eagleton as his Democratic running mate for vice president in 1972, died on Friday in Philadelphia. He was 91.
The cause was congestive heart failure, his son Tim Boyd said.
The scoop, by Mr. Boyd and a colleague at the Knight Ridder newspaper chain, Clark Hoyt, was based on a tip from a McGovern supporter, a friend of a doctor who had treated Mr. Eagleton and who feared his medical history would be leaked closer to the election, when the revelation might be even more damaging.
"The available evidence at the time indicated that, under stress, he was prone to incapacitating depression," Mr. Hoyt, who was later the public editor of The New York Times, said of Mr. Eagleton by email. "Can you imagine a president facing an international crisis suddenly unable to function?"
Mr. Hoyt and Mr. Boyd flew to South Dakota, Mr. McGovern's home state, to present McGovern campaign officials with a two-page memo detailing the reporters' findings and to give the campaign a chance to respond.
"It was the only fair and decent thing to do," Mr. Boyd told The Harvard Crimson in 1999.
But on July 25, 1972, Mr. Eagleton, a Democrat from Missouri, pre-empted the journalists' report before it could be published by announcing at a news conference that he had been hospitalized three times for "nervous exhaustion and fatigue" in the 1960s. Mr. Boyd and Mr. Hoyt published their findings after Mr. Eagleton's announcement, and in greater detail.
Mr. McGovern insisted that he remained "1,000 percent" committed to Mr. Eagleton. But on Aug. 1, Mr. Eagleton withdrew from the Democratic ticket. He was replaced by R. Sargent Shriver, the Peace Corps founder and Kennedy in-law.
Mr. McGovern lost in a landslide to President Richard M. Nixon.
Though Mr. Eagleton himself, in effect, broke the story before Mr. Boyd and Mr. Hoyt could, the reporters were awarded the Pulitzer Prize for national reporting in 1973, inspiring one cynic, quoted in Davis Merritt's "Public Journalism and Public Life: Why Telling the News Is Not Enough" (1998), to observe that it was "the first time anybody ever won a Pulitzer for a story they didn't write."
Mr. Boyd, who joined the Knight Washington bureau in 1960 and was the bureau chief for 20 years, was admired by colleagues and competitors alike for breaking journalistic ground.
In 1961, he and Tad Szulc of The Times were the only two reporters who accompanied Walter Reuther, the president of the United Auto Workers, to Cuba when he was sent there by the White House to negotiate a prisoner exchange after the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion. The reporters were given a tour of the scene of the fighting by Fidel Castro.
In 1970, Mr. Boyd witnessed the start of the secret American bombing campaign of Cambodia during the Vietnam War. Two years later, he was among the reporters who accompanied Nixon on his historic trip to China.
Mr. Boyd became a science writer in 1993 and Mr. Hoyt succeeded him as the Washington bureau chief.
Robert Skinner Boyd, who was descended from Scottish nobility, was born on Jan. 11, 1928, in Chicago. His father, Alden Work Boyd, was a foreign aid officer and New York department store executive. His mother, Mary Althea (Skinner) Boyd, was a librarian who raised Robert after she and his father divorced.
Mr. Boyd graduated from Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., in 1945, and then enrolled in Harvard. After hitches in the Merchant Marine and the Army, he graduated with bachelor's and master's degrees in ancient languages in 1949, but then shifted his career goal, from continuing as a linguistics scholar to joining the Foreign Service.
Recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency, he was assigned to the Swiss Desk, but became frustrated by the secrecy. He left in 1953 for journalism jobs in Louisiana and Michigan before landing at The Detroit Free Press, part of the Knight newspapers chain.
His first marriage, to Gloria Paulsen, ended in divorce. In 1983, he married Ann Cullingworth, who survives him along with their daughter, Hollis McLaughlin; four children from his first marriage, Peter, Andrew and Tim Boyd and Susan Allan; two stepchildren, Jennifer Lauchlan and Harry Rust V; 13 grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.

G.O.P. Governor Breaks Ranks To Back Inquiry

Texto completo: Mr. Scott, a moderate from Vermont who has broken with President Trump in the past, said he hoped the House would go "wherever the facts lead."
Gov. Phil Scott of Vermont on Thursday endorsed the impeachment inquiry against President Trump, becoming the first Republican governor to do so.
Mr. Scott's announcement, at a news conference, was carefully calibrated. He did not say that he believed Mr. Trump should be impeached, much less removed from office. He said only that Congress should examine the full whistle-blower report, and that it was appropriate for the House to proceed with the inquiry that Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Tuesday.
"I think the inquiry is important, yes, and where it leads from here is going to be driven by the facts that are established," he said.
His remarks at the news conference mirrored a statement his office released beforehand, in which he said he supported the opening of an inquiry but also added: "Most realize impeachment is a very serious issue and should not be taken lightly or abused. Congress has a solemn responsibility to every American to fulfill its role in our government system of checks and balances. It is my hope they will be objective and let their work take them wherever the facts lead, and they will be transparent with the American people every step of the way."
A spokeswoman for Mr. Scott said the governor was not available for an interview Thursday afternoon, but she emphasized the distinction between supporting impeachment and supporting the inquiry.
"As the governor has said, he's not predetermining the outcome of the inquiry, which could find there is no cause to move forward," the spokeswoman, Rebecca Kelley, said in an email.
Yet this stance, limited as it is, is noteworthy when most other Republicans are circling the wagons around the president. Even other moderate Republican governors, like Charlie Baker of Massachusetts and Larry Hogan of Maryland, have stopped short of endorsing the impeachment inquiry, though Mr. Baker did call on Congress to investigate Mr. Trump's actions.
"It's a deeply disturbing situation and circumstance, and I think the proper role and responsibility for Congress at this point is to investigate it and get to the bottom of it," Mr. Baker said in Boston on Thursday. He did not use the word "impeachment" or directly address Ms. Pelosi's decision to open a formal inquiry.
Based on public statements and a New York Times survey, not one of the nearly 200 House Republicans supports the impeachment inquiry. (Fifty-five have said nothing either way.) Representative Justin Amash of Michigan, a former Republican who left the party in July and is now an independent, is the only non-Democrat in the House who supports it.
In news conferences and on Twitter, top Republicans have staunchly defended Mr. Trump and accused Democrats of putting partisanship above country.
Mr. Scott has often departed from the party line, though, especially when it comes to Mr. Trump.
He denounced the president's calls in July for four House members -- all women of color and all United States citizens, three of them native-born -- to "go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came." He has criticized Mr. Trump's climate, trade and immigration policies, and, almost exactly a year ago this week, urged a more thorough investigation of sexual assault allegations against Brett M. Kavanaugh before the Senate confirmed him to the Supreme Court.
Last year, Mr. Scott also defied fellow Republicans by signing a package of gun control measures after the massacre in Parkland, Fla. He nonetheless won re-election by a large margin in Vermont, which is one of the nation's bluest states.
Jonathan Martin contributed reporting.

Santa Anita faces existential questions as fall meet opens

Texto completo: ARCADIA — Santa Anita opens its 23-day fall meet Friday with many questions to answer, and the future of horse racing in Southern California may be at stake.
As Santa Anita opens with a nine-race program, including three graded stakes races, horse owners, trainers and the operators of Santa Anita have bigger questions than which horse runs fastest.
— Will it be a safer meet than the winter-spring season from December through June, when 30 horses died either in morning workouts or during afternoon racing?
— Will Hall of Fame trainer Jerry Hollendorfer, banned from all race tracks owned by the Stronach Group since June 22, be allowed to race horses at any time during the meet?
— Is the horse population in Southern California large enough to allow the track to follow through on its plan to hold four-day race weeks, as opposed to the three-day schedule track officials were forced to adopt during the final portion of the spring meet?
— Will racing fans stay away, from both the track and the betting windows, like happened during Del Mar’s 36-day summer meet that ended Sept. 2? Del Mar enjoyed a very safe meet, but a hangover from Santa Anita’s troubles hurt its business.
— What kind of spotlight will come with the Breeders’ Cup on Nov. 1-2? Horse racing’s biggest event also raises the pressure on Santa Anita to run a safe meet.
One thing is perfectly clear, and carries no question marks: This is the most important meet in the track’s history.
“For what’s at stake, I think absolutely (it’s the most important),” said Aidan Butler, the new acting executive director of California racing for Santa Anita’s parent company, the Stronach Group. “There are a lot of eye balls on Santa Anita, both on the positive and the negative. I think we need to put our best foot forward and make sure things are done better than they’ve ever been done historically in any country.
“The way I look at it, if this many people are interested, let’s show ’em what horse racing can do. Let’s show ’em how good horse racing, when done right, truly is.”
California governor Gavin Newsom is watching closely. He issued a scathing review of horse racing when he met with reporters from the New York Times this week.
“What happened last year was unacceptable, and all of the excuses be damned,” he told the Times. “We own that going into the next season, and we’re going to have to do something about it.
“I’ll tell you, talk about a sport whose time is up unless they reform. That’s horse racing. Incredible abuses to these precious animals and the willingness to just spit these animals out and literally take their lives is a disgrace.”
The 42-year-old Butler, a native of Great Britain who came to the Stronach Group from a Toronto law firm in 2018 and assumed his new position in early August, says he sees the need for horse racing to adapt and not conduct business as usual.
“Just because things back in the day were done a certain way and were acceptable does not mean they’ll be acceptable in today’s day and age,” he said.
For example, he cited the days when a racing fatality was treated as back-page news. The nightmare at Santa Anita has changed all of that.
“The way I actually look at it is, if a horse gets injured, everything that happened around that horse, what happened, why did it go on, that needs to be addressed, needs to be looked at,” Butler said. “This is a very fast-paced, active sport and accidents do happen. But that being said, transparency I think will set us all free. I hate to say back in the old days no one cared, well no one cared about a lot of stuff going back a few years.
“There are so many eyeballs on us now that it makes everybody wan to be better. I think if we’re going to try to grow the sport — and I’m not here to keep the status quo, I’m here to try and grow the sport — if we’re going to do that, we need to get confidence back, show (the sport) is as good and safe as can possibly be.”
Thoroughbred owner Jon Lindo is taking a wait-and-see approach, while agreeing that this is Santa Anita’s most important meet ever.
“I think it’s huge,” he said. “Right now, Santa Anita has to earn back the trust and the confidence of not only the horsemen, the owners and trainers, but the fans and the general public. The messages sent during that last meet, that was so confrontational, with the new management team in place we need to see if it’s one that everyone can work with toward a common goal.
“I mean, if this goes the wrong way, we could be out of business. That’s how important it is. It’s a short meet and unfortunately I think we’re all watching, not because we want to see the races, but we just want to see this thing go smoothly. They’ve got to earn my trust back.”
Two-time Kentucky Derby-winning trainer Doug O’Neill is taking an optimistic view.
“After the success of Del Mar (no fatalities during live racing), I can speak on the behalf of the majority of the horsemen that we’re real excited to continue it and have a real great Santa Anita,” he said. “There’s no reason why we shouldn’t.”
Is this Santa Anita’s most important meet ever?
“I haven’t thought of it in those terms,” O’Neill said, “but it’s just real important that we all work together and continue to work together, have a good open dialogue and realize we need to share in all the great times and share in all the accidental stuff.
“From what I can see, I really like the way Santa Anita is going into the meet and we’ll know more as we get going. I know we’re all optimistic that we’re going to have a heck of a meet.”
But that doesn’t mean there is no anxiety in the executive offices at Santa Anita this week. Even Del Mar officials admitted to some nervousness on the eve of their pivotal meet.
“Am I a little bit apprehensive? Of course,” Butler said. “I’ve got a few butterflies because I want everything to go as well as it should. But if preparation and hard work and having the right people around (means anything), my confidence level is pretty good.”
The Hollendorfer situation is still under review. The 73-year-old trainer with more than 7,600 lifetime victories was banned from the Stronach Group’s five race tracks — Santa Anita, Golden Gate Fields, Gulfstream Park, Laurel Park and Pimlico — after his fourth fatality at Santa Anita on June 22.
Butler would not comment on Hollendorfer, citing litigation, but he did offer a rebuttal to people who believe the Stronach Group banned Hollendorfer in an attempt to take the onus off the race track.
“There is absolutely no truth to that whatsoever,” he said. “I was involved, I was there, I was on the grounds and that was never once contemplated or thought of.”

Texto completo: Facing growing momentum behind a full House impeachment inquiry, President Trump evidently concluded that releasing a memorandum of his phone call on July 25 with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine would quiet the investigative fervor. He could not have been more wrong.
The memorandum, which the White House released Wednesday morning, is far worse than we could have imagined. It demonstrates that Mr. Trump sought multiple favors from a foreign leader for his personal political gain and in doing so violated his solemn oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution.
The memorandum gives the game away. After the two leaders exchanged pleasantries and agreed that European countries should provide more aid to Ukraine, Mr. Zelensky stated that Ukraine was ready to discuss “next steps” and specifically raised his desire to buy weapons from the United States. In response, Mr. Trump asked Mr. Zelensky to “do us a favor” and proceeded to request that Mr. Zelensky “find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike,” before telling Mr. Zelensky that he would “like to have the attorney general call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it.”
This appears to be nothing short of a request for Ukraine’s help in undermining stories and proceedings that are damaging to the president, including the federal criminal prosecution of Roger Stone. “CrowdStrike” is a reference to a private cybersecurity firm that the Democratic National Committee brought in to investigate the 2016 hack of its servers. Although federal investigators independently verified that Russia was behind the attacks, Mr. Stone and other Trump allies have asserted a conspiracy theory that the government relied on “an inconclusive and unsubstantiated report” prepared by CrowdStrike. If, as it appears, Mr. Trump was effectively asking a foreign power to help undermine a federal criminal prosecution of his political ally, he was engaging in impeachable conduct by violating his oath to take care that the laws are faithfully executed.
Mr. Zelensky got the message. He explained that one of his assistants spoke with Mr. Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and that he hoped Mr. Giuliani would be able to travel to Ukraine to meet in person. Mr. Zelensky also guaranteed that “all the investigations will be done openly and candidly.”
But Mr. Trump did not stop there. He asked Mr. Zelensky for a second favor. He referred to Joe Biden, a 2020 presidential candidate, and unsubstantiated claims that when Mr. Biden was vice president he “stopped the prosecution” of a Ukrainian company tied to his son Hunter. Mr. Trump added that “a lot of people want to find out about that, so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great.”
Mr. Trump’s meaning was perfectly clear: He wanted Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden. Mr. Zelensky’s reaction shows that he got the message. He assured Mr. Trump that he would be appointing a loyal prosecutor general and that “he or she will look into the situation.”
Mr. Zelensky also invited Mr. Trump to send him “any additional information that you can provide to us.” Mr. Trump confirmed their understanding: “I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it.”

Texto completo: Yancey County, there's a genius in your midst.
Conceptual artist Mel Chin, who lives in Egypt Township, has been named a 2019 MacArthur fellow. The fellowship confers a $625,000, "no strings attached" genius grant to thinkers, creators and scientists of exceptional caliber and is considered "an investment in a person's originality, insight, and potential," according to the fellowship's website.
Chin's oeuvre defies categorization — he's worked with media from animated films and ecological installations in landfills to immersive virtual reality exhibitions in Times Square. He's a passionate advocate for the environment and much of his work revolves around climate change.
Chin is a Black Mountain College Legacy Fellow at UNC Asheville and worked closely with UNCA students in the creation and installation of "mixed-reality" projects "Wake" and "Unmoored" in Times Square in the summer of 2018.
The installations were a collaboration with Microsoft's HoloLens, a virtual reality headset that transposed Chin's vision of a post-climate disaster New York City over one of the most iconic landscapes in the U.S.
In the holograms, Times Square visitors were submerged in an underwater landscape where marine life flitted around street level and rusting ships wasted overhead at the encroaching ocean's surface.
The 60-foot-tall animatronic sculpture "Wake" depicted the 19th century Swedish opera star Jenny Lind as a figurehead on a shipwrecked vessel.
Chin received the call about the grant just after returning from trips to Greenland and Miami for a film he is making about climate change, the New York Times reported.
"I don't want to use the word 'responsibility,'" he told the Times. "But this felt like an acknowledgment that maybe after a life's work, you just need to do more."
Mel Chin illustrates one of his concepts for UNC Asheville engineering students at the STEAM Studio meeting room.

Come on, NFL. Give Kaepernick the ball.

Texto completo: Another NFL season is in full swing. A few players are still kneeling during the national anthem to protest police brutality, but the controversy has receded from the headlines - and from President Trump's Twitter feed. The NFL has even reached a settlement - reported by the New York Times to be worth "considerably less than $10 million" - with quarterback Colin Kaepernick and safety Eric Reid, two former teammates on the San Francisco 49ers who claimed they were blackballed by the league for kneeling.
Reid is back in the league as the starting safety for the Carolina Panthers. Not Kaepernick. He is reported to be working out three hours a day starting at 5 a.m. and to be "literally in the best shape of his life." He even trained this summer with star wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. of the Cleveland Browns. His agent is reaching out to teams to get him a tryout - but apparently hasn't gotten a single positive response.
This makes no football sense. Granted, Kaepernick hasn't played since Jan. 1, 2017, but he's only 31 years old - a decade younger than the New England Patriots' Tom Brady - and all that inactivity means he's a lot fresher than other players his age. Kaepernick played six years for the 49ers, leading them to two conference championship games and one Super Bowl. He threw 72 touchdowns to 30 interceptions. And his skills as both a runner and passer would seem to be a perfect fit for today's NFL, which features mobile quarterbacks such as Lamar Jackson of the Baltimore Ravens. (I still have traumatic memories of Kaepernick running for three touchdowns and passing for two more in 2010 to lead the University of Nevada Wolfpack over my California Golden Bears.)
It's not as though NFL teams aren't in need of quarterbacks. In the first two weeks of the season, five teams - the New Orleans Saints, the Pittsburgh Steelers, the New York Jets, the Carolina Panthers and the Jacksonville Jaguars - lost their starting QBs for varying periods of time. This has led to the signing of backups J.T. Barrett (Saints), Paxton Lynch (Steelers), Joshua Dobbs (Jaguars) and David Fales (Jets). Who dat? They are all journeymen who have bounced around the league with no distinction. Not one has gotten his team anywhere close to a Super Bowl. They have hardly gotten on the field.
There is no football executive who can say with a straight face that Barrett, Lynch, Dobbs or Fales is a better player than Kaepernick. Heck, Kaepernick isn't just better than these third-string QBs. His career quarterback rating (88.9) is higher than 15 of 35 starters in the NFL this year. (Ryan Fitzpatrick, the Miami Dolphins' sometime starter, has a dismal rating of 44 in 2019!) But Kaepernick isn't demanding to be a starter. He has said he would be content to hold a clipboard on the sideline.
So why isn't he being given a chance? Some blame the kneeling controversy he initiated for a decline in the league's TV ratings, but Kaepernick's return could be a ratings bonanza. Interest in, and support for, Kaepernick remains so strong that his Nike ads are credited with boosting the company's stock price.
Others suggest that Kaepernick would be a distraction to a team. But NFL teams don't hesitate to sign troublemakers such as wide receiver Antonio Brown. He was bounced from the Steelers and then the Oakland Raiders after feuding with teammates and executives and then signed by the Patriots one day before he was accused of sexual assault in a lawsuit. The Patriots cut him after he allegedly sent intimidating messages to his accuser, and Brown now says he is done with football, but there are apparently still teams interested in him if he chooses to play. Kaepernick hasn't been accused of anything other than making a political statement - and he has become more of a pariah than Brown.
It's hard to avoid the conclusion that the NFL is still blacklisting Kaepernick for political reasons. And it's the politics of the owners rather than the fans that counts. According to FiveThirtyEight, only six NFL teams have a primarily Republican fan base. Most NFL fans lean Democratic - as you would expect in blue towns such as San Francisco, Detroit, New York, Baltimore, Seattle and Chicago. Presumably Democrats would not be nearly as offended by Kaepernick's politics as Republicans.
But while NFL fans might be Democrats, the NFL's wealthy owners are primarily Republicans. Nine NFL owners collectively donated $8.9 million to Trump's inaugural and campaign committees. One of them - Jets owner Woody Johnson - is now ambassador to Britain. Even though Trump has said that Kaepernick should get another shot - "if he's good enough" - he could easily reverse himself and blast Kaepernick if he should take the field, especially if he kneels again. NFL owners appear to be putting fealty to Trump - or at least fear of Trump - over the needs of their teams. To paraphrase another outspoken NFL player, just give Kap the damn ball.

Ukraine memo release: Attorney General Barr has some explaining to do

Resumen: President Trump and Rudy Giuliani aren't the only players tied to this controversy.

Texto completo: One of the most shocking revelations in the transcript of President Donald Trump’s phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky was that so much of what Trump had to say on the call focused just on getting Ukrainian officials to investigate Trump’s political opponents. Another surprise was the fact that President Trump said repeatedly — five times, in fact — that Attorney General William Barr would be running point, working with Trump’s private attorney Rudy Giuliani, on these matters.
Make no mistake, these facts now implicate the attorney general, the nation’s chief law enforcement officer, directly in the commission of acts that many of the country’s leading legal experts consider federal crimes — whether as election law violations, bribery or other offenses concerning public corruption.
This doesn't look good for the AG
The revelation of Barr’s possible involvement should alarm all of us concerned about the rule of law in this country. At a minimum, it’s no longer sustainable for this attorney general to oversee the Justice Department’s handling of the Ukraine scandal.
Consider a contrast: One of the most egregious acts revealed in the Mueller report was when the president asked then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to ”take (a) look” at investigating Trump’s political rival, Hillary Clinton. Sessions, to his credit, refused. Not to his great credit, though, because the right answer is so obviously to refrain.
Ukraine whistleblower: It's time for all the cards to be laid out for Congress
Even Barr seems to understand the extreme impropriety of what the transcript suggests about his using the power of his office to go after the president’s political rivals. Hence Barr’s formal statement, issued within 30 minutes of the transcript’s release, suggesting that what Trump told Ukraine’s president about the attorney general’s role was essentially false.
But Barr long ago lost the benefit of the doubt. We cannot accept at face value what he says when it comes to the defense of the president or himself.
What’s even more egregious here is to think of the transcript in relation to what else Barr may have been doing in handling the Ukraine matter.
It’s deeply concerning to now know that Barr’s Justice Department told the director of national intelligence to withhold the whistleblower’s complaint from Congress, while Barr admits he knew at the time that he was named on the phone call at the heart of the whistleblower’s allegations. Perhaps that would be excusable if the Justice Department’s advice to the director was ordinary and well within the law. But the DOJ advice was not close to that line. Even Fox News’ Judge Andrew Napolitano has called the DOJ legal theory for withholding the whistleblower’s complaint “cockamamie. ”
Pushing aside reports
Layer onto all of these concerns another revelation in Wednesday’s news — according to The New York Times, the director of national intelligence and the inspector general of the intelligence community each referred the whistleblower’s complaint to the Justice Department for a possible criminal investigation into the president’s actions. Within a matter of days, it seems Barr’s Justice Department somehow reached the conclusion that the complaint could not even trigger an investigation because the allegations could not involve a crime. The legal reasoning that has been reported would put the administration “on very thin ice,” as Judge Napolitano might say.
McMullin: If Congress doesn't stand up to Trump on Ukraine, his abuse of power will only escalate
Apparently, Barr’s Justice Department came up with the idea that “the information discussed on the call didn’t amount to a ‘thing of value’ that could be quantified,” according to BuzzFeed News. That logic flies in the face of what the nation’s foremost legal experts, including Trump’s deputy solicitor general, concluded in the Mueller report. In the case of Ukraine, just chalking up all of Giuliani’s out-of-pocket expenses in the hunt for fake dirt on Biden would likely show the immense value that he and Trump placed on the information.
Finally, what makes matters worse for Barr is that the president has twice publicly discussed having the attorney general investigate allegations involving Ukraine, Clinton and Biden. And the attorney general famously tried to avoid answering Sen. Kamala Harris’ simple question whether the White House ever asked him to investigate anyone.
After the release of the Ukrainegate transcript, the cloud over Bill Barr is thick. There’s one way for him to remove it. Step aside.

Texto completo: EPA targets California over poor air quality, rules backlog
SACRAMENTO, Calif. - The Trump administration on Tuesday blamed California's worst-in-the nation air quality on shoddy paperwork, calling on the state to overhaul its plans for cleaning up toxic smog or risk losing billions in federal road dollars.
The government's warning comes days after the Trump administration moved to block the state's emission standards for cars and trucks, a move that would eliminate California's most important weapon for combating its biggest source of pollution.
Tuesday's announcement by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler chastised California for its backlog of pending rules and regulations to reduce pollution in areas that do not meet federal air quality standards.
"It makes no sense," said Gay MacGregor, a former senior policy adviser for the EPA Office of Transportation and Air Quality from 1983 until 2016. "What they are doing today is basically punishing California for EPA's own inaction."
The federal government sets rules for pollution. Lots of places in the country don't meet those standards. But no state has more problems than California, where 85% of the population - 34 million people - breathe dirty air.
Federal law requires states to come up with a plan on how to reduce pollution. Those plans must be approved by the EPA. The federal agency has a backlog of these plans awaiting approval, and California accounts for about one-third of the total.
The EPA says it plans to issue $40 million in grants to help areas around the country meet federal air quality standards.

Unmarried partners in US have tripled in 2 decades, report says
A new U.S. Census Bureau report says the number of unmarried partners living together has tripled in the past two decades due to social acceptance.
The report released this week says the number went from nearly 6 million in 1996 to 19.1 million in 2018.
The report says unmarried partners are older, better educated, more likely to earn higher wages and more racially diverse than in the past.
Benjamin Gurrentz, a bureau survey statistician, writes that the growth in unmarried cohabitation reflects an increasing normalization. It's also viewed as an alternative to marriage for low-income and less educated people.
As a group, unmarried partners are still small compared to married partners, who numbered 127 million in 2018.
The report used data from the Current Population Survey.

Massachusetts temporarily bans sale of vaping products
BOSTON - The governor of Massachusetts on Tuesday declared a public health emergency and ordered a four-month ban on the sale of vaping products in the state.
Republican Gov. Charlie Baker's order appears to be the first of its kind in the nation, though at least two states, Michigan and New York, have moved to ban vaping flavors.
His announcement came amid growing concern about the health effects of vaping products.
Baker said that during the ban, the administration will work with medical experts, state and federal officials to better understand vaping illnesses and address this public health crisis.
The administration will also work on providing more resources for a public awareness campaign and smoking cessation programs, he said.

300 sent notices for jury duty in newspaper shooting case
ANNAPOLIS, Md. - The judge in the case of the man charged with killing five people in 2018 at a Maryland newspaper said Tuesday that 300 potential jurors are coming to court late this week to answer a questionnaire ahead of next month's jury selection.
Anne Arundel Circuit Court Judge Laura Ripken outlined the plans at a hearing in the case of Jarrod Ramos, who has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder charges. Ramos also has pleaded not criminally responsible, Maryland's version of an insanity defense.
Jury selection is set to begin Oct. 30 and last for three days.
The trial is set to begin Nov. 4.
If he is found guilty, a second phase would determine whether his mental state made him not criminally responsible.

Karzai says Afghan election threatens peace
KABUL, Afghanistan - A presidential election that is days away in Afghanistan threatens the best chance of making peace with the Taliban and ending 18 years of war, former President Hamid Karzai said Tuesday.
The Taliban, with whom the U.S. abruptly ended peace talks this month, have threatened Afghans who go to the polls Saturday.
He called for an immediate resumption of peace talks not only between the United States and the Taliban, but also between the insurgent group and Afghan leaders.
With 18 candidates for president on the ballot, the majority are not campaigning, and some have thrown their support behind others.
Many supporters are also heavily armed, adding to fears that a contested election could result in violence.

Trump's Senate allies give OK to $5B wall request
WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump's Senate GOP allies are pushing to give him his full $5 billion request to build about 200 miles of fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border, but the plan ran into immediate opposition from Democrats and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.
The wall money is contained in a $71 billion draft funding measure for the Department of Homeland Security that cleared its first, easiest hurdle in a Senate panel Tuesday.
A heated debate awaits Thursday, when Democrats promise votes to cut back the border wall funding.
"If Republicans stand with President Trump, they will be saying they fully support allowing the president to take money from our military to fund the border wall," said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.

In New York: The New York Times says it turned to the Irish government to rescue a reporter threatened with arrest in Egypt two years ago out of concern that the Trump administration wouldn't help.
Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger revealed the incident during a speech at Brown University and in an op-ed. Sulzberger said the paper was warned by a U.S. government official that Egypt planned to seize reporter Declan Walsh.
The official said the Trump administration intended to let the arrest be carried out.
The paper turned to Ireland, where Walsh is a citizen, and one of that country's diplomats helped the reporter get out of Egypt.

Police fire tear gas and water cannons Tuesday to disperse thousands of rock-throwing students protesting a new law they say has crippled Indonesia's anti-corruption agency. The protests have grown over the past two days and turned violent in some cities.

Texto completo: While the Poughkeepsie Rural Cemetery is the burial site of a number of prominent industrialists such as Matthew Vassar, John Adriance, the Smith Brothers and James Collingwood, another graveyard just north in Hyde Park at St. James' Episcopal Church includes the graves of some of the region's Gilded Age families and political leaders.
The church, a longtime dream of physician John Bard, who settled in the area in the mid-18th century, was not established until 1812, after Bard's son Samuel donated land south of the family home for the edifice's construction. Along with the church, a graveyard behind it was created.
Because the parcel of land that Samuel Bard donated included his family's burial ground, John Bard's grave predates the existence of the church graveyard. The family's grave markers stand under a tree on the south side of the main entrance road into the grounds.
One of the most unusual and distinctive grave markers in the cemetery exists just inside the entrance gates, behind the church. Easily recognizable due to its resemblance to a tub used to bathe in, it marks the resting place of Morgan Lewis.
The son of Francis Lewis, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, Morgan Lewis fought in the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, and served in the New York assembly and senate. In 1804, he was elected the state's third governor.
A mausoleum in the rear of the graveyard that contains the remains of Ogden Mills resembles a miniature version of the center block of the famed family mansion in Staatsburg. Mills was a successful banker and investor.
While former U.S. President and first lady Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt are interred at Springwood, the nearby family estate, FDR's parents, James and Sara, as well as James's first wife, Rebecca Brien Howland, FDR's half-brother "Rosy" and four of Eleanor and Franklin's children are buried in St. James' graveyard.
"James 'Rosy' Roosevelt, the older half-brother of FDR, was once described in The New York Times as 'an aimless if charming member of New York society's sporting set,'" said Hyde Park Historian Shannon Butler. "He was said to be very generous with his wealth."
Robert J. Livingston is one of many members of the prominent Livingston family interred in the graveyard. Occupying space in a large mausoleum with other family members, the prolific philanthropist was the founder of the Children's Aid Society and served as president of New York Hospital, a position held through his death in 1891.
Not everyone buried in the church graveyard are well-known personalities but were endeared just the same by parishioners. Richard Jenkins, a freed slave who became St. James's first sexton from 1822-1857, was so beloved that he was given his own pew in the church.
Following his retirement from the railroad industry, Col. Archibald Rogers, who lived on a large estate in town named Crumwold Hall, became a well-known ice yacht racer and hunter, sharing several of the latter pursuits with his good friend Theodore Roosevelt. He and his family are interred close to the Bard clan.
Among the many other prominent people interred in the graveyard is the grave of Nathaniel Pendelton, who served as the second to Alexander Hamilton during his duel with Aaron Burr in 1804.
In October, St. James will once again stage its annual "Historic Graveyard Tours," a family-friendly event where attendees are led by lantern through the 200-year-old graveyard. Professional actors clad in historically accurate attire portray some of the "residents" interred on the grounds and share their stories, "Rosy" Roosevelt among them.
"This is St. James's 10th year staging the graveyard tours and they will take place on Friday and Saturday evenings for three weeks starting on Oct. 4 and 5," said tour coordinator Brian Rance.
St. James' Episcopal Church is at 4526 Albany Post Road (Route 9), Hyde Park. For more information about the tours, call 845-229-2820; visit www.stjameshydepark.org

Abrupt exit adds to opera's crisis; Placido Domingo left the Met on the eve of its season opener. So what's his future here?

Texto completo: Embattled singer Placido Domingo on Tuesday pulled out of the Metropolitan Opera's production of "Macbeth" barely 24 hours before the curtain was to rise in New York, reigniting questions about whether he will resign as Los Angeles Opera general director and if the star's career in the United States is already effectively over.
Domingo's appearance Wednesday was to be his first in the U.S. since the Associated Press published reports in which two named sources and 18 anonymous women accused Domingo of sexual harassment. The language of the Met's announcement implied that the company had asked Domingo to step back.
"The Metropolitan Opera confirms that Placido Domingo has agreed to withdraw from all future performances at the Met, effective immediately," the statement read. "The Met and Mr. Domingo are in agreement that he needed to step down. The Met has no further comment at this time."

Domingo responded in a statement to the New York Times, noting that he has sung at the Met for 51 consecutive years.
"While I strongly dispute recent allegations made about me, and I am concerned about a climate in which people are condemned without due process, upon reflection I believe that my appearance in this production of 'Macbeth' would distract from the hard work of my colleagues both onstage and behind the scenes," he said. "As a result, I have asked to withdraw and I thank the leadership of the Met for graciously granting my request."
He expressed happiness that "at the age of 78, I was able to sing the wonderful title role in the dress rehearsal of 'Macbeth,' which I consider my last performance on the Met stage. I am grateful to God and the public for what they have allowed me to accomplish here at the Metropolitan Opera."
The last-minute reversal came after a contentious weekend at the world's largest repertory opera house.
Although the Met previously had said it would await the outcome of an L.A. Opera investigation of the harassment allegations before taking any action, pressure peaked over the weekend following an NPR report that said Met General Manager Peter Gelb held a closed-door meeting with employees Saturday. Gelb reportedly told employees that the Met was not canceling Domingo's performances because the allegations first reported in two AP articles could not be corroborated.
"Placido Domingo is a huge cash cow, and, sometimes, I feel like management cares more about money and reputation," a female chorister told NPR. "What if these accusations turn out to be true, or if there's legal action against Maestro Domingo? I feel that Peter Gelb is saying, 'I don't have a problem exposing my artists to such situations.' "
Domingo had sung in rehearsals, and the Met said as late as Monday that he would perform. By Tuesday afternoon, however, the Met's website had been scrubbed of all mentions of Domingo in "Macbeth," instead advertising that baritone Zeljko Lucic -- originally scheduled to alternate with Domingo -- would star in all performances.
The casting change staves off the likelihood of a protest or the possibility of a disruption in the 3,800-seat venue where memories still linger from 2014, when John Adams' "The Death of Klinghoffer" was interrupted twice by protesters who considered the opera to be anti-Semitic. Several hundred people gathered outside to voice their anger at the Met for that production.
Despite the Domingo accusations -- or perhaps because of them -- the singer was greeted with adoration when he performed in Austria this summer.
When L.A. Opera opened its 34th season this month with a punkish production of Puccini's "La Boheme," the performance and, later, the ball that followed under the stars on the newly renovated Music Center Plaza unfolded sans protest.
The night, in fact, was most notable for what it lacked: any mention of Domingo.
The program contained no traditional welcome note from the general manager, there was no sight of Domingo before or after the performance, and there was not a single mention of his name during official comments at the ball afterward.
Los Angeles Opera did not respond to a Times request for comment Tuesday as two investigations proceeded. In the first, L.A. Opera hired investigator Debra Wong Yang of the law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. Yang recently sent a letter to L.A. Opera contractors and employees, inviting them to speak out about harassment and promising that the company would prohibit retaliation against "anyone participating in an investigation in good faith."
The second investigation is being conducted by the American Guild of Musical Artists, a union that represents members at the Met and L.A. Opera.
Len Egert, AGMA's national executive director, told The Times on Tuesday that the union's investigation will take two to three months. He would not comment on specifics of the inquiry.
"AGMA has been in regular communication with artists and union leaders at affected locations, including Los Angeles Opera and Metropolitan Opera," Egert wrote in an email. "We have encouraged our members to come to the union as a resource to redress and eliminate sexual harassment in the workplace."
He added that L.A. Opera recently asked AGMA to provide information and resources to prevent harassment and discrimination. In response to that request, AGMA held a forum at the Music Center on Monday to discuss forms of harassment and to offer bystander training for those witnessing harassment. It also made counseling available for targets of harassment.
After the Met's announcement Tuesday, a lawyer for Patricia Wulf, a mezzo-soprano who went public with her sexual harassment allegations against Domingo, released a letter she sent to Gelb.
"It appears that while the pain and indignity of more than 20 women who were sexually harassed by Mr. Domingo was not enough for the Met to do the right thing, the public outcry was," wrote the lawyer, Debra S. Katz.
Of the women who have accused Domingo of harassment, Katz added, referencing earlier Gelb comments: "They deserve the public and the arts world's respect and appreciation -- and not the type of victim shaming your statement reinforced."

Texto completo: The girl survived after her father jumped in front of an oncoming train at the Kingsbridge Road station in the Bronx, officials said.
[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
A Bronx man was killed and his 5-year-old daughter was injured early on Monday after he apparently jumped in front of a subway train while holding onto the girl, the police said.
The man, Fernando Balbuena-Flores, 45, was hit by a southbound No. 4 train at the elevated Kingsbridge Road station in the Bronx shortly before 8 a.m., and he was pronounced dead at the scene, officials said.
The girl, who only had some cuts, was taken to Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx and was in stable condition, officials said. She was met there by her mother, Niurka Caraballo.
At around 5:30 p.m., Ms. Caraballo, her daughter, whose name was not released, and a man who said he was the girl's godfather arrived at the five-story, red brick building on the Grand Concourse where Ms. Caraballo and the girl have lived with Mr. Balbuena-Flores.
After going into the building, Ms. Caraballo re-emerged and, in Spanish, briefly addressed a crowd of reporters and neighbors gathered outside the building.
"The girl is in perfect condition," she said. "Thank God and the angels who watched over her. Everything is O.K., except that now I'm without my husband."
Leidy Martinez, a resident of the building who said that she did not know Mr. Balbuena-Flores personally, said she had been on the Kingsbridge Road platform on Monday morning and had watched the fatal episode unfold.
"When the train was approaching, oh my god, he took that girl and he jumped," Ms. Martinez, 49, said.
Video shot by a person on the northbound platform showed two men on the tracks pulling the girl, whose name had not been released, out from under a subway car.
In the video, the girl appears to be alert as she crawls out from under the train, her pink backpack briefly catching on the car's underside before the two men hoist her onto the platform, which is packed with rush-hour commuters.
One of the men who helped the girl off the tracks, Antonio Love, 32, said that he had been walking near the Kingsbridge Road station when he heard people screaming. He said that when he ran up to the platform, he saw that another man was already trying to help the girl.
Mr. Love said that when he jumped onto the tracks, he saw Mr. Balbuena-Flores's body beneath the train's wheels. The girl was crying and there was blood on her head, Mr. Love said.
"The only thing she was saying was 'Papa, my papa,"' he said.
The two men called to the girl, Mr. Love said, and she soon crawled toward them.
Mr. Love and the second man were taken to St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx with minor injuries, the Fire Department said.
At the hospital, Mr. Love, whose yellow sweatshirt was stained with blood, said he was just "a little banged up." Mostly, he said, he was shocked by what he had seen.
He said he was especially dismayed to see so many people on the platform taking out their phones but not doing anything to help.
"It was just panicking," he said. "Like, regular New Yorkers, pulling out their phones. Really? Let's get down there and help."
To add further insult, Mr. Love said that he left his bag on the platform when he jumped onto the tracks. When he went back to retrieve it, it was gone.
"Why would somebody do that?" he said. "I'm saving their lives and someone took my bag."
The operator of the train, a 20-year veteran of the job, was being treated for trauma and evaluated, transit union representatives said.
"Our thoughts are with the family members as well as with our employees who responded," Shams Tarek, a Metropolitan Transportation Authority spokesman, said in a statement. "This is a traumatic event for everyone involved."
Officials said they did not know what might have prompted Mr. Balbuena-Flores to jump into the train's path.
Anthony Woods, the assistant superintendent at the building where Mr. Balbuena-Flores lived, said he was stunned to hear about the death. He recalled Mr. Balbuena-Flores as a good father who would take his daughter to the park three times a day.
"Wherever he goes, she goes," Mr. Woods said. "The only place he doesn't take her is work."
As of July 22, at least 32 people this year had been killed after being hit by trains, the transit authority said. Over all, trains hit 103 people who were on either tracks or platforms in that period.
Last year, 68 people died as a result of being hit by trains, and there were 189 total collisions, the authority said.
Transit officials said last year that they were contending with a worrying rise in the number of people going onto subway tracks, and not only to attempt suicide.
Officials have suggested that riders who sees someone who appears to be emotionally distressed should press the "emergency" button on a Help Point station or notify a subway worker.
The death on Monday was reminiscent of an episode at another Bronx subway station in June 2018, when a woman jumped onto the subway tracks with her two-month-old son. In that instance, the mother and child were uninjured.

Texto completo: I've been lucky.
In February 1968, I came down to Washington from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism to do some research, stopped up at The Post and walked out with a job. A week later, for reasons I never understood, I got a raise. After graduating in June, I started work, and now, 51 years later, I am about to stop. This is my final column. I think I've earned that raise.
In 1976, eight years after I started, I was offered a local column. Ben Bradlee, the executive editor, made the offer at a lunch I had requested so I could tell him I was quitting. A rival news organization had offered to make me its White House correspondent. But before I could resign, Bradlee upset my plans. I never got around to quitting and never told Bradlee I had intended to.
I was lucky.
Bradlee asked me to show him five sample columns. Instead, knowing I need the juice of a deadline, I wrote one the next day and gave it to the city editor. "I'm the new local columnist," I brazenly told him. "Check with Bradlee." He never did.
The next day, my column was in the paper.
I was lucky.
Back then, I wrote three columns a week - an exhausting but exhilarating schedule. Little by little, I broadened my scope until, in Bradlee's telling, he picked up the paper one day and discovered that I was in Beirut. By fiat, he moved me from the Metro page to the A section and, later, at the insistence of the publisher, to the op-ed page. I wrote what I wanted from where I wanted, and not once did the publishers ever tell me what to write or what not to write. On occasion, though, Katharine Graham offered some constructive criticism. Once, at a formal lunch for the new Russian ambassador, she strode purposely across the dining room to tell me that my column that morning "was a real piece of s---."
"Don't hold back, Katharine," I responded. "Tell me what you really think."
She laughed.
There were no better bosses than the Grahams - and, more recently, Jeff Bezos. I roamed the world on their dime. Flying into Cairo for the first time, I looked out the window. A sandstorm obscured the pyramids, but I envisioned them anyway and could not get over the fact that I was being paid to see them. What fools the Grahams were. I would have done it for nothing.
Back in 2017, I helped produce a documentary for HBO on the life of Ben Bradlee. HBO called it "The Newspaperman," and I thought, how wonderful, how apt. That was Bradlee and, with the same permission he gave me to write a column, I take that appellation for myself as well. It is, I think, the highest of callings, and I never wanted to be anything else. You go to work and someone pins an imaginary badge on you and deputizes you to go forth and discover life, ask questions, turn over rocks and, in the case of a column, think so hard it's physically draining.
I had grown up reading the once- liberal New York Post. It was a brave, scrappy paper with great, iconoclastic writers, particularly its columnists. I gorged on Murray Kempton, Jimmy Cannon and Pete Hamill. I read them all, envied them all and wanted to be like them. Later, I became a copyboy for the New York Herald Tribune and noticed that reporters were required to read the paper. They got paid for it. Amazing. Professional ballplayers must feel the same way. Imagine getting paid to play a game!
That first day at The Post, I was assigned a desk next to Carl Bernstein. We became fast friends and so, like a barnacle on a ship, I attached myself to him and Bob Woodward, going through Watergate with them. Earlier, I watched in awe and pride as The Post risked all sorts of legal and financial penalties to publish the Pentagon Papers after the New York Times had been enjoined from doing so. This was one great newspaper that I had just walked into. Again, what luck!
Now, it is over. I have written books and screenplays and will continue to do so. My girlfriend and I are going to Paris for a month and we're getting a dog. I will have time to walk it now. I will miss newspapering, but I know I had the best it ever had to offer.
I was very lucky indeed.

Vigil held for vanished girl
BRIDGETON, N.J. - Dozens of people have attended a vigil for a 5-year-old girl believed to have been kidnapped from a southern New Jersey park.
Family, friends and supporters gathered Saturday night for a vigil at the park in Bridgeton where Dulce Maria Alavez disappeared Monday. Supporters lit candles, prayed, sang hymns and wore yellow, the color that Dulce was wearing when she went missing. A pastor prayed the girl's abductor would "send this baby home."
Dulce's grandmother, Norma Perez, said, "I miss her. I need her."
The missing girl and her 3-year-old brother were playing at the park while their mother sat in her car with an 8-year-old relative.
Authorities believe the girl was taken by a man who led her to a red van.
There's a $35,000 reward for information leading to an arrest in the case.

PENNSYLVANIA
Serious virus found in Carbon, Monroe
A rare, potentially deadly virus transmitted by mosquitoes has been confirmed in three Pennsylvania counties, including two in the Lehigh Valley region.
The Pennsylvania departments of health and agriculture issued a warning Saturday after confirming eastern equine encephalitis in Erie, Carbon, and Monroe counties. The virus was found in pheasants, horses and a wild turkey.
The virus is carried by birds. Mosquitoes can transmit it to humans, horses and other birds.
Health officials say the infection is fatal in 30% of human cases. They're urging people to avoid mosquito bites when outdoors by wearing mosquito repellent and covering exposed skin with lightweight clothing. Homeowners should also make sure window screens are in good condition and eliminate standing water around their properties.

Trump Tower jewel thefts net $350K
NEW YORK - Detectives are investigating the reported thefts of about $350,000 worth of jewelry from residents in Manhattan's Trump Tower.
Police say the jewelry was stolen from inside two apartments in the building where President Donald Trump owns a penthouse triplex.
One woman reported a $117,000 diamond bracelet taken from her 59th floor apartment. Another woman reported various gem-encrusted pieces missing from her 42nd floor closet. The items reportedly disappeared between June 21 and Sept. 9.
A police spokesman told The New York Times that investigators haven't identified a suspect and are looking at everyone with access to the building.
Trump plans to stay at his penthouse Sunday night. He's to deliver a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday.
Reports of the thefts were first published by the New York Post.

RIDGEWOOD, N.J.
Speeding car carried woman in labor
RIDGEWOOD, N.J. - New Jersey State Police chased a speeding car for several minutes and then approached it at gunpoint once the driver finally pulled over.
Inside they found a woman in labor.
State police got a call for a car speeding northbound on Route 17 just before 11 p.m. Friday. They gave chase, signaling for the vehicle to stop.
Authorities tell NorthJersey.com that troopers drew their guns because they didn't know if the car's occupants were armed or dangerous. When they realized what was happening, the troopers escorted the pregnant woman and her driver to The Valley Hospital in Ridgewood.
The woman's condition wasn't clear.

Devin Nunes: Whistleblower complaint may not even mention Ukraine

Texto completo: Beware leaks to the media about the whistleblower complaint from inside the intelligence community that surfaced earlier this month, warned Rep. Devin Nunes.
The California Republican told Fox & Friends on Monday that little is actually known about this complaint, and that it may not have anything to do with a July phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, as has been reported.
"This is a whistleblower," Nunes said, who "supposedly wants to remain secret, yet all his secrets — his or her secrets — are spilling out in the pages of the New York Times, Washington Post, and NBC News. We have no idea. This could maybe not even be about Ukraine. We have seen absolutely nothing."
Nunes is the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, which last week was briefed by Inspector General Michael Atkinson, who deemed the complaint "credible" and "urgent." Echoing other lawmakers who were in attendance, Nunes said Atkinson "didn't tell us any information" about the complaint.iFrame ObjectIn that closed-door briefing, Atkinson is said to have told lawmakers that he was forbidden by acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire to disclose details about the complaint. Maguire, who is set to testify this week about the matter, reportedly received guidance on the situation from the Justice Department, as well as the White House.
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff first revealed the existence of the whistleblower complaint on Sept. 13, when he issued a subpoena to Maguire to hand it over as he said statute required. So far the Trump administration has not played ball with Democrats and some Republicans who want to see the complaint, citing jurisdictional issues. The controversy has also re-energized a push in the Democratic Party for impeachment.
Only in media reports has it been said that the complaint, at least in part, has to do with Trump pressuring Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden's son Hunter, who did business in Ukraine while his father was vice president, at a time when the elder Biden is campaigning to be president. One report even said the whistleblower did not have direct knowledge of the communications between Trump and Ukraine.
Trump has admitted that he talked about Biden to Zelensky, but argues he did nothing wrong. Ukraine's foreign minister also claimed Trump did not pressure Zelensky during that phone call.
Nunes said he sees similarities between this controversy and the Russia debacle that cast a cloud over the first two-and-a-half years of Trump's presidency. "Doesn't it feel like the Russia hoax all over again? It's like the Ukrainian hoax," he said.

Ponzi Tactics Changing In the Post-Madoff Era

Texto completo: It has been more than 10 years since Bernard L. Madoff was caught running the biggest Ponzi scheme in history, a case that became a cautionary tale for investors and a call to action for regulators. The Securities and Exchange Commission made changes in its enforcement division to better detect fraud, established specialized teams and even revamped its system for handling tips from the public.
But the prosecution of Mr. Madoff -- who took investors for more than $ 50 billion -- was not the Ponzi case to end all Ponzi cases. The S.E.C. brought 50 percent more Ponzi prosecutions in the decade after Mr. Madoff's arrest than in the 10 years before, according to a New York Times analysis of the agency's enforcement announcements.
Whether the increase is the result of enhanced enforcement or a proliferation of scammers, records show that Ponzi victims lost $ 31 billion in the decade beginning 2009, more than three times the amount lost in non-Madoff schemes in the previous decade. (The figures are not adjusted for inflation.)
Sioux Schaefer was one of those millions of victims, and her case demonstrates one of the ways scammers have changed tactics in hopes of ensnaring unwary investors: Instead of pitching secretive, market-beating stock strategies as Mr. Madoff did, schemers are more frequently selling esoteric investments like natural resource mining and cryptocurrencies.
Ms. Schaefer, a horse trainer and photographer from Santa Cruz, Calif., was recently widowed and wondered how to leave an inheritance to her daughter and grandson. A friend told her about investing in gold mines with Daniel Christian Stanley Powell, a gregarious Cornell graduate and the founder of a Los Angeles investment company, Christian Stanley.
As she spoke with Mr. Powell on the phone, they bonded over a shared love of horses. He promised her a 10 percent return on her money, and she gave him $ 175,000.
The payments Mr. Powell promised never came. Federal prosecutors said he had victimized Ms. Schaefer and dozens of other investors through false promises of profits from gold mines, coal leases and a business for which he had trademarked the term "reverse life insurance." Instead, they said, Mr. Powell used new investors' money to pay the old -- skimming off a healthy cut to buy a luxury apartment, sports cars and other items -- including $ 5,000 for cowboy boots.
"In my mind, in my spirit, it just knocked everything out of me," Ms. Schaefer said. "How could I be so gullible?"
______
Life After Bernie
Bernard L. Madoff was accused of running a $ 50 billion Ponzi scheme on Dec. 19, 2008, a fraud so enormous that it prompted the Securities and Exchange Commission to reorganize its enforcement division. Since the start of 2009, Ponzi scheme prosecutions have increased by nearly 50 percent, with much greater losses.
Pre-Madoff
$ 8.5 billion
301,000 investors in 195 cases
Post-Madoff
$ 31.1 billion
4.3 million investors in 291 cases
______
The S.E.C.'s enforcement announcements demonstrate how scammers' offerings have evolved to take in people, like Ms. Schaefer, who might otherwise be wary of a pitch involving traditional investment funds. Half the 291 cases brought in the past decade involved schemes promoting untraditional products. In the decade before the Madoff case, about 38 percent did.
"Fraudsters are trying to wrap themselves in new products to garner the attention of investors," said Jeff Boujoukos, director of the S.E.C.'s Philadelphia regional office.
It's not the only way that scammers have sought to distinguish themselves. Some victims said they had been fooled by pitches offering modest returns, which made them seem more believable than promises of astronomical profits.
The scheme that Christopher Parris has been accused of running leaned on more traditional Ponzi pitch tactics; the investments were said to be in businesses including financial services, insurance and real estate. Jaleen Dambrosio of Rochester entrusted to him her life savings -- $ 600,000 -- and for a few years received steady returns that assured her that she had made the right investment.
But Mr. Parris and an associate, Perry Santillo, were actually running a Ponzi scheme that defrauded more than 600 investors, the commission said. The money Ms. Dambrosio had given him was gone, along with about $ 100 million that others had invested.
The men had spent lavishly on themselves, including commissioning a song that Mr. Santillo had performed at a party he threw at a Las Vegas nightclub, according to the commission. "Ten-thousand-dollar suits everywhere he rides," the song went. "Pop the champagne in L.A., New York to Florida; buy another bottle just to spray it all over ya."
"It was like somebody punched me in the face," said Ms. Dambrosio, who had retired from Kodak, where she was a purchasing manager. "Everything stopped."
Ms. Dambrosio -- who has gone back to work, at a Walmart deli counter -- lost an unusually large amount for a Ponzi victim. The average loss for Ponzi victims in the decade after Madoff was $ 150,000, according to an analysis of S.E.C. data, compared with $ 80,000 in the previous decade for non-Madoff scams.
Jane Naylon, who had taken music lessons from Mr. Parris's father while growing up in the same Rochester neighborhood, contacted the S.E.C. after growing suspicious of Mr. Parris and Mr. Santillo. Some of the accusers have spoken to the F.B.I.
"Why are these guys walking around free?" asked Ms. Naylon, who declared bankruptcy after losing her $ 105,000 investment. "They froze their assets, but they still seem to have money."
Lawyers for Mr. Santillo did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Court records do not list an attorney for Mr. Parris; messages and emails to him were not returned.
All Ponzi schemes -- whether they make international headlines or minor headaches for a handful of investors -- have the same basic shape: They use new investors to pay the old ones. That type of scheme long predates its current name, which comes from Charles Ponzi, whose 1920 investment scam brought in millions of dollars.
Perpetrators' outreach methods are still often the same as they were in the days of Ponzi. Friends, family and acquaintances are common targets, and word of mouth helps recruit new investors -- a trait that was on display in the cases involving Mr. Powell as well as Mr. Santillo and Mr. Parris.
"These are investors who didn't even know where to begin doing due diligence," said Scott Silver, a Florida lawyer who has assisted dozens of people who contend they were victims of Mr. Santillo and Mr. Parris. "A lot of the traits of this scheme have become very typical of what we've seen over the last decade."
Another thing that hasn't changed: Victims rarely get their money back.
Some accusers of Mr. Parris and Mr. Santillo -- although not Ms. Dambrosio and Ms. Naylon -- have sued Bank of America. They claim that the bank enabled the fraud by providing the defendants with dozens of accounts and facilitating transactions between them. The bank has asked a judge to dismiss the case, calling it "a misguided attempt to hold Bank of America responsible for the misdeeds of its customers."
Ms. Schaefer, who was caught up in the gold-mine scheme, has less reason for hope. In 2015, Mr. Powell was sentenced to 10 years in prison and ordered to pay $ 4.4 million in restitution to his victims -- a judgment that has yet to be fulfilled.
"He could have stayed out, for all I care," Ms. Schaefer said. "Just as long as we got our money back."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: In an era plagued by deep fakes and online disinformation campaigns, we still tend to trust what we read in books. But should we?
In the past year alone, errors in books by several high-profile authors -- including Naomi Wolf, the former New York Times executive editor Jill Abramson, the historian Jared Diamond, the behavioral scientist and "happiness expert" Paul Dolan and the journalist Michael Wolff -- have ignited a debate over whether publishers should take more responsibility for the accuracy of their books.
Some authors are hiring independent fact checkers to review their books. A few nonfiction editors at major publishing companies have started including rigorous professional fact-checking in their suite of editorial services.
While in the fallout of each accuracy scandal everyone asks where the fact checkers are, there isn't broad agreement on who should be paying for what is a time-consuming, labor-intensive process in the low-margin publishing industry.
"The standard line from publishers is, 'We rely on our authors,' and, well, that's not good enough," said Gabriel Sherman, a journalist who paid two fact checkers $ 100,000 from his advance for his 2014 book, "The Loudest Voice in the Room," about Roger E. Ailes and Fox News. "I wish publishers did see the importance of fact-checking as essentially an insurance policy."
Publishers have long maintained that fact-checking every book would be prohibitively expensive, and that the responsibility falls on authors, who hold the copyrights. But in today's polarized media landscape, that stance appears to be shifting as some publishers privately agree that they should be doing more, particularly when the subject matter is controversial.
"If you're writing a remotely controversial book, there's going to be an active audience that's invested in discrediting it," said Kyle Pope, the editor and publisher of the Columbia Journalism Review. "This notion that books are above the fray, I don't think it's going to last."
Accusations of sloppiness and journalistic malpractice now quickly explode on social media. Ms. Abramson was pilloried on Twitter by sources and other journalists this year for mistakes in her book "Merchants of Truth" and for failing to cite source material from other writers. She made corrections and credited sources in the digital version and future print editions.
"I was aware that taking care of all of that was my responsibility as an author," Ms. Abramson said in an interview. "There were mistakes and imperfections and dropped footnotes, and I'm pained by that."
The stakes have gotten higher as the publishing industry has become increasingly dependent on political tell-alls, memoirs and newsy nonfiction books to drive profits. From 2014 to 2018, revenue for adult nonfiction grew 23 percent while adult fiction fell 10 percent, according to the Association of American Publishers, a trade group.
At the same time, scrutiny of such books is growing. After Mr. Wolff in June published "Siege," his account of volatility inside the Trump administration, journalists highlighted numerous inaccuracies in the book.
Mr. Wolff's publisher, Henry Holt, has stood by his incendiary account. "While there could be minor copy editing corrections made to the text in future editions, Holt has no plans to alter the author's reporting or perceptions," the company said in a statement.
In May, The New York Times Book Review published a blistering review of Mr. Diamond's book "Upheaval." The reviewer, the author Anand Giridharadas, cited mangled facts and what he described as misleading generalizations, and argued that the flaws were emblematic of a systemic lack of fact-checking in publishing.
"Fact checkers are as important as cover designers, as editors," Mr. Giridharadas said in an interview. "It's not treated as mandatory, and I think it should be."
In response to an inquiry from The Times, Mr. Diamond disputed the characterization of his book as "riddled with errors."
"Mr. Giridharadas's claims are variously wrong or deliberately misleading," he said, adding that "newspapers, not only authors, can be guilty of flagrantly deficient fact-checking."
Mistakes in books often persist and become magnified, spreading like a genetic mutation as they're repeated in articles and subsequent books.

In his new book, "Talking to Strangers," Malcolm Gladwell writes that poets have "far and away the highest suicide rates," as much as five times the rate for the general population. The statistic struck Andrew Ferguson, a writer for The Atlantic, as odd, so he tracked down its source: a paper that cited a 1993 book by Kay Redfield Jamison, a psychologist who based the finding on suicides among 36 "major British and Irish poets born between 1705 and 1805." Somehow, a narrow analysis of a few dozen 18th- and 19th-century poets was mistakenly applied to all poets, then amplified in a best-selling book.
When publishers do conduct a factual review, it's often in response to a crisis. In June, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt postponed the release of Ms. Wolf's "Outrages," which explores how 19th-century British courts criminalized same-sex relationships, and commissioned independent evaluations from several scholars after questions were raised about the accuracy of her research. The publisher took the unusual and costly step of recalling copies from retailers and pulping them. Ms. Wolf has said that she disagrees with the delay, and that only a small number of errors must be corrected.
Publishers have manuscripts reviewed by their legal departments to guard against libel and copyright infringement. But that process doesn't include vetting an author's research and thesis, and doesn't always prevent errors or even fraud, as was the case with fabricated memoirs by James Frey, Margaret Seltzer and the Holocaust survivor Herman Rosenblat.
The economic realities of commercial publishing -- an unpredictable business that often relies on outsize hits and blockbuster authors -- make routine fact-checking difficult. Rigorously fact-checking a book-length manuscript, which can involve calling sources and reviewing notes and documents, can cost tens of thousands of dollars, the equivalent of a modest author advance.
"It's not ideal. I would love to be able to fact-check every book that I publish, but it's just the reality," said Morgan Entrekin, publisher and chief executive of Grove Atlantic, which weathered its own scandal over Gay Talese's book "The Voyeur's Motel." "I don't know what the alternative is, other than to publish fewer books on a different model."
But a factual controversy can also be costly, driving down sales and, in extreme cases, forcing the publisher to recall and destroy finished copies.
Barry Harbaugh, a senior editor at Amazon Publishing, said the company paid for fact-checking for many of its nonfiction titles.
"A lot of the time we talk about fact-checking in this defensive framework, like when something horribly wrong happens," Mr. Harbaugh said. "But it's also a way to lay many more hands on a story that's being sculpted from facts, and it's qualitatively improving the piece."
Tim Duggan Books, part of Penguin Random House's Crown publishing division, provides a stipend for its nonfiction authors to hire fact checkers. The imprint, which was founded in 2014, has attracted some prominent journalists and scholars.
"Part of the nature of the work is to make no assumptions and ask the most basic questions," said Andy Young, a professional fact checker who has worked with authors published by Tim Duggan Books.
Early in her career, the New Yorker writer Susan Orlean was shocked to learn that publishers didn't vet books for accuracy, but couldn't afford to spend a chunk of her modest advances on fact-checking. For her last two books, "The Library Book," about a 1986 fire at the Central Library in Los Angeles, and a biography of Rin Tin Tin, Ms. Orlean hired fact checkers herself.
"I don't want a substantial error that changes the meaning of my book, but I also don't want silly errors," she said.
Even so, the occasional mistake slips through. After "The Library Book" was published, a firefighter emailed her and said her description of firefighters using oxygen tanks was wrong. They use air tanks, since pure oxygen would explode.
"We corrected it in the next edition," Ms. Orlean said.

Texto completo: My birthday was a few days ago. I’ve had some memorable ones, but this was particularly unforgettable for reasons I’ll explain.
I’d spent the week working on my latest book with my co-authors and speaking in several middle schools in and around Boise. Ah, middle-schoolers. They’re the “Empire Strikes Back” of the “Star Wars” trilogy of childhood: They experience some setbacks (in mood swings), they sometimes smell like the inside of a Tauntaun, but ultimately they come out hopeful.
We helped them create a story as a class. They decided their main character would be Bob the Flying Bush, who had powers of regeneration, but whose weakness was bananas. His nemesis was Ned, the Fish of Despair, who had just invented the universe’s first banana cannon.
It was tough to rein them in. They were inquisitive, fidgety, talkative and mostly just loud in every way.
So, they were typical.
The kids sang happy birthday to me and one of them asked how old I was.
“Twenty-eight,” I said.
Knowing it was a fabrication, they tried a different tact.
“How young are you?” one said.
“Twenty-eight.”
Ever relentless, a student asked, “What year were you born?”
Ever stubborn, I said, “1492.”
“How long have you been alive?”
“Longer than you.”
“Ask another question,” the librarian said.
“How old was your mom when she had you and how old is she now?” one boy asked.
Ah, kids. I’ve seen it all, I wanted to say.
But the truth is, I haven’t. Because on the morning of my birthday, before our second presentation, the librarian came over and warned us that we should expect a “lockdown drill.”
I have heard of lockdown drills. I knew both of my sons experienced them regularly.
The librarian pointed to the adjoining computer lab. “All you need to do is go in there. The police know to clear the library first.”
Seemed simple enough.
We started the class, and a few minutes in, the principal came over the loudspeaker. “Lockdown. Lockdown. Lockdown.”
We followed the students into the computer lab.
Once inside, the rambunctious kids fell silent.
“You’re supposed to stay away from sight of the door,” one student warned us newbies.
“And find a hiding place,” another whispered.
One by one, each child found their place, whether it was under a desk, behind a bookshelf, or in a closet.
We followed suit, and hid behind book stacks.
And for 10 minutes, there was not one peep. Phones were silent. Breathing was muted. Under one of the computer desks, two girls were huddled next to each other. The boy who had tried so hard to get me to confess my age was behind an easel, his eyes closed, his knees to his chest.
No one moved an inch.
We listened for any sounds coming from the library.
Perhaps some of you have experienced a lockdown, but for me, it was new, and for some reason the unnatural quiet of a room full of middle-schoolers struck me.
I glanced up above the light switch. There was a small sign that said, “Even in darkness we can find light.”
Eventually, we heard the officers enter the room.
“Is there anyone in here with you,” they asked the librarian.
“No,” he replied. And then when he was reassured they were real officers, he said, “There’s a roomful of children and adults right over there.”
When we all exited the room, he commended the students.
“Well done! I couldn’t see any of you from the door, and I definitely couldn’t hear any of you.”
I’ve been in a lot of middle school classrooms, but I’d never seen a full room so empty, and I’d never heard two dozen boisterous middle-schoolers so silent.
Afterward, they returned to their story, nonplussed. Bob the Flying Bush was now mired in banana goo, unable to free himself. It was the climax of our book, the “dark night of the soul,” so to speak.
Until a magical pair of galoshes saved him.
One student asked if our childhood experiences helped us become better writers.
We collectively answered yes. As children, we’d been through many of the same things they had.
But not all.

Open your eyes to modern reality

Texto completo: There are some books that I think of as "wake-up calls." I'm talking about books that not only tell me something I don't know, but that challenge and reconfigure a previously held belief, allowing me to see the world I live in with greater clarity and understanding.
Before reading such a book, I often think the problem at hand is due to forces beyond our control, a sad fact of human frailty or the downside of change. Afterward, I recognize that some of our deepest societal problems were the result of deliberate acts.
I'm thinking of "Dopesick: Dealers, Doctors, and the Drug Company That Addicted America" by Beth Macy, for example. I'd figured that opiate addiction was an unfortunate byproduct of a well-meaning intervention to alleviate pain, but no, it was a deliberate campaign coordinated around maximizing profits without care for human well-being.
"Glass House: The 1% Economy and the Shattering of the All-American Town" by Brian Alexander reveals that the Anchor Hocking Glass Co. of Lancaster, Ohio, wasn't done in by the forces of globalization, but by private equity investors from Wall Street who drained the lifeblood from the company like a bunch of vampires, profiting mightily in the process.
Two more recent reads brought these books to mind as they further shaped my views about how ordinary folks seem to be struggling beyond what's sensible, especially considering the fact that the United States of America is collectively richer than at any time in its history.
"Kochland: The Secret History of Koch Industries and Corporate Power in America" by Christopher Leonard offers a deep dive into Koch Industries, a company that Leonard notes has more revenue than Goldman Sachs, U.S. Steel, and Facebook combined.
Leonard, a longtime business reporter, illustrates how corporations more broadly are able to shape public policy via lobbying and contributions to politicians who have come to rely on them to fund their campaigns. Koch Industries have worked to degrade unions, resist taxing carbon and shape tax laws in their favor.
Unfortunately, influencing policy to their benefit also contributes to inaction on climate change and widening the income divide. It is sobering to think how much power a single, privately held company has over every aspect of our lives. Regardless of one's political orientation, this fact alone is chilling.
"The Economists' Hour: False Prophets, Free Markets, and the Fracture of Society" by Binyamin Applebaum explains how the negative forces explored in "Dopesick," "Glass House," and "Kochland" have been able to find such favor in both government and among the public: Professional economists have been calling the shots.
Applebaum, a business and economics writer for The New York Times, patiently covers why this may be a bad thing, showing all the things economists have gotten wrong because of their unquestioned embrace of unfettered markets as an unalloyed good.
The resulting disinvestment in public goods like education and infrastructure has led to expanding wealth inequality and paved the way for the kind of power that is concentrated in companies like Koch Industries -- power that even the collective will of the populace cannot seem to overcome.
Part history lesson, part extended argument for a more sensible and skeptical attitude, Applebaum is a believer in markets, but like many of the rest of us, he recognizes that something has been out of balance for quite a long time.
These books opened my eyes. They may prove useful to others as well.

Texto completo: SCRANTON - As a young boy, Rashad Jennings wore goofy glasses and struggled academically. His peers picked him last for kickball.
On Friday, the former NFL running back, best-selling author and “Dancing with the Stars” champion told Frances Willard Elementary School students to never settle.
“I remember what it was like to sit in those seats,” he said. “I don’t think I’m anything special, but I think I’m in a special place to influence.”
Jennings, who played for the Jacksonville Jaguars, Oakland Raiders and New York Giants, spent time in Lackawanna County this week to speak to students in Scranton and Riverside and help raise money for Allied Services’ dePaul School.
Jennings’ visit with Willard students was coordinated by teacher Juli Avvisato, who has known Jennings’ agent since childhood.
“I’m hoping students see some inspiration for what can be in their future,” Avvisato said. “I hope our students aspire to be anything they can be.”
Jennings, whose autobiography “The IF in Life: How to Get Off Life’s Sidelines and Become Your Best Self” spent time on the New York Times bestseller list, spoke to students about his children’s book series, Arcade. He emphasized the importance of reading and how he worked hard to overcome academic struggles.
After the speech in the auditorium at West Scranton High School, Jennings posed for photos and gave hugs. Students asked him about his favorite food (sushi), song (“Slow Dancing In A Burning Room” by John Mayer) and the hardest hit he felt in the NFL (from Clint Session).
Jennings, the season 24 champion of “Dancing with the Stars,” signed the cast of third grader Jaden Tavares, who said he now plans to keep his arm cast forever.
Aiden Diaz, 9, said Jennings inspired him to read. All Willard students will receive a signed copy of an Arcade series book.
“I like the Steelers, but the Giants are my second favorite team,” Aiden said. “I’ll definitely read his book.”

Texto completo: Retired NYPD Chief of Detectives John Keenan, who led the team of investigators that tracked and arrested "Son of Sam" serial killer David Berkowitz, died Thursday - just three months shy of his 100th birthday.
Keenan, a resident of Long Island, was a World War II veteran who served with the NYPD for 30 years before leaving the department in 1978, a few months after Berkowitz was arrested. He then served as Vice President of Operations for the New York Racing Association.
Both NYPD Police Commissioner James O'Neill and current NYPD Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea mourned Keenan's passing.
O'Neill said Chief Keenan "took the confession of '.44-caliber killer David Berkowitz" after Berkowitz's arrest in August 1977. The serial killer was ultimately convicted of murdering six people and wounding seven.
"I went up to him, (and) he said, 'I know you. You're a detective - Chief Keenan," Keenan said about meeting Berkowitz, a conversation he often recalled, according to O'Neill's tweet.
"'Yeah? Who are YOU?" Keenan asked the murder suspect.
"I'm the Son of Sam," Berkowitz replied.
Keenan was also the first chief of detectives to assign women police officers to the department's perennially male homicide squads.
At the time he said adding women to the homicide teams was "more than just a trend of women's lib" and that women "can upgrade the work of investigation squads," according to a 1977 article in the New York Times.
He also added that women on other detective assignments had shown a high degree of "tenacity and inquisitiveness - qualities that are especially important in homicide work."
Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea on Friday touted Keenan's contributions the department, and the war hero's victories on the battlefield.
"Truly saddened to learn that former Chief of Detectives John Keenan has passed," Shea wrote on Twitter. "A life of epic heroism, he stormed Normandy on D-Day, fought in the Battle of the Bulge & later, as the NYPD Chief of D's, took the confession from the Son of Sam. We salute you, sir. #FidelisAdMortem"
Grandson Kevin Brennan remembered Keenan as a generous man who was a lifelong learner and a voracious reader.
Brennan said his grandfather grew up during the depression and could not afford to go to college until years later.
"He knew more about a lot of subjects than any of us," said Brennan, 34. "He wasn't a know-it-all, by any means. If you ever sat and watched `Jeopardy' with him, he was incredibly knowledgeable."
"He was the central figure and the rock of our family," Brennan said.
Services for Keenan will held Sunday at 2 p.m. at the Reposing Macken Mortuary in Rockville Centre. A funeral mass will be held at St. Agnes Cathedral on Monday at 11 a.m.

While They Talk, He Shoots

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
The actress Pam Grier, 70, was bouncing with joy while she talked about her horses one July afternoon, in turquoise jewelry and a cowboy hat in a photo studio near Hudson Yards. She was visiting New York in part for a photo shoot with The New York Times Magazine's Talk column, in which the staff writer David Marchese interviews prominent people from different fields.
As Ms. Grier warmed up on set, she laughed, picked out the music, and told stories about Snoop Dogg and about running for planes, all as a young man in a pink T-shirt quickly and meticulously arranged the studio.
Watching that young man, Mamadi Doumbouya, photograph is watching someone do what he loves. He began photographing in high school, and just three years later, the 22-year-old's photographs have appeared in The New York Times Magazine, Port and The Cut.
Now, Mr. Doumbouya photographs the thrice-monthly Talk column for the Sunday Magazine. Mr. Marchese interviews people who are moving our culture, like the actor Nicolas Cage (who discussed dinosaur skulls and primal screaming), the soccer star Megan Rapinoe and the Georgia political figure Stacey Abrams (who is also a prolific romance novel writer -- who knew?), and Mr. Doumbouya photographs them all. He has traveled from New York to California and Hawaii for the column.
While photographing Ms. Grier in July, Mr. Doumbouya switched between three backdrops and numerous lights, manipulating colored gels to get the effect he wanted on his subject's face. Mr. Doumbouya often stands on an apple box to shoot from a slight angle above his subjects. He is quiet but encouraging as he clicks away. It takes him about two hours to set up, and sometimes he is given as little as a half-hour to photograph someone. (On assignment for New York Magazine at the Tribeca Film Festival, he was given one minute with each subject.) Subjects show up camera-ready, which means there are no makeup artists or stylists on set. "For the most part, you just jump right into the shoot," Mr. Doumbouya said.
Mr. Doumbouya's road to a professional photography career started when he was 19, three years after he had emigrated to New York from Guinea in 2013. He left most of his family behind at 15 to live with his father in the Bronx, and worked at his dad's cellphone store after school, fixing iPhone screens and making cases.
Mr. Doumbouya speaks four languages (20 languages are spoken in his native Guinea), and soon enrolled at the New Visions Charter High School for Advanced Math and Science in the Bronx. Another high school friend from Guinea, the young photographer Malike Sidibe, told him about an after-school photography program called Salt, and he decided to apply.
"When I first came to the U.S.," Mr. Doumbouya said, "I used to walk downtown and take a lot of photos on my phone. So I had something to show them when I applied."
Mr. Doumbouya knew he had found something he wanted to pursue from the start. "The first time I picked up a camera," he said, "all of this just happened naturally. I just had curiosity to get into certain things, and it led me here."
The Times Magazine's director of photography, Kathy Ryan, first saw Mr. Doumbouya's work at Salt's annual exhibition for students and alumni (Scott Thode, the curator of the show that year and a teacher at the organization, introduced them). "I was very impressed by his work," she said.
Several months later, Ms. Ryan tapped him to shoot for the Magazine's annual Voyages issue, the theme of which was family vacations around the world. When Mr. Doumbouya's family in Guinea celebrates Eid al-Adha, family members drive from hundreds of miles away to meet in their ancestral village near Kankan for the holiday.
"I was shooting so many family members, and people I hadn't seen in ages," Mr. Doumbouya said. "The last time they saw me, I was a baby. It was super emotional." It was his first time testing his mobile studio, setting up seamless backdrops and lights outside of a studio. The pictures of his cousins, great-aunt, niece and nephews appeared as his first magazine assignment in September 2017.
His first cover shoot came just a few months later: He photographed Spike Lee in The Times Magazine in November 2017, for a piece by Thomas Chatterton Williams on the director.
Now, Mr. Doumbouya often returns to the Salt program, from which he graduated just two years ago, to teach lighting classes and talk to current high school students. Alicia Hansen, the founder and chief executive of the nonprofit, says that it is inspiring for current high school students to see someone who is close to their age and successfully doing what he loves. "I think that's a lot more powerful than what the teachers can share with them," Ms. Hansen said. "We definitely brag about him quite a bit. We are very proud of what he's done."
Mr. Doumbouya said that most of the advice he gives to young photographers is simple. "Choose what you want to do," he said. "You can't be the best street photographer and a travel photographer and a lifestyle photographer and a photojournalist; you have to choose what you want."
Mr. Doumbouya won the Photo District News's Sony Tastemaker Award for leading as an influencer in the photography industry in 2018. Findhis portrait of Ms. Grier with this week's Talk column.

New Yorkers Welcome Swedish Activist, 16

Texto completo: "I feel hopeful seeing the power of all these people here today," one teenager said of the protest, which drew tens of thousands of demonstrators.
[Read more live coverage of the climate strikes .]
They packed Foley Square and the streets around City Hall, and jammed the stairs leading out of nearby subway stations. They carried handmade signs like one that said, "There is no plan(et) B," and chanted, "Sea levels are rising and so are we!" Later, they paraded out of the square, headed to another rally at Battery Park.
Frustrated by what they consider officials' failure to adequately address a crisis, thousands of young people marched through Lower Manhattan on Friday during a day of global climate protests.
Those who rallied said that too little was being done to stem the rise of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. One test of their message will come on Monday, when world leaders convene at the United Nations to discuss what they are ready to do about climate change.
The crowd totaled at least 60,000, according to an afternoon estimate from Mayor Bill de Blasio's office. In a sign of how difficult crowd sizes can be to pin down, organizers put the figure at 250,000. A permit had been issued for 5,000, prompting some organizers to joke that their efforts to publicize the event had been too successful.
Many of the participants were students who had the blessing of city school officials to take the day off. Schools excused the students' absence if they had their parents' permission to take part in the protests.
At Battery Park, demonstrators cheered when Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish activist who shot to global fame for inspiring worldwide student strikes, ascended a stage in the late afternoon and said, "This is the biggest climate strike in the history of the world."
Ms. Thunberg, who sailed to New York in an emissions-free yacht last month, directed part of her remarks at leaders setting climate policy.
"Change is coming whether they like it or not," she said, adding, "Do you think they hear us?"
Mina Garcia, 12, of Manhattan said that she was "astounded" by the experience of seeing Ms. Thunberg speak. "She's able to do so much," Mina said. "It shows no matter how small you are and how little you feel, you can stand up to someone and make a difference."
One of the youngest organizers of the New York event was Marisol Rivera, 13, who attends school in Brooklyn. Marisol was 6 when the roof of her house in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood collapsed during Hurricane Sandy, nearly hitting her.
She also has relatives in Puerto Rico whose lives were upended by Hurricane Maria two years ago. The strike in Manhattan was also billed as a "Puerto Rico Day of Action."
"I feel hopeful seeing the power of all these people here today, calling to end fossil fuels and build a better future for us," she said.
As the rally began in Foley Square, Mr. de Blasio's office said on Twitter that "The #ClimateStrike is about our future. Either we have one or we don't."
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo issued a statement on Friday that targeted climate change deniers. "Our young people understand climate change is no longer up for debate -- it's reality based in science." the statement said.
Andy Gao, 16, a junior at Brooklyn Technical High School, said that the recent pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong had inspired him to attend the demonstration in New York.
"They are fighting for their future," he said, "and people here care about our future, too. If our planet is burnt and polluted, what future will we have? Better to strike today than to stay in school and do nothing about it."
Ajani Stella, 13, an eighth-grader at Hunter College High School, said that he had been "invested in the movement for fossil fuel divestment." He said that when he was 10, he had taken the issue to the board of the Teachers' Retirement System of the City of New York, which, with 200,000 members, is one of the largest pension systems in the United States.
Amid the sophisticated discussions, it was clear that young people were driving the day. Signs dashed off in ballpoint pen or colored marker included insults about President Trump, and riffs on Dr. Seuss ("I speak for the trees!") and WALL-E, the movie robot that collects trash on a desolate Earth.
But the crowd was a New York crowd, with a range of personalities. The drag queen Lady Bunny, 57, carried a sign that read "I'm Greta's mom." (When asked if she was actually Greta's mother, Lady Bunny joked, "No, I'm her brother Hansel.")
"We've got to call out both political parties on climate change," said Lady Bunny, who was wearing a blond wig, generous false eyelashes and a blue-and-purple muumuu. Environmental activists were thrilled by officials' decision this week to allow the city's 1.1 million public school students to be excused from class for the protests.
Teachers and other school employees were told they could not attend because the Education Department had determined that doing so would violate rules ensuring a "politically neutral learning environment," as would schools staging their own protests on school property.
[Teachers in New York City were barred from attending protests .]
Yet at the usual morning drop-off time, elementary school students appeared to be staging rallies led by parents or the students themselves.
"P.S. 10 kids wouldn't take no for an answer," said Elizabeth Meister, whose fifth-grader at the school in Park Slope, Brooklyn, helped organize a demonstration at which children waved signs and sat down in their schoolyard for 15 minutes instead of filing in for class.
A planned field trip to a protest nearby had been canceled.
The decision to prohibit school staff members from participating in demonstrations underscored how hard it is to separate the politics of climate change from teaching the science of it -- even in liberal-leaning New York, and even in a school system that some experts consider a national leader in bringing climate-related issues to the classroom.
Many critics of the protest, including climate-change deniers, argued that Mr. de Blasio was using classroom attendance to promote a political aim. The New York Post's editorial board called the decision "out-and-out government sponsorship of a particular point of view."
Education Department officials did not say how many students missed school to attend the rally. They provided raw attendance figures, saying that 87.4 percent were in school on Friday, compared with 92.3 percent last Friday, a difference of about 53,900 students.
Michael Gold and Azi Paybarah contributed reporting.

Shoddy NYT report advances media siege on Kavanaugh

Información de publicación: Daily Herald ; Arlington Heights, Ill. [Arlington Heights, Ill]. 20 Sep 2019: 10.

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/shoddy-nyt-report-advances-media-siege-on/docview/2295356687/se-2?accountid=14708

Resumen: In it, the authors reported allegations by a Yale classmate that Kavanaugh was at a "drunken dorm party" where "friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student." With apologies to my grandmothers, the reason The Times’ writers likely included the penis-in-hand accusation at all is because it added context to the accusations by both Deborah Ramirez, who alleged last year that she experienced sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh at another boozy Yale party, and Christine Blasey Ford. Far more troubling is that several presidential candidates seemingly would impeach a Supreme Court justice on nothing more than hearsay — and impeachable journalism. © 2019, Washington Post Writers Group

Texto completo: The recent fiasco at The New York Times, which last weekend published the latest uncorroborated sexual-assault accusation against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, was a monument to hearsay and a travesty of journalistic ethics.
The story, since modified to include crucial information, was an adapted excerpt from a book — "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh," written by two Times’ staff writers, Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly. In it, the authors reported allegations by a Yale classmate that Kavanaugh was at a "drunken dorm party" where "friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student."
Setting aside the logistics of such a feat, more eye-popping was the omission from the original Times’ piece that the alleged victim refused to be interviewed for the book — and, according to friends, doesn’t remember any such incident.
Such an oversight is inexcusable.
The Times added these details to the story after they were flagged by The Federalist’s Mollie Hemingway, who had an advance copy of the book. The Times’ writers, who said that the details had been in the excerpt’s initial draft, made media rounds Monday and Tuesday to explain the omission and essentially blamed editors, who, they said, "in the haste" of trying to close out production, had deleted the reference.
The facts that the alleged victim refused to be interviewed by the authors and apparently told friends that she doesn’t recall any such incident amount to the very definition of a non-story. For the record, The Washington Post learned of the accusation last year but declined to publish it because the alleged witnesses weren’t identified and the woman said to be involved refused to comment.
Indeed, the authors’ only sources for the claim were two unnamed officials who spoke to Washington attorney Max Stier, who last year apparently told the FBI and various senators that he witnessed the alleged incident. But Stier refused to talk to the Times’ writers himself.
Some Democratic contenders for the presidency immediately called for Kavanaugh’s impeachment. They include Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Sen. Kamala Harris, former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
But let’s rewind the reel a bit. With apologies to my grandmothers, the reason The Times’ writers likely included the penis-in-hand accusation at all is because it added context to the accusations by both Deborah Ramirez, who alleged last year that she experienced sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh at another boozy Yale party, and Christine Blasey Ford.
Ramirez, for her part, initially wasn’t quite sure of events. She has admitted to time lapses and also to having been drunk, but told The New Yorker and the Times writers that she remembers brushing away a penis thrust in her face, allegedly by Kavanaugh.
If these stories are true, then Kavanaugh could have been a creepy, perhaps monstrous, drunk in his youth. But all we have to go by is alleged victims who also were drinking at the time and comments from former classmates, who may also have been inebriated, some of whom corroborate the Ramirez accusation and others who dispute it. The Times’ writers reported finding seven people who they say corroborated Ramirez’s story, but much of what they documented were second- and third-hand reports, things overheard and, yes, Ramirez’s mother, to whom she apparently said "Something happened at Yale."
Not exactly a wrap for justice.
The truth is, Kavanaugh has been the target of a media siege since his name was announced for consideration for the high court. Ramirez’s story was first reported by The New Yorker just days before Ford’s congressional testimony, which, frankly, was flimsy at best. None of the other four people Ford named as attending the high school party where she claimed Kavanaugh groped her recalled any such gathering. One of them, a close friend and the only other female, Leland Keyser, not only doesn’t remember the party — but says she’s never even met Kavanaugh.
What’s all too clear is that America’s privileged youth had a serious drinking problem in the early 1980s; and boozy memories from high school and young adulthood are unreliable. Far more troubling is that several presidential candidates seemingly would impeach a Supreme Court justice on nothing more than hearsay — and impeachable journalism.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The recent fiasco at The New York Times, which last weekend published the latest uncorroborated sexual-assault accusation against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, was a monument to hearsay and a travesty of journalistic ethics.
The story, since modified to include crucial information, was an adapted excerpt from a book — “The Education of Brett Kavanaugh,” written by two Times’ staff writers, Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly. In it, the authors reported allegations by a Yale classmate that Kavanaugh was at a “drunken dorm party” where “friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student.”

Homage to Ivins has Asheville connection

Texto completo: ASHEVILLE – For news junkies of a certain age, there's a kind of nostalgia watching the documentary "Raise Hell: The Life and Times of Molly Ivins."
Although it's been just 12 years since the legendary columnist died of cancer at age 62, her singular brand of whip-smart commentary and sharp-but-civil humor seem to come from a time long distant from today's street-fighting media landscape. Her death coincided with swift decline of in-depth print journalism, but her staunch defense of press freedom couldn't be more timely today.
"Raise Hell" premiered at Sundance earlier this year and won the audience award at the 2019 SXSW Festival. Asheville resident Maryedith Burrell served as creative consultant on the film and was instrumental in getting it to screen in Asheville, where it opens Sept. 20 at Grail Moviehouse.
A native of Houston and daughter of an oil company executive, Ivins' newspaper career started in the late '60s at the Houston Chronicle, but she soon went on to become the first female reporter at the Minneapolis Tribune, covering the social movements of the day. It was upon her return to Texas, though, that her career really took off. As investigative journalist and editor at The Texas Observer, her blend of hard-hitting reporting and humor caught the attention of the New York Times, where she served as political reporter, then Rocky Mountain bureau chief.
Six feet tall with a Texas twang and a constitution for strong language and strong liquor, Ivins occupied a special space in journalism. A Texas liberal, a hunter who advocated for gun control ("I'm not anti-gun, I'm pro-knife" she once wrote), a woman in a man's world — she brought a unique outsider's perspective to her work. Often compared to Mark Twain for her pointed wit and political insight, she had an inimitable way with words.
"We've had trickle down economics for 10 years and most of us aren't even damp yet," she wrote in the '90s. She was able to lambast politicians on both sides of the aisle with a wink and a smile and shrugged off death threats from detractors. Ivins was especially passionate about the First Amendment, and was a lifelong donor to the American Civil Liberties Union. Part of the proceeds from the film will be donated to the ACLU.
Ivins became a distinctive and sought-after voice in politics, contributing to The Nation, Harper's and The Atlantic among other outlets. But she's probably best known as a thorn in the side of George W. Bush (whom she knew growing up in Texas) and coiner of his infamous nickname "Shrub." Her 2003 book "Bushwhacked: Life in George W. Bush's America" was a New York Times bestseller.
Asheville's connection As creative consultant on the film, Asheville's Burrell worked on many different parts of project through the six years it took to make it. Burrell settled in Asheville in 2009, after a career in film and television that started with acting and went on to include screenwriting, producing and consulting.
Her involvement in the film sprung from her relationship with director Janice Engel, with whom she'd worked on previous projects. When Engel, a professor of documentary film at Academy of Art University in San Francisco, decided to make the film on Ivins, she found no shortage of supporters wanted to be involved.
"There's a reason we got Dan Rather, Rachel Maddow, Paul Begala, Cecile Richards, etc. to say 'yes' to interviews," says Burrell. "They all loved Molly and knew her message about freedom of the press, the First Amendment, and active citizenship was important in 2007 and is even more important right now. They believed Molly needed to be heard."
It's inevitable to wonder what Ivins would think of the current administration and attacks on the media. "She'd probably have a column in Politico. She'd be a frequent guest on Bill Maher," says Burrell. The film's title come from an Ivins quote on civic engagement "Raise hell — big time... My word, there's a world out there that needs fixing. Get out there and get after it."

Proposal: Free college tuition for NM students

Texto completo: Flynn pointed to an industry study predicting the industry could attract $174 billion in infrastructure investments in the Permian Basin through 2030.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced a plan Wednesday that would make New Mexico the second state to offer full college tuition to state residents.
The governor announced her plan at the state's Higher Education Summit at Central New Mexico Community College in Albuquerque. The proposal is for a "last dollar" program covering 100 percent of undergraduate tuition and fees not paid for by federal grants or the New Mexico Lottery Scholarship.
Branded the New Mexico Opportunity Scholarship, the plan is estimated to benefit 55,000 New Mexico students at all 29 public higher education institutions in the state, beginning in the fall of 2020.
The scholarship, applicable to two- and four-year institutions, would be administered by the New Mexico Higher Education Department and available for New Mexico residents with a high school diploma or equivalency. A minimum grade-point average of 2.5 would be a requirement of the scholarship.
In a statement, Lujan Grisham called it "a game-changer for New Mexico" and said it would culminate in "improved outcomes for New Mexico workers and families and parents (and) a better trained and better compensated workforce."
Ultimately, her proposal would require approval in the state legislature.
Role of oil and gas industry The New York Times broke news of the governor's proposal Wednesday morning, stating that the governor "plans to use climbing revenues from oil production to pay for much of the costs" of the scholarship.
New Mexico Oil and Gas Association Executive Director Ryan Flynn issued a statement following the announcement.
"Big, bold ideas like this are the type the transformational opportunities New Mexico now has because of the success and growth of the oil and natural gas industry," Flynn said. "This is a great example of how the Governor can leverage increased oil and natural gas production to the benefit of all New Mexicans regardless of where they live, work, or go to school. Our state has enjoyed two consecutive billion-dollar budget surpluses on the strength oil and natural gas, and we're committed to continuing our role as the economic foundation of New Mexico while safely and responsibly producing the energy we need."
Flynn pointed to an industry study predicting the industry could attract $174 billion in infrastructure investments in the Permian Basin through 2030.
Presently, a boom in production and recent discovery of more supply in the Permian Basic has boosted general fund revenue fiscal year far exceeding the state's current $7 billion budget.
Executives of oil and gas companies attending an annual energy summit in Carlsbad last week expressed confidence in long-term production in the region.
However, prior to an upturn in revenue from the oil and gas industry in 2018, sagging tax revenues from the oil and gas sector in 2016 led to deep cuts in public K-12 education.
'It requires a commitment of priorities' In attendance at the higher education summit was Western New Mexico University President Joseph Shepard, who said he first heard rumors of the governor's proposal on Tuesday and likened it to the Apollo mission.
Her announcement to the summit did not include details, he said, but presented an objective Shepard likened to President John F. Kennedy's 1961 challenge to place an astronaut safely on the moon within that decade.
Lujan Grisham herself has frequently described her ambition for improving education in New Mexico as a "moonshot."
Shepard acknowledged the need to assess consistent revenue streams supporting the program.
"It requires a commitment of priorities — the moonshot, so to speak," Shepard said when reached by phone in Albuquerque. "Often we say, 'we don't have the budget for it,' but budget is about how we allocate resources."
He also said, to those who criticize New Mexico's economy for being overly reliant on revenue from the oil and gas industry, that increasing affordable access to higher education was essential for diversifying the state's economy.
Shepard said the plan's next step will be the New Mexico Higher Education Advisory Committee, which includes state cabinet secretaries for higher education, the department of workforce solutions, finance and administration, economic development, and the director of the legislative finance committee, or delegates.
Tribal colleges included in proposal The governor's office confirmed Wednesday that the tuition proposal would include New Mexico's four tribal colleges: Navajo Technical University in Crownpoint, Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute in Albuquerque, Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe and the Crownpoint and Shiprock campuses of Diné College.
Diné College President Charles "Monty" Roessel hailed the proposal, which follows legislation earlier this year opening lottery scholarships to students at tribal colleges in New Mexico.
"I think it's a great plan and I give the governor a lot of credit," Roessel said, adding, "I think it's a wonderful opportunity for all Native Americans."
Roessel was also in attendance at the summit.
A gift to Texas and Arizona? Executive vice president Ed DesPlas of San Juan College in Farmington said, "This will effectively close the gaps between our skills and education base and our workforce and employer needs. The Opportunity Scholarship would provide equity across the board – New Mexico will become a place where opportunity prevails."
A Republican critic, however, said it might boost opportunity elsewhere instead.
Gavin Clarkson, who taught at New Mexico State University's college of business prior to serving in the Trump Administration, and is currently a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate, criticized the governor's proposal.
"Unfortunately, making public colleges free for even the wealthiest of families will be a big boon to workforce development — in Texas and Arizona," Clarkson said in a statement. "It does nothing to address the lack of high-quality jobs that would keep our college graduates here in New Mexico."
Clarkson added, "If we're going to subsidize higher education, we owe it to both students and taxpayers to target those resources towards empowering citizens with the kind of skills that will actually add value to New Mexico's economy."
Preparing for a 21st-century economy The proposal was welcome news to Tracey Bryan, CEO of the nonprofit Bridge of Southern New Mexico, which promotes educational advancement and workforce development in Doña Ana County.
"We know that as little as $500 can stand in the way of a student finishing a degree," Bryan said. "If this proposal can bridge those financial gaps, then it's an investment that will pay off in long-term returns to the state."
New Mexico State University Chancellor Dan Arvizu was also in attendance at Wednesday's summit.
In a statement, Arvizu wrote, "No matter what socioeconomic background our students arrive from, attaining a degree positions them to earn higher salaries, to live healthier lives and to achieve greater successes than someone without a degree. In turn, this helps their families and lifts the communities where they live. We are eager to see where this endeavor can lead our state. Right now, we are assessing what implications this announcement may have for the entire NMSU system."
Workforce Solutions Secretary Bill McCamley called the governor's proposal "brave" yet essential for helping new generations of New Mexico workers. He said that students who continue their education beyond secondary school with minimal student debt will have more options to explore job opportunities or establish themselves as entrepreneurs.
"Since 2008 and the great recession, over 95 percent of the new jobs that have been created in the country require more than a high school degree," McCamley said. "We're not just talking about bachelor's degrees, we're talking about associate's degrees and industry-specific certificates. The point of it is, you need more than a high school degree to make it in a 21st-century economy and that's why the governor's proposal is so important."
Hannah Grover and Noel Lyn Smith of the Farmington Daily Times contributed to this report.

Branded the New Mexico Opportunity Scholarship, the plan is estimated to benefit 55,000 New Mexico students at all 29 public higher education institutions in the state, beginning in the fall of 2020.
The scholarship, applicable to two- and four-year institutions, would be administered by the New Mexico Higher Education Department and available for New Mexico residents with a high school diploma or equivalency. A minimum grade-point average of 2.5 would be a requirement of the scholarship.
In a statement, Lujan Grisham called it "a game-changer for New Mexico" and said it would culminate in "improved outcomes for New Mexico workers and families and parents (and) a better trained and better compensated workforce."
Ultimately, her proposal would require approval in the state legislature.
Role of oil and gas industry The New York Times broke news of the governor's proposal Wednesday morning, stating that the governor "plans to use climbing revenues from oil production to pay for much of the costs" of the scholarship.
New Mexico Oil and Gas Association Executive Director Ryan Flynn issued a statement following the announcement.
"Big, bold ideas like this are the type the transformational opportunities New Mexico now has because of the success and growth of the oil and natural gas industry," Flynn said. "This is a great example of how the Governor can leverage increased oil and natural gas production to the benefit of all New Mexicans regardless of where they live, work, or go to school. Our state has enjoyed two consecutive billion-dollar budget surpluses on the strength oil and natural gas, and we're committed to continuing our role as the economic foundation of New Mexico while safely and responsibly producing the energy we need."
Flynn pointed to an industry study predicting the industry could attract $174 billion in infrastructure investments in the Permian Basin through 2030.
Presently, a boom in production and recent discovery of more supply in the Permian Basic has boosted general fund revenue fiscal year far exceeding the state's current $7 billion budget.
Executives of oil and gas companies attending an annual energy summit in Carlsbad last week expressed confidence in long-term production in the region. However, prior to an upturn in revenue from the oil and gas industry in 2018, sagging tax revenues from the oil and gas sector in 2016 led to deep cuts in public K-12 education.
'Commitment of priorities' In attendance at the higher education summit was Western New Mexico University President Joseph Shepard, who said he first heard rumors of the governor's proposal on Tuesday and likened it to the Apollo mission.
Her announcement to the summit did not include details, he said, but presented an objective Shepard likened to President John F. Kennedy's 1961 challenge to place an astronaut safely on the moon within that decade.
Lujan Grisham herself has frequently described her ambition for improving education in New Mexico as a "moonshot."
Shepard acknowledged the need to assess consistent revenue streams supporting the program.
"It requires a commitment of priorities — the moonshot, so to speak," Shepard said when reached by phone in Albuquerque. "Often we say, 'we don't have the budget for it,' but budget is about how we allocate resources."
He also said, to those who criticize New Mexico's economy for being overly reliant on revenue from the oil and gas industry, that increasing affordable access to higher education was essential for diversifying the state's economy.
Shepard said the plan's next step will be the New Mexico Higher Education Advisory Committee, which includes state cabinet secretaries for higher education, the department of workforce solutions, finance and administration, economic development, and the director of the legislative finance committee, or delegates.
Tribal colleges included The governor's office confirmed Wednesday that the tuition proposal would include New Mexico's four tribal colleges: Navajo Technical University in Crownpoint, Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute in Albuquerque, Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe and the Crownpoint and Shiprock campuses of Diné College.
Diné College President Charles "Monty" Roessel hailed the proposal, which follows legislation earlier this year opening lottery scholarships to students at tribal colleges in New Mexico.
"I think it's a great plan and I give the governor a lot of credit," Roessel said, adding, "I think it's a wonderful opportunity for all Native Americans."
Roessel was also in attendance at the summit.
A gift to Texas and Arizona? Gavin Clarkson, who taught at New Mexico State University's college of business prior to serving in the Trump Administration and is currently a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate, criticized the proposal.
"Unfortunately, making public colleges free for even the wealthiest of families will be a big boon to workforce development — in Texas and Arizona," Clarkson said in a statement. "It does nothing to address the lack of high-quality jobs that would keep our college graduates here in New Mexico."
Clarkson added, "If we're going to subsidize higher education, we owe it to both students and taxpayers to target those resources towards empowering citizens with the kind of skills that will actually add value to New Mexico's economy."
Preparing for 21st century New Mexico State University Chancellor Dan Arvizu was also in attendance at Wednesday's summit.
In a statement, Arvizu wrote, "No matter what socioeconomic background our students arrive from, attaining a degree positions them to earn higher salaries, to live healthier lives and to achieve greater successes than someone without a degree. In turn, this helps their families and lifts the communities where they live. We are eager to see where this endeavor can lead our state. Right now, we are assessing what implications this announcement may have for the entire NMSU system."
Workforce Solutions Secretary Bill McCamley called the governor's proposal "brave" yet essential for helping new generations of New Mexico workers. He said that students who continue their education beyond secondary school with minimal student debt will have more options to explore job opportunities or establish themselves as entrepreneurs.
"Since 2008 and the great recession, over 95 percent of the new jobs that have been created in the country require more than a high school degree," McCamley said. "We're not just talking about bachelor's degrees, we're talking about associate's degrees and industry-specific certificates. The point of it is, you need more than a high school degree to make it in a 21st-century economy and that's why the governor's proposal is so important."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The recent fiasco at The New York Times, which last weekend published the latest uncorroborated sexual-assault accusation against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, was a monument to hearsay and a travesty of journalistic ethics.
The story, since modified to include crucial information, was an adapted excerpt from a book – "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh," written by two Times' staff writers, Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly. In it, the authors reported allegations by a Yale classmate that Kavanaugh was at a "drunken dorm party" where "friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student."
Setting aside the logistics of such a feat, more eye-popping was the omission from the original Times' piece that the alleged victim refused to be interviewed for the book – and, according to friends, doesn't remember any such incident.
Such an oversight is inexcusable.
The Times added these details to the story after they were flagged by The Federalist's Mollie Hemingway, who had an advance copy of the book. The Times' writers, who said that the details had been in the excerpt's initial draft, made media rounds Monday and Tuesday to explain the omission and essentially blamed editors, who, they said, "in the haste" of trying to close out production, had deleted the reference.
The facts that the alleged victim refused to be interviewed by the authors and apparently told friends that she doesn't recall any such incident amount to the very definition of a non-story. For the record, The Washington Post learned of the accusation last year but declined to publish it because the alleged witnesses weren't identified and the woman said to be involved refused to comment.
Indeed, the authors' only sources for the claim were two unnamed officials who spoke to Washington attorney Max Stier, who last year apparently told the FBI and various senators that he witnessed the alleged incident. But Stier refused to talk to the Times' writers himself.
Some Democratic contenders for the presidency immediately called for Kavanaugh's impeachment. They include Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Sen. Kamala Harris, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
But let's rewind the reel a bit. With apologies to my grandmothers, the reason The Times' writers likely included the penis-in-hand accusation at all is because it added context to the accusations by both Deborah Ramirez, who alleged last year that she experienced sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh at another boozy Yale party, and Christine Blasey Ford.
Ramirez, for her part, initially wasn't quite sure of events. She has admitted to time lapses and also to having been drunk, but told The New Yorker and the Times writers that she remembers brushing away a penis thrust in her face, allegedly by Kavanaugh.
If these stories are true, then Kavanaugh could have been a creepy, perhaps monstrous, drunk in his youth.
But all we have to go by is alleged victims who also were drinking at the time and comments from former classmates, who may also have been inebriated, some of whom corroborate the Ramirez accusation and others who dispute it. The Times' writers reported finding seven people who they say corroborated Ramirez's story, but much of what they documented were second- and third-hand reports, things overheard and, yes, Ramirez's mother, to whom she apparently said "Something happened at Yale."
Not exactly a wrap for justice.
The truth is, Kavanaugh has been the target of a media siege since his name was announced for consideration for the high court. Ramirez's story was first reported by The New Yorker just days before Ford's congressional testimony, which, frankly, was flimsy at best. None of the other four people Ford named as attending the high school party where she claimed Kavanaugh groped her recalled any such gathering. One of them, a close friend and the only other female, Leland Keyser, not only doesn't remember the party – but says she's never even met Kavanaugh.
What's all too clear is that America's privileged youth had a serious drinking problem in the early 1980s; and boozy memories from high school and young adulthood are unreliable. Far more troubling is that several presidential candidates seemingly would impeach a Supreme Court justice on nothing more than hearsay – and impeachable journalism.

Texto completo: New York Yankees pitcher Domingo Germán has been placed on administrative leave due to the MLB's domestic violence policy, the league announced Thursday.
MLB announced that it will undergo an investigation into Germán, but did not specifically say what his alleged actions are. The specifics of the incident were not announced as the league investigates the situation.
Bob Klapisch of the New York Times reported Thursday afternoon on social media that the incident with Germán involved his girlfriend and occurred between late Monday night and Tuesday morning.
The Yankees released a statement on Thursday in response to MLB's decision.
"We fully support all measures being undertaken by the commissioner's office pursuant to the policy of domestic violence. We support this policy which reinforces that domestic violence has no place in our society and cannot be tolerated. We have followed the lead of Major League Baseball and will continue to provide our complete cooperation throughout the investigative process. We reserve any further comment until the investigation reaches its conclusion. All questions pertaining to this matter should be directed to the office of the commissioner."
Yankees manager Aaron Boone told reporters Thursday afternoon that he learned of Germán's placement on the ride to Yankee Stadium.
"I heard some of the whispers and what not, but this is a Major League Baseball investigation and issue, so we are just trying to be as cooperative as we can while this goes on," Boone said.
It remains a mystery as to whether the Yankees were aware of a pending move by the league regarding Germán. The 27-year-old appeared in Wednesday's 3-2 loss to the Los Angeles Angels, tossing 21/3 scoreless innings in relief. Germán is 18-4 with a 4.03 ERA in 143 innings this season.
"It was vague to me," Boone said about hearing of the incident. Boone said he was not sure he knew if Germán was aware before pitching on Wednesday.
According to Boone, players were not informed of the move by the league before it was announced to the public. When Boone was asked if he knew anything before Wednesday's game, the manager said he could not comment further on an active league investigation.
"It's a Major League issue and we are kind of in a stand down mode," Boone said.
Boone and general manager Brian Cashman will address the team before Thursday night's game regarding the incident.
"I haven't thought of exactly what I'll say," Boone said. "Obviously, this is fresh. I'll get up there and talk as a group and as a family and speak from the heart."
With the move to place Germán on administrative leave, the Yankees brought up right-handed pitcher Michael King to the active roster. Under the administrative leave, Germán cannot have contact with the team while the matter is being investigated.

Texto completo: A documentary on PBS revisits a 1918 Texas massacre. And a "Between Two Ferns" movie hits Netflix.
What's on TV
VOCES 10 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). "For years after the massacre, horses would rear and wouldn't go near the spot where those bodies lay." That's from "Porvenir, Texas," an hourlong documentary that will air Friday night as part of this PBS program dedicated to Latino culture. The documentary takes as its subject a 1918 Texas massacre that left 15 people of Mexican descent dead and involved Texas Rangers and United States Army cavalry soldiers. The event serves here as a way to discuss the period from the mid-19th century into the 20th century during which thousands of Latino men, women and children were killed by lynch mobs in the American West.
What's Streaming
BETWEEN TWO FERNS: THE MOVIE (2019) Stream on Netflix. It's fair to say that the first joke in "Between Two Ferns: The Movie" comes before the movie even starts. After all, you could scarcely find source material with less potential for feature-length adaptation than "Between Two Ferns," the long running web series where the comedian Zach Galifianakis has hosted short spoof interviews with actors and other famous people, like Charlize Theron and Barack Obama. Adding "The Movie" to the title reads like a punch line in itself. But somehow a feature film has been wrestled out of the series. Directed by Scott Aukerman, the movie's self-referential plot follows Galifianakis (playing a version of himself) on a quest to complete a series of celebrity interviews.
PEAKING Steam on CW platforms and Red Bull TV. Each entry in this series follows a professional athlete in the lead-up to an important event. The lineup includes the Olympic snowboarder Mark McMorris, the motocross rider James Stewart, the Olympic mountain bike rider Jenny Rissveds and the big-wave surfer Peter Mel. Asked at the beginning of an episode whether or not he's worried by the prospect of riding a particularly enormous wave, Mel gives an honest response that only a veteran would: "Of course I am."
THE IMMIGRANT (2014) Rent on Amazon, iTunes and Vudu. The director James Gray returns to movie theaters this weekend with "Ad Astra," a story about a man who journeys to mysterious corners of space. With "The Immigrant," Gray directed a story about a woman who crosses the Atlantic Ocean in search of a better life on a mysterious new continent. That continent is North America, and that woman is Ewa Cybulska, a Polish immigrant who arrives at Ellis Island in 1921. Soon threatened with deportation, Ewa is saved at the last minute by Bruno Weiss, a representative of the Travelers Aid Society played by Joaquin Phoenix. Weiss is also a pimp who produces burlesque shows, and Ewa's time with him quickly comes to involve illicit business. "The film is earnestly and unabashedly melodramatic to an extent that may baffle audiences accustomed to clever, knowing historical fictions," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. "But it also has a depth and purity of feeling that makes other movies feel timid and small by comparison."

Texto completo: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced a plan Wednesday that would make New Mexico the second state to offer full college tuition to state residents.
The governor announced her plan at the state's Higher Education Summit at Central New Mexico Community College in Albuquerque. The proposal is for a "last dollar" program covering 100 percent of undergraduate tuition and fees not paid for by federal grants or the New Mexico Lottery Scholarship.
Branded the New Mexico Opportunity Scholarship, the plan is estimated to benefit 55,000 New Mexico students at all 29 public higher education institutions in the state, beginning in the fall of 2020.
The scholarship, applicable to two- and four-year institutions, would be administered by the New Mexico Higher Education Department and available for New Mexico residents with a high school diploma or equivalency. A minimum grade-point average of 2.5 would be a requirement of the scholarship.
In a statement, Lujan Grisham called it "a game-changer for New Mexico" and said it would culminate in "improved outcomes for New Mexico workers and families and parents (and) a better trained and better compensated workforce."
Ultimately, her proposal would require approval in the state legislature.
Role of oil and gas industry The New York Times broke news of the governor's proposal Wednesday morning, stating that the governor "plans to use climbing revenues from oil production to pay for much of the costs" of the scholarship.
New Mexico Oil and Gas Association Executive Director Ryan Flynn issued a statement following the announcement.
"Big, bold ideas like this are the type the transformational opportunities New Mexico now has because of the success and growth of the oil and natural gas industry," Flynn said. "This is a great example of how the Governor can leverage increased oil and natural gas production to the benefit of all New Mexicans regardless of where they live, work, or go to school. Our state has enjoyed two consecutive billion-dollar budget surpluses on the strength oil and natural gas, and we're committed to continuing our role as the economic foundation of New Mexico while safely and responsibly producing the energy we need."
Flynn pointed to an industry study predicting the industry could attract $174 billion in infrastructure investments in the Permian Basin through 2030.
Presently, a boom in production and recent discovery of more supply in the Permian Basic has boosted general fund revenue fiscal year far exceeding the state's current $7 billion budget.
Executives of oil and gas companies attending an annual energy summit in Carlsbad last week expressed confidence in long-term production in the region.
However, prior to an upturn in revenue from the oil and gas industry in 2018, sagging tax revenues from the oil and gas sector in 2016 led to deep cuts in public K-12 education.
'Commitment of priorities' In attendance at the higher education summit was Western New Mexico University President Joseph Shepard, who said he first heard rumors of the governor's proposal on Tuesday and likened it to the Apollo mission.
Her announcement to the summit did not include details, he said, but presented an objective Shepard likened to President John F. Kennedy's 1961 challenge to place an astronaut safely on the moon within that decade.
Lujan Grisham herself has frequently described her ambition for improving education in New Mexico as a "moonshot."
Shepard acknowledged the need to assess consistent revenue streams supporting the program.
"It requires a commitment of priorities — the moonshot, so to speak," Shepard said when reached by phone in Albuquerque. "Often we say, 'we don't have the budget for it,' but budget is about how we allocate resources."
He also said, to those who criticize New Mexico's economy for being overly reliant on revenue from the oil and gas industry, that increasing affordable access to higher education was essential for diversifying the state's economy.
Shepard said the plan's next step will be the New Mexico Higher Education Advisory Committee, which includes state cabinet secretaries for higher education, the department of workforce solutions, finance and administration, economic development, and the director of the legislative finance committee, or delegates.
Tribal colleges included The governor's office confirmed Wednesday that the tuition proposal would include New Mexico's four tribal colleges: Navajo Technical University in Crownpoint, Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute in Albuquerque, Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe and the Crownpoint and Shiprock campuses of Diné College.
Diné College President Charles "Monty" Roessel hailed the proposal, which follows legislation earlier this year opening lottery scholarships to students at tribal colleges in New Mexico.
"I think it's a great plan and I give the governor a lot of credit," Roessel said, adding, "I think it's a wonderful opportunity for all Native Americans."
Roessel was also in attendance at the summit.
A gift to Texas and Arizona? Gavin Clarkson, who taught at New Mexico State University's college of business prior to serving in the Trump Administration and is currently a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate, criticized the proposal.
"Unfortunately, making public colleges free for even the wealthiest of families will be a big boon to workforce development — in Texas and Arizona," Clarkson said in a statement. "It does nothing to address the lack of high-quality jobs that would keep our college graduates here in New Mexico."
Clarkson added, "If we're going to subsidize higher education, we owe it to both students and taxpayers to target those resources towards empowering citizens with the kind of skills that will actually add value to New Mexico's economy."
Preparing for 21st century New Mexico State University Chancellor Dan Arvizu was also in attendance at Wednesday's summit.
In a statement, Arvizu wrote, "No matter what socioeconomic background our students arrive from, attaining a degree positions them to earn higher salaries, to live healthier lives and to achieve greater successes than someone without a degree. In turn, this helps their families and lifts the communities where they live. We are eager to see where this endeavor can lead our state. Right now, we are assessing what implications this announcement may have for the entire NMSU system."
Workforce Solutions Secretary Bill McCamley called the governor's proposal "brave" yet essential for helping new generations of New Mexico workers. He said that students who continue their education beyond secondary school with minimal student debt will have more options to explore job opportunities or establish themselves as entrepreneurs.
"Since 2008 and the great recession, over 95 percent of the new jobs that have been created in the country require more than a high school degree," McCamley said. "We're not just talking about bachelor's degrees, we're talking about associate's degrees and industry-specific certificates. The point of it is, you need more than a high school degree to make it in a 21st-century economy and that's why the governor's proposal is so important."

Texto completo: The recent fiasco at the New York Times, which last weekend published the latest uncorroborated sexual assault accusation against Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, was a monument to hearsay and a travesty of journalistic ethics.
The story, since modified to include crucial information, was an adapted excerpt from a book, "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh," written by two Times staff writers, Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly. In it, the authors reported allegations by a Yale classmate that Kavanaugh was at a "drunken dorm party" where "friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student."
Setting aside the logistics of such a feat, more eye-popping was the omission from the original Times piece that the alleged victim refused to be interviewed for the book - and, according to friends, doesn't remember any such incident .
Such an oversight is inexcusable.
The Times added these details to the story after they were flagged by the Federalist's Mollie Hemingway, who had an advance copy of the book. The Times writers, who said the details had been in the excerpt's initial draft, made media rounds Monday and Tuesday to explain the omission and essentially blamed editors, who, they said, "in the haste" of trying to close out production, had deleted the reference.
The fact that the alleged victim refused to be interviewed by the authors, and apparently told friends that she doesn't recall any such incident, amount to the very definition of a non-story. For the record, The Post learned of the accusation last year but declined to publish it because the alleged witnesses weren't identified and the woman said to be involved refused to comment.
Indeed, the authors' only sources for the claim were two unnamed officials who spoke to Washington attorney Max Stier, who last year apparently told the FBI and various senators that he witnessed the alleged incident. But Stier refused to talk to the Times writers himself.
Some Democratic contenders for the presidency immediately called for Kavanaugh's impeachment. They include Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), former representative Beto O'Rourke (Tex.) and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
But let's rewind the reel a bit. With apologies to my grandmothers, the reason the Times writers likely included the penis-in-hand accusation at all is because it added context to the accusations by both Deborah Ramirez, who alleged last year that she experienced sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh at another boozy Yale party, and Christine Blasey Ford.
Ramirez, for her part, initially wasn't quite sure of events. She has admitted to time lapses and also to having been drunk, but told the New Yorker and the Times writers that she remembers brushing away a penis thrust in her face, allegedly by Kavanaugh.
If these stories are true, then Kavanaugh could have been a creepy, perhaps monstrous, drunk in his youth. But all we have to go by are alleged victims who also were drinking at the time, and comments from former classmates - who may also have been inebriated - some of whom corroborate the Ramirez accusation and others who dispute it. The Times writers reported finding seven people who they say corroborated Ramirez's story, but much of what they documented were second- and third-hand reports, things overheard and, yes, Ramirez's mother, to whom she apparently said, "Something happened at Yale."
Not exactly a wrap for justice.
The truth is, Kavanaugh has been the target of a media siege since his name was announced for consideration for the high court. Ramirez's story was first reported by the New Yorker just days before Ford's congressional testimony, which, frankly, was flimsy at best. None of the other four people Ford named as attending the high school party where she claimed Kavanaugh groped her recalled any such gathering. One of them, a close friend of Ford and the only other female, Leland Keyser , not only doesn't remember the party but also says she's never even met Kavanaugh.
What's all too clear is that America's privileged youth had a serious drinking problem in the early 1980s, and boozy memories from high school and young adulthood are unreliable. Far more troubling is that several presidential candidates seemingly would impeach a Supreme Court justice on nothing more than hearsay - and impeachable journalism.

Fed cuts interest rates by another quarter point

Texto completo: Washington • The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point Wednesday, its second cut since late July, and suggested it was prepared to move aggressively if the U.S. economy showed additional signs of weakening.
A growing number of Fed officials expect one more cut this year, based on economic projections released following the meeting, in line with investor and economist expectations.
But the Fed’s announcement Wednesday did little to appease President Donald Trump, who has been pushing the central bank to cut interest rates to zero — or even into negative territory. The Fed’s policy interest rate is now set in a range of 1.75% to 2%, and not a single official sees it falling lower than 1.5% to 1.75% through the end of 2022.
“Our eyes are open, we’re watching the situation,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference, explaining that the Fed will stop cutting rates to sustain the expansion “when we think we’ve done enough.”
“There may come a time when the economy weakens and we would have to cut more aggressively,” he said. “We don’t know.”
That approach was not drastic enough for the president.
“Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve Fail Again,” Trump said in a tweet shortly after the Fed’s announcement. “No ‘guts,’ no sense, no vision! A terrible communicator!”
Stocks, which were down slightly before the announcement, fell further afterward. Shortly before 2:30 p.m., the S&P 500 was down 0.7% and the Nasdaq was down 1%. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was down on the day, at roughly 1.77%.
The Fed’s decision-making has been complicated by mixed economic signals. While risks cloud the horizon, economic data remain solid, creating a complicated backdrop. Businesses are hiring and consumers are spending, but Trump’s trade war and prospects of an unruly British withdrawal from the European Union have markets on edge. Inflation has been stuck below the Fed’s 2% target, giving officials room to lower rates without worrying about runaway price gains.
Powell, speaking at a news conference Wednesday, said the decision to cut rates stemmed from a need to guard against “some notable developments” and “ongoing risks.” Powell said trade uncertainty and geopolitical tensions necessitated action.
“Since the middle of last year the global growth outlook has weakened,” he said. “Trade policy tensions have waxed and waned” he said, adding that “elevated uncertainty” is weighing on business investment and exports.
While the U.S. economy remains strong and unemployment is low “there are risks to this positive outlook,” he said, adding that if the economy weakens, a “more extensive” series of rate cuts would be appropriate.
In its official statement after its meeting, the Fed said that policymakers “will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion.”
While the median Fed official expects rates to stay at the current level through the end of the year, 7 of 17 expect another rate cut. No officials had expected rates a third cut this year when the central bank last released economic projections, in June, suggesting that momentum is shifting toward additional accommodation.
Powell acknowledged that shift, saying the change in the Fed’s policy stance over the course of the year is “the main takeaway.”
But officials are increasingly divided over what happens next. Three members of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee dissented in this month’s vote. James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, wanted a more drastic half-point rate cut and voted against moving by just a quarter point. Esther George, who heads the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, and Eric Rosengren, who heads the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, thought that the central bank should keep borrowing costs steady. George and Rosengren also voted against the July rate cut.
Powell acknowledged the divisions, calling it “a time of difficult judgments” but saying he welcomed “diverse perspectives.”
He added that the bulk of the committee is going “meeting by meeting.”
The dissents underscore the economic and political challenges facing the Fed.
While the Fed operates independently of the White House and answers to Congress, Trump has made a regular habit of criticizing Powell and his colleagues.
“The Federal Reserve should get our interest rates down to ZERO, or less,” Trump tweeted on Sept. 11. “It is only the naïveté of Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve that doesn’t allow us to do what other countries are already doing.”
Officials regularly say that they set policy with an eye to the longer-term economic outlook, not short-term political concerns, but Trump’s onslaught creates an optics problem for the Fed. Some share of the population could see rate cuts, like Wednesday’s, as a sign that the central bank is caving to political pressure, particularly given that it was not a unanimous decision.
But there is an economic rationale for lowering rates sooner rather than later, since doing so could keep credit flowing, helping to keep consumer and business spending as uncertainty climbs.
The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index has drifted lower recently on the back of trade concerns, and jitters about the U.S. economy were also reflected in the Business Roundtable’s CEO Economic Outlook Index, which declined to a three year low in the third quarter.
Chief executives of the nation’s largest corporations have sharply lowered their plans for capital investment and their expectations for sales. Trade tensions were cited as a major factor for the worry that companies are feeling.
At the same time, employers are still hiring, wages are gradually rising and Americans in their prime have been coming back into the labor force. As households take home better paychecks, their spending is holding up, fueling strong retail sales. Even the housing market, which has struggled this year, shows signs of firming.
But global risks abound. Germany seems to be teetering on the brink of recession. Britain’s exit from the European Union remains fraught, and the United States’ trade war with China is dragging on.
Trump has placed tariffs on $360 billion worth of Chinese goods and plans to impose levies on nearly all Chinese imports by the end of the year. While the two nations are back at the negotiating table, it is unclear whether and when a deal could be reached.
The Fed has also struggled to coax inflation up to its 2% goal. The central bank aims for steady inflation that is low enough to allow for consumer comfort but high enough to leave policymakers extra headroom to cut interest rates, which include price gains, during a downturn.
Inflation came in at 1.6% in July, based on the Fed’s preferred gauge, and has been mired below-target for years. Inflation expectations, as measured by one New York Fed survey, have slipped both in the short- and the longer-term.
The Fed also lowered the rate of interest it pays on reserves — money commercial banks park at the central bank — to 1.8%, a 0.2 percentage point below the top of the Fed’s preferred range. That technical tweak is meant to keep the fed funds rate, which has been creeping up, anchored within its range.

Texto completo: Just a few days before The New York Times and Democratic presidential candidates engaged in an outrageous smear of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh -- a smear the newspaper was forced to amend and walk back -- there was a gruesome discovery in a suburb south of Chicago.
Out in a garage in Crete, authorities found the remains of 2,246 babies on property owned by the late Indiana abortionist Dr. Ulrich Klopfer. His family had been going through his possessions when they discovered the stuff of nightmares.
The Times' Kavanaugh smear was deliciously exposed in a series of tweets by journalist Mollie Hemingway, senior writer for The Federalist. The panic of the Times sucked up most of the prominent media/political oxygen over the weekend.
And if Klopfer's demonic cache of human bodies wasn't ignored, exactly, it was consigned to the far edge of things, where we keep our monstrosities at bay.
What, if anything, connects these seemingly unrelated events?
Abortion.
Abortion is what Klopfer engaged in, as did many others before him, including the infamous Kermit Gosnell, of Philadelphia, who snipped the spines of infants with scissors and kept his trophies and was sentenced to life in prison.
And abortion is what this smearing of Kavanaugh has always been about.
The left lost control of the Supreme Court through the 2016 election of President Donald Trump, who has nominated two conservative justices and may nominate another if he's reelected in 2020. Since 2016, the left has waged cultural war, delegitimizing all institutions that may stand in their way.
Theirs is a dangerous game with far-reaching implications, but the left reveals itself, clearly, as determined to destroy Kavanaugh's credibility, and that of the Supreme Court itself, to protect past gains. Unhindered, in fact aided and cheered on by many in the media, the left proceeds on its scorched-earth strategy.
What is dangerous is that what is burned in their culture war are American institutions, and the scorched earth is the American republic.
Some may object to my reference to human remains as having been babies, rather than the impersonal "fetuses" or "masses of tissue." But such journalistic newspeak is politically loaded, and makes it much easier to allow powerful lives to exert their will upon the weakest among us.
It is easier to consider them as abstractions, as opposed to thousands of dead babies stored out there in Crete for so many years.
There is nothing remotely abstract about the remains of 2,246 human beings, is there?
The strategy of the left is undeniable and clear. It is about the use of force, about relentless pressure and shame, using media as both handmaiden and the lash. It is about those who virtue signal most often about due process, demanding it, yet denying those same due process considerations to those with whom they disagree.
The left's end game is the delegitimization of the Supreme Court, if justices don't give them the political outcomes they can't achieve through legislation.
One way to accomplish this is to sear into the American mind the idea that Kavanaugh is personally illegitimate, and therefore, his reasoning and decisions are illegitimate. Though the allegations against him remain uncorroborated, and most are incredible and fall apart in embarrassing fashion, like the one most recently in the Times, the assault continues.
And not only against Kavanaugh, but also against other justices and future nominees. They are warned that destruction and humiliation await.
So, the left would hang upon his neck an asterisk like some medal of shame, a reminder to future history that everything he accomplishes is illegitimate.
This was expressed, clearly, in a video of a speech by Debra Katz, the lawyer for Kavanaugh's initial accuser, Christine Blasey Ford. Ford testified before the Senate in Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing that, many years ago, when she and Kavanaugh were in high school, he assaulted her. Yet there were no corroborating witnesses, none remembered the party and even Ford's then close friend Leland Keyser reportedly doesn't believe her story.
But Ford's testimony had the intended effect. It savaged Kavanaugh's reputation and spawned a wave of suspect and equally unsubstantiated anti-Kavanaugh smears that were treated as gospel by Democratic politicians and many in the media.
Despite this, Kavanaugh was confirmed in a close Senate vote. The Katz video, obtained by The Daily Caller, shows Katz discussing the long-term strategic implications in a talk to a feminist group at the University of Baltimore in April.
"In the aftermath of these hearings, I believe that Christine's testimony brought about more good than the harm misogynist Republicans caused by allowing Kavanaugh on the court," Katz said. "He will always have an asterisk next to his name. When he takes a scalpel to Roe v. Wade, we will know who he is, we know his character, and we know what motivates him, and that is important; it is important that we know, and that is part of what motivated Christine."
An asterisk next to his name? That's just perfect.
I suppose it is preferable to pinning two large scarlet letters, an "R" and a "C", on his robes to identify him as a Roman Catholic.
But an asterisk accomplishes just about the same thing, doesn't it?

Snap launches political ads library, but lawmakers say uniform rules are needed

Texto completo: Snap is attempting to shed more light on which political players are using its platform to reach voters as the 2020 campaign ramps up. It's the latest move by a big social media company to police itself as Washington struggles to figure out what role, if any, it should play in regulating political ads on such platforms.
Snap told The Washington Post it has launched a political ad library in recent days that will list all political and advocacy ads on its platform; so far, the library includes more than 1,000 ads purchased in 2019 promoting President Trump, as well as those for 2020 rivals former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) The database also includes third-party ads touching on hot-button issues, including advertising from Planned Parenthood and even about criminal-justice restructuring from the ice cream company Ben and Jerry's.
The library includes how much each advertiser is spending on its ad buy.
Snap is just the latest firm to proactively create a database of its political ads as the 2020 campaign gets underway. Snap said it didn't find evidence that Russian actors bought ads on its platform after an internal audit following the 2016 election, so it hasn't confronted the same political blowback in Washington as larger platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Google, which previously have rolled out similar databases.
But it highlights a growing awareness that smaller social media companies are targets of malign influence operations and need to be regulated like everyone else when it comes to political activity, according to lawmakers. Right now, companies are left to their own devices in policing such ads, and their individual rules are inconsistent and vary in quality.
Brendan Fischer, director of federal reform at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center, said Snap's database is a "positive step." But he warned of the general inconsistency governing such efforts. "The big shortcoming in any . . . self-regulatory efforts is that any effort by a particular platform is not going to apply to any other platform," he said.
That's worrying lawmakers on Capitol Hill who have been trying to pass the bipartisan Honest Ads Act, which would force social media companies to abide by the same rules that apply to political ads on television and radio, and require large companies to keep a public file of the political ads they're selling.
One senator co-sponsoring the bill says Snap's new library doesn't go far enough. "It's commendable that more companies are increasing transparency when it comes to political advertising; however, a patchwork of voluntary measures from tech companies isn't sufficient - we need to pass the Honest Ads Act," said Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), also a 2020 presidential candidate.
"The goal of my legislation is to ensure that all major platforms that sell political advertisements are held to the same rules of the road, something that is already required for television, radio and print political advertising. Americans have a right to know who is paying to influence them regardless of where ads are sold," she said.
Klobuchar introduced her legislation in 2017 with Sens. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) in response to findings that Russian actors targeted American voters with social media ads designed to influence the outcome of the 2016 election. Some ads attacked Hillary Clinton or boosted Trump, but others sought to exploit divisive social issues. Klobuchar said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has blocked the bill from coming up for a vote.
Fischer warns that without government regulation, there is no accountability for smaller social media companies that might be selling political ads. "Ads on platforms other than those big four are not going to be disclosed," he said.
There is some evidence Russia also influenced smaller social networks in 2016 including Pinterest, where Americans unwittingly posted political content created by Russian operatives. Pinterest and other emerging social networks such as TikTok have policies that prohibit the sale of political ads on their platforms.
But other platforms, such as Reddit, continue to allow such sales - under tight rules that require the company to preapprove political ads and require the advertiser to disclose who paid for them. But the company does not maintain any sort of ongoing library of ads.
"Under the Honest Ads Act, the threshold is a site having at least 50 million monthly active users, and to the extent Reddit sells political ads, it should follow the lead of other large platforms and establish a political ad library," Warner said.
Researchers and journalists also argue that databases maintained by Facebook, Twitter and Google are imperfect. They have encountered technical challenges with Facebook's tool, as the New York Times first reported. Andy Stone, a Facebook spokesman, said since that story was published, the company has made changes to improve its developer tool, including fixing bugs.
Laura Edelson, a PhD candidate at New York University, says that Google has one of the best ad libraries from a technical perspective but that it doesn't include as many ads as other platforms. Google's library includes only ads related to current federal officeholders or people running for federal offices such as the presidency and Congress, so it's missing key issue ads and those related to local elections.
Google spokeswoman Charlotte Smith said the company is "working with experts in the U.S. and around the world to explore tools that capture a wider range of political ads - including issue ads, state and local election ads, and political ads in other countries."
Twitter's ad library doesn't allow researchers to download the full data set.

Texto completo: The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - Several Democratic presidential candidates lined up to call for the impeachment of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in the face of an uninvestigated allegation of sexual impropriety when he was in college.
Kavanaugh was confirmed last October after emotional hearings in the Senate over a sexual assault allegation from his high school years. The New York Times now reports that Kavanaugh faced a separate allegation from his time at Yale University.
The Times said that the female student in the latest claim declined to be interviewed and that friends said she doesn't recall the episode. The newspaper said Sunday in an editor's note that an earlier version of its story didn't include that information. None of the Democratic candidates publicly adjusted his or her position on Kavanaugh after the newspaper published the editor's note.
But several Democratic presidential candidates were quick to call for Kavanaugh's impeachment. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said Kavanaugh "lied" to the Senate and "most importantly to the American people." She tweeted: "He must be impeached." Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, tweeted, "Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be
Impeached." Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke asserted in a tweet: "We know he lied under oath. He should be impeached."
Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., asked the FBI on Oct. 2 to speak with "one individual I would like to specifically refer you to for appropriate follow up," according to a letter obtained by the AP.
The senator's letter does not spell out the allegations, and the person's name is redacted in the letter. But a person familiar with the letter confirmed Coons was referring to Max Stier, a Yale classmate of Kavanaugh's who is the person cited in the newspaper story.
Days later, Coons sent his letter to the FBI. A copy - with Stier's name redacted - was sent to the Judiciary Committee and its chairman, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. The letter did not contain any specific details of the allegation.
On Monday, Grassley said his office "never received anything from Mr. Stier" or anything with the special allegation against Kavanaugh "like the one referenced."
Grassley stood by the process and scoffed at impeachment.
"Let me be clear: this is not an allegation. It's barely a third-hand rumor," Grassley said. "These writers did not even speak to the man who they claim originally recounted this rumor. Not more corroboration. Not more verification. Nothing from the accuser himself. And nothing from the person who was allegedly involved."

Parents slam schools that don't warn them of threats

Texto completo: RALEIGH, N.C. -- When officials at a Catholic high school in South Carolina learned that a 16-year-old student made videos of himself firing a gun and using racial slurs, they alerted police, but not parents. After the videos made it into the news over the summer, the backlash came quickly.

Outraged parents complained they were left in the dark about the teen's threat to shoot people at Cardinal Newman School while their children were at risk. The principal took more than two weeks to send letters to parents about the videos and later apologized for not sharing information sooner.

While schools are more vigilant than ever about threats or signs of potential violence, some have faced intense criticism for favoring privacy over informing the community. When trying to strike a balance, security experts say there's one rule: Tell parents as much as you can as soon as you can.

"Every school district has to determine what kind of news conference they want to have," said Ronald Stephens, executive director of the National School Safety Center in California. "Do they want to have one where they say ‘Oh, yeah, we knew we had Charlie Manson Jr. walking the halls and we did nothing about it.' Or do they want to have the other one where they say, ‘We informed the parents and students'" and diffused the situation.

Some school districts are now sending letters home even if a threat isn't specific or to warn what consequences children face if they make a threat.

Parents got more concerned about what schools tell them about security threats after details emerged about a shooter who killed nine people last month in an Ohio entertainment district.

The 24-year-old gunman had been suspended from his high school years before the shooting for compiling a "hit list" of fellow students, former classmates say. Police told at least some of his classmates that they were on the list, but it's not clear what information the school shared widely at the time.

The suburban Dayton school district has refused to release information about Connor Betts, who was shot and killed by police, citing legal protections for student records. News organizations, including The Associated Press, CNN, The New York Times and others, have sued for access to Betts' high school files.

Schools can seem less transparent than police, who are legally allowed to reveal more information, and administrators can struggle to stay ahead of rumors as students quickly post on social media.

Schools can't release children's names, but those that don't communicate at all can face parent revolts when details come out later.

In Ohio's Highland Local Schools, where some staffers can carry concealed weapons, angry parents told the school board that they should have been told when a first-grader picked up a loaded handgun left unattended by an employee in March. Instead, they learned about it in August in The Columbus Dispatch newspaper.

School board president Wayne Hinkle said officials could have communicated better with parents.

"I'm still working on what should have and could have and whatever," he said. "Heaven forbid this ever happens again. If it does, I do believe the school will be better equipped to handle it."

At the Catholic school in South Carolina, officials learned of the threatening videos, which the student forwarded in a group text, on July 13. They called police and told his parents he would be expelled.

He was arrested on July 17 when another video surfaced in which he threatened to shoot people at the private school in the state's capital, authorities said. He was charged as a juvenile with making student threats.

The first two videos show the white teen firing more than two dozen shots into a box that he says represents black men, authorities said. He uses a racial slur several times in the videos and says African Americans "are bad people."

The State newspaper in Columbia published an article on the videos July 30. In a series of letters to parents days later, principal Robert Loia said the threat had been addressed and school leaders did not think anybody was in danger.

He faced intense criticism from parents before apologizing in a letter Aug. 5.

"I realize now that I should have communicated with you immediately when I learned a violent threat had been made against our school community," Loia wrote.

A spokeswoman for the Diocese of Charleston, which covers the Columbia school, didn't respond to messages asking if the school or diocese wanted to discuss how the parents were notified.

"Any kind of threat to the children, every parent should know and continue to be kept abreast of what's happening," said Greg Pryor, a parent who attended a meeting with administrators on the issue.

Other schools have sent letters to parents even in cases where officials determined there wasn't a credible threat.

The Ravena Coeymans Selkirk Central School District outside Albany, New York, sent a letter to parents in November about a "non-specific, verbal bomb threat" even though they had determined the student was just blowing off steam.

The school and law enforcement responded that way because this is an "era where there is no such thing as an innocuous threat," Superintendent Brian Bailey said.

Schools in Kentucky also are now sending letters to parents outlining what happens if their child makes a threat. The letters, required in a law passed this year in response to a 2018 shooting that killed two students at Marshall County High School, say schools will pursue charges when a student makes a threat that could result in death or injury.

"We're done with it," said William Boblett, superintendent of Boyd County schools in eastern Kentucky. "We're tired of dealing with this."

Texto completo: MANASQUAN – A fisherman who slipped and fell from the jetty at Manasquan Inlet on Sunday has died, Mayor Ed Donovan said.
Donovan identified the man as Joo Ha Lee, 71, and said he was visiting from Canada. Lee was fishing at the tip of the jetty, what is known as the t-rocks because of the shape of the rocks, when he fell and hit his head, Donovan said.
Donovan said Lee's two sons witnessed their father fall and tried to rescue him. He was pronounced dead at Jersey Shore University Medical Center in Neptune on Sunday, Donovan said.
"He was out as far as you can go on the jetty when somehow he slipped and hit his head. It's not easy to get out there," Donovan said.
Manasquan Police Chief Michael Bauer said a 911 call was received by police at 4:41 p.m. Sunday. He said Manasquan Fire Department arrived at the scene at 4:52 p.m.
They were assisted by Brielle and Asbury Park. Manasquan First Aid and New Jersey State Police arrived 4:53 p.m., Bauer said.
According to the police report obtained by the Asbury Park Press through an Open Public Records Request, police received the 911 call from a 12-year-old witness.
The witness told police that Lee's fishing line was snagged and he was attempting to free the line when he slipped and fell into a crevice between the rocks.
According to Saltwater Tides, low tide was 3:12 p.m. on Sunday.
The end of the jetty where Lee fell was completely flooded and made getting to Lee extremely difficult. When police reached Lee, he was not breathing, according to the report.
Lee was pulled from the rocks with the use of a basket and CPR was performed.
Lee's two sons had climbed down into rocks to try and save their father. Sungjin Lee was injured and treated at Jersey Shore University Medical Center. Seang Lee refused medical aid.
Joo Ha Lee and Sungkin Lee were visiting from North York, Ontario, Canada, according to the police report. Seang Lee had a Dumont address.
"You drill for this. They (emergency responders) had an excellent response time but unfortunately, there was nothing else they could have done. It's very sad," said Donovan.
Thomas Lozinski, 42, lives about a mile from the inlet and was walking toward the beach with his family when he heard a large number of emergency sirens. Seeing rescue boats off the jetty and orange-vested rescuers, he pulled out his drone camera to see the scene from the air.
Typically, the jetties at Manasquan Inlet are safer, higher and drier than comparable jetties throughout Monmouth and Ocean counties, he said.
But the fisherman was out near the end of the jetty, where the man-made concrete stones are slippery with water and algae and have gaping holes between the rocks, Lozinski said.
"It's really rare to see anybody out where this guy was," he said. "You easily could fall down there."
Donovan said Officer Thomas Morton, who climbed down into the rocks to try and rescue Lee, received a laceration over his eye. He was treated at Jersey Shore University Medical Center and released.
Donovan said the beaches were guarded and Sunday was their last beach day of the season.
Lee's death is not the first to happen at the inlet.
Two Philadelphia men died in 2015 after a pontoon boat was struck by a large swell and flipped over near the inlet. Authorities said strong currents may have played a role in their deaths.
In 1995, the currents surrounding the inlet swept two brothers, ages 11 and 13, out into the ocean, according to The New York Times. The boys had been wading in knee-deep water on the Point Pleasant Beach side of the inlet when they were knocked over by a wave and carried away in strong currents, according to the newspaper.

Trump attacks Kavanaugh's critics, blames media reports

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump again defended Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on Monday, assailing a news report over the weekend that prompted calls for a renewed investigation and even impeachment of the jurist.
"The one who is actually being assaulted is Justice Kavanaugh," Trump tweeted. "Assaulted by lies and Fake News! This is all about the LameStream Media working with their partner, the Dems."
Citing a report on the morning program "Fox & Friends," Trump tweeted, "'The New York Times walks back report on Kavanaugh assault claim.'"
The Times clarified part of a story, what the newspaper called "an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party."
In an editor's note, the Times said, "The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article."
The article, an essay adapted from a forthcoming book called "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh," dealt with allegations from Yale classmate Deborah Ramirez, who said Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a party.
The authors said there is more corroboration for Ramirez's story than there was at the time of Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings last year.
"During his Senate testimony, Mr. Kavanaugh said that if the incident Ms. Ramirez described had occurred, it would have been 'the talk of campus,'" Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly wrote.
"Our reporting suggests that it was," they said. "At least seven people, including Ms. Ramirez's mother, heard about the Yale incident long before Mr. Kavanaugh was a federal judge."
Some Democrats, including presidential candidates, said they believe Kavanaugh lied at his confirmation hearings, and they called for impeachment proceedings.
"I sat through those hearings," tweeted Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., one of the presidential candidates. "Brett Kavanaugh lied to the U.S. Senate and most importantly to the American people. He was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice. He must be impeached."
Trump said Sunday that the man he nominated to the nation's highest court should sue for libel, a suggestion he repeated Monday.
"DO YOU BELIEVE WHAT THESE HORRIBLE PEOPLE WILL DO OR SAY," Trump tweeted. "They are looking to destroy, and influence his opinions – but played the game badly. They should be sued!"

A media mess in Kavanaugh case

Texto completo: Over the weekend, American public conversation was rocked by claims of explosive new revelations about Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was confirmed last year despite allegations of sexual misconduct in high school and college.
A New York Times news analysis by reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, adapted from their book, "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh" - which is being published this week - focused on Deborah Ramirez, Kavanaugh's former Yale University classmate who charged that he exposed himself to her at a drunken dorm party in 1983. The piece claimed not only that Ramirez's account had extensive corroboration which the Senate Judiciary Committee and the FBI investigation ignored, but also that Kavanaugh had been accused of similar misconduct against another woman at Yale.
Left-of-center opinion and social media erupted in outrage, including demands for Kavanaugh's impeachment.
But a closer look shows the bombshell is largely a dud - and, with a Times update that largely negates the so-called new accusation, this controversy is likely to prove more damaging to the media than to Kavanaugh or to Republicans.
When Ramirez came forward, an account of her story in The New Yorker noted that she spent about a week "carefully assessing her memories" before she felt comfortable going on the record. The magazine reported that another Yale alumnus, Kenneth Appold, was "certain" that he had been told by an eyewitness about Kavanaugh exposing himself to Ramirez - but the classmate from whom he had supposedly heard the story had told The New Yorker he had no memory of the incident.
The Times essay and the book ultimately add little of value. Appold remains certain he heard the story about Kavanaugh, but says he heard it from two students whose names he doesn't recall. Another Yale alum, Richard Oh, remembers a female classmate recounting a party where "a fake penis turned out to be real." (Ramirez says that in her inebriated state, she initially mistook Kavanaugh's genitals for a fake penis that had been passed around earlier.) Appold's graduate-school roommate confirms that Appold told him about the incident some years later. Two more Yale alumni recall hearing about a similar incident, with no names. Ramirez's mother, listed in the Times essay as a corroborator, says Ramirez told her something sexually traumatic happened at Yale.
As for the claim of yet another alleged Kavanaugh victim, the story is that a very drunk Kavanaugh dropped his pants at another party and some other male students "pushed" his penis into a woman's hand. If true, it's unclear how much at fault Kavanaugh would be. But in any case, as the Times acknowledged in its update, friends of the woman say she doesn't remember any such incident. That's quite a "Never mind."
So far, this debacle has ended up giving ammunition to conservatives and Donald Trump supporters who believe that the mainstream media, in tandem with progressive activists, are out to smear Kavanaugh for political reasons.
Conservative pundit Mollie Hemingway, whose book, "Justice on Trial," claims the allegations against Kavanaugh were a left-wing plot, has been derided as a pro-Trump hack. But on Sunday, she was able to successfully fact-check the Times.
The irony is that, whatever happened in his youth, Kavanaugh isn't the patriarchal devil of progressive imagination. Pogrebin and Kelly acknowledge that he became a better man as he matured. His record of promoting women professionally has been praised by feminist icon Ruth Bader Ginsburg. He even sided with Planned Parenthood in a recent case.
It may be that the worst damage Kavanaugh will do to feminists and progressives will be the self-inflicted damage to their own credibility.

No, Kavanaugh’s accusers are not ‘credible’

Texto completo: Here we are, nearly a year after the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hysteria, once again relitigating the dubious allegations against the new Supreme Court justice. And unsurprisingly, this means we must re-engage in debate over just what the word “credible” means when applied to an accusation.
For several weeks last fall, the term “credible” was used abundantly in most major newspapers and online, with partisans insisting, over and over again that the sexual assault accusations against Kavanaugh were “credible,” though none of them ever seemed to stop and consider what the word actually means.
Eleven months later, we are at it again.
The New York Times just published another bizarre, tissue-thin accusation against Kavanaugh, as well as supposed “corroboration” of an earlier accusation against him. Neither claim lived up to the hype, but it set off a fresh wave of credibility mania.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, claimed that Kavanaugh had been “credibly accused of sexual assault” and called for his impeachment. New Yorker writer Jeffrey Toobin also wrote that Kavanaugh has been “credibly accused of sexual misconduct.” Meanwhile, the writers of the Times supposed “bombshell” said that one of Kavanaugh’s accusers, Deborah Ramirez, was herself “credible.” Calling for impeachment proceedings against Kavanaugh, Cory Booker referred to the “deeply troubling and credible allegations” against the justice, and other Democratic presidential candidates such as Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren joined him.
What does all of this really mean? How are we supposed to define “credible” and apply that definition to Kavanaugh’s accusers and their accusations against him?
The two principle ways to define “credible” appear to be “capable of being believed” and “worthy of belief or confidence.” As far as the former definition is concerned, the allegations against Kavanaugh are most assuredly “credible,” insofar as one is perfectly capable of believing that he sexually assaulted a woman several decades ago. It’s not an outrageous claim at all. Men do commit sexual assault, after all, and there’s nothing special about Kavanaugh that would render him incapable of doing so.
Yet what about “worthy of belief or confidence?” Here is where the definition breaks down, and the progressive parroting of this talking point becomes an embarrassing canard. There is actually very little about any of the claims against Kavanaugh that is worthy of belief.
We know, for instance, that nobody — not a single person — has been able to corroborate to any degree that the assault against Christine Blasey Ford happened. Even Ford’s old friend Leland Keyser, who Ford claimed was at the party where the assault allegedly happened, couldn’t confirm it. In fact, Keyser recently announced that she doesn’t believe Ford’s story.
We also know that Ford’s recollection of that night has changed several times, that she couldn’t pin down a date or a location for when the assault allegedly happened, that she couldn’t explain how she got home from the party, and that she told nobody about it for many years afterward.
Whatever else it is, this is not a credible accusation at all.
What about Deborah Ramirez’s claim that Brett Kavanaugh shoved his penis at her in a Yale dorm room over three decades ago? That story, too, has never been corroborated in any meaningful way — the closest it has ever come to being corroborated has been several people who said they heard about the incident, not that they witnessed it.
The circumstances surrounding Ramirez’s revelation are themselves deeply suspect: The New Yorker reported that she only remembered the incident “after six days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney.” This is not credible, in fact it pushes credulity past the breaking point.
That’s not the same as saying they didn’t happen, as they could have, it’s just that there is no compelling evidence at this time to lead anyone to believe they did. On that basis, it was perfectly appropriate for the Senate to confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, and it is profoundly reckless and dishonest for Democrats to call for his impeachment now.

Texto completo: State prosecutors in Manhattan have subpoenaed eight years of President Trump's tax returns from his longtime accounting firm, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The subpoena seeks documents including Mr. Trump's personal tax returns and those of his longtime business, the Trump Organization, the person said. The probe is examining whether a payment to former adult-film star Stormy Daniels—and the way the Trump Organization recorded the reimbursement of that payment—violated a state law that bars falsifying business records, according to the person.
A spokesman for the Manhattan district attorney's office, which is conducting the investigation, declined to comment.
Marc Mukasey, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, said, "We are evaluating our options, taking a look at the situation and we'll respond in due course."
A spokeswoman for the accounting firm, Mazars USA, said in a statement that the company would "respect the legal process and fully comply with its legal obligations." She said it is the firm's policy not to comment on work it does for clients.
The subpoena was reported earlier by the New York Times.
An investigation by Manhattan state prosecutors into the president's role in hush-money payments has escalated since the federal investigation into those payments—which sent former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen to prison in May—concluded this summer. Investigators from the district attorney's office met with Mr. Cohen this summer, the person familiar with the matter said.
A lawyer for Mr. Cohen didn't respond to a request for comment.
In August 2018, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to charges including violating campaign-finance law by arranging hush-money payments during the 2016 election to two women who alleged they had affairs with Mr. Trump. He has said he did so at Mr. Trump's behest, an assertion that was confirmed by federal prosecutors in a court filing last year.
Mr. Trump has denied wrongdoing.
Until this summer, federal prosecutors in Manhattan probed the possible involvement of others at the Trump Organization in Mr. Cohen's campaign-finance violations. They haven't disclosed any indictments of any executives at the company.
Federal prosecutors said in a charging document for Mr. Cohen that the Trump Organization accounted for reimbursement checks to him for the payments as "legal expenses," when, in fact, there was no such retainer agreement. The reimbursement Mr. Cohen sought was "not in connection with any legal services he had provided," prosecutors have said.
Justice Department policy bars the indictment of a sitting president.
The subpoena from the Manhattan district attorney's office is the latest chapter in a multipronged effort by investigators to obtain the president's financial information.
The House Intelligence and Financial Services committees in April subpoenaed Deutsche Bank for documents and financial records—including tax returns—related to Mr. Trump, his children and various business entities they own spanning the last decade. Deutsche Bank told a federal appeals court last month that it has copies of tax returns sought under that subpoena.
In July, the House Ways and Means Committee sued the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service for the president's tax returns. In a separate dispute, the president sued that committee and New York state officials in an attempt to block his state tax returns from being turned over to the panel.
Mr. Trump in 2016 broke with four decades of precedent for presidential candidates in declining to release his tax returns.

Legislation proposed to grant Kissimmee River rights

Texto completo: In the 2020 presidential election, Florida voters may be able to vote for the rights of nature. Environmental groups in counties such as Osceola and Brevard are proposing laws to protect the rights of Florida's rivers and springs including the Santa Fe and the Kissimmee river.
According to the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund (CELDF), these laws protect the rights of nature and Floridians' rights to clean drinking water. In turn, governments and corporations will be prohibited to violate said rights. CELDF assists in protecting the rights of ecosystems and challenging powers in government and corporate that allowed damages to the ecosystem.
This would make Florida one of the first states to recognize the rights of nature along with Ohio, where voters passed the Lake Erie Bill of Rights in Feb. 2019.
According to CNN, the legislation grants the 11th largest lake in the world, Lake Erie, the same rights as a person, meaning people can sue polluters on its behalf.
In 2014, Lake Erie suffered a toxic algae bloom that rendered more than half a million Toledo locals without water to drink, bathe or brush their teeth for three days. The rationale behind the Lake Erie Bill of Rights is that the consequences may prevent future algal blooms triggered by an increase in agricultural runoff and other man-made environmental degradations.
Not all Ohio residents and officials agreed with the decision. "We care much about the lake," Yvonne Lesicko, vice president for public policy at the Ohio Farm Bureau told the New York Times. "But this is not a solution. In fact, it is counterproductive. This is going to lead to lots of lawsuits and stress."
Florida is taking similar measures to protect its ecosystems. The CELDF are working to bring these legislations to the polls in 2020. Residents hope this will allow their surrounding ecosystems to exist and thrive.
"Our river was destroyed in the name of flood control, killing the wildlife it supported," Osceola county resident Barbara Cady told the CELDF. "A Kissimmee River Bill of Rights will ensure that this living breathing ecosystem will never be assaulted again."
With a Bill of Rights like Lake Erie's, the Kissimmee River would be recognized as an environmental entity rather than property that can be owned and polluted without consequence. This recognition will allow it to have rights enforced by communities and governments with the hopes that if these rights are enforced, there will be less pollution and mistreatment.
Chuck O'Neal is the Director of Speak Up Wekiva, a small environmental group made of volunteers in Orange County. He believes that citizens should have the right to challenge polluters of their environmental landmarks and sources of water.
"Florida residents are increasingly aware that the problems with our water originates from the concept that corporations have the rights of humans while nature and aquatic ecosystems have no legal rights," said O'Neal in a release. "We have seen this past week that this imbalance of rights continues to generate negative consequences in Florida and around the world. It will take a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens to change this equation - and that is happening right now across this state."
The CELDF are continuing to push for the rights of nature, people and the environment. Visit https://celdf.org/ for updates on legislation regarding the Rights of Nature.
Voters will be able to cast their votes for the protection of the Kissimmee River on the 2020 ballot.

Texto completo: I like Elizabeth Warren. I like her a lot. Too bad she's a hypocrite.
I think Warren, D-Mass., has been a great senator, and her work in setting up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was terrific. The CFPB is the best protection that ordinary Americans have from financial institutions that prey on them.
In fact, I like her so much that when she ran for Senate in 2018, I co-chaired a couple of fundraisers for her and donated a combined $4,500 to her campaign.
Shortly after announcing her candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination in February, Warren said she would shun high-dollar fundraising events. "That means no fancy receptions or big money fundraisers only with people who can write the big checks," Warren wrote in an email to supporters.
Now, Warren has every right to make that pledge even if she had obtained significant contributions from donors in the past. Doing that didn't make her a hypocrite. But there are two other reasons why the description applies.
First, because she transferred $10.4 million from her Senate reelection campaign to her presidential campaign fund. More than $6 million came in contributions of $1,000 and up, as The New York Times recently noted. The senator appears to be trying to have it both ways - get the political upside from eschewing donations from higher-level donors and running a grass-roots campaign, while at the same time using money obtained from those donors in 2018.
The $10.4 million gave Warren a substantial head start in building a presidential-campaign staff and doing other things for which money is essential. If she weren't being hypocritical, she would have taken only the dollars raised in smaller increments from her Senate race and transferred those into her presidential account.
Second, Warren attacked former Vice President Joe Biden for holding a kickoff fundraiser in Philadelphia in April, which she criticized as "a swanky private fundraiser for wealthy donors" in an email to supporters the next day.
Well, I helped organize that affair, and I thought her attack was extremely hypocritical because nearly 20 of us who attended the Biden fundraiser had also given her $2,000 or more in 2018 at closed-door fundraisers in "swanky" locations.
Warren didn't seem to have any trouble taking our money in 2018, but suddenly we were power brokers and influence peddlers in 2019. The year before, we were wonderful. I co-chaired one of the events for the senator and received a glowing, handwritten thank-you letter from her for my hard work.
It seemed odd to some of us who gave her money that Warren was experiencing an epiphany less than 12 months later. It's one thing to fashion a campaign that relies on grassroots fundraising, but it's another to go out of your way to characterize as power brokers and influence peddlers the very people whose support you have previously courted.
Now, Warren is not the first person to have been hypocritical about fundraising. Barack Obama, whom I consider one of the greatest presidents in my lifetime, vowed not to take any money from the political action committees of Wall Street firms in his 2008 campaign. At the same time, his campaign took in millions of dollars in contributions from individuals who worked for Wall Street firms.
But the news media basically gave Obama a free ride and didn't point out the blatant hypocrisy of trying to win credit for shunning contributions from Wall Street firms while taking tons of money from people who work for those same Wall Street firms. Politics can make people do peculiar things.
I also take issue with the notion, raised by Warren in her criticism of the Biden fundraiser in April, that people who give the maximum allowable individual donation of $2,800 to a presidential candidate are doing so because they believe it will get them a federal job, win their business a federal contract or even gain special access.
Donors who give $2,800 for the most part are doing so because they believe strongly that the candidate would make a great leader, or maybe they believe in the candidate's values or policies on the important issues challenging the country.
Are there some people who give or raise money in presidential campaigns with ulterior motives? Sure, but I'm confident that the crowd at the Biden fundraiser gave money to him for the same reason I did. We believe that he will be the best person to lead the country, to restore the United States' moral leadership in the world, to get things done in Washington, to create opportunity for all Americans and to protect the nation's most vulnerable citizens.
So, despite my feelings, Elizabeth, if you're reading this and you win the Democratic nomination, I will be happy to support you and will campaign for you with all my heart.
And, by the way, Philadelphia has a lot more swanky restaurants that you haven't seen yet.

BILL PEDUTO NEEDS TO START REPRESENTING HIS CONSTITUENTS

Texto completo: In 2015, President Donald Trump was ridiculed by Mayor Bill Peduto for saying, "I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris." The president's word choice was colorful and easy to attack. Many, including Mr. Peduto, pointed out that Hillary Clinton carried the city of Pittsburgh vote by a wide margin. Mr. Peduto leaped into action and penned a New York Times op-ed with the mayor of Paris about climate change.
Unlike the president, Mr. Peduto did earn the votes from the majority of voters in Pittsburgh. He was undoubtedly elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh. Not India, Tokyo, Cambodia or Israel. The mayor has traveled to all of these places in 2019, according to his own Instagram posts.
The citizens of Pittsburgh deserve a mayor who places his or her primary focus on our unique problems and opportunities.
As both a Downtown resident and businessman, I have witnessed first-hand the deterioration of Downtown safety. I would ask - beg - Mr. Peduto to represent me.
Mr. Mayor, represent the people who are invested, financially and personally, in making Downtown thrive. Work with everyone to solve our problems. Don't blame others. Tackle these issues head-on. Be here, physically and emotionally. Be focused on the problems you can try to solve. The current Downtown violence does not have an easy answer. It may be an unsolvable puzzle. But please try.
Mr. Mayor, place the safety of our citizens and the prosperity of our city above your insatiable addiction to soundbites that play well in uber-liberal circles. As a member of society, I agree that we must help and respect those among us who have fallen into addiction or are homeless or downtrodden. Please don't ignore everyone else. You were, after all, elected to represent all of us.

To a Critic, 'Dance Is Everywhere'

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
When Gia Kourlas moved to New York City from Columbus, Ohio, in 1989, her writing clips and journalism degree in tow, she set out to work in publishing -- but she had no burning ambition to become a dance writer.
"You're from Ohio. You move to New York. There's enough against you," she said.
Nevertheless, Ms. Kourlas has been writing about dance for The New York Times since 2000. In mid-August, she became its full-time critic. She is now one of 16 staff critics on The Times's culture desk, and one of few full-time dance critics in the country. She is the latest in a corps of Times dance critics that has included Jennifer Dunning, Anna Kisselgoff and Alastair Macaulay. And Ms. Kourlas is determined to blaze her own trail.
"I'm not going to be the same conventional critic that there always was," she said -- a journalist with a strict and limited mandate to review one show at a time. One of Ms. Kourlas's goals in her full-time role is "to create more fans of dance," she said. "I think it's a wonderful art form, and I don't think enough people watch it."
She should know. Growing up in Columbus, Ms. Kourlas rarely saw professional dancers perform, catching the occasional show by the city's homegrown ballet company, BalletMet, or touring performances by Dance Theater of Harlem. As enchanted as she was by these performances, she grew to love dance "through doing it more than watching it."
Ms. Kourlas started taking dance classes at 5 years old at a small school in Columbus. Several years later, she switched to figure skating. She attended open sessions at local ice rinks, where she taught herself basic techniques by reading books and imitating other skaters she saw on the ice. Later, in formal skating classes, she surprised her teachers with her self-taught skills.
As a journalism student at Ohio State University, Ms. Kourlas held various positions at its campus newspaper, The Lantern. She was steeped in the arts in college. "Ohio State is like a huge city within a city, and there's a lot to take advantage of," she said. "At that time, the music scene was great, so I was involved in lots of pockets."
At Ohio State, she resumed her dance education, taking ballet and modern classes. (She never aspired to dance professionally, and she never did.)
Ms. Kourlas had other plans for her life in New York. She worked as an editorial assistant, writer and editor at places such as the Museum of Television and Radio (now the Paley Center for Media), New York magazine and The Paris Review. She continued taking dance classes in New York, as often as five days a week.
Writing about dance came unexpectedly. A recruiter contacted her about an editor job at Time Out New York before the publication debuted in 1995. "They said, 'Will you come in for an interview? And oh, by the way, what would you want to write about?"' Ms. Kourlas remembered. "And I just blurted out, 'Dance!"'
"I had been working up to it, but I didn't realize it," she added.
Ms. Kourlas also regularly wrote quirky features about clothing stores and record shops for The New York Times in the mid-90s, expanding to dance in 2000. Since then, she has written about many forms of dance for The Times, including ballet, modern and street styles, as well as music videos. She has tackled tough subjects such as the lack of diversity in ballet and the #MeToo movement.
Her writing takes many forms. For example, writing features based on interviews with dance artists serves readers by demystifying the art form, she said. But she does not draw a clear demarcation between fact-based feature articles and opinion-driven reviews. "I think that things are changing so that features or profiles can be a little bit more opinionated," she said.
Ms. Kourlas does not limit her criticism to merely what happens between the curtain's rise and fall. "I try not to think that I'm looking at one show," she explained. "I think I'm looking at the many shows that person has made up to that point."
Analysis of a dance artist's oeuvre is a tool in putting a performance in proper context. In this digital age, another powerful way to enlighten readers is, of course, video. Ms. Kourlas has been producing The Times's video series on Instagram, #SpeakingInDance, since 2016. "I love showing people dancing and trying to explain some of it in a way that doesn't dumb it down," she said.
For Ms. Kourlas, seeing dancers in action -- onstage, on the street -- is a source of excitement.
"Dance is everywhere, and whether you're at New York City Ballet or whether you're watching a performers on a subway, it's all valid," she said. "Dance is a gift."

Texto completo: Q: Any chance for "The Good Cop" to get another season? That was the most delightful new show we have seen! I mean, Josh Groban with Tony Danza, but with Tony doing all the singing? How cool is that?
A: Netflix decided one run was enough for the series. As Deadline.com reported last year, the show "had not been able to cut through the clutter" of so many other programs to get most viewers' attention.

Q: Be honest: Aren't you astounded that "Supernatural" lasted a whopping 15 seasons, longer than the iconic "Bonanza's" 14 seasons?
A: I can't say I'm astounded, since my entertainment astonishment tends toward other things. How, for instance, was "Freaks and Geeks" only one season? What was David Caruso thinking when he left "NYPD Blue"? Who really thought "BH90210" was a good idea?
"Supernatural's" run - with its 15th and final season beginning Oct. 10 - is not a TV series record. Just among current scripted shows. "The Simpsons," "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit," "NCIS" and "Grey's Anatomy" all predate "Supernatural." But it's a run that most series would envy, and proof that a loyal audience has long existed for the CW thriller, even if you and I may not have watched.

Q: Where is James Norton from "Grantchester"? Is he on another show? We are a group of women who want him back.
A: Norton decided to leave "Grantchester" a while back, and he has apparently been busy. He is in the new version of "Little Women," directed by Greta Gerwig and coming to theaters Christmas Day. For AMC he is in "McMafia," the crime thriller that had a first season last year and has been renewed for a second. Other upcoming projects include "The Nevers," an HBO series from writer-director Joss Whedon, and a miniseries, "The Trial of Christine Keeler."

Q: I am looking for a program where outlaws in the 1880s rob a bank and are chased by a sheriff and his posse when a big storm comes on. The next morning, they wake up to a strange sound - a jet passing overhead. They have been transported to the present day. I would like to know the name and if it is available in any format.
A: That's "Outlaws," which aired on CBS in 1986-87 for 12 episodes, including a two-hour pilot. Rod Taylor played a Texas sheriff in 1899 in pursuit of a bank-robbing gang (William Lucking, Charles Napier, Richard Roundtree and Patrick Houser); after a storm they find themselves in the present day and set up a detective agency. I do not know of an authorized home-video release. Episodes, including the pilot, are available on YouTube.

Q: Please tell me why in the third season of "The Lone Ranger," Clayton Moore was replaced by John Hart, and then Moore returned for the fourth season.
A: As anyone who grew up watching the show can tell you, Clayton Moore was the one true Lone Ranger. (Let's just forget Klinton Spilsbury and Armie Hammer in the role, OK?) But Moore was indeed replaced for a time by John Hart, and different theories have been offered, including that Moore asked for more money or that there were creative differences between Moore and "Lone Ranger" producer George W. Trendle. The 1999 New York Times obituary for Moore says he never was told why he was fired, or why he was rehired. Moore's daughter Dawn, in a 2014 interview available on YouTube, says Trendle believed Moore wanted a share of the merchandising revenue from the show. Since he considered actors playing a masked man were interchangeable, he fired Moore (who, according to Dawn, never would have asked for the merchandising money). But when Hart proved less appealing to audiences, Moore was brought back.

Next Democratic debate in Westerville

Texto completo: COLUMBUS – Democrats will hold their next presidential debate at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, a suburb northeast of Columbus.
The Democratic National Committee announced the Oct. 15 debate will be hosted by CNN and The New York Times. A second night could be added if more candidates meet the qualifying criteria.
Donald Trump won Ohio by 8 points in 2016,raising questions about Ohio's battleground state status. The DNC's decision to hold a debate in the Buckeye State was seen as a sign Democrats won't give up Ohio easily.
Friday's announcement ends weeks of speculation the DNC might choose Dayton, where a mass shooter killed nine in August, or Lordstown in Ohio's Mahoning Valley, where General Motors has left thousands of assembly plant employees out of work.
To Ohio Democrats, Westerville and suburban Columbus represent voter demographics changing in their favor.
A 2018 national "blue wave" didn't change much in Ohio on the congressional and statewide level. But Democrats picked up six Ohio House seats in suburban districts – three were in central Ohio.
In 2016 Democrat Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump in Westerville precincts by about 1,000 votes. President Barack Obama lost in those same precincts by about the same margin.
"What we've seen in the suburbs of Columbus, Cincinnati, Cleveland and other cities mirrors what has happened in places like Harris County, Texas, and Orange County, California – suburban voters, particularly women, are backing Democratic candidates in response to the broken promises and toxic agenda of Donald Trump," Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper said in a statement.
In a memo to national media, Pepper called Westerville "ground zero" in a "seismic shift" in voting patterns in Republican-leaning suburbs. Suburban women, Pepper said, are especially concerned about health care and the economy – two issues he says Trump has failed to deliver on.
The Ohio Republican Party responded to the announcement by noting its success in 2016, when Trump made inroads in traditionally Democratic voting areas such as the Mahoning Valley.
"The 2020 Democratic candidates can debate in Ohio all they want, but Ohioans have made it clear that their radical ideas are not welcome here," ORP press secretary Elizabeth Giannone said in a statement. "President Trump's pro-growth policies have created a booming economy, and in 2016 we flipped traditionally blue counties red. President Trump won Ohio by 8 points and we are still feeling that momentum thanks to the president's leadership. The Democrats' radical agendas, policies that will only result in higher taxes on the middle class, simply don't resonate here."
Candidates must reach 2% in four DNC-approved polls and record contributions from at least 130,000 unique donors by Oct. 1.
The following candidates have already qualified:
Former Vice President Joe Biden
Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey
South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg
Former HUD Secretary Julián Castro
Sen. Kamala Harris of California
Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota
Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas
Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont
Tom Steyer, businessman
Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts
Andrew Yang, businessman
The debate will be moderated by CNN anchors Anderson Cooper and Erin Burnett as well as The Times' National editor, Marc Lacey.
The state party will give away a limited number of tickets to people who register online at goohiodems.org/debate.
Columbus bureau reporter Jessie Balmert contributed.

From 'Sex' to 'Superstar,' 10 Plays That Riled Us Up

Texto completo: The marketing campaign for the Broadway-bound "Slave Play" is following the time-honored tradition of leaning into its controversy, with pull quotes like "Gaudily transgressive" and "Gruesomely sexy." Assuming the transgressions and sexiness carry through to the Golden Theater, "Slave Play" will find itself part of a rich history of productions -- many of them transfers from the more licentious lands of Off Broadway and London -- that shocked audience members upon opening on Broadway.
To this day, classics like "Lysistrata," "Tartuffe" and (as any Fox News viewer can attest) "Julius Caesar" can raise hackles centuries later. Here are several more plays that caused controversy -- and frequently made sure to point that out in their ad campaigns.
Mrs. Warren's Profession (1905)
"It's much my best play," George Bernard Shaw once wrote, "but it makes my blood run cold." Temperatures ran a good bit higher during a protracted war of words in the press between one of the performers and the much-feared Anthony Comstock of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice. The profession in question was the running of a brothel, after all, and the cops busted up the first United States performance of this play. New York's police commissioner supplied what would have been the perfect pull quote -- "revolting, indecent and nauseating where it is not boring" -- had he not canceled every subsequent performance.
God of Vengeance (1923)
The police may have been there at opening night for "Mrs. Warren," but it wasn't until Sholem Asch's Yiddish drama -- also about a brothel keeper and her daughter, and this time featuring a lesbian relationship -- transferred uptown to the Apollo Theater that its producer, Harry Weinberger, and the cast members were indicted on charges of "an indecent, immoral and impure theatrical performance." Weinberger, a well-known lawyer who had defended the likes of Emma Goldman, agreed to represent himself and the cast in the subsequent obscenity trial. Paula Vogel's "Indecent" would dramatize the proceedings almost a century later.
Sex (1926)
Oh, to be a fly on the wall of the police wagon that hauled away the cast members of both "The Captive" and this lurid Mae West dramedy on the same night. "Sex" had been running for almost a year at that point and got a huge bump in publicity from this run-in, although West earned that publicity by serving a 10-day sentence at a Roosevelt Island workhouse. She then took the play on the road, armed with this "warning" in the advertisements: "If you cannot stand excitement -- see your doctor before visiting Mae West in 'Sex."'
The Children's Hour (1934)
As with "God of Vengeance" and "The Captive," homosexuality was at issue in this Lillian Hellman drama. It was banned in Boston the following year, and the New York Drama Critics Circle sprang into existence in the wake of the Pulitzer Prize committee's refusal to award Hellman. The play was so incendiary that Hellman not only removed any mention of lesbianism but even changed the title -- to "These Three" -- for the film version in 1936.
Hair (1968)
Drug use and irreverence toward the American flag had as much to do with the furor that rose around this "American tribal love-rock musical" as its famous -- and famously brief -- nude scene. Not one but two Supreme Court decisions weighed in on contested productions (including one in, you guessed it, Boston); the Apollo 13 astronauts made headlines by leaving at intermission; and members of the touring casts were issued an eight-page guide on how to handle the local police.
Jesus Christ Superstar (1971)
The "Hair" director Tom O'Horgan struck again with this freewheeling adaptation of the Andrew Lloyd Webber-Tim Rice concept album. But there's a thin line between boisterous and blasphemous, and both Christians (who didn't like seeing Judas as a protagonist) and Jews (who worried about the villainous depictions of Herod and Caiaphas) ended up protesting the work. Charges of impiety would also arise in later years over "The Book of Mormon," "The Testament of Mary" and especially the Off Broadway play "Corpus Christi."
Oh! Calcutta! (1971)
A few dimly lit seconds in "Hair" gave way to lots and lots of nudity a mere three years later in this revue with segments written by John Lennon, Jules Feiffer, Sam Shepard and (before he pulled the rights) Samuel Beckett. Since American audiences quickly adopted a been-there-seen-that attitude in the 1970s -- "There is no more innocent show in town," reported The New York Times critic Clive Barnes -- the producers actively courted foreign audiences, spending about $ 35,000 a year solely on Japanese-language advertising for its long-running 1976 revival.
Miss Saigon (1991)
Just as "God of Vengeance" yielded its own dramatic adaptation in "Indecent," this pop-opera "Madame Butterfly" update -- which starred a heavily made-up Jonathan Pryce in the role of a Eurasian pimp called the Engineer -- spawned David Henry Hwang's "Yellowface." The producers did away with Mr. Pryce's makeup before the transfer from London, but it wasn't enough to mollify the protesters who gathered outside the Broadway Theater. Every subsequent Engineer on Broadway and on national tours has been played by an actor of Asian heritage.
The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia? (2002)
Edward Albee's plays have rankled everyone from Maoists ("Box and Quotations From Chairman Mao Tse-tung") to the Pulitzer Prize board ("Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"). But it wasn't until this Tony Award-winning drama, in which Bill Pullman and Mercedes Ruehl's characters find themselves in a love triangle with the titular ruminant, that death threats started coming to the theater. "I wanted to write a play examining the limits of our tolerance," Albee told The Hartford Courant, and he soon found out. He was nonplussed that a climactic father-son kiss proved too much for some audience members who had previously handled the vividly described (though not actually depicted) bestiality: "What are we, all Republicans or something?"
The_____ With the Hat (2011)
So many plays have tried employing profanity in their titles that The New York Times's standards editor, Philip B. Corbett, finally had to weigh in with an explanation about all the hyphens and euphemisms put into service. But only Stephen Adly Guirgis's Broadway debut brought this debate to Broadway, with a Playbill that bleeped just two of those 12 letters -- and a website that offered the sound of Elaine Stritch lustily declaiming every _____ing word in the title.

It's Tough Being a Young Skyscraper in New York

Texto completo: The MetLife building was born with an inferiority complex. Even before construction was completed in March 1963, critics called it ugly and unwanted. It was deemed an overgrown, traffic-snarling invader on an already teeming East 42nd Street. Even worse, the tower wasn't nearly the tallest one in New York, and the records it set smacked of desperation: Biggest air conditioning system! Highest helicopter landing pad! The building (originally named after its chief tenant, Pan Am) was the largest skyscraper in Manhattan in terms of square footage. But even that seemed underwhelming when both the Pentagon and the Merchandise Mart, in Chicago, could sit on it and take its lunch money.
New York is a tough place to be a young skyscraper: Wonders have been built here.
By 1915, Manhattan was already a hothouse of architecture revivals and home to grand, wedding-cake masonry and gilt without guilt: the Park Row Building, the Flatiron, the Singer, the Woolworth and the Equitable, among others. "The skyscraper represents capitalism's version of the impulse to build great monuments," said Jason M. Barr, an economist at Rutgers University, Newark, and author of "Building the Skyline: The Birth and Growth of Manhattan's Skyscrapers."
In the late 1920s -- in a towering ego-measuring contest made possible by advances in construction technology -- three teams vied to construct the tallest building in the world. Automobile magnate Walter Chrysler, at least, was self-aware: His tower, he said, would be "a monument to me." The Chrysler Building's 180-foot spire was constructed clandestinely, inside the building, and hoisted at the last second to dash the dreams of 40 Wall Street, some 70 blocks to the south.
Within a year, of course, another Art Deco marvel was looking down on the Chrysler. In March 1931, The New York Times reported on the completion of the "dirigible mooring mast" atop the Empire State Building, where (according to the plan, anyway) passengers would de-blimp in 30 mile-an-hour winds and walk across a ramp to the top of what was then the tallest building on Earth. That did not pan out. Still, the Empire State retained its title until 1970, when the first of the Twin Towers topped out.
Manhattan has long since bowed out of the race toward space, in favor of going all-in on the luxury condo market, with its $ 238,000,000 crash pads. "The economics of building the world's tallest skyscraper in New York -- they just don't exist," said Mr. Barr. "The only way to do it is to get the government involved, and the government is not going to do that in 21st century." Instead, governments in Asia and the Middle East have aggressively followed the example New York once set. The Burj Khalifa, in Dubai, is now the world's tallest structure. The rest of the top ten is dominated by China.
No one is crying for New York's skyline, of course, because it has an extraordinary number of greatest hits. Asked if he had a favorite building in Manhattan, Mr. Barr laughed at the enormity of the question and named the Flatiron. "But you know another one I love?" he added. "No one talks about it: the American Radiator Building. It's very diminutive but there's a certain charm and elegance to it. In my opinion, Raymond Hood was one of the greatest skyscraper architects ever. "
The Radiator building -- a dark brick beauty with a gilded, Gothic-style top -- was completed in 1924 on Bryant Park. Three years later, it was painted by Georgia O'Keeffe, who was living in a Midtown hotel at the time. True, the building is just 338 feet tall. But maybe the only thing that can surprise us about a skyscraper these days is a little modesty.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Here’s some advice for the media covering President Trump: If you don’t want to be accused of reporting fake news, don’t report fake news.
Case in point: On Monday, CNN correspondent Jim Sciutto reported that a highly-placed U.S. intelligence source inside the Kremlin was pulled “in part, by concerns that President Donald Trump and his administration repeatedly mishandled classified intelligence and could contribute to exposing the covert source as a spy.” Sciutto continued, “The decision to carry out the extraction occurred soon after a May 2017 meeting in the Oval Office in which Trump discussed highly classified intelligence with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and then-Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak. ... [that] had been provided by Israel.”
Sorry, the decision to extract the source was first made before Trump took office, and the reason was mishandling of classified intelligence not by Trump, but bythe Obama administration. As The New York Times reports this week, “C.I.A. officials worried about safety made the arduous decision in late 2016 to offer to extract the source from Russia.” What prompted that decision? Leaks to the media about the covert source’s reporting that Russian president Vladimir Putin personally ordered and orchestrated Russia’s election interference campaign.
The impetus for the extraction decision was a Dec. 14, 2016, NBC News report that “Two senior officials with direct access to the information” said Putin personally directed Russia’s election interference and that “the intelligence came from diplomatic sources and spies working for U.S. allies, the officials said.” NBC added that this new intelligence showing Putin’s direct involvement went much further than the information the U.S. was relying when all 17 intelligence agencies issued a report in October holding Russia responsible for the DNC hack, and that “now the U.S has solid information tying Putin to the operation.”
This leak exposed the fact that the CIA had a spy in Putin’s orbit who was passing on intelligence about the Russian president’s decision making. Who leaked the information? Two senior Obama administration officials. The Times reports that Obama CIA director John Brennan considered the Kremlin source’s reporting “so delicate, and the need to protect the source’s identity so important,” that he kept his reports out of the President’s Daily Brief (PDB) sent them to Obama in “special sealed envelopes to the Oval Office.” The PDB is already one of the most restricted U.S. government documents, so the sealed reports were restricted to an even smaller circle of senior Obama aides. Yet the leak, according to NBC, came from officials “with direct access to the information.” Which Obama aide leaked it? That is for U.S. attorney John Durham to find out, but this much is certain: It was not Donald Trump.
It was after this Obama administration leak that the CIA decided to pull the source. The reason he was not actually pulled at the time is that he initially refused — a decision the Times reports raised concerns that “the informant had been turned and had become a double agent.” Eventually, the source changed his mind. But the decision was made before Trump came to office.
That’s not all. CNN falsely reported that the source was pulled after Trump’s meeting with Russia officials in which he shared intelligence on Syria that was “provided by Israel.” But as I pointed out in May 2017, Trump did not reveal to that Israel was the source of the intelligence. That classified information was revealed to the Times by what the paper described “a current and a former American official familiar with how the United States obtained the information.” Any former official familiar with that intelligence was from the Obama administration. So this leak also came from Team Obama. Even Brennan, the Obama CIA director and virulent Trump critic, admitted that Trump was not to blame and said that “the real damage to national security is ... what was leaked in the aftermath, what was put in the media.”
So, CNN tried to blame Trump for the loss of Kremlin source, when it was really the Obama administration that was responsible for the catastrophic leaks that burned him — and did so citing a leak that did not come from Trump at all, but most likely from a former Obama official. Talk about fake news! Yet despite all this, CNN has not pulled its “fake news” story. Indeed, Sciutto still has it proudly pinned at the top of the Twitter feed. What a disgrace.

Drag-queen debate spotlights creepy trend on right

Texto completo: SACRAMENTO – The Sacramento public library featured a drag-queen story hour, in which men dressed as women read stories to children. It seems bizarre and agenda driven, given that a stated goal was to provide kids with “glamorous, positive and unabashedly queer role models.” I’ve seen drag queens and glamorous isn’t the first thing that jumps to mind.
But who really cares? I avoided the library that day and shrugged it off as something that takes place in a big, diverse, largely free and slightly crazy society. No one was forced to attend. Few people around here were upset. But this local event sparked an intense national debate that highlighted the “battle for the future of conservatism,” as the New Yorker put it.
The New York Post’s op-ed editor, Sohrab Ahmari, learned about the story-telling queens and penned a screed against David French, a writer for the conservative National Review. French has nothing to do with the story hour or drag queens, but epitomizes an older Christian ethic that Ahmari, a young Catholic convert, apparently finds as objectionable as men with names such as Claire Voyance, Adda Miration and Allison Wonder.
In Ahmari’s view, social conservatives need “to fight the culture war with the aim of defeating the enemy and enjoying the spoils in the form of a public square re-ordered to the common good and ultimately the Highest Good.” French, he notes, is too civil and “believes that the institutions of a technocratic market society are neutral zones that should, in theory, accommodate both traditional Christianity and the libertine ways and paganized ideology of the other side.”
Ahmari is a Trump supporter, which is ironic given that the president is known for his libertine ways – and the president’s worldview seems more pagan (i.e., its celebration of power) than Christian. Most significantly, Ahmari embraces an emergent brand of conservatism that’s hostile to markets and individualism. French believes that defending the constitutional order is the best means to defend the rights of everyone, including Christians.
The fracas filled the pages of right-leaning publications and even some liberal ones. Last week, the two faced off at Catholic University of America, where a columnist for the venerable New York Times moderated the figurative fisticuffs before a packed crowd.
Drag queens and religious absolutists might not be your cup of tea, but this debate should get your attention for an eye-popping reason: Many conservatives now believe the country is facing such a dire cultural threat that the nation should essentially jettison some long-standing constitutional restraints and protections.
They want an empowered government to intervene on behalf of their religious values. They might not be theocrats, but they are too close for this libertarian’s comfort. They’re amazingly naïve. What happens to them in a world with few government limits if they can’t grab its levers of power? One need only think about California … and shudder.
Ahmari picked the wrong target, and not just because French was a far more skilled debater. French is a conservative warrior, who has fought numerous legal battles to protect the right of Christians to participate in the public square. He’s not a squish by any definition. “I’m going to fight for the rights of others that I would like to exercise for myself because I also know that my rights are fragile,” he said.
The problems with Ahmari’s view are legion, but French made hay with Ahmari’s lack of specificity. What public policies would he embrace to deal with the “threat” posed by drag queens in libraries? Ahmari offered only lame answers – pass local ordinances and hold congressional hearings.
Local ordinances won’t pass in places such as Sacramento, where these reading hours are culturally acceptable. Congress has little business in local library matters and could only posture. In Ahmari’s world, who gets to decide the public good? One need only look at the endless differences among religious denominations and sects to realize the kind of grudge matches that would ensue if government abandoned its pretense of neutrality.
The government, which abuses its power daily, cannot force people to be moral. An acquaintance, from fundamentalist Iran, told me about the common house parties there, where the burkas come off, booze flows – and where the apartment doormen give a heads up when the religious police are on patrol.
“What this is really about is cultural imperialism, taking America as it is and replacing it with something it’s never been,” opined The American Conservative’s Matt Purple. Sure, the Left is all about cultural imperialism, as it seeks to force its values on us all. But the antidote is protecting everyone’s liberties and winning people’s hearts and minds by persuasion, not force.
I understand the frustrations of religious conservatives, who have watched the culture head off in disturbing directions. But putting up with some drag-queen storytelling seems like a small price to pay to live in a relatively free society.

Texto completo: Today, I decided to try a recipe for "really the best gazpacho ever" shared a while ago by a reader.
My reason for trying it today was that I harvested a basket of ripe tomatoes with spots or cracks and had to do something with them, and quick.
So I cut bad parts off and plugged in my blender. I blended the tomatoes with red onion, cucumber, a Hungarian pepper from my garden, a bit of sherry vinegar, garlic, salt and a decent amount of olive oil. The recipe called for straining afterwards, but you know what? I had a big bowl of it straight from the blender, sans straining. Addictively good.
You could do either, leave as is or strain for an elegant presentation.
Now truth be told, I have a packed file of gazpacho recipes. This one, though, is my newest fave. A smooth Spanish style gazpacho, easy and so fast.
The bonus? It uses those late summer, less than perfect, dead ripe veggies.
Make this gazpacho! Let me know how you like it, OK?

Late summer gazpacho aka best gazpacho Originally from Julia Moskin, New York Times. Here's my adaptation. As always, go to taste.
Ingredients
A good 2 pounds red or combo of ripe tomatoes, cored and chunked up — I used red, yellow, and grape
1 Cubanelle or sweet banana pepper or about half of a sweet bell, seeded and chunked. I used a sweet Hungarian banana pepper
1 cucumber, about 8" long, peeled and chunked
1/3 to 1/2 cup red or mild onion, chunked (careful, here, you can always add more but you can't take away...).
1 nice teaspoon garlic/1 large clove
1 tablespoon sherry vinegar
Salt — I used 11/2 teaspoons
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil or to taste, plus extra to drizzle
Instructions
Put everything but vinegar, salt and oil in blender and blend on high until very smooth. With motor running, add vinegar and salt.
Slowly pour in oil and blend until everything is emulsified and again, smooth. It will be the thickness of salad dressing. If a bit watery, add a little more oil until it's creamy the way you like it.
Now you can either strain it all through strainer or food mill, making sure you press hard on solids, or leave as is, or just strain some of it.
For a silky smooth soup, you should strain it all.
Chill about 6 hours or overnight.
To serve:
Adjust seasonings. If too thick, add a bit of ice water.
Serve with drizzle of oil.
Serve as appetizer or first course in shot or small glasses or as an entre in a bowl.
Try my garlic crostini alongside.
Substitute for sherry vinegar
Try red wine vinegar with maybe a tad of sugar, since sherry vinegar has a sweeter flavor profile.

New book explores hard cider of Finger Lakes

Texto completo: We were delighted to have arrive at our doorstep a zippy new book, literally hot off the press: Jason Wilson's "The Cider Revival: Dispatches from the Orchard."
An engaging read with many good things to say about our beautiful Finger Lakes region, it's a romp through the recent rise of "hard" cider — the smart, hardworking people who graft and grow the classical European cider apple varieties, the dedicated cider makers who seek out "feral" varieties and crab apples in hedgerows and abandoned orchards, the tension between large commercial producers and artisan producers, the drama in the wings: it's all there.
Wilson, who also writes for The Washington Post, New York Times and The New Yorker, tells the story of cider, nearly as old as this country itself. But what grabbed my attention was not only the breadth of his research, but also Wilson's concentration on ciders produced "on the isthmus between Seneca and Cayuga Lakes in New York," where he interviews and tastes along with the apple cullers and producers of the area's fine ciders, among them Redbyrd, Bellwether, Black Diamond, Kite & String (Finger Lakes Cider House), Blackduck, and a little to the south, Eve's Cidery and South Hill Cider, the latter about to open a handsome new cider house near Buttermilk Falls.
Meanwhile, I plan to relax with the book and a glass of cider. Cheers!
Be prepared The New York Citizen Preparedness Training Program is offering a citizen preparedness class at the Village of Trumansburg Board Room, 5 Elm St., at 6 p.m. Thursday.
Taught by members of the New York National Guard, the 1.5-hour course will provide an introduction to responding to weather disasters and active violence situations. They'll advise on preparation for any disaster, developing a family emergency plan, and stocking up on supplies.
Community Chorus recruiting Margo Alexander tells us that the Trumansburg Community Chorus is looking for a few more voices.
The chorus, directed by T'burg's own Alice Ploss, meets each Monday at the Jacksonville Community Methodist Church, 1869 Trumansburg Road in Jacksonville, from 7 to 9 p.m. New members who like to sing are welcome, regardless of formal experience.
The fee is $40 for adults and $25 for students, and scholarships are available. For more information, see tburgchorus.com or check out their Facebook page.
Crafts and chicken On Oct. 5, the Trumansburg Presbyterian Church will host its annual craft sale from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at 69 E. Main St. Interested vendors can obtain information and a contract online at fpculysses@gmail.com.
Meanwhile, across the street, the Trumansburg United Methodist Church will host a chicken barbecue and pie sale, with mouth-watering pies, $10 each, sold from 9 a.m. until the last one's been accounted for. Chicken halves are $6 each, ready about 11 a.m.
Go see the white deer After more than 70 years of isolation, the former Seneca Army Depot is now open for visitors to see the world's largest herd of all-white, white-tailed deer, learn their fascinating story, and see the intriguing remains of the U.S. Army's former weapons storage facility.
Seneca White Deer is looking for volunteers to support its tour program: tour guides, drivers, reception workers, people to help their marketing outreach, and others to bolster the success of their historical and wildlife educational program. Call 315-759-8220 or email them (info@senecawhitedeer.org) to sign up.
Changing of the guard Outgoing Trumansburg Rotary President Mike Jimenez passed the gavel to incoming President Mary Bouchard this summer. Trumansburg Rotary thanks Jimenez for his enthusiastic leadership during a great year for the club.
You may know Bouchard from her local work as a CPA, but did you also know that for years, she's led student delegations to rural Alaska to help Native Alaskans with their taxes? And you may have caught her performance as the terrifying child-catching witch in the T'burg Community Players Production of "Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang."
President Mary's Rotary goals include catching some new Rotarians.
What's new at the TCFA? So much! The Trumansburg Conservatory of Fine Arts is abuzz with early-fall classes, and upcoming concerts and art exhibits. According to managing director Mark Costa, dance classes have already begun, but it's not too late to register. For further information, check outtburgconservatory.org/dance.
For families, there's a four-week session of song, dance and yoga, and tumbling for students ages 1 to 2, and Nancy Kane is back Mondays, teaching beginner and adult Irish dance, musical theater and rough-and-tumble classes for kids. Last, but not least, the contra dance Jane Doe Trio, with steps called by Pamela Goddard, will perform at the conservatory from 7 to 9 p.m. Sept. 28, and everyone is invited to come and dance. Admission is $10.
From 7 to 9 p.m. Oct. 5, multi-instrumentalist, teacher and composer Bill Gregg will present an environmental concert, inspired by his contemplation of the consequences of changing global climate patterns. In 2013, this suite of 13 futuristic synthesizer/computer/acoustic musical works was recognized by Sustainable Tompkins with the "Signs of Sustainability" award, and TCFA is pleased to present this encore performance.
Last gasp of summer Trimmer's Ice Cream, just past the north end of the village, is holding an Ice Cream and Food Truck Fair from noon to 8 p.m. Saturday.
The Lake Country Food Truck will be there, and if you haven't had enough ice cream this summer, get in on the fun. This event's special sundae will be the PB&J, and all proceeds from its sale will be donated to the Trumansburg Central School Nurses' Fund.
And at the library ... Don't miss the Ulysses Philomathic Library book sale, Sept. 18 to 25, where you'll find lots of good reading to get you and your gang through the winter.
On Sept. 26 at 6:30 p.m., the library invites you to a talk by local author, and web developer and designer Scott Dawson on his new book, "The Art of Working Remotely."

Texto completo: The final note has been sung in the final dress rehearsal, the caterers have begun preparing the gala meal, the tickets are at will call and the forecast calls for sunny skies, but Los Angeles Opera prepared to open its 34th season Saturday with a dark cloud still looming overhead: the sexual harassment allegations against Placido Domingo.
With Domingo staying away from Los Angeles while an internal investigation is underway, the company pushed ahead Friday on season-opener plans with its general manager absent and rumors swirling about whether he will step down. Domingo has not spoken about the allegations since issuing an initial statement that was part apology and part denial, and neither L.A. Opera nor the law firm it hired for the investigation, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, responded to The Times' questions about the inquiry.
On Friday that left crews to prepare for what in any other year would be an opening night of pure celebration, with a splashy production of Puccini's "La Boheme" conceived by noted director Barrie Kosky providing the crescendo, and an elaborate black-tie ball outside the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on the newly renovated Music Center Plaza as the grand finale. With individual tickets running $2,588 to $15,525, the evening of dinner, dancing and cocktails beneath the stars -- one of L.A. Opera's most important fundraisers -- now will unfold with the possibility of protests.

The company did not say if extra security measures were being taken to address the prospect of a demonstration. Guests arriving at the Music Center's valet station will see a minimal red carpet with no step-and-repeat photography, lest anything delay their entry to a new welcome center building for check-in. After the performance, the ball will take place on the open-air plaza but behind a fabric perimeter. With John Leguizamo's "Latin History for Morons" playing at the Ahmanson Theatre across the plaza, public access to the space will remain open via stairs, and restaurants will be open. The prospect of a #MeToo protest appeared not to have hurt ticket sales. The production, in which Domingo has no part, has seen ticket sales fairly typical of a season opener -- as of midday Friday, not sold out but close.
The company, meanwhile, sought to prevent the accusations against its star from detracting from "La Boheme."
"We are thrilled with and proud of the work that more than 350 of our tireless and talented staffers, artistic corps and guest artists have been doing behind the scenes for months," L.A. Opera's president and chief executive, Christopher Koelsch, said via email to The Times. "Their sensational 'La Boheme' is a bold, and emotionally affecting take on the classic -- and one that I have every hope will resonate strongly with today's audiences."
But the challenge of moving ahead with the season will remain difficult given the distractions and external pressures that come with an investigation. While San Francisco Opera has already canceled an Oct. 6 appearance by Domingo and the Dallas Opera canceled its March gala concert with Domingo, the Metropolitan Opera in New York reiterated that it has not made a decision on Domingo's scheduled appearance in "Macbeth," that company's season opener Sept. 25. The Met said it was withholding judgment until the results of L.A. Opera's investigation are in, creating pressure for a timely resolution, and the New York Times reported that Domingo did indeed start rehearsals at the Met last week.
The scandal, among the biggest to hit the opera world, centers on two Associated Press reports in which two named singers and 18 anonymous women accused Domingo of sexual harassment and misconduct including unwanted touching, kisses, persistent late-night phone calls and hurt careers if those advances were rebuffed. The AP articles characterized Domingo's behavior as an open secret at L.A. Opera. The company issued a statement saying that it took the allegations "extremely seriously."
"We believe all our employees and artists should feel valued, supported and safe," the company said. "We are, however, unable to discuss any specific claim."
Sources close to company operations said that Domingo is not involved in day-to-day management of the company while the investigation is open.

Editor
Sarah Carr has covered education for the last 20 years, reporting on battles over school vouchers, efforts to educate China's massive population of migrant children, and the explosion of charter schools in New Orleans. She has worked for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, the New Orleans Times-Picayune and The Chronicle of Higher Education, and contributed to dozens of other publications, including The Atlantic, Slate, and the Washington Post. For the last five years, she led an education reporting fellowship at Columbia Journalism School focused on race and inequality. Carr is the author Hope Against Hope, which tells the story of New Orleans schools post-Hurricane Katrina, through the eyes of a student, teacher, and principal. She serves on the board of the national Education Writers Association and authored the organization's guides to interviewing children and visiting schools.
Malcolm Gay
Malcolm Gay has been a staff writer at the Boston Globe since 2015, where he's covered visual and performing arts for the paper. His work ranges from narrative projects to investigations, and in 2018 he was a lead writer and reporter on The Valedictorians Project, an innovative look at what became of the city's best and brightest. Before joining the Globe, Gay wrote frequently for The New York Times, and he has contributed to The Atlantic, Time, Wired, and several other publications. A former Alicia Patterson Fellow, he has won numerous national journalism awards, including top honors from the James Beard Foundation, the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies, and the National Association of Black Journalists. His first book, “The Brain Electric," which chronicles the race to merge minds with machines, was published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux in October 2015.
Meghan Irons
Meghan E. Irons has long examined the intersection of race and class with education, politics, and everyday life. A 17-year veteran of the Globe, she was a lead reporter on the Globe's Valedictorians Project, which chronicled the struggles of Boston's top students as they entered adulthood. She provided the most in-depth look inside the iconic Boston Latin School as it reeled from allegations of racism in 2016, spending a week at the school with students and teachers. As the Globe's City Hall bureau chief, she also led the coverage of a new Boston mayor, the first new administration in 20 years, with a focus on education, public policies and initiatives. Irons grew up in Boston's Dorchester and Mattapan neighborhoods, and attended the Burke High School. She still lives in Boston.
James Vaznis
James Vaznis likes to delve into stories that probe racial, economic, and educational disparities in public schools, especially through the lenses of students, teachers, parents, and administrators. These stories ideally examine why school systems and the state are failing to eliminate these disparities — by digging through data and documents — while holding public officials accountable for their inaction or misguided policies. Other stories highlight initiatives that are getting results with an eye towards explaining how and why these efforts are working. He is also interested in chronicling the growing attempts by educators and others to address the social and emotional well-being of students — an issue that cuts across urban, suburban, and rural lines — that is effectively turning some schools into social service agencies. James has been a reporter for The Boston Globe since 2002 and has been covering K-12 education since 2008. He has also reported on New Hampshire, the suburbs, crime, and higher education for the Globe. Previously, he worked for The Daily News of Newburyport and the Concord Monitor where he covered education and other issues.
Bianca Vázquez Toness
Bianca Vázquez Toness has long written about education, poverty, and immigration, both in this country and abroad. Most recently, she covered K-12 education for WGBH News in Boston, where her investigation of exam school admissions revealed how Boston Public School students were at a disadvantage getting into the city's most elite public schools. She started her career in Mexico and later spent years reporting on the experience of Mexican and other Latin American immigrants in Washington state, Minnesota and Massachusetts. Her stories have aired on NPR's Morning Edition and All Things Considered, along with PRI's The World, and have been published in Bloomberg Businessweek, Quartz, The Christian Science Monitor and Time. She was a Knight Science Journalism Fellow at MIT in 2016-2017, and has a bachelor's degree in cultural anthropology from Princeton University.
Jenna Russell
Jenna Russell is an award-winning reporter for the Boston Globe whose recent work on immigration has twice been selected for publication in the Best American Newspaper Narratives anthology, published annually by the Mayborn Institute. Her previous work with the Globe Spotlight Team – a two-year investigation of the failures of the Massachusetts mental health care system - was a finalist for the 2017 Pulitzer Prize in local reporting. Jenna is a former higher education beat reporter and the co-author of two Globe books: Last Lion, a 2009 biography of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, and Long Mile Home, about the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing.

Texto completo: In brief
Basketball: The U.S. will leave the World Cup with its worst finish in a major international tournament, assured of finishing no better than seventh after falling to Serbia 94-89 in a consolation playoff game Thursday in Dongguan, China.
The previous worst finish for a U.S. men's team in 45 tournament appearances was sixth at the 2002 world championships. The Americans - the top-ranked team in the world - will be either seventh or eighth in China, depending on the outcome of their consolation finale Saturday.
Harrison Barnes scored 22 for the U.S., which got 18 from Kemba Walker and 16 from Khris Middleton.
Bogdan Bogdanovic scored 28 for Serbia, which ran out to a quick 25-point lead and handed the U.S. its second loss in two days.
Justify had positive test; Baffert blames food
Horse racing: Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert denied giving 2018 Triple Crown winning horse Justify a banned substance that caused a positive test prior to last year's Kentucky Derby and blamed the result on contaminated food.
Baffert said in a statement that he "unequivocally" rejects the implication he'd give Justify or any other horse scopolamine, which the colt tested positive for in April 2018. The New York Times reported Justify tested positive for the substance after winning the Santa Anita Derby and that the California Horse Racing Board did not adequately investigate the matter.
Justify was allowed to run in the Kentucky Derby a month later and went on to become horse racing's 13th Triple Crown winner.
Baffert said Justify passed drug tests in Kentucky, Maryland and New York on the way to the Triple Crown and called on those states' testing agencies to "immediately release information related to Justify's test results" there. Justify did not run another race after winning the Triple Crown and was retired.
Angels' Ohtani sidelined due to knee surgery
MLB: Shohei Ohtani will miss the rest of the Los Angeles Angels' season to have surgery on his left kneecap.
Los Angeles (67-80) has been eliminated from playoff contention with 15 games left.
Ohtani will need eight to 12 weeks to recover from surgery on a bipartite patella, or a two-part kneecap, according to the Angels. The team didn't specify the reason for addressing the condition now.
Ohtani finishes his second major league season batting .286 with 18 homers and 62 RBIs in 106 games as the Angels' designated hitter.
The 2018 AL Rookie of the Year didn't pitch this season after undergoing Tommy John surgery last year. He is expected to pitch and hit in 2020.
Yelich won't need surgery: Milwaukee outfielder Christian Yelich won't need surgery on his broken right kneecap, but the team said it's unlikely he'll return this season.
Brewers general manager David Stearns said Yelich's recovery is expected to take eight to 10 weeks. Yelich was back in Milwaukee on Wednesday for tests, a day after the reigning NL MVP fouled a ball off his leg during a game in Miami.
Shelton grabs lead
at PGA's Greenbrier
Golf: Robby Shelton shot an 8-under-par 62 to take a two-stroke lead after the first round of A Military Tribute at The Greenbrier in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.
Defending champion Kevin Na, Lanto Griffin, Mark Hubbard, rookie Scott Harrington and Zack Sucher opened with 64s in the PGA Tour's season opener at the Old White TPC.
Shelton, Griffin, Harrington and Hubbard spent last season on the Korn Ferry Tour. Sucher split time between the Korn Ferry circuit and PGA Tour.
Brian Harman, Sung Kang of South Korea, Harold Varner III and Jimmy Walker topped the group at 65.

Bad feed gets the blame for bad Justify test; CHRB decided not to penalize eventual Triple Crown winner or trainer Baffert.

Texto completo: Justify, who dominated the equine world last year when he became the 13th winner of the Triple Crown, has thrust horse racing back into an unwelcome spotlight after it was reported that the colt failed a drug test following his victory in the Santa Anita Derby.
Justify tested positive for scopolamine, a compound commonly found in jimson weed, a wild-growing plant, which according to veterinarians has little to no effect on performance. Justify was not alone at Santa Anita, as seven horses in five barns tested positive at the same time, indicating it was not some random case of a trainer seeking an edge.
In this case, the trainer would be Hall of Famer Bob Baffert.

The cases against Justify and the other six horses were dropped after the California Horse Racing Board determined that the positive tests were caused by simple feed contamination. The failed drug test was first reported by the New York Times. Technically, the case should be classified as a poisoning rather than a drugging because of how the drug was ingested.
The timing of the positive test and how it was handled has become the subject of much discussion in a sport that has had more than its share of scrutiny this year, including the death of 30 horses at Santa Anita and the race-day disqualification of a Kentucky Derby winner, the first time that has happened in 145 years.
Chuck Winner, who was the chairman of the CHRB at the time, on Thursday cited "overwhelming evidence that Justify, along with six other horses in four different barns at Santa Anita, ingested scopolamine from jimson weed which was present in the hay that had been delivered to the barns.
"It would have been a complete miscarriage of justice for the CHRB to have taken action against Justify or Baffert, knowing full well that the horse was poisoned by an environmental contaminate and not injected with a substance," Winner said.
Even if the process had moved at rocket speed and the seven horses had been found in violation, Justify still would not have been disqualified as the winner of the Santa Anita Derby or denied a spot in the Kentucky Derby.
The drug was originally classified in California as a "3b," which if detected could lead to disqualification. But the Assn. of Racing Commissioners International (RCI), which sets industry standards, including drug limits for horses and greyhounds, had reclassified the drug as a less serious "4c," for which violations don't result in disqualifications.
California automatically adopts all RCI rules unless the board votes otherwise. The CHRB website -- because of a clerical oversight, according to Winner -- had not updated the classification, and because the board hadn't voted for a change, scopolamine was technically a 4c in the state.
Dr. Rick Arthur, equine medical director of the CHRB, said the drug can be used as a bronchodilator, but "the pharmacological effect is nil."
Arthur called this contamination "unusual but not unprecedented," and referred back to March 2013, when 48 instances of zilpaterol violations were thrown out because of feed contamination. Zilpaterol is essentially used to increase the size of cattle. In that case, shipments got mixed up and cattle feed was delivered to horse barns. The first horse to test positive came from a March 1 race and the CHRB decided to throw out the cases on March 26.
Word of the positive test also stirred animal rights advocates, who escalated the rhetoric in a sport that has had 13 weeks without a racing death in Southern California.
"Bob Baffert apparently drugged and harmed Justify -- a horse that was completely at his mercy," said Kathy Guillermo, senior vice president of PETA. "Baffert should be suspended and held accountable, and Justify should be disqualified from the Triple Crown victory."
Reaching a decision in medication or doping cases can often drag on for months, if not longer. Baffert was informed about the positive test nine days before the Kentucky Derby.
Samples are often retested and, in this case, the second result on Justify's sample did not come back until three days after the Kentucky Derby. After an investigation by the CHRB staff, the board's executive director, Rick Baedeker, and Arthur recommended that the cases be thrown out.
"California law mandates that test results must remain confidential unless and until a complaint is filed and a complaint can only be filed at the end of an investigative process," Winner said.
Winner said he learned about the investigation about a week before last year's Aug. 23 board meeting. At the board meeting, in closed executive session, the charges were dropped, he said.
"I unequivocally reject any implication that scopolamine was ever intentionally administered to Justify, or any of my horses," Baffert said. "Following the Santa Anita Derby, Justify raced in three different jurisdictions during his Triple Crown run -- Kentucky, Maryland and New York. He passed all drug tests in those jurisdictions. I call on the relevant testing agencies in those jurisdictions to immediately release information related to Justify's test results."

Texto completo: To get into the minds and notebooks of Times journalists, look no further than Instagram. The app allows many reporters, editors and photographers based in New York and around the world to show how their professional and personal lives intersect. Their feeds become a repository for unpublished details and visuals, and serve as a creative outlet for their journalism-related interests. On Fridays this month, we are sharing Instagram accounts from journalists who span The Times's report and take readers behind the scenes. Here are three. LARA TAKENAGA
Kathy Ryan, @kathyryan

Director of photography for The New York Times Magazine
In 2012, a shaft of light falling across some stairs in the Times Building caught Kathy Ryan's eye. She posted a photo of it on Instagram, and from there evolved a series she dubbed "Office Romance."
"It's overwhelmingly about the light for me," says Kathy, who captures The Times through the people and objects in its Renzo Piano-designed building -- "the greatest studio in the world."
Her subjects, often bathed in soft sunlight punctuated by stripes of shadow, appear ethereal in her posts -- a conscious contrast to the chaos of working at a news organization. She shoots them mainly in black and white, with the occasional pop of cherry red, in a style that evokes film noir.
Each post, she says, captioned with the time and date she took the photo, allows her followers "for a split second to be in this remarkable building in this remarkable city." Pete Wells, @pete_wells
Restaurant critic
Pete Wells has a disclaimer in his Instagram bio: "sloppy with lighting; struggling with focus."
"I'm kind of picking the least bad photo from my three visits to a restaurant," Pete says of his approach to posting. "And sometimes it's still pretty bad."
While he makes no claims to high art, his feed brings followers to tables across New York City, from slice shops to high-end sushi counters. They can also see his review process, which often involves comparing meals at similar restaurants.
Pete credits Instagram for "one of the biggest subtle changes in restaurant design" in recent years: lighting fixtures that act as spotlights for your plate, chosen with amateur food photographers in mind. But when the lighting isn't ideal, he admits, he uses his iPhone's flash, "even though it's the biggest no-no in food photography." Sebastian Modak, @sebmodak
52 Places correspondent
Unlike most Times journalists, Sebastian Modak actually has Instagram in his job description. As the 52 Places Traveler, he uses the platform daily to bring along his followers on his yearlong adventure.
Sebastian's feed brims with his best shots from each destination and gives a sneak peek of his weekly columns. But his Instagram Stories are, well, another story. The often humorous slide shows of photos, text and videos reveal the "not fun part of travel" -- flight cancellations, exhaustion, middle-of-the-night driving -- and everyday moments, like a haircut in Croatia, that don't make it into his articles.
Followers have sent Sebastian a plethora of recommendations, and he has taken them up on offers to be his tour guide. "It's a really nice way to meet people," he says, "and I never even thought of Instagram as a tool for that."

Charles M. Blow: My memories of 9/11

Texto completo: It was a normal September morning.
I dressed my children, my 7-year-old son and his 4-year-old twin brother and sister, for school that had just restarted. Lunches were packed, backpacks stuffed, hair combed and teeth brushed.
We walked the two blocks to the school complex under dazzling blue skies, so clear that they looked unreal. Then I came back home to take a nap before heading in to work. It was my normal routine.
Then the phone rang. It was my mother. “I think you need to get to work. Something just hit the World Trade Center,” she said. I was The New York Times’ graphics director at the time. Our form of journalism was to explain the news with maps, charts and diagrams. Plane crashes and damaged buildings were a staple of those explanations.
I turned on the television, and there was smoke coming from one of the buildings. My first thought was that one of the many small Cessna-like planes that buzz around the cities had crashed into the building. My second thought was, “How are they going to repair that?”
I rushed to get dressed and dashed to the subway station. (I still believe that my train was the last on my line allowed into Manhattan that day.) For a brief stretch of track, the train emerged and traveled above ground. When it did, there were gasps and shrieking. The passengers all pressed themselves against the windows on the tower side of the train.
I could see the gaping hole clearly. A Cessna hadn’t done this. The train went back underground. The passengers talked nervously among themselves. Soon, the train arrived at my stop, Times Square, and I dashed up the stairs and into the maelstrom of tourists.
I was making a beeline for The Times’ building when I heard another gasp, this time from thousands of people. I turned, and on the Jumbotron affixed to the building where the New Year’s Eve ball is dropped, I could see that the other tower had been hit. That was not an accident. My stomach dropped.
I turned and ran faster toward The Times. What was happening? How could two separate planes hit the two separate towers? Nothing was making sense. I was numb. I ran to my department. Some of my people were there. They were all waiting to hear my plan. I didn’t really have one.
I knew that we needed to find out what kind of planes had hit the buildings and their flight path on approach. We also needed architectural drawings of the towers, and hopefully be put in contact with someone who helped design it. Everyone scrambled to make calls.
One woman in my department called to ask if I wanted her to go the World Trade Center buildings to see what information she might be able to gather from first responders. I said yes.
Then, the unimaginable happened, then was shown again, and then again. The first of the two towers collapsed. We stood watching the television screen in disbelief. How many people were in that building? The loss of life was inconceivable.
My mind, however, was on the woman I had told to go to the site. There was no way to reach her. Was she OK? Her husband called. “Have you heard from her?” he asked. No, I said. He called back, it seemed, every hour on the hour. It was my job to repeat no. (She said that when the building fell, someone thankfully pushed her into a neighboring building. She walked back across the Brooklyn Bridge, like many others who were covered in ash like ghostly apparitions.)
Of all the ghastly images from that day, one struck me most: It was what looked like birds at the top of one of the towers. They weren’t. People were jumping to certain death. What must that decision have been like? Fire at your back, no help on the way. Jump or burn. Thinking about it to this day chills my skin.
One man in the department broke down crying. His mother worked at the World Trade Center. He wasn’t sure if she was in the building or not. I told him to go home. His pain was personal. The rest of us would have to work through our shock and grief for the sake of millions of others depending on us to make sense of this. That’s journalism.
But then the other tower collapsed. Then a plane crashed into the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. Then a plane crashed in Pennsylvania. There seemed no way to make a coverage plan because there was no way to fully get our arms around what was going on and when it would end. Further complicating things, the phone lines where overwhelmed. It felt like only one out of every 10 calls was getting out.
This was going to require that we work well into the night. But, what about my children? What was I going to do? The babysitter called in the early afternoon to say that she had retrieved them from school (which had closed early) and that she could stay as long as needed. She was my personal hero that day. The bus got caught in a massive traffic jam. She got off and walked across Brooklyn to reach my children. She stayed with them late into the night, leaving her own children with her husband.
We finally finished up that night, providing the public with as much information and explanations as we could provide, and I made my way home. My recollection is that it was after midnight when I arrived. The babysitter was still watching the news in disbelief.
I went into my children’s rooms and woke them. I felt like I had a need to say something. I told them that some bad men had done a bad thing, but that everything was going to be OK. I could grant no assurances that what I was saying was true. In fact, I knew as I was saying it that the world had been irrevocably altered.

Texto completo: 2,500 missing in Bahamas: FREEPORT, Bahamas — An estimated 2,500 people are listed as missing in the Bahamas in Hurricane Dorian’s aftermath, the government said Wednesday. But it cautioned that the names had yet to be checked against the rosters of people evacuated from the devastated islands or staying in shelters. Carl Smith, a spokesman for the country’s National Emergency Management Agency, said he expected the list to shrink as the names are checked.
Trump denies ordering rebuke: WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Wednesday denied instructing an aide to urge a federal agency to repudiate weather forecasters who contradicted his claim that Hurricane Dorian could hit Alabama. Trump responded to a New York Times report that acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to have the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration publicly disavow the position that Alabama was not at risk. A senior administration official told The Associated Press Wednesday night that Mulvaney pushed Ross to "fix" the issue with the Alabama forecast.
Mar-a-Lago trespasser guilty: FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — Yujing Zhang’s desire to meet President Donald Trump and his family turned the Chinese businesswoman into an American felon. A 10-woman, two-man federal jury convicted Zhang on Wednesday of trespassing at the president’s Mar-a-Lago club in March and lying to Secret Service agents. The 33-year-old Shanghai consultant faces up to six years in prison when District Judge Roy Altman sentences her Nov. 22.
Gene-editing to fight HIV: Scientists are reporting the first use of the gene-editing tool CRISPR to try to cure a patient’s HIV infection by providing blood cells that were altered to resist the AIDS virus. Wednesday’s report in the New England Journal of Medicine, by different Chinese researchers, is the first published account of using CRISPR to treat a disease in an adult, where the DNA changes are confined to that person. The attempt was successful in some ways but fell short of being an HIV cure.
Few welcome Mugabe home: HARARE, Zimbabwe — Zimbabwe’s founding leader Robert Mugabe made his final journey back to the country Wednesday, his body flown into the capital amid the contradictions of his long, controversial rule. President Emmerson Mnangagwa, Mugabe’s closest ally and vice president before joining the military-led effort to oust him in 2017, addressed the airport gathering of about 1,000, praising Mugabe as "our revolutionary commander ... an icon of pan-Africanism" and "the man who created our nation." The former guerrilla leader, who died Friday at 95, led the fight to end white-minority rule and ruled Zimbabwe from its independence in 1980 until he was deposed.
Water found at star’s planet: CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — In a tantalizing first, scientists have discovered water at a planet outside our solar system that has temperatures suitable for life. Two research groups announced this week that they’ve found water vapor in the atmosphere of a planet 110 light-years away in the constellation Leo. This so-called Super Earth is just the right distance from its star to conceivably harbor life.

No second season for 'The Good Cop'

Texto completo: Q: Any chance for "The Good Cop" to get another season? That was the most delightful new show we have seen! I mean, Josh Groban with Tony Danza, but with Tony doing all the singing? How cool is that?
A: Netflix decided one run was enough for the series. As Deadline.com reported last year, the show "had not been able to cut through the clutter" of so many other programs to get most viewers' attention.

Q: Be honest: Aren't you astounded that "Supernatural" lasted a whopping 15 seasons, longer than the iconic "Bonanza's" 14 seasons?
A: I can't say I'm astounded, since my entertainment astonishment tends toward other things. How, for instance, was "Freaks and Geeks" only one season? What was David Caruso thinking when he left "NYPD Blue"? Who really thought "BH90210" was a good idea?
"Supernatural's" run - with its 15th and final season beginning Oct. 10 - is not a TV series record. Just among current scripted shows. "The Simpsons," "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit," "NCIS" and "Grey's Anatomy" all predate "Supernatural." But it's a run that most series would envy, and proof that a loyal audience has long existed for the CW thriller, even if you and I may not have watched.

Q: Where is James Norton from "Grantchester"? Is he on another show? We are a group of women who want him back.
A: Norton decided to leave "Grantchester" a while back, and he has apparently been busy. He is in the new version of "Little Women," directed by Greta Gerwig and coming to theaters Christmas Day. For AMC he is in "McMafia," the crime thriller that had a first season last year and has been renewed for a second. Other upcoming projects include "The Nevers," an HBO series from writer-director Joss Whedon, and a miniseries, "The Trial of Christine Keeler."

Q: I am looking for a program where outlaws in the 1880s rob a bank and are chased by a sheriff and his posse when a big storm comes on. The next morning, they wake up to a strange sound - a jet passing overhead. They have been transported to the present day. I would like to know the name and if it is available in any format.
A: That's "Outlaws," which aired on CBS in 1986-87 for 12 episodes, including a two-hour pilot. Rod Taylor played a Texas sheriff in 1899 in pursuit of a bank-robbing gang (William Lucking, Charles Napier, Richard Roundtree and Patrick Houser); after a storm they find themselves in the present day and set up a detective agency. I do not know of an authorized home-video release. Episodes, including the pilot, are available on YouTube.

Q: Please tell me why in the third season of "The Lone Ranger," Clayton Moore was replaced by John Hart, and then Moore returned for the fourth season.
A: As anyone who grew up watching the show can tell you, Clayton Moore was the one true Lone Ranger. (Let's just forget Klinton Spilsbury and Armie Hammer in the role, OK?) But Moore was indeed replaced for a time by John Hart, and different theories have been offered, including that Moore asked for more money or that there were creative differences between Moore and "Lone Ranger" producer George W. Trendle. The 1999 New York Times obituary for Moore says he never was told why he was fired, or why he was rehired. Moore's daughter Dawn, in a 2014 interview available on YouTube, says Trendle believed Moore wanted a share of the merchandising revenue from the show. Since he considered actors playing a masked man were interchangeable, he fired Moore (who, according to Dawn, never would have asked for the merchandising money). But when Hart proved less appealing to audiences, Moore was brought back.

IN BRIEF Justify failed drug test in '18

Texto completo: Justify won the 2018 Triple Crown after a failed postrace drug test at a California track that could have kept the horse out of the Kentucky Derby, The New York Times reported Wednesday.
The Bob Baffert-trained Justify tested positive for the drug scopolamine after winning the Santa Anita Derby, one of the final prep races for the Kentucky Derby. Justify went on to win the Kentucky Derby and took the Preakness and Belmont stakes to complete the Triple Crown.
The Times said instead of a speedy disqualification, the California Horse Racing Board took more than a month to confirm the results. The newspaper also reported that instead of filing a public complaint, the board made decisions behind closed doors as it moved to drop the case and lighten the penalty for horses found to have scopolamine in their systems.
The newspaper said test results, emails and internal memorandums show how California regulators waited nearly three weeks, until the Kentucky Derby was only nine days away, to notify Baffert of the positive test. Then, two months after the Belmont victory, the board disposed of the inquiry altogether during a closed-door executive session.
"We take seriously the integrity of horse racing in California and are committed to implementing the highest standards of safety and accountability for all horses, jockeys and participants," the California Horse Racing Board said in a statement.
The organization said it would have a further statement Thursday.
Basketball: The U.S. was ousted from medal contention by France at the World Cup, failing to capture gold at a major tournament for the first time since the 2006 world championships. Rudy Gobert had 21 points and 16 rebounds and France beat the U.S. 89-79 in the World Cup quarterfinals in Dongguan, China. The U.S. had won 58 consecutive tournament games in FIBA and Olympic competition. It was bidding to become the first nation to win three consecutive World Cups. The U.S. already had qualified for next summer's Olympics in Tokyo.
Golf: Rory McIlroy was voted PGA Tour player of the year over Brooks Koepka after posting the most top-10 finishes and winning the FedEx Cup. It's the third time McIlroy has won the Jack Nicklaus Award, and the first without having won a major.
NHL: The Bruins signed coach Bruce Cassidy, 54, to a multiyear contract extension. Terms of the deal weren't available.

Texto completo: Here’s a Jeopardy! answer for you to consider: The federal debt, free trade, a consistent national security policy, and young voters. The question: What are things conservatism has lost?
But the biggest conservative calamity of all, and one that creates real jeopardy at the polls, is the loss of its narrative. Conservatives, whose message was once individual liberty and limited government, are instead now branded by the narrower and less popular narrative of capitalism and free markets. It turns out that path is a dead end, especially among younger voters.
As Patrick Dineen pointed out in his book Why Liberalism Failed, the two great operating systems of our time are now the state (big government) and the market (capitalism). To many, including most young people, these are both opaque systems operated by distant forces beyond their understanding and influence. Both are undesirable but, of the two, government at least allows some kind of voice or representation of the people, so to young people it seems fairer than the harsh markets that produce winners and losers.
Indeed, the perceived harshness of capitalism and the market is the underlying cause of the recent rise of the once-despised term "socialism" in the American vocabulary. As presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg explained, “I think the reason we’re having this argument over socialism and capitalism is that capitalism has let a lot of people down.” Young people, who lived through the recession of 2008 and its aftermath, carry huge student debt, experience wage stagnation and lower-paying jobs, and are resigned to less financial success and security than their parents.
Unfortunately, for Republicans and conservatives, they are associated with free markets and capitalism, whereas liberals and Democrats are for big government. A 2017 Pew survey found that 57% of Americans 18-29 years old want a “bigger government with more services,” compared with only 38-40% of those ages 50 and up. Young people say they are interested in “socialism” but, if you probe a little more deeply, what they really want is free stuff: free college education, reduction of student debt, help with the high cost of housing, and the like, and this is precisely the direction most of the Democratic presidential candidates are heading.
Conservatives and Republicans have only begun to realize that their singular pursuit of capitalism and free markets is heading over the cliff and appear to be at a loss on what to do about it. Conservative commentator Tucker Carlson shocked his Fox News audience on Jan. 2 with a tirade against capitalism that could well have been articulated by Sen. Bernie Sanders. David Brooks, the New York Times conservative columnist, worries that economic competitors have been too focused on their own short-term gains and have lost their moral compass. Now there is a debate on reforming corporate practice to take account of more goals than just shareholder value. It will doubtless take a while to see if conservatives are able to reform capitalism to the satisfaction of young people, or whether their efforts will be seen as just putting lipstick on a pig.
The larger point, however, is that there is a larger point to conservatism than just capitalism and free markets, and it is here that conservatives need to take their stand. Conservatives have traditionally believed that freedom is indivisible and extends to political, religious, social, personal freedoms, right along with economic freedom. They are the champions of the opening line of the Declaration of Independence claiming that America is about “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” They are the defenders of the Constitution that set up systems by which individual liberty is to be guaranteed, especially from threats by big government.
Young people, who still love their individualism, resent being told they must wear helmets and pads through life, don’t like to be told they can’t buy a 16-ounce soda or an e-cigarette, or that their private health insurance is now illegal under Obamacare. They can still be reached by a message of individual liberty and limited government. That is where conservatives must begin their narrative, not with today’s bogeymen of capitalism and free markets.

Ross Douthat: Can the right escape racism?

Texto completo: Last week I wrote a column that simultaneously argued that conservatism has a problem with white-nationalist infiltration and that liberalism, influenced by the revival of racial chauvinism in the Trump era, is increasingly tempted to smear mainstream conservatives as racist.
The response was varied, but a common critique from the left was that any defense of individual conservatives from the charge of racism is basically irrelevant to the underlying structural reality that the Trump era has exposed — which is that the American right’s coalition is founded on racism, endures because of racism and has no future as a morally decent force unless it is essentially refounded, its racist roots torn out.
One of the more temperate versions of this argument was offered by New York magazine’s Zak Cheney-Rice, taking on my own essay and a column by Tim Carney of The Washington Examiner calling for conservative institutions to make themselves inhospitable to white identity politics. Such calls are well and good, wrote Cheney-Rice, but they wildly understate the challenge:
“… racism has been fundamental to American conservatism, and the GOP in particular, since the mid-20th century realignment of the parties — even as its purportedly defining tenets have proved to be negotiable, from small government to antagonism toward autocrats to reduced deficit spending. None of this precludes the existence of nonracist conservatives, to be sure. It just makes them some of the least influential people in their movement, and renders their claims to broader relevance akin to shouting into a void.”
Cheney-Rice goes on to catalog various conservative policies, from border detention camps to voter-ID laws, that reflect the deeper-than-Donald-Trump influence of racism on the right. He argues that the various conservative factions have consistently made their peace with racism and racist policies since Richard Nixon, not just since 2016. And he suggests that since “the Republican Party would collapse without support from racists,” there is probably no path to a nonracist GOP that doesn’t involve the total defeat and total reconstruction of the party.
Cheney-Rice is right that there is considerably more racism on the right than Republican Party elites wanted to believe pre-Trump and that the elite has conspicuously failed to confront its more overt and toxic forms — which is part of how we ended up with a birther as the president of the United States. In the longer view, he’s also right that white identity politics has been important to the conservative coalition since the 1960s, when the strategic and policy choices that the Nixon-era Republican Party made — in effect, rallying voters who opposed the Great Society’s vision of racial redress — ensured that a lot of racially conservative and racist white voters would migrate into the GOP.
But I disagree with Cheney-Rice that these underlying realities make change, indeed dramatic change, in how conservative politics approaches race all but unimaginable. Some of that difference reflects philosophical differences about what constitutes racist public policy: I think conservatism can be nonracist, or at least substantially less racialized, without embracing the current progressive definition (from reparations to substantial immigration increases to single-payer health care) of what anti-racism requires. But some of it reflects a different interpretation of the complexities of conservative policy history, and how our politics has reduced racial polarization in the past.
Those complexities first: If it’s true that conservative politicians, in the age of Trump and earlier, have supported policies that disadvantage minorities, it’s also true that the record of every post-Nixon Republican administration has mixed other policies as well. Nixon himself accepted elements of the Great Society even as he undermined others. As Noah Smith pointed out recently, the modern multiracial America was forged as much by eight years of Ronald Reagan’s pro-immigration conservatism as by the original liberalizing 1965 reforms. George W. Bush’s administration sharply increased education spending in the hopes of closing racial gaps, pushed a homeownership agenda with a similar purpose, and started an AIDS-in-Africa initiative that saved millions of nonwhite lives. And for all his race-baiting, even Trump has pursued policies that don’t fit the white-identitarian frame — most notably a criminal-justice reform that built on state-by-state efforts that were championed by religious conservatives and libertarians as often as by Democrats.
So it’s been possible, in various ways and at various moments, for the post-Nixon Republican Party to be something other than just a coalition defending white supremacy. (There has also been somewhat more racism lurking below the surface of progressive politics over the same period — as genteel eugenics, as elite NIMBYism, as left-wing or Sharptonian anti-Semitism — than most polemics against the right acknowledge, but that’s a subject for another time.)
And the racialized element in conservative politics has also ebbed and flowed depending on the political situation. When I came to political awareness in the early 1990s, American politics was dominated by racially polarizing controversies over crime, welfare and affirmative action. But by the time I graduated from college, a decade later, those issues had receded, the major cultural controversies had changed and conservatism’s agenda under the younger Bush was consciously designed to win over at least some minority voters and leave the Lee Atwater era behind.
That change didn’t happen because the Republican Party was destroyed and refounded in 1999. It happened because the racialized issues dividing the country circa 1992 were somewhat successfully addressed by politicians of both parties, or else partly resolved themselves. The Clinton-Gingrich years brought compromises on welfare reform and affirmative action, successful policing strategies that helped bring down the crime rate, and an economic boom that made every policy debate seem somewhat less zero-sum. The subsequent turn to “compassionate conservatism” happened because these shifts happened first; the Republican voter base didn’t suddenly become perfectly racially enlightened, but the salience of race changed dramatically as crime rates fell and welfare was reformed.
And this shift was not just a case of white America making deals at black America’s expense and congratulating itself. Blacks as well as whites had a relatively optimistic view of race relations around the turn of the millennium, and that sentiment persisted until Barack Obama’s second term. Racial polarization hardly disappeared, especially in the voting booth, but it was more muted in the George W. Bush era than before or since. And it might have remained muted if the Bush administration had not fallen into a very different error than racism — the error of unbounded moralistic optimism, which after the Iraq disaster and the financial crisis made darker, more culturally pessimistic varieties of conservatism seem like wisdom to many voters on the right.
So without arguing that racism is going to disappear outright from conservative politics after this presidency, the recent historical record at least suggests that another muting could happen, another substantial diminishment of racial polarization, at some point in the post-Trump future. Especially since there is little evidence that Trump himself is making Americans or Republicans more racist, or that his most racially polarizing strategies are actually politically effective: Instead, his main achievement has been to activate latent bigotries rather than expand their influence, and what can be activated can presumably be suppressed.
If you draw lessons from the 1990s and 2000s, that suppression would require more than just the quarantine of overt white supremacists (though it does require that). First, following the pattern of the crime and welfare debates, it would probably require a sense among populist voters that today’s equivalent to those controversies, the debate over the pace of immigration and the security of the southern border, had been addressed in a way that wasn’t just a capitulation to the left or to big business.
Second, it would require a recovery of influence and moral ambition by the Republican Party’s religious conservatives — a group whose elites shaped the Bush presidency’s racially inclusive efforts and whose rank-and-file are still less inclined to white-identity politics than other conservative constituencies, despite their Faustian bargain with Trump.
Third, it would require some clear successes by Democrats in states like Texas and Georgia, where the GOP is currently hanging on to power with thinning white majorities, to prove to Republican politicians that a strategy of voter-ID laws and base turnout really is as foredoomed as optimistic liberals hope.
Finally, it would require imaginative statesmanship by the next generation of Republican leaders, who would be wise to recognize that the Democratic Party’s leftward shift — and particularly the way that white liberals have lately overleapt minorities in their racial pessimism — is an opportunity and not just a threat, because it leaves a potential pan-ethnic center available for a less bunkered and bigoted populist conservatism to claim.
This list of requirements is not small, and there are plenty of reasons to doubt they will be met. The media ecology has changed since the late 1990s in ways that make suppression and quarantine more difficult. Trump himself had the opportunity and the credibility to make a base-satisfying deal on immigration, but that opportunity has passed. Religious conservatism’s compromise with Trumpism may ultimately prove fatal to its influence. The Democrats’ leftward move should inspire entrepreneurship and outreach from Republicans, but it could help sustain the GOP’s own base strategy instead. Many GOP donors prefer a party of white-identity politics and tax cuts to the more economically populist and ethnically diverse alternative. And Trump’s toxic Twitter influence will endure, no doubt, even once his presidency has ended.
But meeting the requirements doesn’t seem obviously less plausible than the world imagined by some fervent Trumpists, where the GOP somehow holds onto power just by winning an ever larger share of the white vote — or for that matter the world imagined by certain hopeful liberals, where the GOP remains a white-identitarian party and simply gets steamrollered into irrelevance as in California.
My scenario also has one piece of grim plausibility going for it: It wouldn’t end the hysterical polarization that defines our times so much as redirect it. A religious-populist conservatism with more appeal to blacks and Hispanics could easily inspire as much fear and anxiety among liberal mandarins as the current Trumpist version. And instead of defending conservatives against charges of racism, I could get back to my true vocation: defending conservatives against charges of theocracy.
Someday, God willing. Someday.

Texto completo: New England Patriots wide receiver Antonio Brown has been accused of rape by a former trainer.
Britney Taylor says Brown sexually assaulted her on three occasions, according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday in the Southern District of Florida.
Brown has denied the allegations. Darren Heitner, a lawyer representing Brown, says it was "a consensual personal relationship."
The New York Times first reported about the lawsuit.
Messages were left seeking comment from the Patriots and the NFL.
Brown was released by the Oakland Raiders last week after clashing with the team throughout training camp. He agreed to a contract with New England on Saturday, but has yet to play for the Patriots.
BROWNS
Beckham Jr. plans to keep wearing watch in games
BEREA, Ohio - Watch it: Odell Beckham Jr.'s taking a stand against the NFL on his lavish wrist wear.
Beckham said Tuesday that he intends to keep wearing the expensive watch he had on during Sunday's season opener against the Tennessee Titans. The showy wide receiver believes the league has made an issue out of his jewelry only because it's him.
"I'm here to play football. I would love for them to talk about football and what I do on the field, if I messed up on the field or if I didn't do well on the field, talk about my performance," he said. "Don't talk about any extracurricular, that's just it. If anybody else would've worn the watch, or if it was a $20 watch, it wouldn't have been no problem."
Beckham feels he's being targeted.
"Yeah, that's just my life," he said. "If it ain't this, it's something else. If it wasn't the watch, it would've been the way that I tie my shoes."
On Monday, a league spokesman said there is no rule prohibiting players from wearing jewelry. However there is a policy "prohibiting hard objects."
The league spoke to the Browns, but to this point Beckham said he has not been contacted.
JETS
Team gives Pats draft pick to acquire WR Thomas
NEW YORK - The New York Jets are getting some roster help from the most unlikely of sources: Bill Belichick and the New England Patriots.
Adam Gase's squad acquired wide receiver Demaryius Thomas from the Patriots for a 2021 sixth-round draft pick on Tuesday, according to a person with direct knowledge of the deal.
ESPN first reported the deal - the first trade between the AFC East rivals since Bill Belichick took over as the Patriots' coach in 2000. The last trade between the teams was actually when Belichick left the Jets for the Patriots, and New York got a first-round pick.
Thomas became expendable for the Patriots when they signed Antonio Brown over the weekend.
The 31-year-old Thomas gives the Jets' receiving group an immediate boost, joining Robby Anderson, Quincy Enunwa and Jamison Crowder.
Shepherd to sit 6 games
NEW YORK - New York Jets defensive lineman Nathan Shepherd was suspended six games Tuesday by the NFL for violating the league's policy on performance-enhancers.
Shepherd will be eligible to return to the Jets' active roster on Oct. 28, following New York's game at Jacksonville.
Shepherd was inactive for the Jets' season opener against Buffalo on Sunday. The second-year defensive lineman from Fort Hays State was a third-round draft pick by New York last year.
TEXANS
Center signs extension
HOUSTON - Center Nick Martin has signed a three-year, $33 million contract extension with the Houston Texans.
Martin, who is set to make just more than $1.1 million this season, will be under contract through the 2022 season.
Martin was drafted in the second round in 2016 and played 30 games in his first two seasons with the Texans. The extension will keep Martin in Houston while the Texans try to build continuity on a line that allowed an NFL-high 62 sacks last season.
IN OTHER NEWS
The Kansas City Chiefs have returned De'Anthony Thomas to the active roster and waived fellow wide receiver Byron Pringle with the hope that they can sign him to the practice squad should he clear waivers.
The Pittsburgh Steelers will likely be without fullback and special teams captain Rosie Nix for Sunday's visit by Seattle. Coach Mike Tomlin said Tuesday that Nix is dealing with a knee injury.
The Seattle Seahawks have re-signed veteran cornerback Jamar Taylor, who was one of Seattle's final cuts at the end of training camp.
The Tennessee Titans have added center Hroniss Grasu to their active roster and waived running back Dalyn Dawkins.
The New York Jets have signed Sam Ficken to try to solve their ongoing kicking woes.

Texto completo: Q: Any chance for "The Good Cop" to get another season? That was the most delightful new show we have seen! I mean, Josh Groban with Tony Danza, but with Tony doing all the singing? How cool is that?
A: Netflix decided one run was enough for the series. As Deadline.com reported last year, the show "had not been able to cut through the clutter" of so many other programs to get most viewers' attention.

Q: Be honest: Aren't you astounded that "Supernatural" lasted a whopping 15 seasons, longer than the iconic "Bonanza's" 14 seasons?
A: I can't say I'm astounded, since my entertainment astonishment tends toward other things. How, for instance, was "Freaks and Geeks" only one season? What was David Caruso thinking when he left "NYPD Blue"? Who really thought "BH90210" was a good idea?
"Supernatural's" run - with its 15th and final season beginning Oct. 10 - is not a TV series record. Just among current scripted shows. "The Simpsons," "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit," "NCIS" and "Grey's Anatomy" all predate "Supernatural." But it's a run that most series would envy, and proof that a loyal audience has long existed for the CW thriller, even if you and I may not have watched.

Q: Where is James Norton from "Grantchester"? Is he on another show? We are a group of women who want him back.
A: Norton decided to leave "Grantchester" a while back, and he has apparently been busy. He is in the new version of "Little Women," directed by Greta Gerwig and coming to theaters Christmas Day. For AMC he is in "McMafia," the crime thriller that had a first season last year and has been renewed for a second. Other upcoming projects include "The Nevers," an HBO series from writer-director Joss Whedon, and a miniseries, "The Trial of Christine Keeler."

Q: I am looking for a program where outlaws in the 1880s rob a bank and are chased by a sheriff and his posse when a big storm comes on. The next morning, they wake up to a strange sound - a jet passing overhead. They have been transported to the present day. I would like to know the name and if it is available in any format.
A: That's "Outlaws," which aired on CBS in 1986-87 for 12 episodes, including a two-hour pilot. Rod Taylor played a Texas sheriff in 1899 in pursuit of a bank-robbing gang (William Lucking, Charles Napier, Richard Roundtree and Patrick Houser); after a storm they find themselves in the present day and set up a detective agency. I do not know of an authorized home-video release. Episodes, including the pilot, are available on YouTube.

Q: Please tell me why in the third season of "The Lone Ranger," Clayton Moore was replaced by John Hart, and then Moore returned for the fourth season.
A: As anyone who grew up watching the show can tell you, Clayton Moore was the one true Lone Ranger. (Let's just forget Klinton Spilsbury and Armie Hammer in the role, OK?) But Moore was indeed replaced for a time by John Hart, and different theories have been offered, including that Moore asked for more money or that there were creative differences between Moore and "Lone Ranger" producer George W. Trendle. The 1999 New York Times obituary for Moore says he never was told why he was fired, or why he was rehired. Moore's daughter Dawn, in a 2014 interview available on YouTube, says Trendle believed Moore wanted a share of the merchandising revenue from the show. Since he considered actors playing a masked man were interchangeable, he fired Moore (who, according to Dawn, never would have asked for the merchandising money). But when Hart proved less appealing to audiences, Moore was brought back.

Texto completo: Patriots wide receiver Antonio Brown has been accused of rape by a former trainer.
Britney Taylor says Brown sexually assaulted her on three occasions, according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday in the Southern District of Florida.
Brown has denied the allegations. Darren Heitner, a lawyer representing Brown, says it was "a consensual personal relationship."
The New York Times first reported about the lawsuit.
Messages were left seeking comment from the Patriots and the NFL.
Brown was released by the Raiders last week after clashing with the team throughout training camp. He agreed to a contract with the Patriots on Saturday, but didn't play in the Super Bowl champions' season-opening win against the Steelers on Sunday night.
Watch it: Odell Beckham Jr.'s taking a stand against the NFL on his lavish wrist wear.
Beckham said that he intends to keep wearing his $190,000 Richard Mille watch that he had on during Sunday's season opener against the Titans. The showy wide receiver believes the league has made an issue out of his jewelry only because it's him.
A league spokesman had said there's no rule prohibiting players from wearing jewelry. However there is a policy "prohibiting hard objects."
Jets get WR Thomas: The Jets acquired wide receiver Demaryius Thomas from the Patriots for a 2021 sixth-round draft pick, according to reports.
Thomas, 31, a four-time Pro Bowler, played for Jets coach Adam Gase from 2010-14 when Gase was wide receivers coach and then offense coordinator with the Broncos.
Also, the Jets waived Kaare Vedvik two days after he missed an extra point and 45-yard field goal in a one-point loss to the Bills and signed Sam Ficken as his replacement.
And defensive tackle Nathan Shepherd was suspended six games by the league for violating its performance-enhancing drug policy.
Extra points: The Texans signed C Nick Martin to a three-year, $33 million extension through the 2022 season. ... The Buccaneers signed S Andrew Adams. Terms of the deal weren't available.

Texto completo: A deliveryman for a renowned New York bakery allegedly stole 1,020 gourmet cakes worth nearly $90,000, local media reported.
Over the course of several months, David Lliviganay, 32, stole the cakes from Lady M Confections' warehouse in Long Island City, the New York Post and New York Times say a lawsuit alleges.
Lady M is known for its unique cakes made of stacks of crepes that have garnered fame from celebrities and thousands of followers on Instagram.
According to the newspapers, the cakes sell for up to $90 apiece, and Lliviganay was caught on camera dozens of times from last November to February nabbing the valuable pastries.
In January alone, he allegedly stole 357 cakes worth $31,238, the lawsuit says per the Post. The suit also alleges Lliviganay sold the cakes to other vendors.

The man was allegedly caught on camera with the cakes in hand as he exited the bakery's warehouse freezer. They also found that Lliviganay's phone was logged into the company's WiFi at the warehouse at the time of the crimes, the Times and Post reported.
Lliviganay allegedly told the bakery on Valentine's Day he was going on vacation but never came back. He was later fired, per the newspapers.
Lliviganay was arrested on theft charges and pleaded guilty in July, the Times reported. The company is now seeking full repayment for the cakes.
He nor a lawyer responded to the paper's request for comment. His sister Daisy told the Post, "they just made something up and charged him. "
Lady M founder Ken Romaniszyn didn't comment to the outlets on the pending lawsuit.
"We put our customers first in all matters, and are dedicated to the quality of our cakes and service," he said in a statement. "We also enforce company standards, which include honesty and integrity. "

Hollywood offers take on DuPont's role in leak

Texto completo: Martin Scorsese's new $125 million, 31/2-hour mob movie "The Irishman" won't be the only major feature film with Delaware ties getting a release this November.
"Dark Waters" starring Mark Ruffalo and Anne Hathaway will arrive in theaters Nov. 22, telling the tale of an attorney who fought DuPont and Chemours over a toxic chemical leak in West Virginia.
The film will receive an award-season push, with filmmakers and producers hoping for Oscar attention when nominees are announced for the Academy Awards on Jan. 13.
DuPont and Chemours paid $671 million to settle more than 3,500 lawsuits that claimed they were to blame for the leak of perfluorooctanoic acid, also known as PFOA or C-8, from a plant in Parkersburg. Both companies denied wrongdoing.
The film, directed by Todd Haynes ("Far From Heaven," "Carol," "I'm Not There"), follows Ruffalo, who plays Cincinnati attorney Rob Bilott. Bilott spent two decades building a case against the chemical giant. Hathaway plays Bilott's wife, Sarah, in the film.
She is joined in the cast by Bill Pullman and fellow Academy Award-winner Tim Robbins. Brandywine Hundred-based actor Lyman Chen ("The Departed," "Sharknado 2," "The Comedian") is also listed as an actor in the film.
The "Dark Waters" screenplay is based on the Jan. 6, 2016, New York Times Magazine article by Nathaniel Rich, which tracked Bilott's fight, titled "The lawyer who became DuPont's worst nightmare."
"Rob Bilott was a corporate defense attorney for eight years. Then he took on an environmental suit that would upend his entire career — and expose a brazen, decades-long history of chemical pollution," the article teased.
Since the settlement, Bilott himself has put pen to paper, writing "Exposure: Poisoned Water, Corporate Greed, and One Lawyer's Twenty-Year Battle Against DuPont" (Atria Books, $28). The 400-page book will publish Oct. 8, timed to coincide with the publicity push behind "Dark Waters."
DuPont's 2017 settlement in connection with the case came six months ahead of its $130 billion merger with Dow Chemical.
PFOA had been used in the production of Teflon, which was once one of DuPont's most profitable products. It had been connected to kidney and testicular cancers, along with thyroid disease and hypertension.
At the time of the settlement, Bilott, a partner at Taft Stettinius & Hollister, said, "This is a tremendous, positive step toward resolving this litigation in a way that provides compensation for our clients without the need for additional, lengthy and expensive trials."
The release of "Dark Waters" will come nearly two months after Netflix's "The Irishman" makes its Sept. 27 debut at the New York Film Festival, based on the book "I Heard You Paint Houses" (Steerforth Press, $15.95) by former Delaware chief deputy attorney general Charles Brandt.
In the book, Brandt writes about a deathbed confession by former Wilmington Teamsters Local 326 president Frank Sheeran, who told Brandt that he was the one who killed union leader Jimmy Hoffa.
Hoffa has been missing since 1975. His body was never found.
Following its festival debut in New York, "The Irishman" will receive a limited theatrical release beginning Nov. 1 before landing on the streaming service on Nov. 27, the day before Thanksgiving.
It was reported last month that "The Irishman" will not be shown at major multiplex chains such as AMC, Regal and Cinemark due to the limited run. The film is expected to be shown in independent theaters and movie houses owned by smaller chains.
The Delaware theaters slated to screen "The Irishman" have not yet been revealed.

Brown Sidelines Official Tied to Epstein's M.I.T. Media Lab Gifts

Texto completo: A former fund-raising official at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who helped secure donations coordinated by the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein for a prominent program there has been placed on administrative leave by Brown University, where he now works.
The fund-raising official, Peter Cohen, has stepped aside from his role as director of development for computer science and data initiatives amid a "review of available information regarding Mr. Cohen in the context of Brown University policies, core values and the university's commitment to treat employees fairly," said Brian Clark, a Brown spokesman.
"We are aware of the content of recent news reports about Mr. Cohen's work at M.I.T.'s Media Lab, which received funds from Jeffrey Epstein," Mr. Clark said. He added that the inquiry "does not constitute any adverse determination" and that it was premature to discuss possible outcomes. Brown never received money from Mr. Epstein, Mr. Clark said.
Mr. Cohen, who joined Brown in 2018, could not immediately be reached for comment. The Providence Journal reported on Brown's decision to place him on leave on Sunday.
Brown's move followed Joichi Ito's resignation on Saturday as director of M.I.T.'s influential Media Lab. Mr. Ito quit after The New Yorker published emails detailing how university officials worked with Mr. Epstein, a convicted sex offender, to secure gifts from wealthy donors and then tried to hide those efforts. The emails suggested that Mr. Cohen was deeply involved in that work.
In an email in October 2014 -- six years after Mr. Epstein had pleaded guilty to a sex charge involving a minor in Florida -- Mr. Ito wrote that a $ 2 million gift from Bill Gates had been "directed by Jeffrey Epstein."
In a subsequent email, Mr. Cohen wrote, "For gift recording purposes, we will not be mentioning Jeffrey's name as the impetus for this gift." (A spokesman for Mr. Gates, a co-founder of Microsoft, has denied that Mr. Epstein "directed any programmatic or personal grant making" on his behalf.)
The emails were shared with The New Yorker by Signe Swenson, who worked under Mr. Cohen at the Media Lab. Ms. Swenson also provided the emails to The New York Times. In an interview with The Times, she said she had learned of Mr. Epstein's ties to the program during a job interview in March 2014. She said that she had told Mr. Cohen that M.I.T. listed Mr. Epstein as "disqualified" as a donor, and that Mr. Cohen had said Mr. Ito had a relationship with the financier.
On Monday, M.I.T.'s president, L. Rafael Reif, told students and faculty in an email that the university had selected the law firm that would conduct an independent review of Mr. Epstein's donations. Mr. Reif urged anyone who had information to contact the firm, Goodwin Procter, for the investigation, which he said could take a month.
Several top-tier universities have been caught in the fallout over Mr. Epstein's philanthropy.
Mr. Epstein, who killed himself in a Manhattan jail cell last month while being held on federal sex-trafficking charges, also made a sizable donation to Harvard University. Mr. Epstein never earned a college degree, but nonetheless cast himself as a "Harvard man." Harvard has said it has no plans to give back the $ 6.5 million it received from Mr. Epstein in 2003.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: The lawyer who represented Theodore Kaczynski, more commonly known as the “Unabomber," will be leading the defense of the man who is accused of masterminding the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
torture
Gary Sowards, 69, has taken over Khalid Shaikh Mohammed's defense from David Nevin, 70, who has lead Mohammed's defense since 2008, according to the New York Times. The trial is set to start on Jan. 11, 2021.
Nevin said Mohammed did not ask for his lead counsel to change, but since he is based in Idaho, it is hard to direct the legal team.
Mohammed, 54, along with four other men, is accused of directing, training, or helping with travel and finances for the 19 hijackers who flew planes into the Wold Trade Center and the Pentagon. A fourth was headed for Washington, D.C., but crashed in Pennsylvania.
With almost 3,000 people killed in the attacks, all five are facing the death penalty.
From 1978 to 1996, Kaczynski, 77, mailed or dropped off homemade bombs to seemingly random targets. During his attacks, three Americans were killed and 24 were wounded. The FBI tracked Kaczynski down and arrested him at a remote cabin in Montana. Since pleading guilty in 1998, he has been in an isolated cell at a supermax prison in Colorado.

Texto completo: I went camping the other day, only to find out — after I’d returned home — that a black bear and her cub were spotted in the campground. We were lucky not to have crossed paths, but believe it or not, that would not have been my first close encounter with a black bear.
This brings us to a segment I like to call “That one time my mom thought I was mauled by a bear, and why I will owe her for the rest of my life.”
It all started when I was in Steamboat Springs, Colo., for a writing retreat. The authors and I were out to dinner in a place that resembled a Park City resort, but I had stepped out of the restaurant and onto the pavilion to take a call from my mom.
The sun had just set, so it was, in the very literal sense of the word, dusk.
My mom and I were discussing plans for a family trip to Washington, when something caught my eye on the mountain.
It was bigger than a dog, but smaller than a megalodon (which is an extinct shark that had an average size of 10.5 meters, #themoreyouknow) and it was black and hairy and running straight down the north face of the mountain and heading right toward me.
I commented to my mom.
“Something’s coming toward me.”
Her: “What’s coming toward you?”
Me: “It’s black... and it’s bigger than a dog.”
Her: “But is it bigger than a megalodon?”
(Kidding.)
Her: “Are you OK? What is it?”
Me (finally realizing what it was): “It’s a black bear. A black bear. A black bear! Heading straight for me!”
Her: “Can you run away?”
But there was nowhere to run. The restaurant was too far away. There was no other shelter.
I thought fast to my bear attack training (which consisted of a short Google search when I was doing background for a scene in my latest book).
The top three internet tips were:
1. Try to appear larger than you are.
2. Try to hold perfectly still.
3. Try not to act like food (i.e., don’t run).
In light of these tips, I put my arms out and acted really really big. I also hung up on my mom, so I could hold perfectly still. And I meditated on what I would look like if I didn’t look like a Big Mac.
Thankfully, the bear ran right past me (I felt the breeze of his hair) and dove into a large blue dumpster at the back of the parking lot. Apparently, he thought that the dumpster held more appeal than I did. (Settle down, ex-boyfriends. Nobody wants to hear how you already suspected as much.)
At that point, several of the restaurant patrons, having seen the whole thing happen, came pouring out and the next few minutes were spent getting pictures of the bear in the dumpster.
Do you want to know how long a few minutes can seem? Ask my mom, who spent that time thinking I’d been attacked by a black bear.
When I finally called her back, I was laughing.
“You’ll never guess the craziest thing that just happened,” I said. “The bear ran straight past me!”
I heard a heavy sigh of relief, and then the click of my phone letting me know that my mom had hung up on me.
Apparently she thought that getting pictures of a bear should be my second priority, just under letting her know I wasn’t dead.
And if you don’t believe me about the bear, here’s a grainy picture. It’s grainy, because fear.

Texto completo: An 82-year-old Florida man was arrested on suspicion of burglarizing luxury apartments in New York City in what may have been a decade-long crime spree, according to reports.
Samuel Sabatino would drive to the city from his home in Miami, paying cash tolls along the way to avoid detection, police told NBC 4. Authorities said he would use cash to stay at a motel in New Jersey and then choose a building to target.
He would sneak past doormen, pick apartment locks and steal cash and jewels before making his getaway, police said. The suspect stole more than $100,000 in three robberies so far this year, but it's believed he has stolen about $400,000 worth of items over the past five years, the station reported, citing New York Assistant District Attorney Rachel Polisner's comments at Sabatino's arraignment.
Dubbed the "Holiday Bandit" because he often broke into buildings during holidays, Sabatino was finally caught when a doorman noticed him trying to enter a building during Labor Day weekend, the New York Times reported. The doorman refused him entry and called police.
Sabatino was taken into custody and charged with 11 counts of burglary, according to the Times.
“I’m relieved because this was becoming a yearly occurrence, because we could expect to get hit, on Memorial Day, Fourth of July and Labor Day weekend every summer,” NYPD Lt. Kevin Blake told the newspaper. “And it was becoming a bit frustrating that we couldn’t catch the guy. I mean he’s 82 years old, but he was elusive to say the least. ”
Blake told the Times that Sabatino has a criminal history stretching to the late 1960s and may have been involved in at least 12 burglaries since around 2014. New York court records show that Sabatino was arrested on suspicion of attempted burglary in 1977 and burglary in 1994.
Polisner said the investigation took so long because Sabatino had been living under the alias James Clement since he disappeared in 2001 after allegedly skipping bail following a previous burglary arrest.
His bail in the current case was set at $250,000. If convicted, he may be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison.

MIT lab big quits over connection to Epstein

Texto completo: The head of a prestigious Massachusetts Institution of Technology research lab quit Saturday amid outrage over his financial ties to sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein.
Joichi Ito (photo), director of the Media Lab at the Cambridge school, exited after reports that officials tried to hide ties to Epstein, the sex offender who killed himself last month awaiting federal prosecution for sex trafficking.
"After giving the matter a great deal of thought over the past several days and weeks, I think that it is best that I resign as director of the Media Lab and as a professor and employee of the Institute, effective immediately," read an email from Ito to MIT Provost Martin Schmidt. Ito provided The New York Times with a copy of the email.
Ito's departure came only days after he announced plans to stay in his position while overseeing "restorative healing" as word of his deep fund-raising relationship with Epstein became public. But things changed Friday, when The New Yorker reported Epstein had made $7.5 million in donations to the lab.
In addition, the multimillionaire accused of targeting girls for his perverse pleasure appeared on the MIT campus with a pair of young Eastern European models in the summer of 2015, according to the magazine. The women were described as his "assistants," making other lab workers even more uncomfortable about his ties to MIT.
In an email to co-workers, Mr. Ito offered an apology: "While this chapter is truly difficult, I am confident the lab will persevere."
The New Yorker said gifts from Epstein were hidden by officials despite his being "disqualified" as an MIT donor. Some were accepted anonymously; others were funneled through sham donors.
MIT President L. Rafael Lief wrote a letter to the university community acknowledging the allegations in the latest story were "deeply disturbing." The university plans to hire a prominent law firm to investigate the ties between Ito and Epstein.

Trump and Biden have the same message

Texto completo: During a recent speech in New Hampshire, President Trump unveiled a new campaign line: "Whether you love me or hate me, you have got to vote for me."
Citing the strong economy, Trump told voters that if he loses, "your 401(k), everything is going to be down the tubes," so "you have no choice!"
To underscore the point, when he finished speaking the music that came on was the Rolling Stones singing, "You can't always get what you want. But if you try sometimes, well, you might find, you get what you need."
Not far away, in Nashua, the Biden campaign rolled out the very same message about its candidate. "I know that not all of you are committed to my husband, and I respect that," Jill Biden told Democratic primary voters. "Your candidate might be better on, I don't know, health care, than Joe is. But you've got to look at who's going to win this election. And maybe you have to swallow a little bit and say, 'Okay, I personally like so and so better,' but your bottom line has to be that we have to beat Trump."
To put it another way: "Whether you love Joe or hate him, you have got to vote for him."
Trump and Biden are both running on the same message, but with one crucial difference: Trump is directing his at independent swing voters; Biden is directing that message at his base.
The New York Times reports that, despite his commanding lead in the polls, Biden faces a problem of low enthusiasm. While Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., "have followings rooted in zealous support for their ideas," Biden's support is rooted in a belief that he is the candidate best positioned to beat Trump.
Patrick Murray, director of Monmouth University's Polling Institute, told the paper that while spending time recently in Iowa "I did not meet one Biden voter who was in any way, shape or form excited about voting for Biden. They feel that they have to vote for Joe Biden as the centrist candidate, to keep somebody from the left who they feel is unelectable from getting the nomination."
The danger of running on electability is that all it takes is one catastrophic gaffe or debate stumble for Biden's support to collapse. And even if Biden manages to secure the Democratic nomination, running a campaign built exclusively on ousting the sitting president, rather than enthusiasm for your own ideas, is not a winning strategy. Just ask President Mitt Romney.
Trump, by contrast, has his base wrapped up and energized. The president consistently enjoys nearly 90% support among Republicans (in contrast with Barack Obama, who had just 75% support among Democrats at this stage in 2011, according to Gallup). For Trump, the risk of this strategy is not with his base, but with the swing voters who put him over the top in 2016.
According to Axios, in 2016 "20% of Trump's voters told exit pollsters they didn't like him." These reluctant Trump voters put Trump in the White House and are critical to his keeping it in 2020. Like many Americans, they are exhausted by the chaos of the Trump presidency. Biden is targeting his message directly at these voters, echoing George W. Bush's 2000 campaign pledge to restore "honor and dignity" to the Oval Office in the wake of the tumultuous Clinton presidency.
Yet, despite their exhaustion with Trump, many of these voters approve of his economic performance in office. Despite recent market turbulence, the U.S. economy remains strong. On Trump's watch, unemployment has reached a five-decade low, and our biggest economic problem is that we have 1.6 million more job openings than we have unemployed workers to fill them. And a decade after the Great Recession, wages are finally rising, with those at the bottom of the economic ladder benefiting the most.
The problem is that Trump has made virtually no effort to win over these reluctant Trump voters again, much less expand his base by appealing to Americans who did not vote for him but are benefiting from his policies. He is betting that presidents seeking reelection in a full-employment economy don't tend to lose.
Biden and Trump are giving voters an ultimatum rather than inspiration. They both may find that running on your unlikability is a risky strategy.

And in this follow-up collection to 2016's “The Crown Ain't Worth Much," he turns his keen critical eye on love, grief, family, and forgiveness. Out this week.
“The Problem of the Many" (Wave Poetry)
The entire fall harvest at Wave is worth digging into, but if Donnelly's singular surveys of contemporary culture aren't on your radar yet, let his third collection make a belated introduction. His is a thrilling, all-encompassing, adventurous poetry where history (Prometheus and Alexander the Great) and modernity (protein shakes and breakfast flakes) seem to constantly be sizing each other up.

The anticipated debut collection from this Twin Cities poet (and co-founder of poetic activist group Poetry Asylum) centers on the everyday lives of immigrants through the eyes of a Korean girl growing up in her parents' NYC bodega in the early '90s.

“The Dolphin: Two Versions, 1972–1973," Robert Lowell, edited by Saskia Hamilton (Farrar, Straus and Giroux)
A Robert Lowell poem worth reading is one worth re-reading, and this return to the 1974 Pulitzer winning collection feels long overdue.

Texto completo: The number of deaths from a vaping-related illness has risen to five.
The deaths were reported in Indiana, Minnesota, Los Angeles, Oregon, and Illinois, according to the New York Times.
Public health officials have warned about a lung illness that appears to be linked to vaping nicotine and marijuana after more than 200 people have become sick. Officials have cautioned about using e-cigarettes while the Centers for Disease Control investigates the illness.
At least 450 more cases in 33 states are under investigation for symptoms that include vomiting, fever, shortness of breath, and chest pain.
CDC officials questioned whether some “chemical” is related to the illness. One study found a chemical derived from vitamin E in samples that were tested. Vitamin E is generally harmless when consumed as a vitamin or used on the skin but could be harmful when inhaled.
"Identifying any compounds present in the samples will be one piece of the puzzle but won't necessarily answer questions about causality, which makes our ongoing work critical," Dr. Ned Sharpless, acting administrator for the Food and Drug Administration, said in a statement.
Photo Caption:A government study released in June said teen vaping seemed to hold steady in 2017 and cigarette smoking continued to decline — a promising sign of progress against a wide range of nicotine and tobacco products.

Report: Healey balked at proposed Pharma settlement

Texto completo: Talks between state attorneys general and Purdue Pharma over a possible $12 billion settlement to resolve thousands of lawsuits brought against the opioid manufacturer have stalled, in part because Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey is not on board, according to a national media report this week.
Reuters reported that OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma is preparing to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy by the end of September unless it is able to reach a settlement with the states and municipalities suing it for its role in the nationwide opioid abuse and overdose epidemic. Word of the talks involving various state attorneys general, Purdue Pharma, and its owners, the Sackler family, was reported throughout the media last week.
NBC News reported that Purdue and the Sacklers had proposed a settlement of $10 billion to $12 billion to resolve the more than 2,000 suits against the company and family members. But Reuters reported Tuesday that “strong opposition from some attorneys general such as those in Massachusetts and New York emerged last week after confidential discussions on Purdue's settlement talks became public in media reports."
“Their main sticking point is how much Purdue's controlling Sackler family will pay," Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the negotiations.
Healey's office declined to address the Reuters report directly.
“Our fight against Purdue and the Sacklers is about exposing the facts, making them pay for the harm they caused, and shutting them down for good. The people who have been hurt by Purdue's misconduct have spoken, loud and clear, about how important it is to have real accountability," Healey said in a statement. “Our lawsuit exposed the roots of this crisis and we will continue to push for the full truth to be made public and to secure the justice these families deserve."
In June 2018, Healey filed the first state lawsuit against individual members of the Sackler family as well as Purdue Pharma, alleging that they “engaged in a deadly, deceptive scheme to sell opioids in Massachusetts" and profited from the drug epidemic they helped create.
Healey's complaint alleges that Purdue “created the epidemic and profited from it through a web of illegal deceit" by misleading doctors and patients to get more people on their drugs, at “higher and more dangerous doses" and for longer periods of time, as well as by deploying falsehoods to keep patients away from “safer alternatives."
A total of 671 Massachusetts residents who filled prescriptions for Purdue opioids since 2009 later died of an opioid overdose, according to the suit. According to Healey's office, Purdue sent sales representatives to Massachusetts doctors, offices, clinics, and hospitals more than 150,000 times since 2008.
Under the settlement framework described last week to NBC News and later to the New York Times, the Connecticut-based Purdue Pharma would file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and restructure itself as a “public beneficiary trust." Future profits from the company would flow to the plaintiffs, namely state and local governments that have sued Purdue.
The Sackler family would cede control of the company and contribute $3 billion to the settlement fund over seven years and would add another $1.5 billion by selling another Sackler-owned business. Reuters reported that “several state attorneys general contend the Sacklers' proposed settlement contribution is too low" and that the attorneys general would rather that the Sacklers guarantee $4.5 billion.
Purdue Pharma said last week that it is “prepared to defend itself vigorously in the opioid litigation" but is discussing a settlement because it “sees little good coming from years of wasteful litigation and appeals" and “the people and communities affected by the opioid crisis need help now."
“Purdue believes a constructive global resolution is the best path forward, and the company is actively working with the state attorneys general and other plaintiffs to achieve this outcome," the company said in a statement.
Last week, a judge in Oklahoma ruled that Johnson & Johnson had to pay the state $572 million. In the order, the judge declared that the company had run “false, misleading, and dangerous marketing campaigns" that “caused exponentially increasing rates of addiction, overdose deaths."
A federal judge in Cleveland is overseeing the more than 2,000 lawsuits filed against the Sacklers and Purdue. Reuters reported that the judge expected plaintiffs to update him on settlement progress this week and that he “wants 35 state attorneys general on board with a deal, a threshold that has not yet been reached."

Novel is part of 21-year journey

Texto completo: The floppy disk where Petina Gappah saved early drafts of her historical-fiction novel "Out of Darkness, Shining Light" now serves as a lucky charm, 21 years after she began.
It took that long because the story she wanted to tell was a complex one: that of the arduous, nine-month journey in 1873 of 69 workers as they transported the body of explorer David Livingstone from the interior of Africa to the coast of Zanzibar, where he was carried to Britain for burial. It took so much research that Gappah, 48, finished and published three other books over the time she worked on it, while navigating a career as an international trade lawyer in Geneva.
She scoured book fairs and museums, acquiring a first edition of Henry Stanley's "How I Found Livingstone," as well as other "Livingstonia" related to the man, who died in what is now Zambia as he searched for the source of the Nile. "I remember at one time spending something like $4,000 for a huge collection of stuff," Gappah said. "I had to not eat lunch for three months."
Yet she couldn't shake her interest in his legacy. "Livingstone is the only missionary who still has monuments to his name in almost every African country he traversed," she said. "That says something extraordinary, I think, about his character."
Inspired by William Faulkner's "As I Lay Dying," Gappah initially wrote her novel through the shifting perspectives of 15 characters, but she later pared it down to two: Halima, a cook who isn't afraid to speak her mind ("I do not know what I have ever done that I should be surrounded by ugly men," she says at one point), and Jacob Wain-wright, a former slave who received a formal education and became a translator.
"Middlemarch," another of Gappah's favorite books, also informed her approach. "What George Eliot does is center these huge reforms happening in England on individuals in a tiny little town," she said. "That was a model that I thought, wow, that is something I could use in my own writing."
With "Shining Light," which Scribner is publishing in the United States on Sept. 10, she wanted to shed light on individuals like Halima and Jacob, who might not otherwise receive much attention, as well as on the East African slave trade that many of them witnessed firsthand.
"I want people to know that they were more than just adult companions," Gappah said. "They were people with their own wishes, own desires and own motives."
'Expectations that were put on me'
Gappah first read about Livingstone as a 10-year-old, when she was one of a handful of Black students at the predominantly white Alfred Beit School in Harare. She struggled to regain her native language of Shona when she went on to St. Dominic's Chishawasha, a girls boarding school.
After earning a law degree at the University of Zimbabwe, she continued her studies at Graz University in Austria and the University of Cambridge in Britain, experiences she called "dislocating" because of her race and the challenges of picking up new languages (she speaks four: Shona, English, French and German). She later moved to Geneva and worked at the World Trade Organization for 17 years, before returning to Harare, where she now lives.
Although she was writing all that time, Gappah felt obligated to pursue what her family considered a "professional" career in law, finance or medicine. "It was particularly important in my family because I was the very first ever descendant of all my ancestors to go to university. There were expectations that were put on me," she said, and she also had four younger siblings for whom she wanted to set an example.
In 2007, she submitted a short story to the online writers group Zoetrope Virtual Studio, where it attracted the interest of the publisher of the literary journal Per Contra. She still has the check, never cashed, that she received as payment.
"It was a symbol of something amazing, that not only could I write something that people liked, but I could actually get paid for it," Gappah said. "For me that was the beginning."
'Stories that make you cry and laugh'
Gappah has at times felt dissatisfied with her writing, finding both inspiration and frustration in literary masterpieces. "I would write something, and then I would think it's not good enough. Then I would read 'Song of Solomon' by Toni Morrison or 'Middlemarch,'" she said, "and I would think, I am never going to be George Eliot, so why bother? Then I would give up."
Other words by Morrison helped feinvigorate her. In a Paris Review interview, Morrison spoke about the importance of revision, which motivated Gappah to keep going. She landed a two-book deal with Faber & Faber in 2008, publishing a short-story collection, "An Elegy for Easterly," followed by a novel, "The Book of Memory," with the London-based publishing house. A second collection, "Rotten Row," came out in 2017.
"Elegy for Easterly" won the Guardian's 2009 First Book Award and was shortlisted for the Orwell Prize and the Frank O'Connor International Short Story Award. Nigerian writer Chika Unigwe calls Gappah "a master of the tragicomedy," adding: "Not many writers are able to pull off stories that make you cry and laugh at the same time."
The New Yorker's fiction editor Deborah Treisman, who edited Gappah's "A Short History of Zaka the Zulu" for the magazine in 2016, said she remembers being "particularly impressed, in that story, with the way that she melded both the specifics of her characters and the sociopolitical context - Zimbabwe's cultural and economic divisions."
Zimbabwe, the setting for her many of her stories, will also be in focus in Gappah's next books, which, like "Shining Light," she expects to be historical fiction. "I thought, let me write the story of the Black people of Zimbabwe," she said, "the others who are not being talked about."

Texto completo: TV is about to become bigger this fall. A whole lot bigger.
In addition to the usual crop of new shows from broadcast networks, cable channels and streaming services, two new players will jump into the game in fall 2019: Apple TV+ and Disney+.
Disney will unveil "The Mandalorian," the first live-action TV show in the "Star Wars" franchise, with the service's Nov. 12 launch. Apple, which has not yet announced a debut date, is betting on star power, including Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell in drama "The Morning Show."
And some old favorites will return, including the long-awaited third season of Netflix's "The Crown" ( Nov. 17), with Oscar-winner Olivia Colman stepping in the role of Queen Elizabeth II. Series such as ABC's long-running family sitcom "Modern Family" (Sept. 25) are also coming back for one last season.
To help you sort through this fall's avalanche of television, we chose the 10 most exciting new series.
'Undone' Amazon Prime (Sept. 13)
"BoJack Horseman" creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg joins forces with Kate Purdy ("Cougar Town") for this adult animated series that embraces darkness. "Undone" is a magical realist drama about Alma (Rose Salazar), a directionless woman in her late 20s who survives a terrible car accident and discovers she has an ability to move through time and communicate with her dead father. The series touches on themes of family history and self-destruction, and uses its animation to beautifully and render eerily realistic sketches of its talented cast, which includes Bob Odenkirk as Alma's father. The result is a series that deliberately lives in the uncanny valley, much like its protagonist.
'Country Music' PBS (Sept. 15, Sundays at 8 EDT/PDT; check local listings)
Because aKen Burns documentary is almost always a gripping, informative and gorgeously scored examination of American history, it's natural for the celebrated director to point his lens at country music, a uniquely American cultural phenomenon. The 18-hour, comprehensive look at the genre's rise genre is not just for diehard fans. It looks at the influences of African instruments and rhythm and blues, among others, includes interviews with dozens of artists and historians, and features an excellent soundtrack.
'Stumptown' ABC, Sept. 25 (Wednesdays at 10 EDT/PDT)
Cobie Smulders ("How I Met Your Mother") returns to TV with the butt-kicking moves she learned from her Marvel films ("The Avengers"). Except Dex, her damaged private investigator character on "Stumptown," drinks and gambles far more than S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Maria ever would. Based on a graphic novel, "Stumptown" which also stars Jake Johnson, follows Dex as she solves (and sometimes mildly commits) crimes and other cases in Portland, Oregon, while she takes care of her younger brother (Cole Sibus), who has Down syndrome, and tries not to gamble her way into poverty. The pilot episode deftly mixes action, drama and comedy, and Smulders remains the magnetic leading lady she was for nine years on "Mother."
'The Unicorn' CBS, Sept. 26 (Thursdays at 8:30 EDT/PDT)
This new comedy is not about mythical horse creatures, but rather Walton Goggins' Wade, a widower who's reluctantly re-entering the dating pool as a rare middle-aged "unicorn" because he's not divorced or a cheating husband, has his own loving family and is earnest. It's a great setup for great romantic comedy, and has a stellar cast, including Rob Corddry and Michaela Watkins, along with the adorable Goggins, who can make almost anything funny.
'The Politician' Netflix (Sept. 27)
Prolific creator Ryan Murphy's first Netflix series preserves his stylish flair. "The Politician" stars Ben Platt ("Pitch Perfect," "Dear Evan Hansen") as a pathologically driven high-school student who is convinced he will become president of the United States. The first step on his journey is president of his senior class, and he will do anything to win. Co-starring Gwyneth Paltrow as Platt's mother, "Politician" is more akin to early seasons of "Glee" than recent seasons of "American Horror Story;" "Politician" has just the right amount of surrealism and melodrama without going over the edge, at least in early episodes.
'Back to Life' Showtime, (Oct. 6, Sundays at 8:30 EDT/PDT)
Fans of dark British comedies "Fleabag" and "Catastrophe" will be drawn to this new series created by and starring Daisy Haggard ("Episodes"). The understated but affecting series follows Miri, a middle-aged woman who returns to her parents' house after 18 years in prison. "Life" is awkward, sweet, sad and witty, and wisely takes its time to unfurl Miri's past, initially withholding the reason she was sent to prison.
'Living With Yourself' Netflix (Oct. 18)
In this new comedy from "Daily Show" writer Timothy Greenberg, the great Paul Rudd stars as Miles, a depressed, struggling and unmotivated man who can't even seek fertility doctors. He seeks out an unconventional treatment for his malaise at a strip-mall spa, and receives much more than he bargained for. Without spoiling the first episode's major twist, let's just say the riotously smart series gives you a double dose of Rudd.
'Modern Love' Amazon (Oct. 18)
This effervescent romance, based on the New York Times column, is as sweet as apple pie without becoming sickly. "Love" is structured as an anthology series about love. That could mean a relationship between an overprotective doorman and an apartment resident, or someone with bipolar disorder worried about revealing it to their new flame. The joyful series stars Anne Hathaway, Tina Fey, John Slattery, Dev Patel and Cristin Millioti.
'High School Musical the Musical the Series' Disney+ (Nov. 12)
An extension of Disney Channel's "High School Musical" franchise, this mockumentary chronicles students' efforts to put on a production of the musical. The tongue-in-cheek approach offers enough new and old music to satisfy fans but creates modern new characters to anchor the stories. Aimed at teens (or nostalgic millennials) instead of Disney Channel's kid and tween audience, "High School" is self-aware and self-effacing. It does almost everything right that NBC's ill-fated "Rise" did wrong, and is genuinely funny. "The Mandalorian" (which was unavailable to preview) will get much of the attention when Disney+ launches, but don't write off this sitcom as just for kids.
'His Dark Materials' HBO (expected in November)
The world of Phillip Pullman's classic fantasy trilogy comes to life, in far more detail (and with better writing) than the failed 2007 film "The Golden Compass." With each planned season based on one of Pullman's novels, "Materials" (already renewed for a second) gives more depth to the story of Lyra (Dafne Keen), the bright young girl living in a world slightly different than our own (human souls live outside their bodies in animals called "daemons"). Co-starring Lin-Manuel Miranda, James McAvoy and Ruth Wilson, the steampunk-style fantasy world might satisfy HBO viewers who miss the high fantasy that "Game of Thrones" brought them for so long.

Texto completo: The summer of 1966 marked the beginning of Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution in China. Angry masses of youth foaming at the mouth from the radical brainwashing of Mao’s Little Red Book brought scores of teachers to the center of Peking University, blackened their faces, and forced them to wear dunces’ caps. Similar scenes reverberated across China as Mao escalated his rhetoric to violence. Those with counterrevolutionary ideas were purged, art that could be perceived to undermine Mao was destroyed, and those who performed or created it were sent to labor camps or killed. Academics either conformed to the tenets of Maoism or suffered persecution, sexual molestation, or death.
It all began, in part, because of a poster.
The Chinese understand that unfettered power relies on the complete control of the ideological and educational roots of the people. In 1965, Mao attempted to ban an opera he viewed as critical of him. Much to his frustration, he was stymied by Peng Zhen, the head of overseeing culture and the Five Man Group (the informal group tasked with exploring the possibility of cultural revolution).
At the May 1966 Politburo meeting, Peng was deposed and dismissed, and the Five Man Group was disbanded, freeing Mao to move against his remaining enemies in the Communist Party and initiate his own version of a cultural revolution.
On May 25, 1966, Nie Yuanzi, a party activist and philosophy administrator at Peking University, and six other party functionaries authored and put up a “big-character poster" (called a dazibao) on campus denouncing the university’s administration as furthering the aims of the bourgeoisie.
Mao seized on the message and ordered it to be read over the national broadcast and reprinted in the People’s Daily. In the coming weeks and months, Mao sought to purge dissent and purify the ideological foundation of China into his cult of personality. Leveraging Nie’s message into a broader call to rebellion, Mao used his Red Guard, a group of militant radicals mostly composed of students, to dismantle higher education and reshape art and literature to support his aims of control.
The 45-year-old Nie became a leading figure among the Red Guard, despite her being two decades older than most fanatics in the movement.
Yet, her 15 minutes were soon spent. “That poster brought me tremendous fame and prominence,” she told the Chinese website of the New York Times in 2016, “yet it also brought endless pain and torment for the rest of my life.” Nie soon became disillusioned with the cause and tried to quit her position in the Red Guards in August 1967. She was accused of disloyalty by Jiang Qing, Mao’s radical conspirator wife.
Nie was later detained and jailed, forced to work in labor camps until the Cultural Revolution ended in 1976. Under Deng Xiaoping, Nie was jailed again in 1983 as a counterrevolutionary and sentenced to 17 years in prison for the suffering she wrought on others during her time in the Red Guard. She was later released on medical parole.
While in her memoirs — published in Hong Kong in 2005 and reprinted again in 2017 — she acknowledges the role she played, she nevertheless maintained throughout her life that she was a pawn caught in the hands of a masterful propagandist. Others, however, tell a different story. Historian Andrew Walder has offered a persuasive case that Nie, a careerist apparatchik married to a party official 23 years her senior, was an active participant in the scheme to overthrow the university leadership. And in his best-selling memoir about his imprisonment at Peking University during the revolution, Ji Xianlin provided an eyewitness account of Nie’s cruelty.
Until her death on Aug. 28 at age 98, Nie was socially ostracized both for her part in sparking Mao’s purge and for recanting against a post-Mao Chinese state that still seeks to instill totalitarian-like control over its people. She lived humbly, relying on the charity of friends and family.
Yet Nie remained feisty, resolute to make China, typically mum on the period in their history, address and heal from the harsh and horrific acts of the Cultural Revolution.
Whether history perceives her as a useful fool or complicit revolutionary, the message she gave during a 2006 New York Times profile is an important one: “Democracy should be really promoted so that each person can express their opinions about state affairs and the work of others. Even if an opinion is not correct, it must be allowed, and allowed to be contradicted. Even today, posters should be allowed.”
It all began with a poster.

Getting a grip on the jellyfish

Texto completo: Researchers from Harvard University and Baruch College at CUNY say their new ­“ultragentle" gripper device, with its noodle-like fingers, can grab delicate ocean creatures that formerly would have been mangled as scientists pulled them out of the ocean to examine them.
But don't just take their word for it.
Ask the jellyfish at the New England Aquarium, where resarchers tested the device, pulling moon jellies, jelly blubbers, and spotted jellies, all about the size of a golf ball, from the water without causing them any stress.
The tool could come in handy studying deep sea creatures in their natural habitat, researchers said.
Jellyfish and squid that live a mile or two underwater are beyond the range of scuba-diving scientists, who must rely on submarines to explore the pitch-dark depths. Once in a while, detritus samplers and other collection tools attached to submersibles can capture the diaphanous animals. But the creatures are at risk of getting stuck in the sampler or destroyed.
The sampling tools available to marine biologists were largely developed for the oil and gas industry and are more suited to grabbing rocks or heavy equipment than sea creatures, researchers said.
The new tool was developed by researchers at Harvard's Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering and John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) and Baruch College at CUNY. The research is detailed in a paper published last week in Science Robotics.
“Our ultragentle gripper is a clear improvement over existing deep-sea sampling devices for jellies and other soft-bodied creatures that are otherwise nearly impossible to collect intact," first author Nina Sinatra, a former graduate student at the Wyss Institute who is now a mechanical and materials engineer at Google, said in a statement from the university.
“This technology can also be extended to improve underwater analysis techniques and allow extensive study of the ecological and ­genetic features of marine organisms without taking them out of the water," she said. “Overall, our ultragentle gripper demonstrates an improvement in gentle sample collection compared with existing deep-sea sampling devices."
David Gruber, a marine biologist at CUNY, told The New York Times, “I always felt that it was a little strange for me as a marine biologist to have to kill the animals that I love and study."
The gripper has six fingers. Each finger is composed of thin strips of silicone with a hollow channel inside. The inside edges of the fingers have a stiffer nanofiber coating that controls how they curve. They are attached to a 3D-printed rectangular palm in such a way that they can be removed individually and replaced if they start to become arthritic.
A switch at the back of the gripper fills the channels inside the silicone fingers with water, forcing them to curl shut in the direction of the nanofiber coating. This helps maintain an ultragentle grip; the fingers exert less than one-10th of the pressure that a human eyelid exerts on the eye.
Current soft marine grippers exert many times more force, researchers said.
Gruber and Wyss founding core faculty member Rob Wood are collaborating on innovations in the use of soft robotics for underwater sampling.
“Soft robotics is an ideal solution to long-standing problems like this one across a wide variety of fields, because it combines the programmability and robustness of traditional robots with unprecedented gentleness thanks to the flexible materials used," Wood said in a statement.
Researchers said they first tried the gripper out on an artificial silcone jellyfish in a tank of water. In the New England Aquarium test on real jellyfish, the animals, which are 95 percent water, were unable to break free until the gripper was depressurized.
The team is continuing to refine the gripper's design and aims to look more deeply into the jellyfishes' physiological response to being grabbed, to more definitely prove that the animals are not being stressed, researchers said.

The 1619 prediction

Texto completo: Headnote Check It Out
The New York Times Magazine released a special issue called "The 1619 Project" to commemorate the 400-year anniversary of the beginning of American slavery. It contains essays, photo essays, poems, and fiction written by Black academics, journalists, and literary figures in consultation with historians.
The material examines the historical and modern impact of slavery over the 400-year span. It updates notions expressed by Black thinkers throughout the 20th century that Black Americans forced America to live up to its founding principles and the effects of slavery linger in modernity. There's nothing new to this examination of history and there shouldn't be, it's an anniversary, but there is a point of contention.
The New York Times Magazine said it aims to reframe the country's history by understanding 1619 as America's true founding.
But that's not a fact.
This invites critics to attack their agenda and dismiss the 400-year anniversary.
One critic responded, "Jamestown was founded by a British company over a decade before the introduction of slaves; its purpose was to search for gold and establish trade to enrich its owners, not give freedom to anyone. America was born in 1776 when we declared our independence to free the American people, including Blacks, from British rule."
A defender of the project replied conservatives feel threatened because "it challenges the totalism on which their entire world view has been constructed. It is their mindset, which monopolizes imagination and stifles alternatives, that lays the groundwork for authoritarianism."
But this was predicted.
In 2017 Michael Guasco, chair of the history department at Davidson College, wrote an essay called, "The Fallacy of 1619: Rethinking the history of Africans in Early America." The essay was published on Black Perspectives, an award-winning blog of the African American Intellectual History Society, whose expressed aim is to produce and disseminate cutting-edge research and discuss the many aspects of Black intellectual history.
Guasco stated: 1619 is not the best place to begin the history of African people in America. It assumes the arrival at Jamestown was an exceptional historical moment. 1619 was not the first time Africans made their mark on the land that became the United States. In 1526, enslaved Africans were part of a Spanish expedition to establish an outpost in present-day South Carolina. The Africans launched a rebellion and destroyed the settlement liberating themselves. (In 1565 when Pedro Menendez founded St. Augustine, Fla.) he had Black members of his crew and he noted his arrival was preceded by free Africans in the French settlement a few miles north at Fort Caroline. This is half a century before Jamestown.) The elevation of 1619 has the unintended consequence of cementing in our minds that the English settlers were already home but they were not. Elevating 1619 silently condones the notion that this place is, and always has been, White, Christian, and European, and establishes conditions for people of African descent to remain strangers forever. As we near the 400th anniversary of 1619 and new works appear that are timed to remember the "firstness" of a few Africans at Jamestown, it is important to remember that historical framing shapes historical meaning. How we characterize the past has consequences, the biggest consequence is essentializing notions of "us" and "them."
Now, that's a premise worthy of debate during the 400-year anniversary of Africans arriving at Jamestown, not whether 1619 was America's true founding.

Texto completo: NUEVA YORK.- Los crímenes de odio mantienen una tendencia sostenida de ascenso en la ciudad de Nueva York, de acuerdo al reporte mensual presentado este miércoles por el Departamento de Policía (NYPD) . En lo que va del año, con corte al primero de septiembre, se registraron 290 delitos de este tipo, comparados con los 205, es decir 85 casos más a la misma altura del 2018, lo que representan un incremento del 41 por ciento.
En general, los llamados crímenes de odio, son agresiones motivadas por la raza, religión o condición sexual de los individuos afectados. En el primer segmento -o por raza- los ataques anti judíos en toda la ciudad aumentaron particularmente los últimos 3 meses del verano, en comparación con el mismo período en 2018, según muestran las estadísticas del NYPD. Mientras todas las categorías de delitos de odio en los cinco condados aumentaron un 67 por ciento, incluyendo los que tienen como blanco las agresiones contra la comunidad LGBT, los afroamericanos y los hispanos.
En agosto, fueron reportados 152 ataques antisemitas, 59 casos más que en el mismo mes del año pasado, lo que representa un aumento del 63 por ciento. El número de arrestos que hizo el NYPD por estas agresiones subió de 35 a 42, o un incremento del 25 por ciento.
En cuanto a los ataques contra afroamericanos, en agosto se reportaron 29 casos, 3 más que el mismo mes del año pasado, un incremento del 12 por ciento, mientras que las agresiones contra los hispanos se reportaron 5 casos, en comparación con 2 el agosto de 2018, para arrojar un aumento de 150 por ciento. En todo caso un leve descenso en comparación con los cuatro primeros meses de 2019 en que las agresiones a latinos se multiplicaron por cuatro, relación con el mismo periodo del año pasado.
En contraste, las agresiones contra la comunidad musulmana experimentaron una disminución en agosto, se reportaron 10 casos a diferencia de los 14 que se registraron el mismo mes del año pasado, una reducción del 29 por ciento.
Mientras tanto, los ataques homofóbicos o motivados por orientación sexual tuvieron un alza, en agosto se reportaron 34 casos, frente a 31 el año pasado o un incremento del 10 por ciento.
Puntos clave de la reducción de delitos
El reporte del NYPD destaca la reducción de los diferentes tipos de delitos en la ciudad de Nueva York, en lo que lo que del 2019. En agosto hubo 2,000 denuncias menos o una reducción del 4 por ciento, no obstante la Uniformada reconoció que continúa abordando la violencia y el aumento de tiroteos a través de vigilancia policial y otros despliegues de precisión dirigidos a eliminar las armas de fuego, mediante acciones coordinadas con los fiscales distritales.
“Los oficiales de policía de la ciudad de Nueva York continúan ganando su título como los mejores del mundo. Gracias a su arduo trabajo y la confianza con la que continúan construyendo la comunidad a la que sirven, el crimen ha disminuido este mes. Eso significa que más personas se mantuvieron a salvo, más familias permanecen completas, y la ciudad de Nueva York sigue siendo la ciudad más segura de Estados Unidos”, dijo Alcalde Bill de Blasio.
Del desglose general de las estadísticas de delitos se advierte una reducción de 2.1 por ciento en el índice de delitos en agosto de 2019 (8,775) en comparación con agosto de 2018 (8,963).
Los 31 asesinatos en agosto de 2019 representan un aumento del 6.9 por ciento en comparación con los 29 de agosto de 2018. Año hasta la fecha, el número de asesinato se redujo al 3.8 por ciento.
El informe defiende una reducción en las categorías principales de delitos en lo que va de año, con excepción de los asaltos que vieron un aumento del 0.2 por ciento.
En cuanto a los delitos o infracciones de tránsito, se reportaron 205 incidentes, una reducción del 11.3 por ciento en agosto de este año en relación con los 231 casos reportados en agosto de 2018.
“La ciudad de Nueva York continúa viendo reducciones del crimen, y eso se debe a la dedicación, profesionalismo y trabajo duro de los miembros de la policía de Nueva York en asociación con las comunidades a las que sirven”, dijo el comisionado de policía James P. O’Neill . “Juntos estamos enfocados en el crimen violento, y eso nos coloca en una posición donde podemos abordar las condiciones de la delincuencia y hacer que la ciudad sea aún más segura”.
El martes, el alcalde Bill de Blasio anunció la creación de la Oficina para la Prevención de Crímenes de Odio y nombró a Deborah Lauter , de 62 años, como directora ejecutiva. La nueva dependencia, que además de la prevención, coordinará la respuesta de la ciudad a los crímenes de odio y ayudará a las víctimas y sus comunidades, estará adscrita a la Oficina de Justicia Criminal del Alcalde.
La agencia para prevenir los crímenes de odio tendrá un presupuesto de $ 1.7 millones en el año fiscal 2020 y contará con seis empleados, reveló Colby Hamilton, portavoz de la Oficina de Justicia Criminal del Alcalde . El salario anual de Lauter será de $ 150,000.
La nueva funcionaria cuenta con una dilatada carrera con grupos afiliados a judíos, incluidos 20 años con la Liga Anti-Difamación. También fue directora ejecutiva de un comité de acción política pro-Israel en San Francisco y trabajó en la Federación Judía de Atlanta.
De los 148 delitos denunciados en la ciudad de Nueva York entre enero y mayo, 85 fueron anti judíos, más de la mitad. De esos 85 delitos, el 80 por ciento fueron relacionados con el dibujo de eran esvásticas y frases antisemita.
“Claramente, creo que los incidentes que hemos estado viendo están saliendo de Brooklyn, y de la comunidad hasídica en particular. Son los judíos más visibles y han sido blanco de ataques atroces”, dijo Lauter.
La semana pasada, en las paredes de un club localizado en una playa pública de Queens se pintaron grafitis racistas y antisemitas. Según The New York Times, la frase “Heil Hitler” estaba escrita en letras mayúsculas en el patio de recreo, una esvástica roja estaba en las paredes y una cámara de gas estaba pintada en la puerta del referido club. , La policía de parques de la ciudad Nueva York está investigando el caso.
En Long Island, el número de crímenes de odio reportados disminuyó en Suffolk, pero aumentó ligeramente este año en Nassau.
Para la policía de Suffolk, los informes de crímenes de odio han disminuido desde 2015, dijo la detective Gail Marrero, pero dijo que esas cifras no incluyen los casos de graffiti. En Nassau, la policía del condado dijo que se habían reportado 41 delitos de odio hasta el 31 de julio, en comparación con 34 durante todo el año pasado.

Texto completo: Researchers from Harvard University and Baruch College at CUNY say their new “ultragentle" gripper device, with its noodle-like fingers, can grab delicate ocean creatures that formerly would have been mangled as scientists pulled them out of the ocean to examine them.
But don't just take their word for it.
Ask the jellyfish at the New England Aquarium, where resarchers tested the device, pulling moon jellies, jelly blubbers, and spotted jellies, all about the size of a golf ball, from the water without causing them any stress.
The tool could come in handy studying deep sea creatures in their natural habitat, researchers said.
Jellyfish and squid that live a mile or two underwater are beyond the range of scuba-diving scientists, who must rely on submarines to explore the pitch-dark depths. Once in a while, detritus samplers and other collection tools attached to submersibles can capture the diaphanous animals. But the creatures are at risk of getting stuck in the sampler or destroyed.
The sampling tools available to marine biologists were largely developed for the oil and gas industry and are more suited to grabbing rocks or heavy equipment than sea creatures, researchers said.
The new tool was developed by researchers at Harvard's Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering and John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) and Baruch College at CUNY. The research is detailed in a paper published last week in Science Robotics.
“Our ultragentle gripper is a clear improvement over existing deep-sea sampling devices for jellies and other soft-bodied creatures that are otherwise nearly impossible to collect intact," first author Nina Sinatra, a former graduate student at the Wyss Institute who is now a mechanical and materials engineer at Google, said in a statement from the university.
“This technology can also be extended to improve underwater analysis techniques and allow extensive study of the ecological and genetic features of marine organisms without taking them out of the water," she said. “Overall, our ultragentle gripper demonstrates an improvement in gentle sample collection compared with existing deep-sea sampling devices."
David Gruber, a marine biologist at CUNY, told The New York Times, “I always felt that it was a little strange for me as a marine biologist to have to kill the animals that I love and study."
The gripper has six fingers. Each finger is composed of thin strips of silicone with a hollow channel inside. The inside edges of the fingers have a stiffer nanofiber coating that controls how they curve. They are attached to a 3D-printed rectangular palm in such a way that they can be removed individually and replaced if they start to become arthritic.
A switch at the back of the gripper fills the channels inside the silicone fingers with water, forcing them to curl shut in the direction of the nanofiber coating. This helps maintain an ultragentle grip; the fingers exert less than one-10th of the pressure that a human eyelid exerts on the eye.
Current soft marine grippers exert many times more force, researchers said.
Gruber and Wyss founding core faculty member Rob Wood are collaborating on innovations in the use of soft robotics for underwater sampling.
“Soft robotics is an ideal solution to long-standing problems like this one across a wide variety of fields, because it combines the programmability and robustness of traditional robots with unprecedented gentleness thanks to the flexible materials used," Wood said in a statement.
Researchers said they first tried the gripper out on an artificial silcone jellyfish in a tank of water. In the New England Aquarium test on real jellyfish, the animals, which are 95 percent water, were unable to break free until the gripper was depressurized.
The team is continuing to refine the gripper's design and aims to look more deeply into the jellyfishes' physiological response to being grabbed, to more definitely prove that the animals are not being stressed, researchers said.

Black, American, and abroad? Racism travels free

Texto completo: I am caught between a cab and a crazy lady.
Over and over, a woman is smashing a taxi door into me, but I can't understand her rage. In that moment, I don't even feel the weight of the door.
For a few seconds, I am outside of my body. I was just trying to catch a cab in Paris.
The driver was a few steps ahead of me. As I made my way to his car, a woman frantically ran toward us across the street, from the opposite direction.
I was already at his car door, so I opened it. And before I could get safely inside, the door was crashing into me.
I'd been in Paris for six days — my first European adventure. I'd heard stories about traveling while black, but France was everything I wanted it to be. “Bonjour," the natives greeted me everywhere I went. Each day, I explored the cafes where James Baldwin wrote “Go Tell It on the Mountain" and “Giovanni's Room." I found solace in the places he spent time, like Shakespeare and Company.
Paris was his escape. And as I sipped hot chocolate in the late of night on Paris sidewalks turned patios, I felt peace. Jumping on the trampolines at the Tuileries with a sisterfriend, hands way in the air, across the street from the Louvre, I felt free. Even if it was fleeting, it was freeing.
With my feet in the grass at Luxembourg Gardens, I understood how this place became his home.
“It wasn't so much a matter of choosing France — it was a matter of getting out of America," Baldwin told The Paris Review in 1984. “I didn't know what was going to happen to me in France but I knew what was going to happen to me in New York. If I had stayed there, I would have gone under."
But there is no escaping racism. It comes with you in the carry-on bag called your skin.
And as I stood outside of a fancy shopping district where security stands at the entrances, being attacked by a white woman wearing a suit in broad daylight, I knew I did not have the right to be right. I was taught to defend myself.
I am American. I am black. And I am in France. I do not have the fame or black excellence of James Baldwin and Josephine Baker. Sometimes the love of black culture is so high, a few of our famous can sample freedom so long as power systems stay intact.
But I'm an everyday black American woman visiting from Boston, where Crispus Attucks, a fugitive from slavery, was the first casualty of the American Revolution. I was born in Virginia, where the first enslaved Africans in America were sold 400 years ago.
I knew I could not fight this lady. Eric Garner was choked to death five years ago on a New York street as he said, “I can't breathe."
Last month, Daniel Pantaleo — the NYPD officer who choked Garner — was finally fired.
The chokehold was illegal. The killing was on video. Pantaleo didn't go to jail. Five years after Garner's death, he lost his job and pension. A GoFundMe for him already has raised over $160,000.
And folk call that justice. No, I could not hit her back.
All I could think about is how I might die or be detained if I defended myself from this woman shouting in my face and attacking me. I took a deep breath and shoved the door back in her direction, giving me just enough room to be, well, free.
Except I wasn't free. I couldn't even look back. I had to just keep pushing forward, toward my friend, toward safety.
And that's when I felt the sting of her violence on my arm, very red but only slightly swollen.
The next day, pain pierced my elbow as I boarded a plane back to the states. I dropped my phone and smashed it.
I was not mad about my arm or my iPhone. I was hurt because I had not fought back.
The day after that, Nikole Hannah-Jones and The New York Times released The 1619 Project, an initiative observing the 400th anniversary of the beginning of American slavery by examining the consequences of slavery and the contributions of black Americans.
We became black Americans in 1619, our roots stripped from us, a new culture born.
Our people, black American people, were seen as subhuman. Whiteness could not exist without our blackness. And richness rested upon our oppression.
The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was less than 55 years ago. And we're still fighting for equity, for black lives to matter.
“This belief, that black people were not merely enslaved but were a slave race, became the root of the endemic racism that we still cannot purge from this nation to this day," Hannah-Jones writes.
And the thing about this nation is America is a world leader. Our influence is everywhere. If we cannot correct racism, if our country continues to uphold systemic oppression and anti-blackness, how can we expect to move about the world and not have run-ins with crazy cab ladies?
I am a black American at all times. But being a black and brown Parisian isn't easy, either.
The Paris banlieues riots against brutality and inequality were in 2005. Protestors want liberation, too. Racism and classism live everywhere.
While walking through a lovely Parisian boutique the day before the attack, a salesman asked me, “Mademoiselle, are you finding happiness here?"
What a beautiful question, I thought. We should all stop and ask ourselves that throughout the day. And the thing is, I was happy. I felt, for the first time in a very long while, light.
Even as I held my elbow on the plane back to America, I clung to that buoyancy. I could still smell the fresh baked bread and that delectable taste of molten chocolate. I couldn't wait to sing “Bonsoir" to my friends.
I closed my eyes and held onto images of Monet's “Water Lilies" and thoughts of Baldwin and Richard Wright talking black creativity over cocktails back in the day.
Yes, I found happiness in France. And I smiled when my feet touched the cobbly sidewalks of Boston again, too. I'm back in Massachusetts, where Belinda Sutton successfully petitioned the courts for her promised pension when her master died. Reparations. There's a lot of ways to fight back the system that seeks to singe our spirit.
In America, in France, all around the world, I know this truth to be self-evident:
Despite all people being created equal, it is not our lived experience. From sea to shining sea, black is black, and we deserve joy and we deserve to be free.

Texto completo: New York City is dedicating an official to fighting hate crimes at a time when the offenses are skyrocketing across the five boroughs. 
Deborah Lauter, 62, started last week as executive director of the new Office for the Prevention of Hate Crimes, within the Mayor's Office of Criminal Justice. Besides prevention, the new office will coordinate the city's response to hate crimes and will help victims and their communities.
Lauter, who was appointed by Mayor Bill de Blasio, will supervise five or six employees and oversee a budget of $1.7 million in fiscal 2020, according to B. Colby Hamilton, a spokesman for the Mayor's Office of Criminal Justice. Lauter's annual salary will be $150,000. 
Lauter joined the city after spending most of her career with Jewish-affiliated groups, including 20 years with the Anti-Defamation League. She also was executive director of a pro-Israel political action committee in San Francisco and worked at the Jewish Federation of Atlanta.
Anti-Jewish crimes citywide jumped 82 percent in the first four months of this year, compared with the same period in 2018, NYPD statistics show. All categories of hate crimes across the five boroughs increased 67 percent. 
Of the 148 crimes reported from January through May, 85 were anti-Jewish - more than half.  Of those 85 crimes, 80 percent were swastikas drawn as anti-Semitic graffiti.
"Clearly, I think the incidents that we've been seeing are coming out of Brooklyn, and the Hasidic community in particular," Lauter said. "They are the most visibly Jewish, and they've been the targets of atrocious attacks."
On Friday, the manager of a beach club on federal land in Queens told members that racist and anti-Semitic graffiti had been scrawled across the property's playground as well as on the club's walls and a door, according to The New York Times. "Heil Hitler" was written in block letters on the playground, a red swastika was on the walls and  "gas chamber" was painted on the door, photos sent to the Times showed. U.S. Park Police in New York are investigating the case. 
Lauter herself has been a victim of a hate crime. When she was living in Atlanta in the 1990s, a vandal or vandals left pork and shellfish products in her mailbox, she said. Jews who obey Jewish dietary laws or keep kosher, as Lauter said she does, don't  eat pork or shellfish.
"When it happened to me personally, I realized how much it meant to my identity and how much fear it raised," she said. "It was pretty terrifying ... in the scheme of things, I was not assaulted and the home wasn't vandalized ... but it was pretty terrifying for my children."
On Long Island, the number of reported hate crimes was down in Suffolk but up slightly this year in Nassau. 
For Suffolk police, reports of hate crimes have been going down since 2015, said Det. Lt. Gail Marrero, commander of the Suffolk County Police Department's major case section, but she said those numbers don't include graffiti. In Nassau, county police said 41 hate crimes had been reported through July 31, compared with 34 for all of last year, but spokesman Det. Vincent Garcia didn't immediately provide a breakdown of what

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Moving toward a final reckoning as the nation approaches the 20th anniversary of the day that led to the longest war in U.S. history, a military judge Friday set a date for the death penalty trial at Guantanamo Bay of the five men accused of plotting the Sept. 11,2001, attacks.
The judge, Col. W. Shane Cohen of the Air Force, set Jan. 11, 2021, for the start of the selection of a military jury at Camp Justice, the war court compound at the Navy base in Cuba. It is the first time that a judge in the case actually set a start-of-trial date.
The case against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and our other men, should it proceed, would be the definitive trial tied to the Sept. 11 attacks. Up until now, only foot soldiers of al-Qaida have been tried at Guant�namo, and many of their convictions have been overturned.
Mohammed and the four others face the death penalty in a conspiracy case that describes Mohammed as the architect of the plot in which 19 men hijacked four commercial passenger planes and slammed two of them into the World Trade Center towers and one into the Pentagon. The fourth, which was believed to be aimed for the Capitol, crashed into a Pennsylvania field instead. The other four men are described as helping the hijackers with training, travel or finances.
The charge sheets lists the names of the 2,976 people who died in the attacks.
"We've been wanting a date for a very long time," said Terry Strada, whose husband, Tom, a corporate bond broker and partner with Cantor Fitzgerald, was killed in the World Trade Center. "This is good news. I certainly hope nothing will happen between now and then to change this. The families have suffered long enough."
Kathleen Vigiano, whose husband, Joseph Vigiano, a New York police detective, and brother-in-law, John Vigiano Jr., a New York firefighter, were both killed at the World Trade Center, said she was relieved after the years of delay. "People say, this is still going on?" she said. "No, it hasn't started yet."
The delay is in part a reflection of the difficulty the military has had in carrying out prosecutions in a judicial system that was created in response to the Sept. 11 attacks.
It is still unclear if the trial will actually occur. A judge has yet to rule on whether crucial FBI agents' descriptions of the defendants' confessions are admissible because the defendants were tortured in CIA prisons. Defense lawyers have said they will go to federal court closer to the trial start date to try to stop the proceedings.
Another outstanding issue is the need for MRI scans of the five defendants to see if they suffered brain or other physical damage from torture. Defense lawyers might use the MRIs to argue against the mens executions if they are convicted.
The war crimes trial by military commissions - a hybrid of federal and military courts - will be held in a special courtroom allowing people sitting behind the court in a spectator's gallery to watch live. But because it is a national security case with the potential to inadvertently make public classified information, the proceedings will be heard on a 40-second delay. For now the general public would be able to see the live proceedings only through a video feed shown at Forr. Meade. Maryland.

Alexander: From Clippers beat to Curt Gowdy Award – it’s Marc Stein’s story, too

Texto completo: Maybe it was the consequence of covering all of those Clippers teams during the bad years, the years of losses, holdouts, coaching changes and the recently fired having to sue Donald Sterling to get their guaranteed contracts paid off. Maybe, if you covered enough of those lean years, you picked up the reporting chops to earn Hall of Fame recognition.
Marc Stein landed on the Clippers beat for the L.A. Daily News in February of 1994, just 10 days before the team traded Danny Manning – the No. 1 overall pick just five seasons before – to the Atlanta Hawks for Dominique Wilkins, then on the downside of his own magnificent career.
“I just thought I was the luckiest person in the world,” he said. “They weren’t anywhere near a marquee attraction, but I got thrown into it. … Bob Weiss was the coach, and they were supposed to be a playoff team because they’d made the playoffs the previous two years (under Larry Brown). But they just imploded. They traded Manning, finished 27-55, traded Mark Jackson. It was a really chaotic season.
“But for me, as a child of the ’80s, when the NBA was not on every channel, obviously I’d see a lot of the Lakers but I also saw a lot of the Hawks because they were on TBS. So for me to be covering Dominique at age 24, and to go to the (Atlanta) Omni and see Dominique lead the Clippers to a win, I couldn’t believe it. I was still star-struck.”
That didn’t last. When you’re doing your job as a journalist, it can’t. And Stein has done his job so well through the years – covering the Clippers and then the Lakers for the Daily News, the Mavericks for the Dallas Morning News and the national basketball beat at Dallas, then for ESPN and now the New York Times – that he will be honored by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on Thursday in Springfield, Mass., right alongside recently retired Clippers play-by-play man Ralph Lawler.
Both men will receive the Curt Gowdy Media Award, given in recognition of distinguished service covering basketball.
It will be a Southern California gathering this weekend, with lots of connected parts. Besides Stein and Lawler, former Lakers coach Del Harris (who Stein covered) will receive the John W. Bunn Lifetime Achievement Award at Thursday’s ceremony, along with Portland Trail Blazers general manager and president Harry Glickman.
At Friday’s main induction ceremony, Bill Fitch (who Stein covered) will go into the Hall, although Fitch’s family announced Tuesday that for health reasons, he won’t be able to attend the ceremony. Additionally, Vlade Divac will be inducted as an international player, and Jerry West will be his presenter.
“Surreal doesn’t even start to cover it,” Stein said.
Stein’s first NBA story was on Divac when he covered the Summer Pro League for the Orange County Register in the summer of 1989. And he covered the Lakers during West’s years as general manager – and drew West’s ire for something he didn’t do in 1996, the summer the Lakers got Shaquille O’Neal.
“I wrote a free agent preview for the Daily News,” he recalled. “It turned out that Long Beach (the Press-Telegram) used mostly my story but weaved some stuff from a New York Daily News story into my piece that suggested the Lakers had already done a deal with Shaq and had broken the rules.
“The next morning Jerry stormed into (publicist) Raymond Ridder’s office and said, ‘Have you seen the clips?’ Raymond said, ‘Yeah, it’s right here’ (pointing to the Daily News story). Jerry said, ‘No, not that one, this one.’ He showed him the Long Beach story with my byline. He made Raymond call me, and then Jerry erupted on me.
“I’m sure anybody who covered the Lakers remembered getting Jerry when he’s in that mode of losing his temper. It’s kind of like a badge of honor. I’m guessing he didn’t remember the next day; he got it out and it was forgotten.”
Stein could be a walking history of sports journalism in Southern California over the past 30 years. He started at the Saddleback Valley News when he was still in high school and got a job at the Register when he started at Cal State Fullerton. He did an internship at the Washington Post the summer of his junior year at Fullerton and then did one at the San Bernardino Sun as a senior, covering the California League and the San Bernardino Spirit – home and road – in 1991.
“My first game was (future major leaguer) Mike Hampton’s no-hitter,” he recalled, adding that it was Hampton’s only victory that season; he was 1-7 with a 5.25 ERA. But fighting deadlines every night, while following the team to Reno, Stockton, Visalia, Bakersfield and the other garden spots of the Cal League was good training.
He remembers the people who helped him move up. Mike Gallups, his high school journalism advisor at El Toro High, was an old high school classmate of the Register’s Earl Bloom, and Bloom helped get him on at the Register. Later, when he graduated from Fullerton at a time when jobs were scarce, Ken Daley – a former co-worker in Orange County and by then Dodgers beat writer at the Daily News – spoke up for him. Stein was hired by the Daily News for the copy desk, but within six months was writing about high school sports and pro tennis before the NBA beat opened in 1994.
“That was my big chance,” he recalled. “Once I got on the Clippers, I wasn’t letting go.”
He hasn’t since.

Texto completo: Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday he is directing the New York State Police Hate Crimes Task Force to help investigate racist and anti-Semitic graffiti scrawled on the walls of a beach club in Queens.
A red swastika, the words "gas chamber" and "Heil Hitler" along with racial slurs aimed at black people were found on the walls of a playground at the Silver Gull Beach Club in Rockaway, according to a report in The New York Times.
Cuomo said in a statement that he was "disgusted" by the graffiti and called on lawmakers across the state to denounce "continued acts of hatred and attempts to intimidate and terrorize."
The latest incident comes amid a rise in hate crimes across the city. Last week, a Jewish man wearing religious clothing was brutally attacked, including being hit with a rock. Earlier in August, four men were arrested in connection with assaults and robberies that targeted Jewish men in Williamsburg.
"We must also call these vile acts what they are - they are hate crimes and they are illegal," Cuomo said.
The state Hate Crimes Task Force will assist the U.S Park Police's investigation of the incident, according to the governor. The Silver Gull is located in the National Park Service's Gateway National Recreation Area.
City Councilman Eric Ulrich and Donovan Richards, who both represent parts of the Rockaway peninsula, condemned the Silver Gull graffiti on social media.

STEVEN UNIVERSE: THE MOVIE (2019) 6 p.m. on Cartoon Network. Rebecca Sugar became the first solo female show creator at Cartoon Network when she created "Steven Universe." Since its 2013 debut, the show has won a Peabody Award, been nominated for five Emmy Awards and gained applause for being a standard-bearer in L.G.B.T.Q. representation in animation. The series gets the movie musical treatment here, with a story that involves Steven (voiced by Zach Callison) saving the world after the arrival of an alien threatens the continued existence of life on earth. Chance the Rapper, Gallant and Aimee Mann are among the musicians who collaborated on the movie's original music; Patti LuPone and Christine Ebersole are among the vocal talent involved. "With the show, we like to take things that feel familiar and dig into them," Sugar said in a recent interview with The New York Times. "So, I wanted to approach a 'Steven Universe' musical that way: These are things you recognize from other musicals, but with these characters."
What's Streaming
UNTOUCHABLE (2019) Stream on Hulu. It has been nearly two years since investigations by The Times and The New Yorker revealed allegations that Harvey Weinstein sexually harassed or abused numerous women over several decades -- allegations, of course, that are credited with sparking the #MeToo Movement. This documentary, directed by Ursula Macfarlane, uses interviews with some of his accusers, alongside journalists and former Weinstein employees, to tell a larger story of how Weinstein went from a childhood in Queens to the position he's in now: set to go to trial in January on charges of rape and other sex crimes.
THE MATRIX TRILOGY Stream on Hulu and Vudu; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. It's a particularly good time to revisit the original trilogy, given the news that Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss will return for a fourth "Matrix" movie. While the chunky computer screens used for hacking in this series are obsolete two decades later, the recent box office successes of "John Wick" movies suggest that watching Reeves engage in hand-to-hand combat never goes out of vogue.
UNSANE (2018) Stream on Amazon; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Claire Foy plays a woman who is forced into a psychiatric hospital in this mysterious thriller, which was directed by Steven Soderbergh. Shot on an iPhone, the film introduces Sawyer (Foy), who has recently moved from her hometown and arrived in a new city, where she works an unfulfilling job in a dull cubicle under a creepy boss. We learn that Sawyer left home to escape a stalker. When she goes to seek psychological counseling at a hospital, she gets duped into signing on to stay there for 24 hours. It ends up being a considerably longer visit. In her review for The Times, Manohla Dargis called the film "an effectively nasty, sometimes funny, sometimes grindingly unpleasant thriller."

Texto completo: Kamala Harris has been facing criticism from fellow Democrats over her criminal justice record during her time as a top California prosecutor. During last month’s Democratic debate, for example, Tulsi Gabbard slammed Harris for blocking DNA testing that could have exonerated death row inmate Kevin Cooper while she was district attorney of San Francisco.
Cooper was convicted of murdering Douglas and Peggy Ryen, their 10-year old daughter Jessica, and 11-year-old Christopher Hughes, a family friend of the Ryens', during a home invasion in the Chino Hills area in 1983. For the past 15 years, his attorneys have been fighting for advanced testing of DNA evidence which they claim could exonerate their client, a move that was opposed by Harris while she was attorney general of California. Last year, after the case was publicized by the New York Times’ Nick Kristof, Harris backtracked and told the paper that she felt “awful about this” and now supports the testing, but did not explain what prompted her change of heart.
The Cooper saga is not the only case where Harris has pitted herself against a culprit who claims to have been wrongfully convicted. Here are five other times where Harris has bucked against criminal justice reform advocates:
1. When her staff prosecuted a reality star who was framed by police. Kamala Harris was district attorney of San Francisco in February 2010 when 29-year-old Jamal Trulove, a former reality star and aspiring hip-hop artist, was convicted of murdering 28-year-old Seu Kuka based on the testimony of a lone witness. After Trulove was sentenced to 50 years in prison, Harris praised the “brave eyewitness” for the conviction — but failed to mention that the woman had been paid over $60,000 by the prosecution and given new housing under the witness protection program. An appeals court later overturned the verdict after finding that prosecutors, working under Harris at the district attorney’s office, misrepresented the witness to the jury. In March, Trulove was awarded a $13 million settlement from the city due to allegations of police misconduct, including manipulating the witness and fabricating evidence.
2. When her office defended the sexual assault conviction of an electrician based on a technicality. Harris was attorney general of California in 2015 when her office fought to uphold a sexual assault conviction against a former electrician named George Gage. Gage, 79, had been found guilty of sexually abusing his ex-wife’s daughter in 1999 and was serving a 70-year sentence. Gage appealed, and a judge determined that prosecutors had withheld exculpatory evidence, including the accuser’s medical records and a statement from her mother calling her a “pathological liar.” Harris’ office successfully fought against a retrial on a procedural technicality, and Gage is still in prison.
3. When she fought compensation for a wrongfully convicted gang shooter. In 2002, Rafael Madrigal was convicted of a drive-by gang shooting and the attempted murder of Ricardo Aguilera in East Los Angeles. He was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. Seven years later, a federal judge tossed the conviction due to inadequate legal defense by Madrigal’s attorney. The court found that Madrigal’s lawyer failed to introduce exculpatory evidence, including several alibis that said Madrigal was 35 miles away at work during the time of the attempted murder. After his release from prison, Madrigal asked the California Victim Compensation and Government Claims Board to compensate him $282,000 for the wrongful conviction. Kamala Harris, the state attorney general at the time, recommended that the board deny Madrigal’s request, arguing that he had not sufficiently proven his innocence.
4. When her office sought to retry a man who had been set up by police. In 1992, Caramad Conley was arrested for a drive-by gang shooting that killed two men in San Francisco. After the prosecution’s key witness testified that 18-year-old Conley had privately confessed to the murder, Conley was convicted and sentenced to life in prison without parole. Although the witness denied under oath that he had been compensated as part of the case, a subsequent investigation found that a detective had paid the witness. The witness had also been given housing by the prosecution and placed in a witness protection program. In December 2010, a judge vacated Conley’s conviction, citing “voluminous” evidence that the witness had lied. Harris was serving as district attorney of San Francisco at the time, and her office initially sought to retry the case, according to reports. One month later, after Harris left to start her new role as California attorney general, the San Francisco district attorney’s office agreed not to retry Conley. He later received a $3.5 million settlement from the city for wrongful conviction.
5. When she fought to keep a misidentified neo-Nazi in prison after his case was tossed. In 1998, a neo-Nazi gang member named Daniel Larsen was convicted of possession of a concealed weapon and sentenced to 27 years in prison. Police officers said they saw Larsen throw a six-inch knife under a car during a confrontation outside a Los Angeles bar. After the trial, nine eyewitnesses (including a North Carolina cop) came forward to dispute that Larsen had been the man holding the knife. A judge determined in 2010 that Larsen’s original attorney had failed to interview any witnesses at all and overturned the conviction. Despite the ruling, Harris, as state attorney general, blocked Larsen’s release for two years. After Larsen was finally let out, Harris appealed his release by arguing that he missed a paperwork deadline.

The rise of Roosevelt

Texto completo: In 1898, Teddy Roosevelt charged up a hill in Cuba and into history. Along the way, he put Tampa on the map.

The Rough Riders, the volunteer unit that Roosevelt recruited and helped lead, sailed from Tampa into national legend. In The Crowded Hour: Theodore Roosevelt, the Rough Riders, and the Dawn of the American Century, Clay Risen has written an engaging, deeply researched account of one the most famous battles in American military history.

Risen, who is the deputy op-ed editor of the New York Times, is also the author of The Bill of the Century: The Epic Battle for the Civil Rights Act and A Nation on Fire: America in the Wake of the King Assassination. He will be a featured author at the Tampa Bay Times Festival of Reading on Nov. 9.

In The Crowded Hour  its title borrowed from Roosevelts own description of the battle  Risen frames his account of the Rough Riders and their part in the attack on Santiago de Cuba with the historical and political context of the Spanish-American War on one hand, and, on the other, the personal accounts in letters and journals of the men who were part of it.

As the 20th century approached, Risen writes, the United States faced changes. The deep scars of the Civil War still divided the nation, and the long wars against indigenous tribes that marked the closing of the Western frontier took their toll as well. For decades most Americans had opposed intervention in foreign nations that might lead to war. So widespread was this pacifism and isolationism that by the 1890s the U.S. Army had dwindled to only 28,000 men.

But the United States was beginning to see itself as a global power, and public support grew for the Cuban rebels who for several years had been fighting to throw off Spanish rule. Spain had controlled Cuba since Christopher Columbus landed there almost four centuries before, and Spains ruthless treatment of the rebels evoked American sympathies. Newspaper accounts of the rebellion by star reporters such as Richard Harding Davis (who plays a large role in this book) appealed to American idealism, casting intervention in Cuba as an extension of national values of liberty and self-determination.

In 1898, Theodore Roosevelt was 39 years old. He had been a bestselling author, politician, rancher, naturalist and historian, but he had no military experience. He was serving as assistant secretary of the Navy under President William McKinley as the drumbeat of war grew. He found a kindred spirit in McKinleys personal physician, Leonard Wood, an Army captain who had served in the Indian wars and was, like Roosevelt, an adventure junkie, Risen writes.

The famous explosion of the Maine, a U.S. warship, in Havanas harbor in February 1898 was probably an accident, Risen writes, but it set off war fever across the United States, not least in Roosevelt and Wood. By May, Roosevelt had resigned his position and volunteered for the Army, and he and Wood set out to recruit a volunteer regiment. They received 27 mail sacks of applications in the first weeks of the war.

They also received huge amounts of press coverage. The fact that he would be leading a band of cowboys into battle, Risen writes, made the story of Roosevelt and his regiment irresistible.

The troops werent all cowboys, although many were, or Westerners who had fought in the Indian wars. Others were scions of wealthy Eastern families with Ivy League degrees, lawyers or doctors or professional tennis players. And pretty soon they were all media darlings. In San Antonio, Texas, where they first gathered for training, so many thousands of civilians came to tour the camp that they had to be banned. At the center of attention was Roosevelt, a charismatic dynamo with no inside voice and a swaggering back story.

From Texas the Rough Riders traveled by train to Tampa. It was an odd choice. At the time Tampa was a town of 15,000 people. Roosevelt called it a perfect welter of confusion; Davis described it as derelict wooden houses drifting in a sea of sand. The only place for the regiment to board ships for Cuba was Port Tampa, 9 miles from the city at the southern tip of the Interbay Peninsula.

So why were they here? Henry Plant. The railroad and hotel magnate saw the war as a fine branding opportunity for his Tampa Bay Hotel, an improbable tourist resort (its minaret-topped building is now part of the University of Tampa) that was in its slow season in the heat of the Florida summer. So he lobbied McKinley to send the troops to Tampa and, Risen writes, the Department of War, without considering the alternatives, agreed.

So many soldiers arrived in Tampa that the citys population tripled, leaving food and almost everything else in short supply, although the locals welcomed them warmly. The troops slept in tents to the north and east of town, around what is now Tampa Heights and other areas, while officers bunked at the posh hotel  except Roosevelt and Wood, now colonels, who spent their days at the hotel but preferred to camp with their men at night. As Plant had hoped, members of the press who swarmed the camp gave Tampa, and his hotel, some of their coverage.

Risen writes vividly about the bungled departure from Tampa, on a mismatched fleet of rented ships so inadequate that most of the regiments horses and artillery had to be left behind. After more than a week of delays, they departed on June 13.

That morning, he writes, thirty-one ships carrying 10 million pounds of rations, 2,295 horses and mules, 16 pieces of artillery, and 16,987 men  including 89 war correspondents and 11 foreign observers  slipped out of Hillsborough Bay toward the Gulf of Mexico.

They were headed for further chaos and shining heroism. Davis wrote in his report of the battle on July 1 that Roosevelt, mounted high on horseback, and charging the rifle-pits at a gallop and quite alone, made you feel you would like to cheer as he led the Rough Riders pivotal charge up a hill above Santiago de Cuba  although perhaps not the hill you think.

The Spanish-American War would last for less than four months, with the United States taking possession of not only Cuba but Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines. Many of the Rough Riders never returned, felled by bullets and bombs as well as by heat stroke, malaria, yellow fever and dysentery. Others came back heroes. The United States had a new vision of itself that would carry forward into all the wars of the 20th century and beyond.

By the end of 1898, Roosevelt would be elected governor of New York. In 1901, he became vice president and, after William McKinley was assassinated six months later, president. The battle in Cuba was just one crowded hour in a crowded and extraordinary life; this book makes it both a dashing adventure story and a revealing window into our history.

Texto completo: Dance, supposedly the most ephemeral of the arts, has the power to put down hardy roots in unlikely ground. Consider Marta Becket, the New York ballerina and show dancer who established her own company of one in Death Valley Junction, where she performed for over 40 years.
Or Maui’s Adaptations Dance Theatre, founded in 2013 and going strong as the island’s home for professionals in modern dance — a barefoot, often more muscular alternative to classical ballet.
At ADR three muses hold sway, dancers all.
“You have to shuffle,” says Hallie Hunt, one of two co-artistic directors who piece together their livings by teaching and performing. “It’s a patchwork quilt,” says Amelia Couture, the other.
“It’s like building the plane in the air,” adds Jen Cox, the executive director, who has a full-time day job as an administrator in a mental health treatment center. “Hallie and Amelia are the ones with the vision, and my job is to make it happen.”
Cox comes to modern dance from a mix of jazz, hip-hop and other styles; in their dreams Couture and Hunt used to dance “Swan Lake.”
The trio’s latest milestone was the company’s fourth annual summer dance concert at Seabury Hall’s classy ‘A‘ali‘ikuhonua Creative Arts Center, presenting four world premieres. The umbrella title “Bring It Home” reflects an agenda.
Whether they were born and raised here or moved here from somewhere else, the leaders of the company are all full-time residents of Maui on a mission to share and grow the professionalism they bring back from the mainland.
Modern dance was the right niche for that. “I want to push myself as a choreographer and the dancers as dancers,” says Hunt. “I want us all to keep moving forward.”
Energy abounded in the four new pieces; space was there to be devoured. There were startling departures from the vertical, cartwheels and stop-action balances upside down. And without telling what you’d call a “story,” exactly, each of the new pieces followed its own theatrical logic.
In “’Ula,” Couture created a fiery starring role for a shape-shifting length of red cloth. In “Ruin,” Hall drove home bad news about climate change with jolts of humor.
Working in tandem as KLOCK, Florian Lochner and Alice Klock contributed two pieces. The big one, “Ellipse,” featured an ensemble of 12 who formed subgroups, merged into new ones, finally separating into the many who are going the same way and the one who stays behind.
The smaller one, “Pan Meli,” a duet for the choreographers themselves, posed the question, Can a woman who weighs 122 pounds lift a man who weighs 75 kilograms? (That’s a spread of 43 pounds.) Yes, came the answer, but why should she have to? Let her fly!
Between the local talent and visitors — most conspicuously the towering Nathaniel Hunt, who parachutes in from New York — 19 eager movers were on the job, and it got crowded up there. That’s one index of the company’s connection with the community, but hardly the only one.
In November ADT presented its annual “Dance Maui” concert, spotlighting local and guest performers of every stripe: a whiz-bang break dancer, a Caribbean enchantress, ethnic dancers with roots in Africa and Asia, and yes, a hula dancer — a hula dancer really pushing the envelope.
A happier afternoon in the courtyard against the drop-dead backdrop of Mauna Kahalawai would be hard to imagine. Now the search is on for as charmed a venue for the next edition.
More immediately, in a spirit of continuing outreach, ADT is launching “Morning Buzz,” a monthly dance workshop dedicated to the visionary proposition that “Every Body Dances,” held at Lumeria Maui, 1813 Baldwin Ave., in Makawao.
The inaugural session takes place Sept. 8 from 9 to 10:30 a.m. Priced at an affordable $ 15, it’s open to all, no experience required. Find more information at adaptationsdancetheater.com.

That's what emerged in the race for Northampton County district attorney. The father of the Republican nominee, Tom Carroll, died this week, and his obituary included a reference to the political race.
The last line reads: "In lieu of flowers, contributions may be sent to - Elect Tom Carroll..."
Unusual, perhaps, but perfectly legal (as long as expenses for obituaries are included on campaign finance reports as in-kind contributions, if done in coordination with a campaign; and if any resulting donations are reported).
And it's not unprecedented.
In 2015, The Washington Post rounded up these obituaries in a story about the deceased's final call to political action: A 2003 obituary for a New Jersey man included request for contributions to the NRA and President George W. Bush's campaign, the family also suggested a donation to a scholarship fund in the deceased's name.
Democrats have done it too, including a 2008 New York Times obituary of a woman who asked for contributions to "Susan B. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, Public Radio or Television, Brandeis Women, The Barack Obama campaign or any charity of your choice."
Republican Tom Carroll faces Democrat Terry Houck in November.
Alcohol-sales reforms
must be done carefully, lawmakers say
Recent opposition to state Rep. Matthew Dowling's proposed changes to alcohol sales rules for grocery and convenience stores led several lawmakers, including Dowling, to talk about balance.
The bill written by Dowling, a second-term Republican who represents parts of Fayette and Somerset counties, is one of 14 currently awaiting action in the House Liquor Control Committee.
Peter Schweyer, a Lehigh County Democrat and committee member, referred to the need for balance when he said the Dowling bill would kill the beer distributor industry by allowing "big box" stores like Wal-Mart to sell cases of beer, and not just two six-packs at a time.
Customer convenience, Schweyer said, can increase only if investments of small business people who bought into the system - paying for licenses in the belief only distributors would sell cases - are respected.
Rep. Jeff Pyle, the Armstrong County Republican who chairs the committee, said proposals to change the sales system must be made carefully. The main reason, he said, is the range of affected parties: the consuming public, the much-invested small business owners, the employees of the state liquor stores and even big businesses that have started selling alcohol in the past few years, to name a few.
All told, Pyle said, when an alcohol-sales change is proposed "you are hitting like seven or eight interests."
Dowling said his bill was just a starting point.
He said he expected it to undergo drastic changes, and its main thrusts might be merged or mingled with those in some of the other bills before the committee.

West Milford red light a test of patience

Texto completo: Every day during the morning rush hour, a light on Clinton Road at Route 23 stays red for nearly 57 minutes each hour — or 2 minutes and 15 seconds each time the amber gives way to red.
Put another way, that means that once the light turns green, drivers have just an 8-second green light to cross Route 23.
Dubbed "America's longest traffic light" by The New York Times nearly 20 years ago, the light's timing has been tweaked over the years (the ratio improves mildly outside of rush hour), but it still manages to frustrate drivers to no end.
And there is good reason: negotiating the crossing of a four-lane highway divided by a 300-foot median in just 8 seconds is nearly impossible.
"They're just totally out of sync. It's frustrating to get to that light in the morning, and you've got to wait another five minutes," said Robert Nicholson, a candidate for township mayor. "I can't understand, with all the technology today, why they can't change the timing ... at that time of day, there's no traffic going north."
Steve Schapiro, a spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Transportation, said the lights were last adjusted in 2016 to optimize traffic flow in a part of the highway prone to rush-hour backups.
Nicholson and other locals say the Clinton Road traffic lights have been a point of controversy for 20 years.
To be sure, traffic lights are a big deal in West Milford. The annual autumn lights festival, now a large street fair, was started two decades ago to celebrate the township receiving its first traffic lights in the downtown.
The Clinton Road light is not given such adulation.
Some residents, such as Marianne Gillen, say they avoid the Clinton Road traffic light at all costs. Many point to alternate routes, including the detour down nearby Cross Road.
Others soak up the red light.
Martha Ollearo said she spends the wait "people watching" by spying patrons at the Grasshopper Irish Pub & Restaurant that sits in the highway median.
Cindi Conner said she plays the word puzzle game Ruzzle on her mobile phone to pass the time.
Former Mayor Bettina Bieri, who has since moved to warmer climes, would quip that she saw the lights as a signal to relax.
And the long light allows thrill-seeking visitors time to rethink a drive down Clinton Road, one of New Jersey's infamous haunts.
Recently, Clinton Road was used as the setting and title of a horror thriller featuring Ice-T and Vincent Pastore.
There are stories about a ghost car that appears out of thin air. And that of a ghost boy living under a bridge who will throw coins dropped by passersby. There are also tales that the road led to a place of worship for a satanic cult in the ruins of an old castle.
And that it served as the gateway to a dumping ground for a serial killer who froze his victims prior to ditching their bodies.
That last one is true.
Clinton Road and Route 23 in West Milford is a two-light intersection that has gained a reputation due to the time it takes to cross.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - It was known as the "Treaty of Detroit, but it did not end a shooting war. In 1950, Walter Reuther, the legendary leader of the United Auto Workers union, and Charlie Wilson, the CEO of General Motors, agreed to a historic labor contract that bought the automaker five years of labor peace.
After more than a decade of sometimes violent conflict and short-term contracts, Wilson wanted stability so he could expand his company. The result was a trend-setting deal that included not only substantial wage increases but also generous pension and health care coverage. The Washington Post labeled it "a great event in industrial history.
Those were the days. At the peak of its power at the end of World War II, the American labor movement - which had cooperated closely with management and government to create democracy's great arsenal - fundamentally altered the social contract in the United States. Fortune magazine said the Treaty of Detroit "made the worker to an amazing degree a middle class member of a middle class society.
The story of the Reuther-Wilson pact is told in Steven Greenhouse's "Beaten Down, Worked Up: The Past, Present and Future of American Labor, an excellent account of how important strong unions were in moving our nation "toward greater economic and social justice, and how their decline has increased "inequality and unfairness.
Greenhouse, who spent 19 years covering labor and workplace issues for The New York Times, is unabashedly pro-labor without ignoring the union movement's warts and shortcomings. His essential point is that, while we can talk all we want about how technological change and the decline of manufacturing work have undercut the living standards of many Americans, the truth is that better wages and benefits are almost always the product of bargaining power. Building that power was the work of tough-minded idealists like Reuther, backed by New Deal-era labor laws rooted in an understanding that mass purchasing power underwritten by decent wages was good for the overall economy.
In the years since the Treaty of Detroit, the negotiating leverage of American workers has been vastly diminished. In the absence of powerful unions, we have yet to find an alternative and sustainable way of representing employees' interests.
We have also lost the sense of solidarity that originally inspired Labor Day. Greenhouse recounts a conversation with his then-86-year-old mother when he was in Wisconsin covering former Republican Gov. Scott Walker's offensive to gut collective bargaining and cut public employee benefits.
"When I was growing up, she told him, "people used to say, Look at the good wages and benefits that people in a union have. I want to join a union.' Now people say, Look at the good wages and benefits that union members have. They're getting more than I get. That's not fair. Let's take away some of what they have.'
How did we get to this point? In another must-read book for our moment, "The Economists' Hour: False Prophets, Free Markets and the Fracture of Society, Binyamin Appelbaum argues that the growing role of professional economists since the late 1960s fundamentally altered popular understandings about how the world should work.
We have moved, Appelbaum argues, from a healthy respect for what markets can accomplish in their proper sphere to a "single-minded embrace of markets that "has come at the expense of economic equality, of the health of liberal democracy, and of future generations.
"In the pursuit of efficiency, Appelbaum writes, "policy makers subsumed the interests of Americans as producers to the interests of Americans as consumers, trading well-paid jobs for low cost electronics.
Appelbaum, who writes about economics and business for The New York Times editorial page, values what economists do, but the ones he respects most are those who understand the limits of a purely material understanding of what matters. He quotes the brilliant Amartya Sen: "Economic growth cannot sensibly be treated as an end in itself. Development has to be more concerned with enhancing the lives we lead and the freedoms we enjoy.
The financial crisis of 2008, as Appelbaum suggests, will be seen historically as dropping the curtain on a period of market supremacy and radical individualism. The transition to the next act is not pretty. The rise of right-wing nationalism is part of the reaction against the earlier era's mistakes. The times call for democratic visionaries of Reuther's stripe who understand that free societies - and, yes, thriving economies - depend on sharing the fruits of our productivity and rebuilding a solidarity that can overcome our fractiousness.

At Starbucks you now have to bring your own NY Times (if you can find one)

Texto completo: At a Starbucks in Pomona a month ago, the newspaper rack just inside the door had disappeared. Copies of the New York Times were on a bar by the counter, a placement that looked unlikely to last long. The other newspapers weren’t present at all.
The barista didn’t know what it was all about. As I’m in the gloom business, I had a pretty good guess.
This was borne out when I found the rack gone at a second Starbucks in Claremont. That barista said the chain would no longer be selling the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, USA Today and Wall Street Journal. All that location had left was the New York Times, left on the counter.
A stack, not a rack.
“They did sell,” the barista told me of the newspapers. “Customers are, ‘nooooo!’”
The New York Post, it turned out, broke the story in July. Starbucks, which had been selling the N.Y. Times since 2000 and other papers since 2010, would stop selling newspapers at its 8,600 U.S. stores Sept. 1 due to “changing customer behavior.”
I have to be honest: I never bought a newspaper at Starbucks. I also never swiped a newspaper from Starbucks. Many customers did, treating papers as if they were free and leaving them behind on communal tables. Since people think news on the internet should be free, they must think that also applies to newspapers.
What I would do was pause at the rack, peer at the front page of the N.Y. Times and maybe read a few paragraphs. My philosophy was that page one was fair game. Opening the paper would be getting into “Hey, kid, this ain’t a library” territory.
Starbucks was probably the most visible retailer to carry newspapers, so even if I didn’t buy papers there, I hated to see them on the way out. And it’s a maxim that things (and people) can become more desirable if they’re unattainable.
And so, with newspapers leaving Starbucks, suddenly I was pining for a N.Y. Times.
My hope had been to buy a Times at Starbucks on one of the last Sundays and wade into its glory, section after section after section. But I ran out of time for the Times. Last Sunday morning at a Pomona Starbucks, I was only able to read my own two home-delivered dailies before needing to be somewhere, so I didn’t buy one of the two Times copies on the counter.
In Chino Hills that afternoon, a friend and I stopped at a Starbucks. (Breaking: Starbucks is everywhere.) The newspaper rack was empty except for two lonely copies of the Orange County Register at the bottom. I mentioned that Starbucks wouldn’t be selling newspapers anymore.
“That’s a harbinger of the future,” said my friend, who writes for a newspaper, and who had the demeanor of someone who’s just seen the Angel of Death drift past, chuckling.
I hit up two Starbucks later that day. The one in Pomona had sold out (or thrown its copies away). One in Claremont didn’t think it had received any.
“It’s the end of an era,” one barista said. Her co-worker added: “It’s so sad!”
So there went my plan to buy a Sunday N.Y. Times at a Starbucks. My new plan was to buy a weekday N.Y. Times at a Starbucks. But there were none to be had. Newspaper sales apparently stopped a week early.
My final plan was to buy a N.Y. Times somewhere else, take it to Starbucks and read it. Give me this: Once I get an idea into my head, I will stubbornly see it through.
Finding a copy of the N.Y. Times was easier said than done. This despite what a Times spokeswoman had told the Post: “Although disappointed by the decision, we’re confident that given our wide retail distribution, readers will have no trouble finding The New York Times for sale at nearby outlets.”
Claremont, the college town where I live, seemed the likeliest bet for the Gray Lady. Downtown used to have two Times racks, one outside the Post Office, one outside Walter’s, but both are gone.
The Village Market sells only the Daily Bulletin, for which I commend them, and the Claremont Courier. Pomona College has a couple of spots where the NYT is available for free, meant for students, but classes haven’t resumed yet and neither has delivery. The college bookstore doesn’t stock newspapers. The libraries downtown and at the colleges get the Times, thankfully, but my goal was to buy one.
At the Barnes & Noble in neighboring Montclair, I asked if they carry newspapers, like the N.Y. Times. “Like, actual newspapers?” a clerk asked. A second clerk said: “We don’t. We used to, but not anymore.”
A gas station near the colleges had also given up. “No, we stopped selling newspapers last year, I think,” a clerk said. “You could try Starbucks.”
I delivered the bad news. “They stopped selling them too?” he said, eyes wide. He shook his head. “A printed newspaper. That’s a hard find.”
This reminded me of an encounter earlier this year at Creme Bakery in downtown Claremont. I often read my newspapers there, partly for pleasure, partly to model good behavior. A woman noticed me reading and said, a bit wistfully, “I miss newspapers.”
A few seconds went by.
I said, “They print new ones every day.”
Where else might one buy a New York Times locally? Suddenly I remembered the area’s only newsstand, Newsboy Books in downtown Ontario.
Newsboy stocks 10 daily newspapers, including the NYT, although the Starbucks decision seemed to throw a wrench into local distribution. The last copy delivered to Newsboy was last Sunday’s, although co-owner Roberta Gingold told me she expects to have copies again starting Tuesday.
In the meantime, on Friday morning she had one copy of last Sunday’s NYT, and to fulfill my goal, and also to round out this column, I handed over $6.47.
Next stop: an Ontario Starbucks, where the newspaper rack stood empty. I bought a drink, sat down with my fat copy of the NYT, with 10 sections and a magazine, and dug in.

4. ESAI (Morales)

Mr. Shortz has clued ESAI each time as Esai Morales, the actor known for his co-starring roles in 1987's "La Bamba" and "NYPD Blue" (2001-4). In more recent years, Mr. Morales appeared on HBO's "The Brink" (2015) as well as the first season of "Ozark" in 2017.
Mr. Morales was a founding member of the National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts, with actors Jimmy Smits, Sonia Braga and Merel Julia.
Possible clues: "Morales of film," "Actor Morales," "Morales of 'NYPD Blue'," "Morales of 'La Bamba'," "Morales of 'Criminal Minds'," "Morales of HBO's 'The Brink'," "Tony's portrayer on 'NYPD Blue"'

Texto completo: BURNSVILLE – The 14th annual Carolina Mountains Literary Festival features New York Times bestselling author and WNC native Charles Frazier as its keynote speaker. The three-day festival, Sept. 5-7, brings 31 authors to downtown Burnsville.
Frazier gained recognition with his first novel, "Cold Mountain," which won the National Book Award in 1997 and was adapted into an Academy Award-winning film. He has released three additional novels; the latest, "Varina," came out in spring 2018. Frazier's address on Sept. 7 is a conversational format with participation from Elaine Neil Orr, a novelist and nonfiction writer.
For the banquet on Sept. 6, Andrew Lawler speaks on his latest book, "The Secret Token: Myth, Obsession, and the Search for the Lost Colony of Roanoke." Lawler explains how the 16th century tale of the missing Colonists remains relevant to Americans today.
The festival includes more than 50 events, such as readings, discussions, speeches, book signings and workshops, that take place at the library, town hall, town center, churches, restaurants and inns throughout town. All of the happenings tie to this year's theme, "On the Move: Stories of Migration, Immigration and Travel."
"Our country is becoming more and more mobile," says Kathy Weisfeld, festival chair. "People leave where they grew up, change jobs, come to our country and become citizens, so we thought it's an appropriate theme for these times. And the festival itself is getting people from a wider range of places; last year we had people from 63 different ZIP codes."
Events kick off the evening of Sept. 5 with a live puppet show by professional puppeteer Lisa Sturz. The adults-only performance is based on the life of Sturz's grandfather, a fourth-generation Jewish cantor who endured the European turmoil during the first half of the 20th century.
Asheville's Malaprop's Bookstore is the festival's official bookseller and sets up shop at Burnsville Town Center with titles by participating authors.
Many festival events are free and open to the public. Four workshops — poetry, nonfiction, science fiction and memoir — require registration and a $35 fee. Friday night's banquet, $35, and Saturday night's keynote, $25, also require registration.

FOUNDED DUQUESNE U.'S CENTER FOR TEACHING EXCELLENCE NOV. 1, 1938 - AUG. 25, 2019

Texto completo: The author of the widely used "Frayer Model" educational tool, a longtime administrator at Duquesne University and founder of its Center for Teaching Excellence, Dorothy Frayer was a renowned educational psychologist who never got tired of learning.
"I've found that over these years, I have learned as much as I did during my formal education, and that learning was highly energizing and interesting," Ms. Frayer said in a Duquesne publication when she retired in 2005 from her role as associate academic vice president.
But she was so much more.
"She was a woman who lived life very passionately and who saw beauty more intensely than other people," said her longtime friend and former colleague Laurel Willingham-McLain, who led the CTE at Duquesne from 1999 to 2005. "She survived four different types of cancer and experienced a lot of pain, but she had so much resilience."
Ms. Frayer, 80, died Sunday of unknown causes at the assisted living home she moved to last year in Charlottesville, Va.
Even as a young woman growing up in Detroit, Ms. Frayer was an overachiever who stood out.
In 1960, she graduated with a bachelor's degree in chemistry from Michigan State University, where she was one of only 10 students to be awarded a full scholarship.
"She was very intelligent," said Valerie Frayer, of Charlottesville, the wife of Ms. Frayer's nephew, Richard. "She used to do the New York Times crossword puzzle in pen."
Ms. Frayer went on to earn a master's degree in counseling from Michigan State in 1962 and a doctorate in educational psychology from the University of Wisconsin in 1969.
It was during her time at Wisconsin that Ms. Frayer developed what would later be dubbed the "Frayer Model," a graphic formula used in teaching word analysis and building vocabulary.
Her work is still relevant today, Ms. Willingham-McLain said.
"Just within the last year, I got a call about the Frayer Model," she said.
Ms. Frayer came to Duquesne in 1981 as dean of the School of Education, founded the CTE eight years later, and served as its first director.
Her work there was groundbreaking, said Ralph Pearson, retired university provost.
"She founded the Center for Teaching Excellence in 1989 because the faculty asked for it," he said. "She drew on her expertise in educational psychology to guide faculty in using learning practices that were known to be effective.
"Her legacy lives on as CTE celebrates its 30th anniversary. Over the years, hundreds of faculty and students have served as workshop panelists and peer mentors, honored annually at the event Dorothy started, the Celebration of Teaching Excellence."
Ms. Frayer, who was appointed academic vice president also in 1989, was more than just a colleague, Mr. Pearson said.
"Dorothy was my beloved mentor and friend," he said. "I have never met anyone with such a capacious mind, zest for learning, appreciation for beauty, and most of all, compassion for others."
Ms. Frayer was an early adopter of technology in the classroom and assisted faculty members in learning ways to integrate technology into various aspects of teaching, Ms. Willingham-McLain said.
"She was my professional mentor," Ms. Willingham-McLain said. "And she touched every classroom. Everybody's life at Duquesne was touched by her in some way."
Her advances in classroom technology were so innovative that an article written by Ms. Frayer in EDUCAUSE Journal was recognized in 1999 as "Contribution of the Year."
The award was given to her by Colin Powell, Ms. Willingham-McLain said.
"She was thrilled - she really loved that," she said.
Ms. Frayer was also a caring person who never forgot a birthday or holiday and who went the extra mile to let her loved ones know how she felt, they said.
"She was always a loving aunt to all of us," Valerie Frayer said. "And we always got wonderful birthday and Christmas cards."
"She was a nurturer; she would take care of your soul," said Ms. Willingham-McLain, who appreciated her friend so much that she sent Ms. Frayer Mother's Day cards, though she had no children. "She would write these really, really personal notes in her tiny handwriting in blue ink. She was also a fantastic storyteller."
When Ms. Frayer was battling several bouts of cancer, from 2003 to 2005, she didn't let her symptoms get the better of her.
"She hardly missed a beat at work," Ms. Willingham-McLain said. "She would intellectualize her pain and do research. It kind of ticked off the doctors at times. She was the most articulate patient. Her mantra was, 'What is, is.'"
Her laugh was infectious and legendary as well, Ms. Willingham-McLain said, including the day that Ms. Frayer was invited by the Pittsburgh Pirates to throw out the first pitch at a baseball game that was also a cancer research fundraiser. She declined and instead gave the honor to a colleague.
"I was there the day she got the call and she actually guffawed," her friend said, laughing. "We had a conference center next to our office and they told us we had to be quiet. But it was just so funny. I think it was the visualization of herself doing that just tickled her funny bone so much."
Ms. Frayer served as a board member for the Bach Choir of Pittsburgh and often attended symphony and ballet performances.
"She absolutely loved the arts," Ms. Willingham-McLain said. "Sunsets and ballets were her favorite. She just had an intense passion for the beauty of it. That was the way she was able to get through all the suffering she dealt with in life."
Along with her nieces and nephews, Ms. Frayer is survived by a brother, Donald, of Summerfield, Fla. She was preceded in death by another brother, William.
Visitation is at Heeney-Sundquist Funeral Home in Farmington, Mich., (1-248-474-5200) at 12:30 p.m. Wednesday, followed by a memorial service and interment at Oakland Hills Cemetery in Novi, Mich.
The family asks that memorial contributions be made to: Duquesne University, 600 Forbes Ave. Pittsburgh, Pa. 15282 with the memo: Center for Teaching Excellence Endowed Fund.

Bed bugs, tan suits, baked beans, and kombucha

Texto completo: JUST A SCRATCH
When New York Times columnist Bret Stephens woke up one morning from unsettling dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed to a monstrous vermin. Actually, that might be overstating things. Turns out some professor just made a funny on Twitter calling Stephens a bedbug (context: the Times has bedbugs) and the latter lost his mind over it and tried to get the poor guy fired by tattling to his provost. (I'm guessing he had to look up the definition of “tenure" shortly afterward.). Anyways, I still like Kafka's dystopia better.
TAUPE OFFICE
It was five whole years ago this week that American politics and democracy as we know it took a sharp turn into — the men's dressing room at Sears? Ahh yes, Obama's infamous Tan Suit. Twitter marveled at just how far we've come/plummeted since the days when glaringly and objectively unflattering menswear was not just uncommon in the Oval Office, but qualified as a genuine scandal. It all seems so quaint in the era of the spray tan and 10-foot necktie.
SPILL IT
Musician Jason Isbell is back on the meme charts once again with a follow-up to his 30-50 feral hog-ride to Twitter superstardom, this time asking people to name the worst thing they've ever spilled in their car. (His: “a full pint of baked beans.") Other epic oopses included bleach, squid juice, sauerkraut, worms, and a molten sex toy (hot trunk) that had to be “frantically" scraped out. For me, it'd have to be my crush on our school's offensive lineman during junior year. (I really thought we were vibing!) Then he spilled his Frosty. Huge mess.
BAD TASTE
And lastly this week, welcome to the international meme stage Kombucha Girl, a.k.a. Twitter @Brittany_broski, whose enthralling odyssey of facial expressions upon taking her first sips of some funky kombucha went viral on TikTok, instantly translating to the perfect visual expression of animated ambivalence and launching her to instant icon status (right up there with Baby Trying Soda For The First Time) — and also condemning herself to a foreseeable future of constantly having to pretend to be trying kombucha for the entertainment of strangers begging for selfies. The takeaway? I'm fine with my Snapple, thanks.

Texto completo: Now in its 14th year, the annual AfroPunk festival has become such a social and cultural mainstay, Brooklynites (and global devotees) instinctively know the arrival of the two-day music showcase signals the last hurrah of summer. A heady weekend of free expression (think attendees and performers alike in chiffon, mile, piercings, African textiles, natural hair, harnesses, cotton candy wigs-how the spirit moves you is all that matters) and the best avant-garde R&B, rap, rock, pop, punk and hardcore the Black diaspora nas to offer.
Past years have seen household-name luminaries such as Solange, Janelle Monae, and Lenny Kravitz take the stage. And while some performers were possibly more obscure, this year's set was no less stellar. The 2019 lineup offered an embarrassment of riches including New Jersey's own raucous and essential hard core act, H09909, bluesman Gary Clark Jr., the creative genius of singer and cellist Kelsey Lu and protean dancer/singer FKA twigs, soul powerhouses Jill Scott and Brittany Howard, jazz player Kamasi Washington, fun time crew Tank and the Bangas, rappers Tierra Whack, Danny Brown, Leikeli 47, Jungle Pussy, Chika and Rico Nasty, retro-soulster Leon Bridges, surprise appearances by Alicia Keys and Rapsody, and a host of other idiosyncratic virtuosos of various stripe.
AfroPunk spring boarded from James Spooner's eponymous uidie documentary film, chronicling Black misfits who found an unlikely home in the culture of punk and all it entails-moshing at shows, creating zines, scouring the rare record shop and, most important, enjoying the camaraderie of other social outliers. Since its inception the AfroPunk organization has exploded into an international entity, putting on festivals annually in Atlanta, Brooklyn, Johannesburg, Paris and London, and spearheading social activism with educational and social oriented talks, workshops and other initiatives.
With growth and success has come the inevitable criticism and controversy to be expected when a grassroots, free community concert in the park catering to Black nerds and punks blows up in relatively short order tc become a global happening, attracting corporate sponsors, celebrities, media hype and a sharp spike in entry fees.
In recent years, slide shows of the Black beauties that come to pose, promenade, and preen have become de rigueur for top tier, mainstream publications such as The New York Times, Elle, GQ, The New Yorker, Vogue, even People magazine. Now, we know Black art has and will always attract a diverse audience, and while festival founders Jocelyn Cooper and Matthew Morgan can revel with pride in the grand and unique spaceship they've built, such a microscope begs the existential question: what's the use in creating a forum for Black folk to twist freely on the grass in a state of utter freedom and outré creativity, only to end up right back under the white gaze, as per usual? These conflicting principles came to a seemingly unavoidable head in 2018, leading to controversy and bad press for the AfroPunk organization, when attendee Ebony Donnley alleged that they and their partner were kicked out of the festival because of Donnle/s handmade T-shirt that read "AfroPunk Sold Out for White Consumption." The incident went viral in the press and on social media, with countless others chiming in to express their disappointment in the incident, and dissatisfaction with how the festival has morphed over the years-a firestorm so big it culminated with the editorin-chief of the AfroPunk website stepping down in shared frustration. Punk ethos is epitomized by a brash, in-yourface, DIY creed, anathema to corporatization, red carpets and celebrity schmoozing. In fact, Dormleyb simple, handcrafted shirt was punk action personified-inexpensive, palpable and to the point And as with any worthy protest, it catalyzed a measure of change.
In 2019 AfroPunk adopted "#AfroPunkWeSeeYou," as its hashtag for photos and videos highlighting its gorgeously eccentric and eccentrically gorgeous supporters-its contrite way of saying, we get it, we messed up and we're striving to do better. It tacitly acknowledged that, without the kids who scrape together their dollars and pile into cars to road trip in from Atlanta and Chicago, or the elites jetting in from Lagos and London, AfroPunk could not/would not be what it is without the ordinary people who faithfully show up, in smiles and camaraderie, illustrating that year after year, thousands of Black folk can connect for mad fun and kinship, with nary a fist fight or gun drawn, and prove that despite its imperfections and the occasional family squabble, on the penultimate weekend of August at Brooklyn's Commodore Barry Park, AfroPunk is all fam, all love, where everyone is welcome.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- A top American diplomat said the United States would not prosecute or otherwise seek to punish President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela if he voluntarily left power, despite bringing his country to the verge of economic collapse and humanitarian disaster.
Elliott Abrams, the State Department's special envoy for Venezuela, said he had seen no indication that Mr. Maduro was willing to step down. But his offer of amnesty was a message to Mr. Maduro after both countries' leaders described high-level talks that Mr. Abrams unequivocally said did not happen.
"This is not a persecution," Mr. Abrams said of Mr. Maduro on Tuesday evening in an interview. "We're not after him. We want him to have a dignified exit and go."
He added: "We don't want to prosecute you; we don't want to persecute you. We want you to leave power."
The Treasury Department last year accused Mr. Maduro of profiting from illegal drug trafficking in Venezuela but did not recommend charges.
The softer, if pragmatic, appeal sharply contrasted with the eight months of sanctions, international isolation and threats by the Trump administration of military intervention against Mr. Maduro and his loyalists, who are accused of hoarding power and manipulating elections last year.
Opposition leaders in Venezuela have not offered immunity to Mr. Maduro, whom they accuse of prospering in a corrupt government that has left many Venezuelans without food, electricity or medical supplies.
In the interview, Mr. Abrams sought to clarify widespread confusion over the Trump administration's efforts to force Mr. Maduro from his presidency.
Last week, asked about news reports of secret talks between Washington and Caracas, Mr. Trump said the White House was in touch with Mr. Maduro's government, "at a very high level."
Hours later, Mr. Maduro confirmed that he had directly authorized his officials to engage in secret meetings with the Trump administration. "Sure, there's been contact and we'll continue having contact," he said in a national broadcast.
On Tuesday, Mr. Abrams said that was not true.
"The notion that we are negotiating is just flat-out wrong," Mr. Abrams said. "And the notion that there is a pattern of communication is wrong. There are intermittent messages and I think people would find the very occasional message sent from Washington to be completely predictable: 'You need to return to democracy. Maduro needs to leave power."'
The comments are likely to soothe Venezuela's opposition leaders, who have privately said Mr. Trump's statement risked sidelining their own negotiations. A delegation headed by the opposition's chief political negotiator, Stalin González, traveled to Washington last week to press American officials on the Trump administration's policy in Venezuela.
Mr. Abrams said he did not currently see any value in talking directly to Mr. Maduro's government.
He said messages to Washington from intermediaries in Venezuela have been "pretty rare" since last winter, and the information they carried was dubious. Some may have been sent with Mr. Maduro's knowledge while others were probably not.
All carried the same general message: that Mr. Maduro would continue to resist the international pressure campaign that is led by the Trump administration.
Messages that the United States sends to Mr. Maduro are usually delivered through media statements, on Twitter and in some cases, through European diplomats or religious leaders. Beyond reiterating the Trump administration's demands that Mr. Maduro step down, those intermediaries have also raised the plight of at least five Americans who are being held in Venezuela, relaying concerns about their health or conditions of their detentions.
Any direct contact between Washington and Mr. Maduro would risk sidelining parallel negotiations -- that are mediated by Norway and held in the Caribbean island of Barbados -- between the Venezuelan government and opposition officials led by Juan Guaidó, whom the United States views as Venezuela's rightful president.
Those negotiations allow Mr. Maduro to claim he is seeking a peaceful resolution of the crisis and have helped stave off tougher European sanctions. The talks also are the opposition's best chance to unseat Mr. Maduro after months of diminishing mass rallies and failed attempts to split his government.
The Barbados negotiations began gaining traction in July, after Mr. Maduro offered the opposition new presidential elections in return for the lifting of American sanctions. But he suspended the talks in protest of new American sanctions issued Aug. 5 that blocked all Venezuelan public assets in the United States.
The sanctions, which surprised both Mr. Maduro and opposition leaders, also threaten economic penalties against any foreign company doing business with the Venezuelan government. Mr. Abrams maintained on Tuesday that the United States would not lift sanctions against Venezuela unless Mr. Maduro steps down.
Officials close to both sides of the Venezuelan negotiations said the talks could resume in Barbados as soon as next week, although no date has been set. They discussed sensitive topics on the condition of anonymity.
"The more the United States gets involved in Venezuela, the more problems it creates for the negotiation process," said Temir Porras, a former chief of staff to Mr. Maduro who now works as a political consultant in Caracas. "The United States pursues a policy that has a lot of influence on Venezuela's future, but it's unable to resolve the crisis. It can only be resolved by Venezuelans."
Mr. Abrams said the Trump administration would not support new national elections with an incumbent -- either Mr. Maduro or Mr. Guaidó -- on the ballot. If either man wanted to run for the presidency, Mr. Abrams said, he should first leave office to prevent concerns about election tampering by the government.
And he predicted that Mr. Guaidó would formally close the negotiations by Oct. 1 to prevent them from dragging on without resolution.
"It's pretty clear that he has not yet reached the conclusion that it is hopeless," Mr. Abrams said, adding: "He may reach that conclusion tomorrow."
Last winter, the opposition-controlled Parliament in Caracas considered -- but then abandoned -- a vaguely worded amnesty proposal that sought to convince military officers to leave Mr. Maduro's ranks. Even before it was dropped, opposition officials insisted it would not allow Mr. Maduro or his close advisers to escape criminal charges, nor would it give cover to government loyalists accused of human rights abuses.
The International Criminal Court in The Hague is investigating claims of abuse by Venezuelan security forces beginning in 2014, during Mr. Maduro's first term in office. The United States is not a party to the international court.
Any offer of amnesty by the United States would have limits. A White House official has previously told The New York Times that the Trump administration would be unable to remove any federal drugs charges that several of Mr. Maduro's top confidants and relatives face.
And Mr. Abrams would not comment when asked whether the United States would stop Mr. Maduro from keeping any wealth or other assets were he to step down or leave Venezuela in exile.
Diego Moya-Ocampos, a political risk analyst at IHS Markit in London, said any offer of amnesty to Mr. Maduro would also need to be extended to all top Venezuelan officials and military officers to be successful.
But it would still be a significant step forward to breaking the political impasse in Venezuela, Mr. Moya-Ocampos said. "It could even be a game changer," he said.

Gillibrand quits presidential campaign, saying she knows it's not her time

Texto completo: Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), who struggled to gain traction in a crowded field, ended her presidential run Wednesday, a further winnowing of the Democrats hoping to take on President Trump in 2020.
Gillibrand's decision comes after news that she'd fallen short of meeting the requirements for the September Democratic primary debate.
In the past two weeks, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper and Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts left the race. Twenty Democrats remain, and only half will be on the debate stage.
Gillibrand, 52, announced her departure in a two-minute video that is mostly a montage of her time on the campaign trail. In the video, the senator says she will focus her energy on uniting Democrats to defeat Trump.
"It's important to know when it's not your time," she says in the video.
Despite her early entry into the race with an exploratory committee in January, Gillibrand could never break 1 or 2 percent in national polls. As one of four female senators in the race, she needed a standout moment that never came.
"My friend @SenGillibrand is a brave voice on some of the most critical issues facing our country today - from childcare to sexual assault. She is a champion and I know she's not done fighting for women and families everywhere," tweeted Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), a presidential hopeful.
Gillibrand branded herself "the best candidate for women" and hoped her record on women's rights would resonate with female voters. She has long been an advocate for victims of sexual misconduct, even when it put her at odds with her own party.
In 2017, Gillibrand was the first Democratic senator to call for the resignation of former senator Al Franken of Minnesota over allegations that he behaved inappropriately with women. She shocked and angered some in the Democratic base the same year when she said in an interview with the New York Times that former president Bill Clinton should have resigned over his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
Gillibrand replaced Hillary Clinton in the Senate in 2009 when Clinton became President Barack Obama's secretary of state. Gillibrand had been close to the Clintons, and some saw her comments as a betrayal.
The senator also may have struggled to amass donors and voter support in an increasingly liberal Democratic Party because of the conservative positions she held on guns and immigration earlier in her political career.
Gillibrand raised $2.3 million in the second quarter of 2019. She had $8.2 million, but most of that was transferred from her Senate campaign account.
Gillibrand came to Washington via the House in 2006 to represent a district in Upstate New York.
Though Gillibrand focused most of her campaign message on Trump, she did go after former vice president Joe Biden directly during the second debate, hitting him for a 1981 opinion piece he wrote that she said degraded working mothers.
"You said women working outside of the home would lead to the deterioration of family," Gillibrand said. "My grandmother worked outside the home. My mother worked outside the home."
When Biden was asked by reporters about Gillibrand's departure from the race, he offered only praise.
"She's smart as hell and she had a lot to contribute. It's hard. It's hard when you have so many people in the race," Biden said after a speech in South Carolina. "She's - she's a caliber person and I hope that means she's going to stay deeply involved in what she's doing, because if I'm lucky enough to be one of the people that gets elected - if I'm the person that's elected - I would go to her for help."
Trump reacted to the news with sarcasm.
"A sad day for the Democrats, Kirsten Gillibrand has dropped out of the Presidential Primary," Trump tweeted. "I'm glad they never found out that she was the one I was really afraid of!"
Gillibrand just won reelection to the Senate in 2018, so she will not have to run again until 2024 - when there will be another presidential contest.

Firesteed
Pinot Gris, 2018
Willamette Valley, Oregon
$15.99/$10.99
13.5% alcohol by volume
Firesteed Pinot Gris is full of melon and citrus flavors that make it an excellent choice for sipping on cooler summer and fall evenings or to accompany grilled vegetables, lobster or other seafood.
This dry, crisp white wine is made from a grape that The New York Times wine writer Eric Asimov described as having an identity crisis because of its many aliases. Although it has many names in different parts of the world — Tokay in Alsace, Malvoisie in parts of Switzerland, for example — it’s the same grape as the Italian Pinot Grigio. The only difference in the Oregon grape is that winemakers in the Willamette Valley have agreed to call it by its French name, which makes sense, since the dominant style of the region’s Pinot Gris is Burgundian. And if you were wondering about the variety’s heritage, it’s a mutation of Pinot Noir, the grape that made Oregon famous.
Although the grape is the same, the wines made from Pinot Gris vary dramatically across the globe, primarily because of the growing conditions and the styles used by the winemakers.
The Oregon Pinot Gris wines that I’ve tried are light and refreshing and most often priced between $10 and $15, sometimes less. They are remarkable wines for the price.
Firesteed is no exception, and often I find it on sale for around $10.
The Firesteed brand was started in 1992 by Howard Rossbach, a Seattle resident with a degree in bio-sciences who has a love of wine, according to a 2004 article in The Seattle Times.
Rossbach started on the retail side, working in a premium wine shop in the early 1970s, then for a distributor and finally in 1985 starting his own distributing business, Vintage Northwest, with an impressive portfolio of clients that included Hogue Cellars, Erath and Panther Creek, among others.
At the time, Oregon Pinot Noir was broadly considered some of the best in the world, but it also was expensive. As he traveled around the country selling wine, Rossbach heard from customers who wondered why there wasn’t a good Oregon Pinot Noir that sold for less than $10.
He took the idea of making an affordable, soft, fruity Pinot Noir back to his winery clients. They weren’t interested, so in 1992 he started Firesteed and produced an award-winning Pinot Noir that sold for less than $10. The wine was made under Rossbach’s direction by Flynn Vineyards with Willamette Valley grapes. Since its inception, Firesteed has grown at a rapid rate — it’s now in all 50 states, in some international markets and is one of the largest wineries in Oregon.
Rossbach added the Pinot Gris in 1999 and a high-end Pinot Noir in 2000 — $70-a-bottle Citation, a brand named after the 1948 Triple Crown winner. In 2002, Rossbach bought the Flynn winery and vineyards in Rickreall, Ore.
Three years ago, Rossbach sold Firesteed’s winery and surrounding vineyards to Pacific Rim Winemakers, a division of Banfi Wines, and the brand and its inventory to Vintage Wine Estates, a privately held company. Rossbach held on to the Citation brand and 200 acres of vineyard. The Citation Pinot Noir is unusual because it is aged for 10 years before it’s released.
By arrangement, Firesteed is still produced at the Rickreall winery from grapes grown in the Willamette Valley. Sales are above 50,000 cases.
When asked about the sale, Rossbach said that he was looking forward to being a small producer of excellent wines.
“The future … is that there will be a few folks that are big, but then you will have a great many more that are smaller. But those that are smaller have it incumbent upon themselves to be excellent. Good is not good enough because Oregon, as an industry, has been recognized as a world-class producer.”
It wasn’t too many years ago that inexpensive Oregon Pinot Noir was awful and the state’s Pinot Gris was hard to find. Now, thanks to Rossbach, that’s not the case.
To show my appreciation, I’ll keep drinking Firesteed and other inexpensive Oregon wines. And I’m saving my pennies to buy a bottle of Citation. The 2009 vintage should be coming out about now.
Suggestions of wines in the $10 range are always appreciated. Warren Johnston can be reached at raiseyourglassofwine@gmail.com. For past recommendations, go to raiseyourglassofwine.com.

Texto completo: STAMFORD — Amid reports of a prospective multibillion-dollar settlement offer made by Purdue Pharma that could involve an ownership change, company officials are staying quiet about their strategy — heightening the uncertainty about the future of the controversial OxyContin maker.
Purdue has purportedly offered to settle, for $10 billion to $12 billion, some 2,000 lawsuits alleging it has fueled the opioid crisis with fraudulent OxyContin marketing. Such a plan could entail a bankruptcy filing and Sackler family members relinquishing control of the company, but garnering the requisite support for an agreement from the proliferation of plaintiffs represents a complex undertaking for a business already undergoing major changes.
“Nearly all the claimants would have to be on board with the terms of the settlement,” Eric Snyder, chairman of the bankruptcy department at Manhattan-based law firm Wilk Auslander, said in an interview Wednesday. “The Sacklers aren’t going to give billions of dollars of their money and walk away from the company they built unless they know they’re getting a complete release from pending and future claims.”
Purdue officials have declined to comment about their plans beyond a statement issued Tuesday in which they said that “Purdue believes a constructive global resolution (of the lawsuits) is the best path forward, and the company is actively working with the state attorneys general and other plaintiffs to achieve this outcome.”
Messages left for a spokesperson for the Sacklers were not returned.

Company overhaul?
Most of the settlement funds would originate from a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing — an option already explored by Purdue — that would restructure Purdue from a private company into a “public beneficiary trust,” according to The New York Times.
The arrangement would allow profits from all drug sales, including those for OxyContin, to benefit the plaintiffs.
Profits from the trust and donations of under-development Purdue drugs to treat addiction would be worth an estimated total of $7 billion to $8 billion.
At the same time, the Sacklers would make a $3 billion cash payout and contribute an additional $1.5 billion from the proceeds of the prospective sale of their international prescription-drug enterprise Mundipharma, The Times said.
The potential agreement apparently would cover all of the pending litigation against Purdue, but its scope has not been confirmed.
“Purdue and the Sacklers should be out of the opioid business entirely,” Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said Wednesday. “Purdue and defendant members of the Sackler family knew people were dying and continued to push opioids in blind pursuit of profit. They must be held accountable for their depraved indifference to human suffering. Purdue illegally transferred hundreds of millions of dollars to the Sacklers and should not be allowed to cry poverty and shirk responsibility now.”
Tong’s office said Tuesday that he was in Cleveland last week, but it has declined to comment on whether he attended an Aug. 20 meeting in the northeast Ohio city that reportedly included Purdue lawyers and 10 state attorneys general.
If a comprehensive settlement is not reached within the next two months, the first of the MDL trials would start Oct. 21. No trials have been scheduled yet for state complaints such as Connecticut’s litigation.
“If there is a settlement, it would need to give the Sacklers finality,” Snyder said. “But it would be massive, and there would be a lot of details to work out to make sure everyone was covered.”
On Monday, an Oklahoma judge found that pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries contributed to the state’s epidemic of opioid abuse and ordered them to pay $572 million to help tackle the public health emergency.
Purdue reached a $270 million settlement with Oklahoma in March.
Many changes
While the Sacklers retain ownership of Purdue, all of them have left the company’s board in the past two years.
In addition to the lawsuits, they face increasing grassroots outrage that has prompted many of their philanthropic recipients to distance themselves in recent months.
Today, the company is increasingly focusing on non-opioid medications, as OxyContin sales steadily decline.
About a month ago, the company launched a drug to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, while it also developing cancer treatments and a medicine to counter opioid overdoses. The company said it would not profit from the latter drug.
Last year, the company stopped marketing its opioids and disbanded its sales force, changes that resulted in hundreds of layoffs.
At the same time, the company is also planning to close a manufacturing facility in North Carolina by the end of the year.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump is eager to build 500 miles of border fencing before the 2020 election and has urged his aides to fast-track construction contracts, seize private land and disregard environmental rules, anonymous sources involved in the project told The Washington Post.
Work with Trump on border crisis
By David Kustoff
A few weeks ago, I traveled to El Paso, Texas, to see for myself the humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border. I visited the El Paso Del Norte Port of Entry, took a helicopter tour of the southern border, spoke with and was briefed by Customs and Border Protection, visited the El Paso Intelligence Center, and met with Tennessee troops from the 1st Armored Division stationed at Fort Bliss.
After my time on the border, I am more convinced than ever that our system is completely overwhelmed. The number of people leaving their homes to come to the United States is truly staggering.
Despite what some say, I saw for myself that we have a true crisis at hand. Our system was not built to handle this massive influx of migrants coming into our country.
A win for Trump loyalists?: Joe Arpaio's decision to run for sheriff is a disaster for Republicans: Today's talker
Unfortunately, some in Congress refuse to work with President Trump to address the situation at hand. Instead, they want to focus on decriminalizing our border, something that would put the safety of the American people at risk and increase the burden on our hardworking border agents.
Do not get me wrong, America was built by immigrants. These people fled their countries to pursue the great American dream.
It was risky and treacherous, but ultimately worth the sacrifice for a better life.
These people are the very backbone of our great nation, and they came to the United States through legal means of immigration.
It is important our immigration process protects American citizens as well as those who immigrated lawfully to the United States. It is increasingly concerning that to protect one’s own country is now viewed as discriminatory. The definition of a state includes that of a defined border.
There is a quote, originally by John Locke, carved into the side of the Department of Justice building that reads “Where law ends, tyranny begins. ”
We need an unapologetic Congress that is unafraid to follow its own laws. We also need a Congress willing to address the crisis on our southern border and ensure the safety and well-being of its constituents.
Unfortunately, Democrats in Congress decry the conditions at our border facilities, yet many refuse to allocate more funding to address the issue. Some even proudly advocate for open borders and want to abolish all forms of immigration enforcement.
Not only would it mean more drugs flowing into our communities, but there also would be no one to remove gang members, sex offenders and drug dealers who crossed the border illegally. It would also allow the hundreds of thousands of foreign nationals who illegally overstay their visas to remain in the United States.
I have helped work out many agreements in my time in public service, but you can’t negotiate when the other party won’t come to the table.
I believe Congress has a responsibility to every American citizen as well as those people who followed our laws and came to America legally.
In September, when Congress is back in session, I hope my colleagues across the aisle can work with me in good faith to enact a real, lasting strategy that will secure our border for good.

What others are saying
Greg Sargent, The Washington Post: "The border wall that President Trump has long dreamed of building has become a symbol of many things about his presidency: his megalomania; his demagoguery about desperate migrants; his contempt for empirical, reality-based governing; his prioritizing of the base’s prejudices and fantasies above all else. Soon enough, Trump’s wall might become an overarching symbol of his presidency’s seemingly bottomless corruption, too. . . . Trump is pressuring a government agency to give a contract for his wall to a company whose chief executive is a donor to one of his top GOP allies in Congress. . . . The fact that he’s pressuring an agency to grant this contract shows he’s trying to hook up a politically connected crony while also perverting the governing process to stick to a political timetable — all to give his crowds something to chant about at his reelection rallies. "
Jim Geraghty, National Review: "In some circles, this (Washington Post report) is a critical article about the president. I suspect that Trump 2020 is tempted to send it out as a press release. Theory: The voters who care the most about 'building the wall' will be reassured by Trump’s declarations that he is building the wall and will take him at his word that he will finish the wall in his second term. The Ann Coulters and Mark Krikorians of the world, who pay attention to the details of policy and what’s actually been done, are relatively rare. Separately, how should we count replacing fencing that is dilapidated? No, that’s not new fencing or border barriers. But it’s putting up a barrier that is either impassable or much more difficult to overcome, where previously people could climb, sneak through, or otherwise penetrate. "
The New York Times, editorial: "As the Department of Homeland Security is compelled to expend ever more resources on the border mess, other basic elements of protecting the country risk getting lost, such as dealing with national emergencies — on top of the nearly $10 million that the administration diverted from the Federal Emergency Management Agency last year to fund detention and removal operations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, it plans to pull another $155 million specifically from the agency’s disaster relief fund this year. . . . Every president brings into office a particular set of principles and priorities. But when those biases start undercutting the government’s ability to pursue smart policies — or even carry out basic duties, a responsible leader must think less about his personal prerogatives and more about the nation’s overall security. "
What our readers are saying
You'd have to be some sicko individual to support how this administration hurts, punishes and neglects children trying to enter the country legally. These people call themselves Christians.
— Hue Hendricks
Thanks to Democrats' open-border, open-arm stances, we are becoming the destination country for every poor, uneducated and ill migrant. We need to start charging these (migrant) parents with child endangerment.
— Lanie Williams
Americans need to wake and see what is really going on at the border. . . . This is the 21st century; there's something called human rights regardless of immigration status.
— Georgiana Hall
Democrat-run cities such as San Francisco and Los Angeles have lost law and order under liberal extremist leadership. . . . Sanctuary cities are sanctuaries for criminals, which leaves law-abiding citizens left with the burden of a failed government. Enough is enough.

Mass. health care professionals told to look out for cases of severe lung illness associated with vaping

Texto completo: Massachusetts officials are instructing health care professionals to look out for respiratory illnesses that might be related to vaping, after nearly 200 cases of mysterious lung illnesses have surfaced across the country.
The Massachusetts Department of Public Health notified some 25,000 doctors, nurses, and physician assistants Tuesday to watch for respiratory illnesses in patients who said they use e-cigarettes or vaporizers of any kind — and report those cases to the state. Patients with the unexplained illnesses have said they have chest pain, difficulty breathing, vomiting, and fatigue. Some cases have been more serious and can involve permanent lung damage.
The department also attached information from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has been tracking the illnesses. It's unclear whether the issues are coming from marijuana products, traditional e-cigarettes, or a contaminated product being sold on the illicit market.
“Even though cases appear similar, it is not clear if these cases have a common cause or if they are different diseases with similar presentations," the CDC wrote in a notice. The State Departments of Health are investigating the possible cause of the illness by testing patient specimens and e-cigarette products. State-specific epidemiologic investigations are ongoing."
As of Thursday, the CDC has received reports of more than 193 potential cases of severe lung illnesses in 22 states, including Connecticut and New York. One person in Illinois has died from respiratory problems.
All the cases were reported between June 28 and Aug. 20.
Ann Scales, a spokeswoman for the state's Department of Public Health, said no cases have been reported in Massachusetts yet, and hospitals aren't required to report such incidents.
The agency is using an “electronic syndromic surveillance system," Scales said, which will be used to track and identify cases of respiratory illnesses that could be linked to vaping. All emergency rooms in Massachusetts have access to the system, according to DPH.
Some states are taking additional action to investigate the illnesses and try to prevent more from occurring. The Wisconsin and Illinois departments of health have asked the CDC to assist them in investigating the incidents, and the New Mexico Department of Health is recommending that people stop using vape cartridges with marijuana as a main ingredient.

De Blasio Gives Up on Educating Poor Kids

Texto completo: To say that many liberal elites have all but given up on educating low-income minorities might seem like an overstatement. But when you consider the state of public education in our inner cities, and the priorities of those in charge, it's hard to draw any other conclusion.
After Labor Day, New York City's 1.1 million public school students will return to the classroom. The majority of them can't do basic reading or math, according to state standardized test results released last week. And the numbers get even more depressing when broken down by race and ethnicity. Black and Hispanic students make up 67% of the system, while whites and Asians are about 15% and 16%, respectively. Only 28% of black students passed the math exam, versus 33% of Hispanics, 67% of whites and 74% of Asians. On the English exam, the passage rates were 68% for Asians, 67% for whites, 37% for Hispanics and 35% for blacks.
Sadly, these racial gaps in academic achievement have persisted for decades, and they are a main source of racial inequality in America. Want to help someone avoid poverty or addiction or incarceration? An education goes a long way. The irony is that the same social-justice advocates who obsess over inequality also spurn reforms, such as public charter schools, that help close black-white differences in learning. "City charter schools, now teaching roughly 10% of the city's student population, markedly outperformed traditional public schools again" on the state tests, reported the New York Post. Fifty-seven percent of charter-school test takers passed the state English exam, and 63% passed the math portion.
Moreover, the highest scores in the state, for the third year in a row, came from Success Academy, a New York City-based charter-school network, where the passage rates for math and English were an astounding 99% and 90%, respectively. Even more impressive is that these charter students are mostly low-income blacks and Hispanics, not middle-class Asians and whites.
If the primary goal were student achievement, Democratic politicians like New York Mayor Bill de Blasio would allow these successful school models to proliferate. But the mayor is far more interested in placating his political benefactors, the powerful teachers unions, which oppose charter schools because they don't control them. To the National Education Association, the American Federation of Teachers and their thousands of state and local affiliates, public education is more about jobs than about kids. Reforms that marginalize or circumvent union members are rejected, regardless of whether they benefit students. Mr. de Blasio may identify as a progressive champion of the underprivileged, but that's lip service. The reality is that he's blocking the surest path to the middle class for the city's poor by relegating them to inferior schools.
Opponents of school reform insist that a lack of funding is a major problem, but education spending has increased for decades without significant improvements in outcomes. Per pupil spending in places like Baltimore and Washington is among the highest in the nation, but you'd never know that based on test scores. In New York's poorer neighborhoods, school spending is significantly higher than the citywide average, which in turn is well above the national average.
The claim that racism explains the learning gap also can't withstand scrutiny, but that hasn't stopped liberals from making school desegregation a priority. In fact, some of the best public schools in the country are high-performing charter schools with large percentages of black and brown students. That doesn't mean segregated schools are desirable or that they lead to academic success, but at the very least it does suggest that black children don't need white classmates before they can learn how to multiply fractions or diagram sentences.
Nevertheless, the left's ideological obsession with racial balance in the classroom continues. Mr. de Blasio is currently preoccupied with trying to phase out gifted-and-talented programs because they are populated with too many white and Asian students. This is an extension of his beef with the city's elite public high schools, which admit kids based on a standardized exam. It's worth noting that even the New York Times has questioned the mayor's reasoning and the possible fallout. "He risks alienating tens of thousands of mostly white and Asian families whose children are enrolled in the gifted programs and selective schools," the paper wrote this week. "If a substantial number of those families leave the system, it would be even more difficult to achieve integration."
You'd think that the main objective of the inequality-obsessed would be to help more minorities meet high academic standards, but Mr. de Blasio and his fellow progressives would rather eliminate the standards altogether. I'd call that giving up on minority kids. What would you call it?

Texto completo: Elizabeth Warren offered some blunt advice to women in a financial self-help book she wrote with her daughter in 2003: Don’t have children and, if you divorce, re-marry as soon as possible.
The senator for Massachusetts and Democratic 2020 presidential candidate, 70, and Amelia Warren Tyagi, 47, shared their recommendations in The Two Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Parents Are (Still) Going Broke. In its pages, the pair teamed up to lay out their case for how double-income couples started “a bidding war” in the middle class that raised the cost of living, so that working families had to commit both their salaries to, for example, paying off a mortgage on a house in a good school district rather than saving for a rainy day.
The book, based on the White House hopeful’s extensive bankruptcy research and her businesswoman daughter’s management consulting experience, cited data that indicated having a child is "the single best predictor that a woman will end up in financial collapse," with a divorced mother being almost "three times more likely to file for bankruptcy than her single friend who never had children."
“Some women have found another way to avoid the Two-Income Trap. It doesn’t involve loading up on insurance policies or conducting a financial fire drill; nor does it require you to keep a spouse at home full-time. And unlike the other solutions we have presented, it is cost-free and highly effective. Their solution? Don’t have children,” they wrote.
While acknowledging childlessness may not be a calculated decision, they touted its lifelong benefits, including how it ratchets up the likelihood of "a comfortable retirement."
“A few generations ago, advising women not to have children would have seemed ridiculous,” they wrote, alluding to the suggestion's defiance of social norms and the argument children are “economic assets.” “Children are still economic assets. Today’s children will build the economy of tomorrow, defend the nation in future wars, care for the sick, construct new buildings, repair the roads, and support the next generation of elderly through Social Security.
"But there is a key difference: These benefits will go to society at large, not to specific parents."
Although it would run counter to financial interests, they added: “If you feel called to be a parent, we hope you will follow your heart. Yes, you may lose your home, and you may go bankrupt. We hope the jobs will outweigh the financial pain. And besides, what other advice would you expect from two working mothers who believe in the great American middle class and who pray for its strong future.”
Warren, at the time a Harvard Law School professor and years away from seeking elected office, and Warren Tyagi, also dedicated a chapter to divorced mothers. They asserted that despite receiving better educations, better job training, better legal support, and better paychecks, the demographic was less financially secure than it was 25 years prior because it’s become more difficult “to compete in a two-income world.”
“Some women take an alternate path to survive the economic blows raining down on their families: They remarry,” they wrote. “Sure, we know that marriage — even second marriage — is supposed to be about chemistry and companionship, but getting a foreclosure notice can make anyone rethink what she really needs from a relationship. Even now, a generation after the Women’s Revolution, the surest way for a woman to regain her financial footing after a divorce is to find a husband — and to do it quickly.” “In a world of economic hurt, even a guy with half a job looks good,” they continued.
Warren is herself divorced. She married her first husband, Jim Warren, in 1968. They had two children, Tyagi and Alexander Warren, 43, and split up a decade later. He died in 2003. Warren began dating her current husband, Bruce Mann, before she was divorced and married him six months after the end of her first marriage. She is now a grandmother of three.
Her interest in bankruptcy law as a Harvard Law School professor led to her being added to the National Bankruptcy Review Commission in 1995. The Wall Street critic would go on to assess the federal bank bailout as chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel from 2008 and later became pivotal to the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2010 before entering politics.
Mother and daughter followed up The Two Income Trap with All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan in 2005, a New York Times bestseller.

A DIFFERENT KIND OF 'RIGHT WING' DAVID KOCH WAS CONSERVATIVE PRECISELY BECAUSE HE CARED ABOUT HIGH CULTURE, NOT IN SPITE OF IT

Texto completo: The late David Koch put his name on a few things and his money behind a great many, prominent among them the theater in which the New York City Ballet performs. The facility had become run down, and Koch put up $100 million for renovations and ongoing maintenance. That is one of the neat things you can do when you are a billionaire.
An "infamous right-wing billionaire," LA Weekly called him. In announcing Koch's death on Friday, The New York Times described him as a funder of the "right-wing libertarian movement."
Is there a "right-wing libertarian movement"? And was David Koch emblematic of it?
Koch was for many years a trustee of Reason magazine and a benefactor of the kind of politics associated with it. I am not at all sure that if the term "right-wing" today means anything at all, it means something that includes former Reason editor Nick Gillespie or current Reason editor Katherine Mangu-Ward.
Koch himself was a supporter of gay rights, abortion rights, drug legalization and much else that does not fit very comfortably on the current "right wing" agenda.
But the part of Koch's career in public life that may be most offensive to the contemporary incarnation of the "right wing" isn't the drugs or the abortion or the gay rights, or anything else on the current policy agenda.
It's the ballet.
Is there anything more "elitist" than ballet?
Koch, born in 1940, came from an era in which conservatives had not abandoned the cities, their institutions, and their culture, had not declared Lincoln Center and all of Manhattan - and California and Chicago and Wall Street and the Ivy League - enemy territory. He was part of a conservative movement founded by William F. Buckley Jr. (born 1925) and adorned by such men as art critic Hilton Kramer (born 1928), who co-founded The New Criterion with Samuel Lipman, a celebrated pianist and trenchant critic of the National Endowment for the Arts and the politically driven vulgarization of all it touched. These were urban men, members of the hated "elite," and even in many cases part of the "establishment." Some of them were known to frequent Bohemian Grove.
Because I write for National Review, I sometimes receive accusations of "elitism," as though "elitist" were a disqualifying epithet, and as though "elitism" consisted of knowing which fork to use and making a terribly big deal of it.
Buckley could be a scouring critic of elites failing at their natural responsibilities - his public career began with a book-length assault on the failures of Yale, and he had a famously low opinion of the collective political wisdom of the Harvard faculty - but he also despised the supposed "authority of political truths arrived at yesterday at the voting booth." I cannot imagine that it ever would have occurred to him that there was something more authentically American - or more conservative - about raising hogs in Arkansas than about dancing in the New York City Ballet.
Before he linked up with Team Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas sneered at the future president as an embodiment of "New York values." Ted Cruz of Princeton and Harvard, clerk to a chief justice of the Supreme Court, husband to a muckety-muck at Goldman Sachs, resident of the nation's fourth-largest city, for some reason felt the need to turn up his nose at "New York values," meaning urban values, some of which - for instance, the ones on display from time to time at the David H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center - are the envy of the world.
Republicans love Texas - except for Austin, Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and other cities, where they habitually lose almost every office they stand for. In many cases, Texas' values are not really so dissimilar from New York's. The New York Philharmonic currently is conducted by Jaap van Zweden, who is from Amsterdam and now divides his time between conducting in New York and conducting in Hong Kong. His job before that? Conducting in Dallas.
Imagine being brought up on an intellectual diet of right-wing talk radio and then taking your first trip to Europe, having been taught for your entire life that France is a moldering socialist pigsty. And then you get to Paris, and it's - Paris, rather than "Hotel Rwanda" or even "The Elementary Particles."
Or consider Los Angeles, for that matter: A lot of the places in the United States you're supposed to hate if you're a good conservative turn out to be pretty nice in a lot of ways, too. There are a lot of young, smart, ambitious people moving to those left-wing hellholes, for some reason. They aren't going to New York for the weather, and they aren't going to California for the low taxes and reasonable cost of living.
But imagine being able to combine what people like about New York and California with low taxes and a reasonable cost of living. You want a winning political agenda - there it is.
Conservatives are not going to win urban-minded culturally curious people over to our way of looking at the world by telling them that they want all the wrong things for themselves, that anything of apparent value they find in New York, California, Chicago, Boston, Austin, etc., is only fools' gold. I am writing this from Beverly Hills (oh, the rigors of book publicity), which doesn't entirely represent the sort of life I'd want for myself or my family, but who could say there isn't anything to like about it?
Beverly Hills is as much a part of the real America as Muleshoe, Texas - and there is no future in trying to build a political coalition that makes a loyalty test of preferring the latter to the former. If conservatives are going to write off the parts of the country where the people and the money are, and where the growth is, we are going to lose. We are ceding that ground in small ways and in big ways.
David Koch, "right-wing billionaire," put $100 million into the New York ballet. Ain't much on God's green Earth more elitist than that, and, if there is, you'd have to go to Gstaad to find it. Imagine all of the freeze-dried apocalypse dinners he could have bought! Imagine the mountains of Scotts Turf Builder!
There was a time when some conservatives were conservatives because they cared about high culture, not in spite of it. David Koch was one of them. We could use a few more of his kind.

Four face charges in deaths of 12 Florida nursing home patients following Hurricane Irma

Texto completo: Two years after Hurricane Irma slammed through South Florida, killing scores of people and knocking out power to three-quarters of the state, four nursing home workers are facing aggravated manslaughter and other charges in the deaths of 12 residents felled by the searing heat the storm left behind.
Arrest warrants were issued Monday for three nurses and an administrator at the since-shuttered Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills, about 20 miles north of Miami.
Operators of the center failed to evacuate for three days despite a lack of air conditioning that caused temperatures in the building to soar, authorities say.
"I'm glad these individuals are being held accountable after their inexplicable failure to call 911 when people were in need," said Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla. , who was the governor at the time. "The individuals responsible for these senseless deaths must be brought to justice. "
Defense lawyers said workers did all they could to protect the residents as Irma roared through South Florida. Lawrence Hashish, a lawyer for one of the nurses, said portable air conditioners and industrial fans were brought in.
“The decision to charge these people is completely outrageous," Hashish told USA TODAY. "They are scapegoats, low-hanging fruit for the Hollywood police. "
Hashish said administrators were provided a hotline number to call and even Scott's cellphone number. But when the storm came and help was needed, calls went unanswered, he said.
"The politicians like to talk the talk, but they did nothing to help," Hashish said.
Hurricane Irma devastated parts of the Caribbean and Florida during a brutal, two-week march directly blamed for more than 80 deaths across Florida. Irma slammed into Florida Sept. 10, 2017, as a Category 4 hurricane with 130-mph winds and driving rain. Some areas of the state remained without power for weeks.
Days after the outage, following numerous 911 calls, the nursing home was finally evacuated. The home's license was suspended a short time later. Attorney David Frankel, who represents the lead nurse, said the defendants did everything to keep the patients cool and hydrated.
Still, 12 of 14 deaths at the center were ruled homicides. Federal, state and local authorities opened investigations in the days after the deaths, but no charges had been filed.

More than 115 people were evacuated from the nursing home, some in critical condition. Three people were found dead at the scene, one died during the evacuation, four were pronounced dead at a hospital. The others succumbed in the days and weeks that followed.
Paramedics from Hollywood Fire Rescue, during an ill-fated effort by the facility to regain licensing in February 2018, testified to stifling heat at the nursing home in the days following the storm. Investigators said the center delayed the evacuation decision even though a fully functional hospital was across the street.
The tragedy made national headlines, and lawmakers ultimately passed a bill requiring backup power sources in Florida nursing homes and assisted living facilities. The legislation requires such facilities to have a generator capable of keeping nursing homes and assisted living facilities at 81 degrees Fahrenheit or lower for at least four days.
"We took steps in Florida to protect our most vulnerable," Scott said. "To ensure a tragedy like this never happens again. "

Schools push to tell legacy of slavery

Texto completo: As the nation commemorates the 400th anniversary of the first slave ship to arrive in America, some Shore educators are planning to reshape their curriculum to make the event more than just a historical footnote.
The newfound focus on 1619 will give students more insight not only into slavery, but also a legacy that continues to leave its mark on the economy, housing, health care and more.
"I think it is essential to tell an accurate story," Asbury Park Schools' Superintendent Sancha K. Gray said. "It's not just Black history; it's America's history. To that end, the Asbury Park School District will incorporate these (lessons) into our future curriculum."
The first enslaved Africans on record arrived at a Virginia colony 400 years ago this month, creating a system of slavery that technically lasted until the Civil War, but remains a part of America even today.
The year 1619 hasn't gotten the mythological treatment of, say, 1492, 1776 or 1941, but its fingerprints have proven to be nearly impossible to wipe away.
Slavery continues to affect every part of American society, said Walter Greason, a professor who specializes in economic history at Monmouth University in West Long Branch.
"Most Americans never learned any of this information," he said. "As a result racism became increasingly hidden and deeply embedded in every way we relate to each other as people."
The impact of 1619 and the institution of slavery has been documented this month by the New York Times and USA TODAY.
The system of free labor helped white Americans build wealth, but left the workers themselves falling short generation after generation in their bid to make good on America's promise of equality.
The promise was laid out in the Declaration of Independence by founding fathers who were slave owners.
But 400 years later:
More than three-quarters of white New Jerseyans owned a home in 2014. By comparison, 37.8 percent of black New Jerseyans owned a home, according to Prosperity Now, an advocacy group.
White households nationwide have a median net worth of $162,770. Black households, $16,300, according to the Peter G. Peterson Foundation.
White New Jerseyans' unemployment rate last month was 3.8 percent. Black New Jerseyans' jobless rate was 6.6 percent, according to state figures.
Whites in the U.S. had a life expectancy in 2013 of 79.1 years. Blacks had a life expectancy of 75.5 years, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.
"I think it's important for the state to look at these issues holistically in a comprehensive way and in a meaningful way to look at policy solutions," said Renee Wolf Koubiadis, executive director of the Anti-Poverty Network of New Jersey.
The group released a study two years ago called "The Uncomfortable Truth: Racism, Injustice and Poverty in New Jersey. The 131-page report proposed 100 policy recommendations to address structural inequality.
"There needs to be a concerted effort, an intentional effort," she said. "Otherwise people will still be suffering from the effects of slavery."
The spotlight on 1619 has sparked backlash as well. A writer for The Federalist said slavery had actually been in America years earlier, and the project was "mostly about convincing Americans that 'America' and 'slavery' are essentially synonyms.
But advocates say African Americans continue to face an uphill climb, encountering centuries-old inequities.
A proposed merger between Fair Lawn-based Columbia Bank and Midland Park-based Atlantic Stewardship Bank has come under fire from a consumer group.
New Jersey Citizen Action filed a protest with the federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, saying neither bank met its legal obligations to meet the credit needs of low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.
For example, it said Atlantic Stewardship between 2015 and 2017 didn't make any home purchase loans in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Meanwhile, Columbia's denial rates for African American and Latino applicants exceeded the market average.
"In this case it's a return to what we were seeing years and years ago in terms of redlining," said Phyllis Salowe-Kaye, executive director of New Jersey Citizen Action, referring to the practice of financial institutions that wouldn't make loans in under-served neighborhoods.
Officials from the two banks didn't respond to requests for comment.
Not that the nation hasn't made any strides. The life expectancy gap between blacks and whites narrowed from nearly six years in 1999 to 3.6 years in 2013 thanks in part to a decline in death rates among African Americans from HIV, heart disease and cancer, according to the CDC.
But progress in other areas has stalled. New Jersey's home ownership rate among black residents has scarcely budged since 1990, Census figures show.
Asbury Park schools aren't alone in rethinking its curriculum. Long Branch Public Schools' humanities department also is in the planning stage.
Educators hope that teaching the story of 1619 will give students a new perspective, recognizing obstacles that are deeply rooted.
"Once everyone sees this information, we have new ways to understand each other," Monmouth University's Greason said. "We can communicate more clearly and abandon the hateful language that has empowered white nationalists throughout the country's history. This...is a chance at a new beginning for democracy in the 21st century."

"I think it is essential to tell an accurate story. It's not just Black history; it's America's history. To that end, the Asbury Park School District will incorporate these (lessons) into our future curriculum."

Texto completo: Last year, the Atlantic put on hold its plans to launch a paywall at the behest of its new owner, Laurene Powell Jobs, according to people familiar with the matter. Ms. Powell Jobs, who had paid more than $100 million for a majority stake, wanted the magazine to first hire new staffers and improve its platform, betting that those changes would help expand offerings and draw more readers.
That strategy now faces a test as the publication gears up to introduce a paywall sometime after Labor Day -- more than 18 months later than initially planned. While the Atlantic has beefed up its staff and expanded its coverage beyond analysis toward more breaking news and scoops, many of its rivals have raced to set up their own paywalls.
The delay puts the magazine at greater risk of falling behind at a critical moment in the industry, when news organizations are trying to reduce their reliance on advertising, and as readers are growing weary of the mushrooming number of publications charging for online access.
The Atlantic declined to divulge details on how the paywall would be structured. Ms. Powell Jobs, who owns 70% of the magazine through Emerson Collective, her philanthropically minded investment firm, declined to be interviewed for this article. She has made it clear that her investment in the Atlantic needs to be financially viable and isn't to be considered charity, according to people familiar with the situation.
The 162-year-old magazine, based in Washington, D.C., recently went from making an annual profit of about $10 million to losing money, people familiar with the matter said, as a result of the early 2018 decision to hire about 100 new people -- a roughly 30% staff expansion.
Ms. Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs, is one of several deep-pocketed tech-world investors who have bought legacy media outlets. In 2013, Jeff Bezos, chief executive of Amazon.com Inc., acquired the Washington Post. Last year, Salesforce.com Inc. co-founder Marc Benioff and his wife, Lynne Benioff, purchased Time Magazine.
Atlantic President Bob Cohn said that when Ms. Powell Jobs explained the details of her investment plan to the magazine's managers, they felt delaying the paywall launch made sense.
"We were about to make dozens of hires that would ultimately lead to the creation of an even better paywall," said Mr. Cohn, who is leaving in early September for a fellowship at Harvard.
People at the Atlantic said Ms. Powell Jobs has taken a mostly hands-off approach to day-to-day matters, but weighs in on key decisions.
The Atlantic has found itself at the center of controversy several times since Ms. Powell Jobs took over. In early 2018, the magazine cut ties with conservative columnist Kevin Williamson less than a month after hiring him following a furious reader backlash over his antiabortion views. Conservatives criticized the move as being anti-free-speech.
Several prominent female reporters have recently left.
The publication just completed a yearlong study into the gender dynamics of its newsroom and has made efforts to address pay disparities, a person familiar with the matter said. In 2018, 75% of its hires were women, and 17 of its 23 senior editors are now women, the company said.
As the Atlantic expands its focus to compete more directly with outlets like Politico, Axios and even the Washington Post and the New York Times, some staffers say it has proven difficult to re-engineer the newsroom.
"It felt like the place was becoming a hot-take factory," said one recently departed writer. "That can be profitable, of course, because hot takes don't cost much."
Adrienne LaFrance, the Atlantic's executive editor, said the magazine's broader focus hasn't detracted from its strengths in analysis and context.
"We have to be a real-time magazine to stay competitive, but our play isn't more volume, it's higher quality," she said. "We have absolutely doubled down on where we excel, which is sharply reported analysis and deep historical context."
The Atlantic spokeswoman added: "If you need empirical data, our story volume this year is down 7.5%, even as we have added journalists and even as our audience has grown significantly."
Monthly U.S. visitor numbers in the first half of 2019 are up 35% from a year earlier, Comscore data show. Revenue grew 13% last year, and digital advertising revenue rose 10%.
Print sales fell 16% to an average of 447,000 a month in the second half of 2018, according to the Alliance for Audited Media.
The Atlantic emerged as a modestly profitable venture under the stewardship of David Bradley, who bought the magazine in 1999 and withstood nearly a decade of losing as much as $10 million a year.
Mr. Bradley, who is in his mid-60s and whose children have expressed little interest in running the business, had a list of people he thought would make good stewards for the Atlantic.
Ms. Powell Jobs agreed to a deal after only a few hours' conversation with Mr. Bradley in the spring of 2017, a person familiar with the matter said. Mr. Bradley agreed to retain a 30% stake for between three and five years, after which Ms. Powell Jobs would have the option to buy him out completely or bring in a minority investor.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The criminal trial of a prominent lawyer has provided a behind-the-scenes, often unflattering look at how public-relations agents, political consultants and lawyers set about shaping public opinion for foreign governments.
Such details are often cloaked by attorney-client privilege or confidentiality agreements. But in this case the particulars have been presented in testimony in the federal trial of Gregory Craig, former White House counsel for President Obama and a go-to inside-the-Beltway lawyer.
He has been charged with misleading the Justice Department over his work for Ukraine, which he denies.
The campaign at issue is a multimillion-dollar effort in 2012 by Ukraine's government. At the time, the government was seen as pro-Moscow, but it hoped to rehabilitate its image in Europe and eventually win admission to the European Union. Tapped to lead the effort were political consultants Paul Manafort and his business partner Rick Gates.
Mr. Craig became involved during a stint working at a white-shoe law firm, Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom LLP. He was asked by Mr. Manafort to write a report evaluating the fairness of the trial of Yulia Tymoshenko, an opposition politician and former prime minister. The Ukrainians sought a Western lawyer of some stature to examine the facts and add credibility to their effort. Messrs. Manafort and Gates also hired a number of international public relations firms to assist them.
Mr. Craig insisted on independence in drafting his report and concluded that Ms. Tymoshenko's trial was flawed, according to testimony. But a consultant for one of the chief PR firms on the case, FTI Consulting, said the plan was to use the report to burnish Ukraine's reputation. "The understanding that we at FTI had was that the Skadden report was a PR tool to help Ukraine reset its relationship with the European Union," said Jonathan Hawker in court. FTI declined to comment.
Emails as well as witness testimony showed that the public relations team drafted press material touting the report's conclusions before they had seen it. Mr. Hawker wrote in an email to Mr. Gates: "We've provided answers even when we do not know the facts." The team wrote news releases that misstated some of its central conclusions, emails showed.
The plan, Mr. Gates said, was to leak the report to a select journalist to win favorable coverage and then rely on what he viewed as the herd mentality of other reporters. "Journalists typically don't like to do all of their own legwork, so they borrow from other reporters," Mr. Gates told the jury.
The team settled on David Sanger of the New York Times, a reporter Mr. Craig knew and whose byline he believed would carry weight. The story Mr. Sanger co-wrote wasn't quite the shot of positivity the PR team hoped for, Mr. Gates acknowledged: "It wasn't the greatest." But he also said Mr. Sanger's article "at least was viewed neutrally."
"The Times wrote an appropriately skeptical story about the prosecution of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, which raised questions about the political nature of the trial and about the compensation that Mr. Craig's firm was paid for the report," an attorney for the Times said in a statement.
After the Times story was published, other journalists became interested. One reporter from Radio Free Europe reached out to Mr. Hawker -- who falsely told the reporter that he wasn't representing the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice when the ministry was his client. "I misled him," Mr. Hawker testified. "It was a very bad decision."
The case resulted from special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference and related issues. That investigation led to the conviction of Mr. Manafort, who was President Trump's 2016 campaign manager, for financial crimes. Mr. Gates pleaded guilty to conspiracy and false statements and is cooperating with the government.
Mr. Craig was charged with misleading the Justice Department while at Skadden. U.S. citizens who represent foreign governments are required to disclose that work.
Mr. Craig's lawyer has argued his legal work didn't require registration. They said any contacts with journalists were to ensure his report wasn't misrepresented by Ukraine's PR consultants.

Struggle for power between unions and corporations

Texto completo: In the early 1990s, Los Angeles faced a turning point. Many of the aerospace and manufacturing jobs that had boomed during and after World War II, feeding a large, prosperous middle class, had evaporated.
Low-wage service jobs - dishwashers, janitors, home-care aides, hotel housekeepers - were exploding, often filled by African Americans and immigrants from Mexico and Central America.
In the wake of the fiery 1992 riots, two labor organizers, children of farmworkers, launched a scrappy group to battle poverty and inequality. Over the following decades, the Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy would gather unions, community groups, environmentalists, immigrant advocates and clergy into one of the most powerful forces in the city.
In his sweeping new history, "Beaten Down, Worked Up: The Past, Present, and Future of American Labor," Steven Greenhouse devotes a detailed chapter to LAANE, as a model for what he calls "a new and different labor movement."
The group championed the nation's broadest living-wage law; invented the concept of "community benefits agreements," forcing big developers to hire locally and build low-income housing; and, with political muscle, helped raise pay and benefits for some 120,000 workers from hotel maids to garbage haulers and construction laborers.
But even as labor grew stronger in Los Angeles, Greenhouse writes , unions across the country have been decimated by fierce pushback from corporate executives, by anti-labor Republican officials from the Reagan era to the Trump administration, and by lawsuits and legislative attacks funded by the billionaire Koch brothers and other right-wing magnates.
In the 1950s, more than a third of U.S. workers belonged to a union. Today membership is 10.5% of the workforce.
For corporations, it may be the best of times. Profits have soared after massive tax cuts for businesses and wealthy stockholders. Labor, environmental and job safety regulations have been gutted.
For workers, it may be the worst of times. Unemployment is down but average hourly pay, adjusted for inflation, remains below what it was in 1973. Four in 10 adults lack enough savings to pay a $400 emergency expense, according to the Federal Reserve. And the U.S. remains the only industrial nation that fails to grant workers the right to paid sick days, vacation or maternity leave.
Greenhouse, a former labor reporter and foreign correspondent for The New York Times, builds a persuasive case that the inability of workers to engage in collective bargaining has markedly shifted power to corporations, fueling the nation's exploding inequality.
CEOs at the biggest corporations now make 312 times more than the average worker, up from 20 times more decades ago.
The share of national income going to business profits has risen to its highest level since World War II, Greenhouse reports, while workers' share - employee compensation including benefits - has sunk to its lowest level since the 1940s.
"Millions of Americans know little about what unions have achieved over American history," he writes. "Labor unions, and their ability to create a powerful collective voice for workers, played a huge role in building the world's largest, richest middle class."
"Beaten Down, Worked Up" paints vivid portraits of labor champions, from the firebrands of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union in the early 20th century, to the African Americans who led the 1968 sanitation workers strike in Memphis where Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, to the multiethnic organizers - Latino, black, white - of Las Vegas' Culinary Workers Union, which raised wages for 57,000 hotel and casino workers in recent decades.
At the same time, there are searing accounts of the struggles of workers with no union to defend them: the Kansas City Burger King and Pizza Hut worker who takes five buses between two jobs that pay so little his family is evicted from its unheated apartment; the Colorado nurse fired for taking two sick days after a fever of 103 from pneumonia; the Disney software engineers laid off with no severance unless they trained their replacements from India; the Uber driver whose income cratered after the tech giant slashed mileage compensation and hiked its commission from 10% to 25%.
Beginning in the 1970s, stiff competition from abroad battered U.S. industry from steel mills to automakers to electronics factories and garment manufacturers. Globalization spurred American companies to force labor concessions that weakened members' attachment to their unions. And they moved operations overseas.
Greenhouse chronicles how union-busting tactics accelerated in the wake of Reagan's 1981 mass firing of striking airport controllers. Government deregulation also weakened unions in airlines, trucking, railroads and telecommunications.
Decades of economic turmoil set the stage for Trump's 2016 victory as he tapped into blue-collar resentment with ferocious trade-war and anti-immigrant rhetoric. Trump followed through with punishing tariffs on goods from China and other nations. But on basic labor issues, Greenhouse writes, the Trump administration "has repeatedly sided with business over workers. It has scrapped numerous job safety regulations ... and rolled back a rule that extended overtime pay to millions more workers." Trump appointees successfully pushed the Supreme Court to limit worker class-action suits and curb the clout of public employee unions.
If labor's predicament seems dire, its future may lie in a new approach: organizing low-wage workers whether or not they can be unionized. The L.A. union's success is one example. Greenhouse describes others: the Coalition of Immokalee Workers raised pay for 35,000 workers and fought sexual abuse in Florida's tomato fields with a successful boycott of Taco Bell; the Fight for $15 movement, funded by the Service Employees International Union, mounted a global campaign to raise pay at McDonald's, and branched out to support minimum-wage hikes in cities and states across the country, benefiting some 22 million workers.
Those efforts may be having an impact. Public approval of unions has risen to 62%, the highest level since 2003. But the path forward for a diminished labor movement is far from clear. "In the balance," Greenhouse argues, "is the future of our economy and our democracy."

Aides blame Macron for pushing 'niche issues' at G-7 summit to embarrass Trump

Texto completo: President Trump's aides are reportedly frustrated that the focus of the Group of Seven summit in France between world leaders is too centered around "niche issues" instead of economic problems that the countries must tackle.
The New York Times reported that senior administration officials have accused French President Emmanuel Macron of purposely fixating the summit on issues that play into his favor at home, such as climate change, income inequality, and gender inequality. They blamed Macron for what they perceived as the French leader emphasizing "differences" with the Trump administration.
U.S. officials also said they pleaded with Macron aides to shift some of the focus on global economic issues, but their requests were largely ignored. They said Macron had violated the tradition of the G-7 summit of ensuring that certain nations' economic slowdowns do not advance globally.
"France, this year’s host, wants the Group of 7 to stay silent on these core economic issues," White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow wrote in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal.
Kudlow alleged that the French were too focused on "politically correct bromides" and warned that the G-7 was "in danger of completely losing its way."
"Trade and the global economy have gotten short shrift," Kudlow wrote.
Trump and Macron met for a private lunch on Saturday in Biarritz, France, before the summit began. Trump stressed the pair had a "very good relationship" during a press gaggle at the lunch.
"We've been friends for a long time," Trump said. "And every once in a while, we go at it just a little bit — not very much. But we get along very well. We have a very good relationship — sort of, I think I can say, a special relationship. And I think we'll accomplish a lot this weekend, and I look forward to it."
Macron reportedly discussed the weekend's schedule during the lunch, telling Trump the world leaders would speak about foreign policy issues regarding Libya, Syria, Ukraine, North Korea, and Iran.
Politico revealed that some White House officials conveyed frustrations with Macron's planned agenda.
"It’s our view that with France trying to drive these other issues outside of global economics, national security and trade, they're trying to fracture the G-7," the official reportedly said.

Texto completo: It seemed, at least on paper, like a tectonic shift of American capitalism: The deviation from the long-held conviction that shareholder returns must always reign supreme.
In a 300-word statement released Monday, 181 leaders of some of the world's largest companies endorsed a philosophical redrawing of the purpose of a corporation. The goal, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s Jamie Dimon, chairman of the Business Roundtable, must be to promote an economy that serves all Americans, not just investors.
Critics quickly seized on the unknowns. Would activist investors overlook stock price dips if the cause could be traced to higher wages and better benefits for workers? Can chief executives, who last about six years on average and mainly get paid in company stock, reasonably be expected to run businesses with a decades-long mind-set?

The group "should be willing to be held accountable in their efforts to transition this statement into reality," said Catherine Jackson, a former senior advisor for responsible investments at Dutch pension fund PGGM. "Stakeholders, including investors, need a line of sight into how these commitments are going to be actioned."
Those who signed the Business Roundtable statement vowed to serve five distinct constituencies: customers, employees, suppliers, communities and shareholders. The revision came more than 20 years after the group said its members' primary goal was to increase shareholder value.
The CEOs who signed -- including those of 3M Co., Johnson & Johnson and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. -- agreed to provide workers with fair pay, benefits and training opportunities, and to promote diversity, among other things. The pledge also called for respecting residents in communities where their businesses operate and caring for the environment by embracing sustainable practices.
What constitutes fair compensation is unclear. The federal minimum wage has remained unchanged for a decade, while costs for things such as healthcare and higher education have soared, prompting some companies, including Amazon.com Inc., to raise its baseline and encourage others to follow.
To some critics, that's not enough. This year, Walt Disney Co., which isn't a member of the Business Roundtable, faced repeated criticism from Abigail Disney, the granddaughter of co-founder Roy O. Disney, who said a $15 hourly wage doesn't go far for workers in expensive areas of the country such as Anaheim, home of Disneyland and other Disney attractions. The company has rejected the criticism.
It's also unclear whether the changing priorities will be reflected in firms' compensation plans. Roughly two-thirds of CEO pay for those in the S&P 500 comes in the form of stock awards. Share performance is among the most common metrics to determine payouts, appearing in about half of pay plans for the CEOs of the 181 companies that signed the pledge, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
At S&P 500 firms, the average ratio of the CEO's compensation compared with that of the median worker is about 280 to 1, the data show.
"The rising income inequality between executives and employees won't be meaningfully eradicated by compensating employees fairly unless executives are willing to be paid less," Jackson said.
The Business Roundtable is a powerful lobbying group in its own right. Led by Josh Bolten, a former chief of staff to President George W. Bush, the group's members and their affiliates have largely supported Republicans with campaign contributions, but did donate to Hillary Clinton in 2016. Its policy goals include supporting stock buybacks and increasing the federal minimum wage.
Absent from the 181 signatories were the leaders of Roundtable members Wells Fargo & Co., State Farm, Parker-Hannifin Corp., NextEra Energy Inc., Kaiser Permanente, General Electric Co., Blackstone Group Inc. and Alcoa Corp.
Representatives for Kaiser and State Farm both said their companies support the pledge but elected not to sign it because they don't have shareholders. A GE spokeswoman said CEO H. Lawrence Culp Jr. consistently makes public statements about creating value for stakeholders such as customers, employees and investors, but declined to comment further. Wells Fargo wasn't invited to sign the pledge because its current chief serves on an interim basis, a spokeswoman said.
The other companies either declined to comment or didn't respond to requests.
Adherence to the shareholder-first model is widely traced back to a New York Times column written by Nobel laureate Milton Friedman in 1970, in which he spurned corporate leaders who "declaim that business is not concerned 'merely' with profit," but also things such as avoiding pollution or "whatever else may be the catchwords of the contemporary crop of reformers."
The idea of maximizing shareholder returns took hold in executive suites and academic circles over the following decades, with some even saying that companies have a legal duty to do so.
There's no U.S. law that explicitly backs that up. Several court cases have broached the matter, including in Delaware, where many companies are incorporated. Some legal scholars and governance experts interpret the court opinions as prohibiting actions that promote environmental or social goals at the expense of profits, but there's no consensus.
"The most frustrating thing I ever hear is when someone says that a board of directors can't do things that are attuned to sustainability under the current legal system," said Larry Hamermesh, executive director of the Institute for Law and Economics at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. "They can. There is nothing in the law that precludes this."
Many companies vow to do good things but often resist releasing data to let others independently verify such promises, or cherry-pick the data they do disclose. Many refuse to release the gender and racial figures they provide to the U.S. government.
It's also unclear to what extent the pledge will weaken the role of the stock price as a CEO's official scorecard. A shifting of resources could affect a company's policy on measures often seen as taken to give short-term share price boosts, such as stock buybacks.
Activist investors have for years shown willingness to take on the biggest global companies with lagging stock prices, including Procter & Gamble Co. and GE. Still, the breadth of signatories may empower CEOs to dial down their adherence to short-term results.
"People treat it as a trade-off -- as a zero-sum game," said Martin Whittaker, CEO of Just Capital, a nonprofit that studies how companies perform on a variety of metrics such as worker well-being and environmental impact. "In the short term, raising wages may suppress the stock price, but if you look over time, you see these companies do better."

Massachusetts's Moulton ends presidential run, will seek reelection to House

Texto completo: Rep. Seth Moulton (Mass.), a Harvard-educated Marine veteran who struggled to gain traction in a crowded Democratic presidential field, announced Friday that he would close his campaign, making him the third candidate to depart the race in the past eight days.
"I am ending my campaign for president," Moulton said in a Friday speech in San Francisco at the Democratic National Committee's summer meeting. "Though this campaign is not ending the way we hoped, I am leaving this race knowing that we raised issues that are vitally important."
Moulton argued that his veterans-focused campaign challenged President Trump "where he's weakest, as commander in chief," and worked to "take back patriotism from the Republican Party."
The congressman attracted as much attention as he had since his April presidential debut on his concluding day, when Trump sought to blame him for a stock market slump that followed the president's belligerent tweets about his handpicked Federal Reserve chief and his trade nemesis, China.
"The Dow is down 573 points perhaps on the news that Representative Seth Moulton, whoever that may be, has dropped out of the 2020 Presidential Race!" Trump tweeted.
Moulton follows Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper, two Democrats who shuttered their bids for the White House in recent days as the nomination contest moves toward the fall - and as the DNC imposes stricter requirements for a spot at upcoming debates.
Inslee announced he would instead seek a third gubernatorial term next year, and Hickenlooper announced he would run against Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.). Moulton said Friday that he would seek reelection to the House in Massachusetts's 6th Congressional District near Boston.
"I can't wait to get back at it," Moulton said in his speech. Moulton's exit from the 2020 race was first reported by the New York Times.
Moulton, 40, had been lingering near 1 percent or less in the polls and failed to qualify for the first two debates, in June and July. By early August, his campaign staff began to shrink following fundraising difficulties.
Despite the disappointment, Moulton told the DNC members that he walks away from the race proud of the way he shined a light on veterans' issues and his own hardships. Moulton served as a Marine Corps captain during the Iraq War and was the recipient of a Bronze Star.
"For the first time in my life, I talked publicly about dealing with post-traumatic stress from my four combat tours in Iraq," Moulton said. He called those discussions part of an effort to end "the stigma around mental health."
Moulton's low-key presence on the campaign trail, however, did little to win him notice.
"I'm not going around doing crazy things just looking for a viral moment," Moulton said at a Washington Post Live event in June. "The case I'm making to the American people is that I'm not a crazy leader. I'm someone that you can trust, and you're not going to agree with me on everything."
In an interview with The Washington Post, Moulton said that "getting in late to the race was a handicap, much worse than expected. If I had gotten in even just a few weeks earlier, I probably would have made the first debate."
But by waiting until April 22, Moulton joined a field that already had 18 candidates and was the most crowded primary in the party's modern history. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, 37, in particular, was surging at the time, and his presence made it harder for Moulton since they both were running on themes related to generational change and military experience.
Moulton said in The Post interview that he has had private conversations this month with former vice president Joe Biden, who leads the polls. Their latest exchange came Thursday, he said.
While Moulton is not ready to make an endorsement, he identifies with Biden's pragmatic politics.
"I do think that Trump is going to be hard to beat," Moulton said. "I think Vice President Biden would make a fantastic president. He's a mentor and a friend, and I've been impressed by the campaign he has run so far."
Moulton added, "It's evident now that this is essentially a three-way race" among Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).
Moulton said he worries that "veering too far left could lose us this election" and warned his party against embracing Medicare-for-all proposals on health care.
"I think we should strengthen Obamacare and have a robust public option that can compete against private plans," Moulton said, echoing Biden's approach. "I don't think we should just take people off of that."
Moulton is also known as a political rebel in the House, where he co-organized an effort to stop Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) from winning the speaker's gavel.
He rejected the suggestion that his work against Pelosi's speaker bid - he eventually supported her after weeks of talks - hurt his 2020 campaign.
"It's basically Washington reporters who care about that," Moulton said. "I've not met a single voter outside of Washington who says to me, 'Seth, I wish you'd be a little more establishment and follow what your party leaders are telling you to do.' It's absurd."
Moulton said he and Pelosi still have differences, including the party's timeline for possibly impeaching Trump. Moulton wants the impeachment process to begin immediately and said Pelosi is making a "big mistake" by waiting to formally begin those proceedings.
Moulton plans to stay active in national politics in the coming months with events for veterans and for fellow Democrats through his Serve America PAC.
On Monday, Moulton will host a veterans' town hall meeting in Fairfax, Va., with retired Army Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the former commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
"I'm not going anywhere. I'm only 40 years old," Moulton said in the interview with a chuckle.

Ginsburg Is Treated For Tumor On Pancreas

Texto completo: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg underwent treatment for a malignant tumor discovered on her pancreas, according to a news release issued by the Supreme Court on Friday.
"The tumor was treated definitively and there is no evidence of disease elsewhere in the body," the statement said.
The abnormality was first discovered in early July after a routine blood test, according to the statement. A biopsy conducted on July 31 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City confirmed a localized malignant tumor.
"Justice Ginsburg will continue to have periodic blood tests and scans," the statement said. "No further treatment is needed at this time."
The health of the 86-year-old justice, the senior member of the court's four-member liberal wing, has been a subject of concern.
In December, surgeons removed two malignant nodules from Justice Ginsburg's left lung. The court described that surgery as successful, and said then that she was cancer free. After missing two weeks of arguments in January, she returned to work in February.
Justice Ginsburg also had surgery in 2009 for early-stage pancreatic cancer.
She was also treated for colon cancer in 1999, but she did not miss a day on the bench.
Justice Ginsberg's career as the second female justice appointed to the Supreme Court, and her overall fortitude, have inspired books ("Notorious RBG: The Life and Times of Ruth Bader Ginsburg"), a major motion picture, a documentary and merchandise, including a pin resembling the collar she wears when writing a dissenting opinion.
Justice Ginsburg has repeatedly vowed to stay on the court as long she is of sound mind and body. In a 2013 interview with The New York Times, she said she loved her work and intended to continue "as long as I can do the job full-steam, and that, at my age, is not predictable."
Pancreatic cancer accounts for about 3 percent of all cancers in the U.S., and about 7 percent of all cancer deaths.
Some 56,770 Americans will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2019; about 45,750 will die of it, according to the American Cancer Society.
For three weeks this August, Justice Ginsberg underwent focused radiation treatment, and a bile duct stent was placed, according to the court's statement.
Dr. Diane Simeone, director of pancreatic cancer at NYU Langone's Perlmutter Cancer Center, said the preferred treatment for a localized tumor is surgery to remove it, but said she was not familiar with the details of this particular case. Radiation "is not typically given as first-line treatment for a newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer," she said.
"The question is: Where does this fit in the big picture?" Dr. Simeone said. "She had a pancreatic cancer resectioned about a decade ago. Is this a second primary tumor? Is this a local recurrence? Those are things that are unclear from the information we have today."
Though pancreatic cancer has a reputation as an aggressive and fast-moving disease, Dr. Simeone said some subtypes are indolent and slow-growing. Some of them have a tendency to spread to the lungs and might have been implicated in the justice's lung cancer.
"It's hard to know the prognosis without knowing the true extent of the tumor," she said. Radiation can be effective for local control but "it's often not curative," she said.
Other justices have had cancer while serving on the bench. In 1992, Justice John Paul Stevens underwent radiation treatment for prostate cancer. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist's thyroid cancer was diagnosed 11 months before his death in September 2005.
Aside from canceling an annual visit to Santa Fe, New Mexico, Justice Ginsburg has otherwise maintained an active schedule this summer, the statement said. The State University of New York at Buffalo said in a statement on Friday that it had received confirmation that she would visit on Monday as scheduled.
Last month, in an interview with NPR, Justice Ginsberg dismissed concerns about her health by recalling a long-ago comment from a senator.
"There was a senator, I think it was after my pancreatic cancer, who announced with great glee that I was going to be dead within six months," she said. "That senator, whose name I have forgotten, is now himself dead, and I am very much alive."
Adam Liptak and Roni Rabin contributed reporting.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Treat mass hate shootings as domestic terrorism

Texto completo: Two weeks ago, a gunman killed 22 people in El Paso, Texas, in what he later told authorities was a targeted attack against Mexicans, according to the arrest affidavit. This tragedy is the latest incident of hate-fueled violence; it's clear our country is plagued by the toxic cocktail of guns and hate. And while the federal government refuses to address this violence, New York is stepping up with a proposal to call these hateful acts exactly what they are - domestic terrorism.
Hate is nothing new in America. Our country bears the scars of the KKK, the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921, and the Porvenir Massacre in 1918, which led to the execution of 15 Mexicans - just to name a few. Many of us thought these incidents were long in the past, but this hate remains a part of our reality today.
Hate crimes have been on the rise. In recent years, we have seen hateful acts against African-Americans in Charleston, Jews in Pittsburgh, Muslims in New York, Latinos in El Paso and LGBTQ people in Orlando. Many of these targeted groups are wrongly cast as "other," even though we are a nation made stronger by people from different backgrounds.
Since Sept. 11, far-right extremists carried out nearly three times as many attacks on Americans in the U.S. as Islamic extremists, according to government data cited by the New York Times. It is not just repulsive, immoral and anti-American - it is illegal and we must confront it by enacting a new law to fit the crime.
That's why I am proposing that New York state pass a national precedent: a Hate Crimes Domestic Terrorism Act. For anyone who launches a mass attack and kills on the basis of race, nationality, ethnicity, religion, disability, sexual orientation or gender identity, the penalty should be the same as it is for other terrorist crimes: up to life without parole.
If we are going to make meaningful strides to address this problem, we must recognize the enemy within - an American cancer where one cell in the body politic destroys other cells. It spreads in the hidden corners of the internet and from the highest positions in the land, and infects sick and hate-filled hearts.
We must also address the instrumentality of hate: guns.
The federal government is not impotent on this issue; it is politically paralyzed.
After the Sandy Hook massacre in 2012, New York lawmakers moved swiftly to pass the SAFE Act, which banned assault weapons and high capacity magazines while instituting universal background checks.
It wasn't easy, but it was right. The New York Legislature had to choose between the gun lobby and public safety in the aftermath of a horrendous tragedy. It was a tough vote but the bill passed on a bipartisan basis.
All the NRA's fear-mongering has been proven false; in the six years since the SAFE Act was passed, no one has ever complained to me that they have been denied a gun they were legally entitled to own.
Washington Democrats must show that they have the leadership to bring this kind of change to the country. They must expose this president and the Republican senators as political cowards and lackeys for the gun industry. Members of the Senate and House and every Democratic presidential candidate should put aside their own personal politics, stand up to the gun lobby, and offer a strong, unified, comprehensive gun proposal to end the carnage.
It's time for leaders in Washington to step up and do something so we can start saving American lives, and the American soul. - (CNN)S

Texto completo: Thank you, Dean Baquet. Readers who complain about articles they don't like, and who assume they are written under pressure from advertisers, could do worse than to study recent comments of the New York Times executive editor.
Mr. Baquet was secretly recorded at a staff meeting. A transcript was posted at Slate.com. But he has made similar points publicly. The gist: It's readers nowadays who pressure newspapers to toe a line. Publishers pine for the era when advertising dollars insulated us from such pressures.
Under fire from its public for an anodyne and accurate headline about Donald Trump after the El Paso shootings, which the paper later changed, Mr. Baquet almost pleaded with his crew: "We are an independent news organization, one of the few remaining. . . . Our readers and some of our staff cheer us when we take on Donald Trump, but they jeer at us when we take on Joe Biden. They sometimes want us to pretend that he was not elected president, but he was elected president."
If he meant a newspaper's job is to report the facts and arrange them in a logical fashion regardless of the howling winds of reader prejudice, he's right. Unfortunately it's not clear this is what he meant.
To his credit, the Times has been one of a few news organizations that have refrained from labelling Mr. Trump a racist, as if this quality can be factually determined between the lines of his tweets. What Mr. Baquet is up against was illustrated by one of his own reporters, quoted in the Slate transcript saying, "I just feel like racism is in everything. It should be considered in our science reporting, in our culture reporting, in our national reporting."
Such thinking is why audiences other than the Times's have become cynical when charges of racism are flung.
But Mr. Baquet also lent credence to an already rampant suspicion that the Times sees its job as imposing a "narrative" (a word he used repeatedly) on the world rather than listening to what the world teaches. After the Russia collusion fiasco, you might think an order of business would be finding out how our politics came to be so roiled by fabricated allegations . All too plainly, Mr. Baquet seemed to suggest that the Times, having failed to deliver the Russia story its readers wanted, must now deliver the Trump racism story they want. "Our readers who want Donald Trump to go away suddenly thought, 'Holy [bleep], Bob Mueller is not going to do it.' "
Is Mr. Trump a racist? I don't know. Are you? What I do know, and what's apparent to everyone, is the existence of powerful incentives in American life to level such charges, indeed a delight in doing so. The Times knows this better than most. It can hardly fire anyone without being accused of racism. Of particular note, a 2016 class action claimed not only that the paper is hostile to "older employees of color," but that it prefers its readers to be "young, white [and] wealthy" too.
Now this is ironic. Multiple Democratic alarums have been sounded lately, including in the Times, about how the racial radicalism of exactly these young white liberals endangers the party's 2020 chances. But let's have a moment of realism. Politicians are about politics. Democrats manifestly see race as a winning card. Their presidential candidates even play it against each other. Mr. Trump, or any alternative in our two-party system, has a card too—the resistance of a large part of America to the role being assigned them in the Democrats' identity-politics melodrama.
A newspaper should tell this story, not serve as one side's propaganda arm. But also evident in Mr. Baquet's plea is another fact of life: He, or any editor who is basically an employee of the New York Times ruling family, will be hard-pressed to steer an independent path for the paper when so many of its readers, staff, editors and patrons want it to be a shield of their wokeness. An owner needs to take a hand.
But I thank him for clearing the air on one matter, the notion that advertisers dictate coverage. Which brings me to Elon Musk.
Never mind that he comprehensively missed the point of a column here in April , which criticized certain electric-vehicle mandates precisely because they were unfair to Tesla. What had me chuckling was his tweeted suggestion that this writer and "WSJ in general are sock puppets of big oil."
Look around. Do you see any big-oil ads? I wish we had more ads of any kind.
For better or worse, newspapers are more dependent than ever on readers to pay our bills. But then Mr. Musk probably knows this. He wouldn't be tweeting if he didn't believe the way to influence me is through our readers.

Ex-Rep. Walsh says he's eyeing GOP presidential bid

Texto completo: Controversial conservative radio talk show host and former tea party-backed Republican U.S. Rep. Joe Walsh is weighing a presidential run and will make a final decision in September, he told the Tribune.
Walsh, who served a single term in Congress, said he's meeting with potential backers as he considers what most view as a long shot campaign against President Donald Trump to win the GOP nomination next year.
"I'm not ruling anything out. I am meeting with people, and I would say that anyone who's considering a run, they need to decide by September," including him, he said this week.
Walsh backed the president in 2016 -- even making a preelection comment on Twitter that raised some eyebrows: "On November 9th, if Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket."
In a phone interview with the Tribune on Wednesday, Walsh said, "It wasn't so much that I was a big fan of Trump, it's that he wasn't Hillary."
The Republican is known for his incendiary comments. He was once suspended from his WIND AM-560 evening radio show for using a racial slur. Today, he says the president's own controversial comments have served as a "road to Damascus moment for me."
Walsh recently penned a piece in The New York Times in which he accused Trump of being "a racial arsonist who encourages bigotry and xenophobia to rouse his base and advance his electoral prospects."
The White House did not answer emails seeking comment about Walsh's criticism.
Walsh said he was using the Times megaphone to call on someone in the GOP to step up and run against Trump. But it also served as a mea culpa of sorts to the public.
"So why did I write that piece? I want to apologize for the role I've played in putting what I feel is an unfit con man in the White House," he told the Tribune. "There were times when I moved away from policy and got ugly and personal, made some comments about Obama, my political opponents, that were personal and hateful. In a weird way, seeing Donald Trump these last 2 1/2 years, he's the ugly final personification of that because that's all he does is ugly personal insults. It's made me think, 'Oh my gosh, did people like me who got ugly and personal these last eight or nine years create this monster?' And I think to a degree it did."
The 57-year-old Mundelein resident waved off questions about whether he could do the kind of fundraising needed to spread his name and message. And he'll likely need the money to fend off criticism of his past remarks, and a child support battle with his ex-wife in which he was portrayed as a deadbeat dad. He and his ex-wife eventually resolved the dispute, which included a stipulation that he was never "a deadbeat dad."
Polling today shows Trump likely would win the Republican nomination in a landslide. His only challenger right now is former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld.
As The Hill noted in a recent story, "a RealClearPolitics average of polls shows Trump has a 72-point lead over Weld."
But a new poll released Thursday by The Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found just 36% of Americans approve of his job performance, while 62% disapprove.
Walsh was in Congress representing a district that encompassed suburban Cook, DuPage and Kane counties. He lost reelection in the 2012 to Tammy Duckworth, who now is one of Illinois' U.S. senators.
So what caused him to campaign against Trump? Walsh said it was when the president stood with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki last year, seemingly accepting Putin's assertion that his government hadn't interfered in the 2016 U.S. election. That's despite U.S. intelligence presenting evidence to the contrary, Walsh said.
"(W)hen he stood in front of the world and said I believe this guy (Putin) and not my own intelligence agency, he lost me," Walsh said of the 2018 Trump-Putin meeting. Besieged by criticism, the president would later say he misspoke.

32 seconds to make case for weapons ban

Texto completo: Thirty-two seconds.
That's how long it took for the madman responsible for the carnage in Dayton, Ohio, to shoot 26 people, killing nine, including his sister, and wounding 17 more before he was killed by police.
According to CNN, the Dayton shooter was armed with a 223-caliber high-capacity rifle with 100-round drum magazines. As USA Today reports, the "AR" variants used in Dayton and the El Paso killing that claimed 22 lives a day earlier were legal, as were the high-capacity magazines employed in the shootings.
"Those rifles usually come with 30 or fewer rounds in a magazine. But increasingly gun manufacturers have catered to shooters looking to have 40, 60 or 100-round magazines that traditionally were shunned because they were heavy and cumbersome," USA Today noted.
These weapons of war are so far past what the Founders, who lived in an age of muskets, envisioned when they crafted the Constitution. These semi-automatic weapons, with their extended magazines, aren't intended for hunting, or self-defense, or even sport shooting.
Recognizing this, the United States banned these weapons for a decade, from 1994 to 2004.
We need a new ban. And we need it now.
As NPR reports, the old ban, formally known as the Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act, "prohibited the manufacture or sale for civilian use of certain semi-automatic weapons that could be converted to fire automatically. The act also banned magazines that could accommodate 10 rounds or more."
In an Aug. 11 op-ed for the New York Times, former Vice President Joe Biden, who was chairman of the U.S Senate Judiciary Committee when the original ban was enacted, summed up the argument expertly.
"We have a huge problem with guns," Biden wrote. "Assault weapons — military-style firearms designed to fire rapidly — are a threat to our national security, and we should treat them as such. Anyone who pretends there's nothing we can do is lying — and holding that view should be disqualifying for anyone seeking to lead our country."
As PolitiFact notes, "in raw numbers," researchers at New York University's medical school found that mass shootings decreased when the ban was in effect and rose afterward.
In fact, "the death toll from mass shootings went from 4.8 per year during the ban years to 23.8 per year afterwards." Still experts are split on whether there was a causal effect between the ban and a reduction in gun deaths.
As The Hill reports, momentum for a ban is growing in the majority-Democrat House. It will be a far harder lift in the majority-Republican Senate. But that doesn't mean the House should not act.
There is a baseline case to advance a new, and constitutional, assault weapons ban. And if the data shows even a modest reduction in deaths, that's an outcome good for society as a whole.
America banned these weapons once and was safer for it. We can do it again.

Netflix Struggles to Come to Terms With Theater Chains Over ‘The Irishman’ Release

Will Netflix release Martin Scorsese’s mob drama The Irishman in theaters? The director certainly hopes so. Scorsese was well-aware that a wide theatrical release was a long shot when he took the picture to Netflix in 2017 after Paramount passed over budget concerns. But the streamer has reportedly been eyeing its biggest traditional release yet for The Irishman . Last year, Roma received an exclusive three-week theatrical run before being made available to subscribers online. Yet neither Netflix nor the major theater chains appear close to a mutually beneficial compromise for The Irishman .
The streaming service is in talks with AMC Theaters and Cineplex, two of the largest exhibitors in North America, according to The New York Times. Though the negotiations are separate, both exhibitors have reportedly dug their heels in over the same impasse.
SEE ALSO: What Does Martin Scorsese Really Think About Netflix?
“A crucial sticking point has been the major chains’ insistence that the films they book must play in their theaters for close to three months while not being made for available for streaming at the same time, which does not sit well with Netflix,” according to the report. “Talks broke down in July, only to pick up again two weeks ago, the people said.”
Netflix is committed to serving its 151 million worldwide subscribers above all else, especially after a rough quarterly earnings report last month led to widespread concern throughout Wall Street. As of now, the company is unwilling to agree to AMC and Cineplex’s terms and are not currently negotiating with fellow exhibitors Regal or Cinemark. Conversely, the major theater chains are unwilling to entertain a smaller theatrical window as they believe it will undercut the existing agreements they hold with traditional studios such as Disney, Warner Bros., Universal, Paramount and Sony. With neither side budging at this time, the release of The Irishman , which will premiere September 27 at the New York Film Festival, is currently unclear.
One motivating factor for Netflix is the opportunity to compete for Academy Awards as The Irishman is expected to be a contender this year. To qualify for the Oscars, a film must have a one-week run in a commercial theater in Los Angeles County, per the outlet. Yet as voters showed with Roma , the presumptive favorite for Best Picture, there is a reluctance from the old guard to anoint a streaming product with the top prize unless it plays by the traditional rules. To improve its chances, Netflix knows The Irishman must be screened in theaters one way or another.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump promised he’d get rid of bad rules.
“Remove the anchor dragging us down!” he said when campaigning for president. “We’re going to cancel every needless job-killing regulation!”
Trump was a developer, so he knew that the thicket of rules government imposes often makes it impossible to get things done.
But would he keep his deregulation promise? I was skeptical.
Republicans often talk deregulation but then add rules. People called President George W. Bush an “anti-regulator.” But once he was president, he hired 90,000 new regulators!
Trump has been different.
When he took office, he hired regulation skeptics. He told government agencies: Get rid of two regulations for every new one you add.
I think his anti-regulation attitude is why stock prices rose and unemployment dropped. Trump sent a message to business: Government will no longer try to crush you. Businesses then started hiring.
Of course, the media wasn’t happy. Reporters love regulation.
They call Trump’s moves “an attack on the environment” and on “workers’ health.” The New York Times ran the headline “Donald Trump Is Trying to Kill You!”
What the media don’t get is that regulations have unintended side effects that often outweigh the good they’re intended to do.
Cars built smaller to comply with President Obama’s rules that require doubling of gas mileage cause increased deaths because smaller cars provide less protection.
“Should the government tell you what kind of car to buy?” asks Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform in my new video about Trump.
Norquist says that Trump has largely kept his deregulation promise, and that’s been great for America.
For example, Trump repealed the Obama-era plan to classify franchise businesses like McDonald’s as one single business. Why?
“The trial lawyers want to be able to sue all of McDonald’s, not just the local McDonald’s, if they spill coffee on themselves,” says Norquist. “And the labor unions want to unionize all McDonald’s, not just the one store. That would have been a disaster.”
Trump’s FCC repealed Obama’s “net neutrality” rule, which would have limited internet providers’ freedom to charge different prices.
Democrats and other regulation-lovers predicted repeal would mean that rich people would dominate the internet. Bernie Sanders even tweeted that repeal would mean “the end of the internet as we know it.”
Of course, none of those things happened. Or as Norquist puts it: “None of it! None of it!”
But some Obama regulations sounded so important.
Norquist laughs at that. “The names for these regulations are written by regulators. They’re advertisements for themselves.”
Of course, unlike advertisers, regulators don’t list side effects of their rules, which Norquist says should read: “May cause unemployment, may reduce wages, may raise the cost of energy, may make your car not drivable.”
Trump’s deregulation record would be better were he not so eager to add regulations, such as tariffs, at the same time.
“There is a challenge. Trump is a protectionist in many ways,” says Norquist, sadly. “Tariffs are taxes, and regulations on the border are regulations on consumers.”
So are Trump’s “buy American” rules.
“That sounds like a good idea, but it’s a dumb idea, and I wish he hadn’t done it,” says Norquist. “That is not deregulation. The good news is that the vast majority of the acts have been deregulatory and tremendously helpful.”
Recently, Trump announced, “We have cut 22 regulations for every new regulation!”
He exaggerated, as he often does. The real number is about five. But that’s still pretty good. Better than Ronald Reagan did.
I wish Trump would do more.
I wish he’d remove his tariffs and agricultural subsidies and kill the Export-Import Bank, drug prohibition and the onerous rules that encourage illegal immigration by making it almost impossible for foreigners to work here legally.
Keep your promise, President Trump! Repeal 22 regulations for every new one!
Nevertheless, so far, mostly good.
Every excessive rule repealed is a step in the right direction: toward freedom.

Texto completo: Seven more Democrats to appear at Native American forum in Iowa
Seven 2020 Democratic candidates for president including Senators Kamala Harris (California) and Bernie Sanders (Vermont); former San Antonio, Texas, Mayor Julián Castro and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio will appear during Day 2 of the Frank LaMere Native American Presidential Forum in Sioux City, Iowa, on Tuesday. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who in 2018 released the results of a DNA test intended to quell criticism from President Donald Trump and others who argue Warren inaccurately has claimed Native American ancestry, made the most notable appearance during Day 1 Monday. Warren began her speech with a public apology about her past claims adding she has listened, learned a lot and that she's "grateful for the many conversations that we've had together. " Rep. Deb Haaland of New Mexico, who is one of the first Native American women elected to Congress, introduced Warren and endorses her.
Statements aside, White House may be taking steps to avert recession
Despite recent assurances from President Donald Trump and top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow that the economy is in fine shape and we aren't in or near a recession, New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman tweeted Monday that the White House has scheduled Kudlow for a briefing call with business leaders on Tuesday on "the topic of the president and the economy. " As the U. S. economy deals with market swings and trade wars, the Times and Washington Post both reported Monday that White House officials have begun looking for ways to prevent a recession, including pushing for a temporary payroll tax cut to put more money into workers' paychecks. But Trump reportedly hasn't been briefed on the idea, and it's not clear whether he would go along with it. A White House official also disputed the reports of payroll tax cuts late Monday saying that's not "under consideration at this time. "

Hurricane season gets even more real
Hurricane season has been quiet, but that may not be for long. History shows that starting Tuesday there will be a sharp increase in named tropical systems in the Atlantic through the Sept. 11 period. Thanks in part to the combination of strong wind and dusty air, the rest of August appears in favor of a quiet hurricane development pattern. September, however, is a different story as conditions are expected to become much more conducive for a tropical storm formation. So far this year, the only hurricane to form in the Atlantic was Barry, which hit Louisiana in July.
After an eventful summer, will Antonio Brown return to practice with the Oakland Raiders?
After an already-eventful summer, talented wide receiver Antonio Brown was with the Oakland Raiders for team meetings on Monday. Whether he'll be seen again Tuesday when the Raiders return to their practice facility in Alameda, Calif. , is a question as, according to multiple reports, Brown has filed a new grievance against the NFL in an attempt to wear the helmet he's worn throughout his career. This comes a week after his original grievance against the NFL was rejected by an arbitrator. Brown has disagreed with that decision, and the wide receiver skipped the Raiders' practice Sunday in protest over the helmet issue, which drew blunt criticism from Raiders general manager Mike Mayock. Brown also has missed practice time after burning the bottom of his feet in a cryotherapy chamber.
Bring your own bottle when flying through San Francisco airport
San Francisco International Airport is banning the sale of single-use plastic water bottles. The unprecedented move at one of the major airports in the country will take effect Aug. 20. The new rule will apply to airport restaurants, cafes and vending machines. As a department of San Francisco's municipal government, the airport is following an ordinance approved in 2014 banning the sale of plastic water bottles on city-owned property.

Texto completo: Investors often ask who else I read. Actually, few pundits write much that is new, unique and thoughtful. I often sample writers and never read them again.
But some I always read, even those with whom I disagree – exactly because they offer unique angles.
Here is a top-tier smattering of 15 heavyweights always worth considering:
Kimberley Strassel and Holman Jenkins in The Wall Street Journal rip apart the underbelly of political intrigue and mystery of events like the Mueller investigation better than anyone else.. Somehow, they get inside complexity without getting lost.
John Tamny from RealClearMarkets.com writes caustically but shows why most economic pontificators are looney. His economics is fundamental and never blindsided by fads. Sometimes he misses that other things, like politics, may be more important than economics.
For a guy with a small investment business, Barry Ritholtz of Bloomberg has a huge voice. He is unusually brief and cuts through market nonsense and bad investment management practices. He has a nose for BS. And America's market jabber overflows in BS.
I read Jim Cramer at The Street just because I love the guy and have for a long time. He's fun. Sometimes his offbeat market notions are way off, but other times they are spot on, finding gems in haystacks that most other miss. He has way more common sense than his animated TV antics imply.
Steve Forbes, a multidecade friend, is a fundamental writer on monetary policy. While he often advocates a gold standard – which will happen when hell freezes over – his prognostications are routinely right, robust and insightful.
Gillian Tett of The Financial Times dives super deep into banking blunders. If we ever again have 2008-like banking problems, you likely hear it from Gillian long before others. Often too pessimistic because, like most journalists, she seeks problems, her knack for climbing inside banking is second to none.
Caroline Baum of Marketwatch is surgically precise on things interest-rate related and the Federal Reserve. She routinely depicts what is wrong with current consensus thinking and speaks directly to real causes, effects, and the correctness or not of Fed actions. She also opines on politics, but there, doesn't say anything unusual.
You can bookend Baum with Jeffrey Gundlach who runs asset management firm, Doubleline. He writes irregularly – but is also cameoed in various print and TV media. Currently the world's much-acclaimed "Bond King", with an ego to match, he is always worth considering because of his outsize opinions, often wrong and often right. Even when you're sure Gundlach is wrong, never underestimate his views.
For money-saving tips, Bill Baldwin of Forbes, is tops. (He was my editor there for 10 years.) He is always sniffing out unheralded ways for you to invest better. No nonsense, super experienced, plain-spoken and modest to a fault, Bill's advice can save your retirement nest egg big bucks.
Joseph Bosco of The Hill dissects Asian political affairs uniquely. Merryn Somerset Webb of MoneyWeek and the Financial Times attacks virtually everything I believe in – which is why I read her. Three heavies – Jamie Dimon of J.P. Morgan, Larry Fink of Blackrock and Ray Dalio of Bridgewater – are all meritorious on almost any darned thing.
Ken Fisher is founder and executive chairman of Fisher Investments, author of 11 books, four of which were New York Times bestsellers, and is No. 200 on the Forbes 400 list of richest Americans. Follow him on Twitter: @KennethLFisher

Bob Rees and Clifton Jolley: Ten reasons Republicans should vote Democrat

Texto completo: The reason for Republicans to vote Democrat in the next presidential election is that Donald Trump is the likeliest Republican nominee. And a vote for Donald Trump is a vote for the dissolution of the Republican Party.
The two of us like to think of ourselves as progressives. But we have family who are Republicans (or, at least, distant acquaintances). So, we respect the fundamentals of a Republican capitalism: a self-reliant, debt-free republic protected by a military budget big enough to guard several dozen less ambitious democracies.
Granted, Trump already has managed to put a hole in the bottom of each of those boats, creating a society in which only billionaires can afford self-reliance; in which the republic continues to sink deeper into debt; in which the military, police and security services are given money instead of respect.
If Republican principles are to survive, Republicans must vote Democrat — for 10 reasons:
1. Trump is a racist. We’ve had other presidents who were racists but (except for Woodrow Wilson) they lived in the 19th century, which we believed to be less enlightened, more inclined than modern times (we thought) to telling women of different colors and religions to “get out” of our white America. Trump has reminded us that there are a lot of us for whom the 19th century is today.
2. Trump is a liar. We know because The Washington Post tells us so. Which we may be inclined to doubt, as our president calls WAPO “fake news.” But Trump’s lies are too big and too many for even fake news to fake. (More than 12,000 lies since he became president, and counting.)
3. Trump doesn’t pay taxes. According to an exhaustive report (in The New York Times), Trump has swindled American taxpayers out of half a billion dollars. It would take the annual tax of 55,000 citizens like us to make up the deficit from Trump’s stiffing the IRS.
4. Trump’s tax cuts are a lie (unless you are rich). The Koch Brothers received a $1.5 billion windfall from the Trump tax bill. Sheldon Adelson got $650 million. If you are an average American, you got $1,800. And that will be more than offset by the added cost of goods you will be paying because of Trump’s ridiculous trade war.
5. Trump is a Demon of Deficit Spending. Trump’s tax and spending bills project a deficit of $1 trillion next year. That’s 1 followed by 12 zeros. But not to worry. The Republicans — who hate deficits — already are talking about offsetting the deficit by cutting Medicare and Social Security benefits.
6. Trump is an abuser of women. He constantly bullies and demeans women. Women of color. White women. All women. He is credibly accused of sexually assaulting 19 women, and counting .
7. Trump hates children. He has illegally (and heartlessly) separated thousands of immigrant children from their parents. (And counting.)
8. Trump is a climate change denier. Old sea maps, when they ran out of “known world” to chart, stated simply: “Beyond here be monsters.” We’ve found the monster.
9. Trump has a despot’s opinion of the media. When he threatens the press, he threatens our democracy. And our security agencies. And our Congress. And anyone who disagrees with the One True Trump.
10. Trump continues to lie, to destroy, to corrupt the republic and what once were the moral, decent attitudes of a free people.
If re-elected, will he destroy the world? Maybe not.
Maybe just the Republican Party.

UNR graduate from Carson City writes piece in New York Times about self-deporting in 2020

Texto completo: In an opinion piece published in the New York Times, University of Nevada, Reno graduate Tawheeda Wahabzada says she will self-deport in 2020.
Wahabzada, who graduated from UNR in 2012, calls herself a DREAMer, named for a failed bill that would have granted legal status to undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children.
Born in Canada to refugees from Afghanistan, she has lived in the United States since she was 5. Now 29, she attended elementary, middle and high school in Carson City.
"Because of circumstances beyond my control, I am undocumented," she wrote in the Times piece.
"As a result, I have lived my life in perpetual limbo — and in the shadows."
"I have been living my life in two-year increments — the duration of my temporary status," she writes of having Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status, a temporary fix that allowed Wahabzada to live in the U.S. legally.
"I will no longer keep waiting for the idea of a pathway to citizenship," she wrote.
Because she has spent more than a year in the country, once she leaves, she cannot return for 10 years. She wrote about not being able to visit friends and family and her grandmother, who raised her and is her best friend.
UNR said faculty in the College of Liberal Arts read the piece and "remember her fondly."
Wahabzada could not be reached for comment but according to her piece, she went on to graduate school in Texas and interned for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. She is now working in Washington, D.C.

Texto completo: I’m really glad we’re having a discussion about what the Statue of Liberty means to America, even if it is precipitated by nefarious thinking. This week, the Trump administration moved forward with a change in legal immigration policy that will limit people allowed to enter the country to those who are well enough off not to need public assistance. It is called the “public charge” rule.
This is yet another way for the administration to restrict people coming from poorer countries, many of them countries with black and brown people. What we are witnessing is an all-out, every-avenue strategy to maintain America as a white majority country — and, by extension, to extend white power and white supremacy — for as long as possible.
This is the game. This has always been the game. This is why President Donald Trump’s base loves him. He is fighting for their primacy, their privileges and their power. But media, politicians and liberals in general make a huge mistake when they respond by invoking the Statue of Liberty and the poem inscribed on it pedestal.
The poem says of the statue:
“Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”
But, the statue was not conceived as a beacon of liberty and immigration. The idea was conceived by French abolitionist Édouard de Laboulaye in 1865, just two months after the Civil War ended, a monument to the emancipation of this country’s slaves.
In an early model of the statue, she holds in her left hand broken shackles, a symbol of the freed slave, but in the final version the left hand holds a tablet inscribed with the Roman numerals for July 4, 1776. The independence of white America had been elevated and the independence of black America had been pushed as low as it could go: It appears by her foot, inching out from under her robe, barely visible, all but erased.
The statue was unveiled in 1886, six years before Ellis Island opened, and the poem wasn’t added to the pedestal until 1903.
Edward Berenson, a history professor at New York University and the author of the book “The Statue of Liberty: A Transatlantic Story,” told The Washington Post in May, “One of the first meanings [of the statue] had to do with abolition, but it’s a meaning that didn’t stick.” In fact, by the time of the statue’s unveiling, “the original meaning of the abolition of slavery had pretty much gotten lost” and went unmentioned in newspaper coverage.
He quotes a black newspaper editorial in his book that read:
“Shove the Bartholdi statue, torch and all, into the ocean until the ‘liberty’ of this country is such as to make it possible for an industrious and inoffensive colored man in the South to earn a respectable living for himself and family. … The idea of the ‘liberty’ of this country ‘enlightening the world,’ or even Patagonia, is ridiculous in the extreme.”
You see, between the time the statue was conceived and when it was erected, the United States had allowed Reconstruction to fail and allowed Jim Crow to rise.
There were people right here in America, black ones, yearning to be free, and the federal government did very little to help facilitate that freedom.
This week, when talking about the Trump administration’s new rule, Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, the acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, altered the statue’s poem: “Give me your tired and your poor who can stand on their own two feet, and who will not become a public charge.”
He made the television rounds that night and was repeatedly asked about the poem and his revision. During one appearance he said the poem referred to “people coming from Europe, where they had class-based societies where people were considered wretched if they weren’t in the right class.”
One point he got wrong: Many of the people coming from Europe were indeed peasants. But I believe he is right to say that the spirit of the beaconing is to people from Europe. And I believe that it was racist then, as it is now.
It is poetically telling and meaningful that the statue stands with her back to America and her face toward Europe.
And the federal government has never shied away from giving these white peasants support. It only chafes at giving things to nonwhite people.
This is why Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. could say in his “The Other America” speech at Stanford University in 1967:
In 1863 the Negro was freed from the bondage of physical slavery. But at the same time, the nation refused to give him land to make that freedom meaningful. And at that same period America was giving millions of acres of land in the West and the Midwest, which meant that America was willing to undergird its white peasants from Europe with an economic floor that would make it possible to grow and develop, and refused to give that economic floor to its black peasants, so to speak.
In response to Cuccinelli’s words, presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren tweeted:
“‘Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.’ Our values are etched in stone on the Statue of Liberty. They will not be replaced. And I will fight for those values and for our immigrant communities.”
But that is a well-meaning but historically false reading of America’s values. For most of American history, the country has never truly welcomed nonwhite immigrants. And now that more of the people wanting to come through the golden door are nonwhite, many Americans want to slam it shut.
Just four years before the statue was erected President Chester A. Arthur signed into law the Chinese Exclusion Act forbidding the immigration of Chinese laborers. That law wasn’t repealed until 1943.
Trump isn’t giving birth to a racist policy; he’s resurrecting one.
Trying to use the Statue of Liberty as a symbol to fight this racism is to me a misstep because there is too much history that fights against it.
Lady Liberty wasn’t born a hypocrite, but America made her one.

Texto completo: The Glenbard Parent Series Navigating Healthy Families is partnering with the Glen Ellyn Public Library for a discussion of the true crime thriller, "Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI."
Be a part of the book chat of this New York Times bestseller and the Glenbard Parent Series community read at 7 p.m. Wednesday, Aug. 28, at the Glen Ellyn Public Library, 400 Duane St.
At the end of the 19th century, the Osage Indians were driven onto presumed-worthless land — but their Oklahoma reservation turned out to be atop one of the largest U.S. oil deposits, turning members of the Osage Nation into some of the wealthiest people in the world. And ultimately, marking them for death!
Exposing the turbulent history of the relations between whites and the Osage Nation over the course of more than a century, this book provides a look at the deep-seated prejudices that continue to cast a shadow over our country, and how, ultimately, a team from the fledgling FBI, led by old-style Texas lawman Tom White, solved a shocking murder case directed at members of the Osage Nation.
On Thursday, Sept 5, hear the author David Grann, a National Book Award finalist, at a Glenbard Parent Series program at 7 p.m. at Glenbard West High School, 670 Crescent Blvd. in Glen Ellyn.
Grann will further explore his riveting book, based on essential American history. The book is being made into a major motion picture with director Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo DiCaprio.
Grann is a New York Times bestselling author and an award-winning staff writer at The New Yorker magazine. Before joining The New Yorker in 2003, Grann was a senior editor at The New Republic, and, from 1995 until 1996, the executive editor of the newspaper The Hill. He holds master’s degrees in international relations from the Fletcher School of Law & Diplomacy as well as in creative writing from Boston University. After graduating from Connecticut College in 1989, he received a Thomas Watson Fellowship and did research in Mexico, where he began his career in journalism.
Additional support of this program comes from One Community.

Sometimes slow news is the answer

Texto completo: If, by some crazy chance, you wanted to be well-informed these past few days about the sudden death of Jeffrey Epstein, there was a way.
The minute you heard the news on Saturday morning that the financier and registered sex offender had died in his New York City prison cell, you would have turned off your digital devices.
You might have checked in briefly later, been immediately bombarded by conspiracy theories and inflammatory hashtags about body counts - including one irresponsibly retweeted by President Donald Trump - and wisely walked away again.
By Sunday night, nearly 48 hours after Epstein died, you would have been able to get a preliminary handle on what had really happened: His death was called an "apparent suicide; no, he was not on suicide watch at the time; no, he had no cellmate, nor had guards checked on him in at least an hour before he died.
These credible facts might have made you justifiably angry for any number of reasons. But your anger would have been grounded in reality - or something approaching it.
(Even in an article that established the believable basics mentioned above, the New York Times included this disclaimer within the first few paragraphs: "Officials cautioned that their initial findings about his detention were preliminary and could change.)
What we have here is an argument for what seems impossible in 2019: slow journalism.
That's not a joke, or an unwitting oxymoron: It's a real thing, modeled after the 30-year-old "slow food movement.
"We need to decide for ourselves what so-called news is worth our while, not just allow ourselves to be subjected to an endless barrage of unfiltered media assaults, wrote Peter Laufer, a University of Oregon professor and author of "Slow News: A Manifesto for the Critical News Consumer.
We're in danger, in the former NBC correspondent's view, "of missing the story because of the noise. (Doyle McManus sang the praises of slow journalism recently in a Los Angeles Times column unrelated to Epstein.)
Laufer's book (published in ancient times: 2011) advises such solid ideas as: "Trust accuracy over time, "Know your sources, and "Don't become a news junkie.
The multitude of worthy news-literacy efforts that have grown in recent years are preaching the same gospel: In journalism, speed kills. Be skeptical. Don't spread shaky information. Find reputable news sources; compare and contrast what they are reporting.
We know this. But it's not easy advice to follow.
"Three years of education, initiatives, conferences, philanthropic support to fight misinformation' ... and here we are, wrote Emily Bell, director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, as unfounded theories - Epstein body doubles, anyone? - multiplied last weekend.
If we are to assess blame for the awful information mess in a single word, its name is Twitter, particularly the platform's in-your-face "trending topics listing.
It was on Twitter, of course, that Trump amplified to his tens of millions of followers the suggestion of actor and comedian Terrence Williams that Epstein's death might be tied to former president Bill Clinton, hence the hashtag "#ClintonBodyCount.
Williams' claim, as a Washington Post news story put it bluntly, "is completely unsubstantiated.
So were plenty of other claims and counter claims ("#TrumpBodyCount).
Epstein must have been murdered was the one of the prevailing sentiments because, after all, he was on suicide watch - though he wasn't.
Lou Dobbs, the Trump confidante and Fox Business host, showed no qualms in spreading the ugliness.
Dobbs tweeted out his Clinton conspiracy theory to his 2 million followers over a New York Post story reporting that there hadn't been a suicide watch after all: "Epstein should at least have been on Arkanside Watch. And he added the obligatory, pro-Trump hashtag: #MAGA
As Charlie Warzel put it in the New York Times: "Twitter's trending algorithms hoovered up the worst of this detritus, curating, ranking and then placing it in the trending module on the right side of its website. That can give misinformation a false sense of importance and factuality.
By Monday, actual facts were circulating more widely - though many of them were attributed to anonymous sources within the prison system or Justice Department. That sourcing, while necessary in some circumstances, often engenders mistrust because it is opaque.
None of this has ever been easy. It's a journalistic truism that the earliest reports of a major news story, whether a mass shooting or natural disaster, are likely to contain errors, sometimes serious ones. As Rebecca Greenfield detailed in an Atlantic article, "The Media Was Always Bad at Reporting Breaking News, a Brief History, that problem goes back way before Twitter - to JFK's assassination, to the sinking of the Titanic, and to Dewey supposedly defeating Truman.
That's bad enough.
But when you stir in the toxins of today's politics, the lightning speed of social media and bad-faith amplification by powerful figures, the mixture is disastrous.
Breaking-news reporters don't have the luxury of slowing down their newsgathering, but they can avoid amplifying misinformation.
News consumers, though, can take an early look at a growing information disaster and make a healthy decision. They can shut off the fire hose of malignancy - and come back later when we might actually know something.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—The trial of President Obama's former White House counsel opened on Thursday, promising to shed new light on the inner workings of Washington lawyers, public relations firms and journalists.
In opening statements, prosecutors accused Gregory Craig —a veteran Democratic attorney who has served in two presidential administrations—of misleading a unit of the Justice Department responsible for enforcing the laws about foreign government representation.
"Gregory B. Craig had a choice. He could tell the truth and be forthcoming when the Department of Justice asked him questions about his work for a foreign government, or he could lie and conceal," said Molly Gaston, a federal prosecutor who delivered the government's opening statement before a crowded courtroom here on Thursday morning.
"We are here today because the defendant chose to lie and conceal," Ms. Gaston said.
Mr. Craig's lawyers painted a much different picture—portraying him as a diligent attorney who spoke to the media about his work on behalf of the government of Ukraine because he worried it was being misrepresented by Kiev's hired U.S. PR agents. They dismissed suggestions he was part of a PR campaign on Ukraine's behalf and rejected claims that he lied to the U.S. government to cover it up.
"The evidence will show that Gregory Craig is entirely innocent," said Bill Taylor, a defense attorney for Mr. Craig.
Mr. Craig, 74 years old, served in senior legal roles for two Democratic presidents, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. He also has been a top State Department adviser and Capitol Hill aide. But it is his work in 2012, after he left the Obama White House, that has come under scrutiny.
The trial pits the longtime public servant determined to clear his name in court against a Justice Department bent on a more aggressively enforcing laws governing work done by Americans for foreign governments. Mr. Craig is on trial for one count related to false statements prosecutors say he made to the Justice Department component that enforces the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA.
The charges against Mr. Craig grew out of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of President Trump's former 2016 campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and his years of work for the pro-Russia regime in power in Kiev. Mr. Manafort and his associate Richard Gates pleaded guilty to crimes related to their Ukraine work.
Mr. Gates is expected to be called as a witness in the Craig trial, prosecutors said.
At issue is work Mr. Craig performed for Ukraine while he was at the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP in 2012. Skadden Arps was hired by the pro-Russian regime that was then in power in Ukraine to evaluate the fairness of the corruption trial of former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko. The firm ultimately concluded that Ms. Tymoshenko's trial didn't meet Western standards of justice but also declined to answer whether there was any political motive in her prosecution or whether she was innocent of the charges.
Skadden has since entered into a $4.6 million settlement with the U.S. government —the fee the law firm collected from the client in this case. Mr. Craig has left the firm.
The opening day of the trial revealed deep disagreements between prosecutors and defense attorneys about Mr. Craig's role after his report was delivered. Prosecutors say Mr. Craig was tapped by several Washington PR consultants to help advance a pro-Ukraine narrative in the U.S.
After Mr. Craig was contacted by the Justice Department, prosecutors said he engaged in a pattern of misrepresentations and half-truths to avoid registering as a foreign agent.
Mr. Craig's lawyers disputed this interpretation of events. They said that he wasn't part of any PR effort, and that Skadden had insisted on independence in the drafting of the report. They said Mr. Craig was concerned about the reputation of the firm and didn't want the Tymoshenko report to be portrayed in the press as vindicating Ukraine's trial of her.
"He was not signing up to do some sort of a whitewash," said Mr. Taylor, Mr. Craig's attorney, about the integrity of the firm's Ukraine findings.
As a result of his concerns about how the report would be received, he contacted David Sanger of the New York Times—a longtime acquaintance—in order to ensure that the newspaper properly covered Skadden's findings. Evidence introduced by Mr. Craig's lawyers also showed how he spoke to several other reporters, even offering to be an anonymous source to a British reporter.
He disclosed most of those contacts, but prosecutors said his answers were misleading and designed to conceal his role in a PR effort. The distinction is important because legal work typically is not governed by FARA, but public relations work is more strictly controlled.
The government's first witness revealed that Skadden was simultaneously working on not one but two projects for Ukraine—and that there were internal concerns that they represented a conflict of interest. Michael Loucks, a partner at Skadden, testified that he and other Skadden lawyers were secretly advising the Ukranian government and writing a report on a similar topic.
"Project One" was the report on the integrity of Ms. Tymoshenko's 2011 trial on corruption. But there was also a "Project Two"—advice the firm was providing about a second potential trial against Ms. Tymoshenko on tax charges. Mr. Loucks said he was worried about the appearance of a conflict of interest, and as a result, he played no role in the drafting of the Project One report.

Texto completo: MANCHESTER, N. H. – President Donald Trump touted the nation's economy during a rally in New Hampshire on Thursday even as investors skittish over the possibility of a global slowdown have roiled markets and put the White House on defense.
Trump, who has visited the state only once before as president, trumpeted the state's low unemployment – New Hampshire had the fourth-best jobless rate in the country in June – as he underscored an economic message long central to his campaign.
"We are doing well with China despite the fact that they want to have you believe to the contrary," Trump told an enthusiastic crowd packed inside the Southern New Hampshire University Arena. "The tariffs are working. "
But the president's visit came as his administration has sought to distance itself from wild market swings caused in part by fears of a worldwide recession and global trade wars. The Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its worst plunge of the year Wednesday, though the market returned to positive territory midday Thursday.
"Before the election, our factories were closing," Trump said. "Today our nation is stronger than ever before. "
Trump's message resonated with many in the audience.
“New Hampshire’s economy is thriving,” said Elizabeth Girarld, chairwoman of New Hampshire Young Republicans, pointing to lower unemployment figures under Trump.
Timothy Lahey, a 55-year-old from Massachusetts said the stock market slide is “just a little scare on the side of the Democrats wanting to believe there’s going to be a recession or something. ”
“The economy is fantastic,” said Lahey, who works in the carpentry industry and was, attending his first Trump rally. “Everybody’s out and about. ”
Marilouise Bunker, 68, an apartment manager from Connecticut, said the economy is “great” and credited Trump’s effort to cut federal regulations as the cause.
“The stock market goes up and down," she said. "Something happens and they get scared and it crashes. It will come back. ”
Around a thousand Trump supporters stood outside the arena hours before the rally started. Chants of “USA! USA! USA” broke out and supporters listened to a country music band before the doors opened.
Carolyn Sires, 57, a physical therapist who operates her own practice, pointed to the economy as a driving issue for her support of Trump even amid the recent stock market struggles.
“I own a business in West Haven and I was really suffering and, not right away, but actually this year I feel it – the economy,” she said. “I’m giving not only raises and bonuses, I’m not worried anymore about making payroll. I’m not worried about giving incentive bonuses. I’m actually going to work without a worry and I love that. ”
Tweets from New Jersey
The president is ostensibly on summer holiday at his golf resort in Bedminster, N. J. , but the trip to New Hampshire marks his second major public event this week. He also traveled to Western Pennsylvania Tuesday for a raucous, rally-like event.
He also has remained active on Twitter. In more than a dozen posts in the hours before the rally, Trump weighed in on the recent Philadelphia shootings, blasted two Democratic congresswomen he claimed "hate Israel & all Jewish people," defended his China tariffs and called attention to a New York Times editor who had been demoted.

"The United States is now, by far, the Biggest, Strongest and Most Powerful Economy in the World, it is not even close!" he wrote. "As others falter, we will only get stronger. "
Trump has also taken time in recent days to tout an ex-campaign aide who is now considering a run for Senate in New Hampshire. Corey Lewandowski, the first manager of Trump's renegade 2016 presidential campaign, got a shout-out from stage.
Trump did not invite Lewandowski on stage as he has with others in the past.
"Corey Lewandowski loves your state, loves New Hampshire. I’m hearing he’s thinking about running for Senate from New Hampshire – I don’t know," Trump said. "I think it’d be tough to beat. He’s going to do a job if he does do it. He would be fantastic. "
Some Republicans in the state have raised concerns about Lewandowski's potential candidacy. Republican New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, who was reportedly among the state officials voicing concerns about Lewandowski, met Trump at the airport and then attended the rally.
Granite State headwinds
The president narrowly lost New Hampshire to Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016. So far, the president has been more likely to travel to Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – where he won – than Minnesota, Maine and New Hampshire, where he lost.
On the other hand, Trump had a key primary win in the state in 2016 after placing second in Iowa. "You remember in the primary when I won New Hampshire?" Trump asked the local radio station. "That was really something special. "
Trump's visit comes during a heightened national debate over gun control following the recent mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio. Trump has said he is optimistic for bipartisan gun control legislation, one of the nation's most contentious issues.
Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. , and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. , both of whom represent neighboring states, also campaigned in New Hampshire this week. Twenty-one of the Democratic presidential campaigns signed onto a statement blasting Trump ahead of his visit.
“Donald Trump’s presidency has been defined by broken promises, hateful rhetoric, and choosing to side with lobbyists and the top 1% at the expense of everyone else," the New Hampshire directors of the competing campaigns wrote in the joint statement. "This week, when he comes to New Hampshire we expect more of the same. "
A Granite State Poll conducted this month by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center found that 42% of New Hampshire adults approve of Trump and 53% disapprove. The poll showed nearly half approve of Trump’s handling of the economy.
Darlene Willey-Sliwa, a 71-year-old Massachusetts woman, who owns a funeral home, said she was attending her eighth Trump rally but her first since the 2016 cycle. After years of voting Democratic, she said she turned Republican three years ago with Trump.
She touted Trump’s “get-tough policy” on foreign affairs and trade along with his hard-line approach to immigration as some of her priorities. “I believe this man believes in that,” she said.
“The Democratic Party as I grew up and knew it does not exist anymore. It’s far too left wing, and there’s very little in the party that I can relate to,” Willey-Sliwa said.
She attended the rally with two others from western Massachusetts who also said in 2016 they switched from voting Democratic. That includes Cinthia Demerski, 68, of Monson, Massachusetts, at her third Trump rally.
"I think it was a feeling of bringing the country back on track,"" Demerski said. "The work ethic. The American way. The Constitution. Conservative family values. And hard work ethics that we were getting away from. "

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The House Judiciary Committee served a subpoena Thursday to President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, another advance in the congressional investigations of the White House.
The committee also served a subpoena for Rick Dearborn, a former deputy chief of staff for policy at the White House, in its investigation of possible obstruction of justice by Trump, as described in former special counsel Robert Mueller's report. Both are requested to testify at a hearing Sept. 17.
The committee investigating whether to recommend impeachment for Trump has focused on Lewandowski and former White House counsel Don McGahn because they are described in Mueller's report in several episodes of potential obstruction of justice.
“The committee intends to hold hearings and obtain testimony over the coming months as part of its efforts to hold the president accountable as we move forward with our investigation into obstruction, corruption and abuse of power by Trump and his associates," said Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N. Y. "This will help the committee determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment against the president or other Article 1 remedies. No one is above the law. ”
McGahn: Random judge assignment ordered for Don McGahn subpoena case, a victory for Justice Department against House
Trump has blasted the multiple congressional investigations of him and his administration as a witch hunt and partisan harassment.
Trump retweeted news of Lewandowski potentially campaigning for U. S. Senate in New Hampshire, where the president planned to speak Thursday. Lewandowski said he would get a lot of support if he challenges Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen.
"Corey Lewandowski I think would be terrific, if he ran. But I don’t know that he’s going to run," Trump told reporters before boarding his flight to New Hampshire. "If he did it, I think he’d be very formidable. "
Mueller made no decision about whether to charge Trump with obstruction because the Justice Department has a policy against charging a sitting president. But House Democrats have continued to investigate.
Mueller's report described Trump asking Lewandowski, who never worked for the administration, to urge then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to limit the Russia inquiry and call it "unfair," according to the report. If Sessions refused to meet with him, Trump told Lewandowski to fire him, according to the report.
Other Trump aides have defied subpoenas. The Judiciary Committee held Attorney General William Barr in contempt for refusing to provide an unredacted version of Mueller's report, and the full House found Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt for refusing to provide documents about a citizenship question for the census.
'Judge shopping': Justice Department argues House panel is 'judge shopping' for favorable opinion to force Don McGahn's testimony
Other House panels have won court rulings for access to Trump's personal financial documents, but the president has appealed those rulings. The Judiciary Committee filed a lawsuit Friday seeking access to grand-jury evidence supporting the Mueller report, which Barr blacked out in the version he provided Congress. And the panel continues to press Trump aides and associates with subpoenas.
On June 19, 2017, Trump met one-on-one in the Oval Office with Lewandowski, a trusted adviser outside the government, and dictated a message to deliver to Sessions, according to the Mueller report. Sessions had recused himself from the Russia investigation because he worked for Trump's campaign, but the president dictated that Sessions should call the inquiry "very unfair" and that Trump had done nothing wrong, the report said.
One month later, in another private meeting July 19, 2017, Trump asked Lewandowski about the status of his message for Sessions to limit the investigation, according to the Mueller report. Lewandowski told the President that the message would be delivered soon. Hours after that meeting, Trump criticized Sessions in an interview with the New York Times, and then issued a series of tweets making it clear that Sessions's job was in jeopardy.
Lewandowski did not want to deliver Trump's message personally, so he asked Dearborn to deliver it to Sessions, according to the Mueller report. Dearborn was uncomfortable with the task and did not follow through, the report said.

Rockland twins' death makes activist angry

Texto completo: Kristie Reeves-Cavaliero lives in Austin, Texas. But recently, she couldn't stop thinking about a family across the country in Rockland County that she never met — Juan and Marissa Rodriguez and their children.
Nearly 1-year-old twins Luna and Phoenix Rodriguez died in late July after they were left in their father's hot car for eight hours while he was at work at the James J. Peters VA Medical Center in the Bronx. Juan Rodriguez, a 39-year-old Iraq War vet, told police he "blanked out" and thought he had dropped them at day care.
"We are having a lot of PTSD triggers from this case," said Reeves-Cavaliero.
The Texas pharmacist is a mother of twins now. But the case has haunted her and her husband, Brett Cavaliero, for a deeper reason.
Their daughter, Sophia Rayne Cavaliero, or Ray Ray, died in 2011 at age 1 after being left in a hot car. Brett Cavaliero thought he dropped her off at day care on his way to work. But he hadn't. She was found in the back of his truck three hours later. But it was too late.
Reeves-Cavaliero can't believe such senseless and awful loss is still happening.
"Our child died eight years ago, when she died she was about about the 498th case since 1998," said Reeves-Cavaliero, who has become an advocate for any and all methods that could prevent more heat stroke deaths of babies left in cars. "Since her death we're up to almost 800 kids — there have been more than 300 kids who have died since my child died.
"As a parent who's worked tirelessly with the child safety advocates and the politicians, it just makes me mad as hell," Reeves-Cavaliero said.
Preventing hot-car deaths The Cavalieros established Ray Ray's Pledge, which encourages day care providers to call a parent if a child has not been dropped off. Forgotten day care dropoff is the No. 1 source of child hot car deaths.
Social media comments have questioned if the twins' day care, located in Yonkers, had called about the their absence. Family and friends have said they didn't, and have not named the provider.
Reeves-Calaviero said that in most states, there is no mandate for child care providers to call about absences, which is done in K-12 schools.
No such mandate could be found in New York State Office of Children and Family Services regulations.
Child Care Resources of Rockland, which provides support and training for childcare providers and referrals for families, strongly recommends providers have a policy addressing absences, CCRR Executive Director Vicki Caramante said. "Reach out to a family if a child is absent without the program being notified," Caramante said. "Our staff is available to help programs write these policies and procedures."
Other measures can be taken to keep kids safe.
On the federal level, the HOT CARS Act — for Helping Overcome Trauma for Children Alone in Rear Seats — would mandate that new vehicles come with alert systems to remind drivers if a child is left in the backseat.
A state bill mandating backseat detection devices for vehicles sold in New York will be introduced this week by Sen. David Carlucci, D-New City. "The technology is available. Automotive manufacturers are already putting them in certain models," Carlucci said. "Everyone thinks it will never happen to them, but it does. That's why we need to ... make this technology standard in all new cars."
There are also several apps and other devices that remind drivers to check the back seat.
Alfredo Angueira, a friend of Juan Rodriguez since their days at SUNY Albany, said he's been surprised by how much technology exists to prevent this kind of tragedy.
"You can turn on your air conditioner from your cellphone," Angueira said. "In this day and age, this is not necessary anymore."
Fifty-two children died after being left in hot cars in 2018, the highest number of vehicular heatstroke deaths in the last 21 years, according to noheatstroke.org. So far this year, 24 children have died; Phoenix and Luna Rodriguez were the 22nd and 23rd fatalities.
Accident or crime It was Angueira who first mentioned to Juan Rodriguez the concept of Forgotten Baby Syndrome – a neurobiological state in which a person's brain believes a child is no longer in the backseat of a vehicle. "He hadn't heard of it."
Rodriguez, the New York Times reported, called David Diamond, a University of South Florida professor who is an expert of Forgotten Baby Syndrome, to find out more.
Angueira was not surprised that Rodriguez, who has a master's degree in social work, went to a primary source to research what had happened.
"Finding out information behind a condition is basically what he's done his entire career," Angueira said. "I think any one of us, your mind is going to search for answers. This isn't you, you love your children, what happened?"
Rodriguez was arrested Friday and jailed, Now out on bail, he was in court Thursday morning in the Bronx. Rodriguez has been charged with two counts of second-degree manslaughter and two counts of criminally negligent homicide, both felonies, as well as two misdemeanor counts of endangering the welfare of a child. While the Bronx District Attorney is still weighing whether to send the case to a grand jury, Rodriguez' lawyer has said the DA should not charge him because it was an accident. The case was adjourned until Aug. 27.
Parents are charged with a crime about 50% of the time when a child dies in a hot car, according to Amber Rollins, director of Kids and Cars, a Kansas-based organization that is dedicated to saving the lives of children in and around cars.
"Juan being charged brings back so much how they treat the parents," said Reeves-Cavaliero, whose husband was investigated in Ray Ray's death but not charged. "The last thing that this family needed was for this guy to be arrested at a time like that."
Angueira said that Juan and his family had not been focused on the criminal case. "He's dealing with his mental state, his wife's mental state," Angueira said. Everything else, he said, is "tertiary."

Texto completo: Theodore E. McCarrick, the prominent Roman Catholic cardinal who was defrocked early this year for sexual abuse, brought one of his victims, James Grein, then 30, to meet Pope John Paul II in 1988.
It was a private audience, Mr. Grein recalled as he became one of hundreds of people to begin filing lawsuits on Wednesday under the Child Victims Act. The new state law says that for one year, sexual abuse victims of any age in New York -- including, crucially, those whose cases had expired under the old statute of limitations -- can take legal action.
After Mr. McCarrick, then the archbishop of Newark, left the room, Mr. Grein said he knelt before the pope and revealed, in the presence of several Vatican officials, that Mr. McCarrick had been sexually abusing him since childhood.
"I told him I had been abused as a child by this man, and I need you to stop it," said an emotional Mr. Grein, who is now 61. "He put both hands on my head, and told me he would pray for me."
No other action was taken, his lawsuit states.
Mr. Grein's lawsuit was made possible by the Child Victims Act, which was approved in January and greatly expanded the ability of child sex abuse victims to hold institutions and individuals accountable for abuse.
Victims of sexual abuse in New York were previously required to file civil lawsuits by their 23rd birthdays. Under the new law, they now have until age 55, and for one year, starting on Wednesday, they can be even older than that.
The window may become a powerful lever for clergy abuse victims to find out how extensive the cover-up of sexual abuse was in the Catholic Church and whether top Vatican officials knew about it.
Hundreds of lawsuits across the state were filed on Wednesday, with hundreds more, if not thousands, expected.
They involve defendants that include the Catholic Church to Rockefeller University in Manhattan to the Boy Scouts, as well as public and private schools and foster care organizations. Each suit will attempt to show that individuals and institutions are liable because they failed to protect children from sexual abuse.
Like dozens of other victims, Mr. Grein is suing the Archdiocese of New York, where Mr. McCarrick was serving as a priest when he began abusing Mr. Grein at the age of 11. Mr. Grein, the son of a family friend of Mr. McCarrick's, was the first baby that the young priest baptized. The sexual relationship the priest began with the boy lasted for about two decades, Mr. Grein said.
Because his lawsuit claims that Mr. Grein told Pope John Paul II about the abuse, his legal team will seek to depose Vatican officials and gain access to secret Vatican documents.
The strategy underscores perhaps the most powerful aspect of the thousands of lawsuits that are expected to be filed this year: By giving plaintiffs the power to subpoena private institutional records, the lawsuits could open a window into how institutions handled abusers in their midst.
"The cover-up has ended and now we are going right to the top," Mitchell Garabedian, Mr. Grein's lawyer, said at a news conference on Wednesday in front of St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan. "We are attempting to show that the Vatican knew that McCarrick was abusing James Grein."
Michelle Simpson Tuegel, a lawyer whose firm was filing cases against Catholic dioceses across New York, said the start of the look-back window was a crucial moment for sexual abuse survivors who previously had no recourse. The discovery process, she said, is crucial.
"It's about so much more than compensation," Ms. Simpson Tuegel said. "It's healing to know that you're not alone, that they did make mistakes, that you were a child and adults failed to protect you, and that they're going to have to pay for that."
The lawsuits will also mark the first time that some alleged abusers will be publicly named, leading to a possible domino effect if long-silent victims see others step forward, and decide to do the same.
"This act is having such an impact in ways that aren't even legal ways," Ms. Simpson Tuegel said. "But in human ways: in opening something up that needed to be opened, as far as the discourse within families, within communities and the larger public."
For Auset Love, 45, it took more than three decades, she said, to feel that her abuser could be held accountable. She was about 9 when the abuse began, she said Wednesday. A recent immigrant from Haiti, she spoke little English when her homeroom teacher at a Brooklyn public school began molesting her, according to a lawsuit filed Wednesday in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn.
Ms. Love said the teacher would call her up to his desk to review a class assignment, then slip his hand under her skirt to rub her vagina. "I'm proud of you," she recalled him saying. Ms. Love began to perform poorly on assignments and was sent for additional tutoring to the teacher's house, where she said she was repeatedly fondled.
Over the years, as the statute of limitations for recourse ran out, she said she began cutting herself and contemplated suicide. On Wednesday, Ms. Love filed a lawsuit against the teacher and the New York City Department of Education.
"It gives myself a voice, and everyone else who is ready to come, to let the world know what happened to them," said Ms. Love, a nursing assistant in Westchester County.
The teacher named in the lawsuit retired in 2004, according to a spokeswoman for the education department. "Every survivor deserves to be heard, and we have clear policies to ensure any allegation is immediately reported, investigated and addressed," said the spokeswoman, Danielle Filson.
Darrell Jackson, 57, who grew up in Brooklyn, joined the Boy Scouts of America in the 1970s when he was about 10.
At the time, Mr. Jackson said on Wednesday, he viewed his scoutmaster as a kind of father figure. Mr. Jackson's father was not around, he said, and he was raised by his grandmother.
"And, you know, it was great in the beginning," he said. "And then, like I said, it just turned into something else."
He said he has been attempting to bring a case against the Boy Scouts of America since his late 20s, but could not until the law was changed.
Mr. Grein said Wednesday felt like a moment of redemption. His account of abuse by Mr. McCarrick, publicly disclosed for the first time last summer in The New York Times, was a crucial aspect of the evidence considered by a Vatican court as it convicted and then defrocked Mr. McCarrick.
In February, the Vatican stripped Mr. McCarrick, 89, of his titles and clerical status. He is living in a friary in Kansas, his former spokeswoman, Susan Gibbs, said. Mr. Grein also plans to sue Mr. McCarrick personally, once a look-back window for abuse claims opens in New Jersey, where he has said some of the abuse occurred, his lawyer said.
Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the Archdiocese of New York, said Wednesday that the archdiocese would "carefully review the claims made in these suits." In the meantime, he asked that "people pray for peace and healing for all those who have suffered from the sin and crime of the sexual abuse of minors, wherever it occurred."
Mr. Grein said at the news conference, "It is our chance, our historical gift from God, that we are able to go forward today and get this done."

Texto completo: Fact-checking journalists lean left, as Mark Hemingway documented in a canonical Washington Examiner analysis that is just as valid today as when it was published in 2011. But as John F. Kennedy once said, when asked why he wasn’t supporting an odiferous Massachusetts Democrat, “Sometimes party loyalty asks too much.”
Case in point: The two solemn statements by Democratic presidential candidates. Last Friday at 2:24 p.m., Kamala Harris tweeted, “Michael Brown’s murder forever changed Ferguson and America.” Half an hour later, Elizabeth Warren got more specific: “5 years ago Michael Brown was murdered by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.” They weren’t the only candidates marking the anniversary, but the others carefully avoided calling it a murder.
Correctly so, as the intensive investigation by President Barack Obama’s and Eric Holder’s Justice Department concluded that the officer fired on Brown in justified self-defense. Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler awarded Harris and Warren “four Pinocchios” and called their dismissal of the Justice Department report “even more galling.”
Vox’s German Lopez wrote, “Five years after the shooting, though, major presidential campaigns are still getting the details wrong.”
“Harris, Warren wrong about Brown shooting,” reads the headline on a factcheck.org story by Lori Robertson.
Were these fact-checkers’ responses just an attempt to uphold the repute of the Obama administration, so many of whose policies have been attacked and scorned by many Democratic candidates? It's unlikely. The candidates’ error was too blatant.
But they may have been surprised to be called out on it. Their staffs did not respond to the fact-checkers’ inquiries and none retracted or explained their mistake. Perhaps they feared blowback on Twitter if they did. Perhaps they genuinely (and unprofessionally) misremembered the incident.
And perhaps they expected that nobody, at least no one on their ideological side, would challenge an accusation of white racism. For that certainly has been the response of liberal media to the claims of Democrat Stacey Abrams that she “won” the election for governor of Georgia last November.
Actually, she lost, 50% to 49%, to Republican Brian Kemp. His popular vote margin was 54,723 out of 3,902,093 votes cast, a close race, but an unambiguous result. Abrams had plenty of reason to be proud of her run: She got 800,000 more votes than any previous Democrat and a higher percentage than any Democrat since 1998. But it’s simply factually wrong to say she “won.”
Abrams argues that she only came up short because Kemp, as secretary of state, eliminated 1.4 million people from the Georgia voter rolls. But, as Mark Hemingway points out, that was in line with federal legislation that requires purging the names of those who haven’t voted and haven’t responded to attempted contacts.
Abrams wants you to think that this is voter suppression, in line with the barring of black people to vote in Georgia and other Southern states before passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In those days black Americans risked their lives if they tried to register to vote. Saying that current requirements, such as showing photo ID, are the same kind of suppression is a vicious lie.
Vicious, because it distorts American history; because it understates the diminution of racism and racial discrimination over the past half-century; because it understates the bravery of the black and other Americans who risked everything to advance equality under the law.
Why do politicians such as Harris, Warren, and Abrams make such refutable (if not often refuted) claims? The cynical explanation is that they’re appealing to black voters and promising to redress their grievances. But how many black Americans really believe they’re barred from voting or more vulnerable to police violence than half a century ago?
Maybe instead they’re "virtue signaling" to the college-graduate whites who are the dominant segment of the Democratic electorate these days. What “sounds like an exclusive appeal to minority voters,” writes the New York Post’s Michael Goodwin, is “just as likely to be aimed at those whites embarrassed by their race.”
“People of color are not the driving force behind most of today’s forms of racial liberalism,” wrote political scientist Eric Kaufmann in the New York Times last March. “The share of white liberals who say racial prejudice is the main reason blacks cannot get ahead has jumped substantially since 2014," the year Michael Brown was shot in Ferguson.
But facts are stubborn things. The Mueller report has forced the Democrats to stop playing the Russia card. And now journalistic fact-checkers are disciplining their attempts to play the racism card. Whether either card trumps Trump for the middle of the electorate is unclear.

Prison deaths require no dark conspiracy

Texto completo: If only it took some dark conspiracy for a federal inmate like Jeffrey Epstein — or any inmate — to kill himself while in custody.
The news that the financier and sex offender accused of abusing scores of underage girls apparently committed suicide in a New York detention facility last week set off a frenzy of wild speculation. The high-profile detainee claimed to have damaging information on powerful men of all political persuasions. President Trump, the conspiracist-in-chief who was himself a friend of Epstein, helped spread the baseless accusation that the Clintons were responsible for silencing Epstein forever.
His death must have been engineered by somebody, proclaimed the Twitter sleuths. Otherwise, how could Epstein, who had already attempted suicide once, have died?
All too easily, comes the reply from anybody who has spent time working in this country's prisons, and especially its jails. There, inmates die all too often, not from some nefarious scheme, but of neglect — intentional and otherwise.
Mundane factors like understaffing, indifference, and lousy training can be deadly in their own way. The pretrial detention facility in which Epstein was held was well known for its overcrowded, inhumane conditions, including grave medical neglect. It was one of many federal prisons which were so chronically understaffed that teachers and secretaries were pressed into service as correctional officers, according to The New York Times.
One such substitute was tasked with guarding Epstein, who had been taken off suicide watch, on the night he died. Another officer was working his fifth straight overtime shift. Neither checked on Epstein for a three-hour period, even though they should have been looking in on him every 30 minutes. After they discovered he had hanged himself, they reportedly falsified records to cover up their inattention.
It's a familiar scenario to advocates like Leslie Walker of Prisoners Legal Services of Massachusetts. According to the New England Center for Investigative reporting, four inmates killed themselves in this state's prisons in 2018, and three committed suicide in county jails. Over the years, Walker and her colleagues have seen plenty of cases where inmates have committed suicide after corrections officers have skipped rounds.
“It's not infrequent to have the logs tampered with, or not filled out, or the log books look fine but the cameras reveal an officer has never left his or her desk," she said. Prisoners can figure out pretty quickly if and when they'll have an opportunity to take their own lives.
She worries that the attorney general's investigation of a prison he himself oversees will end with the firing of the corrections officers who failed to do their jobs, and nothing more.
“Heads will roll, problem solved," Walker said. “It's a very quick and dirty way to make sure a systemic problem is not brought to light."
Nothing trains the attention of an indifferent public on the shortcomings of our prisons like the death of an infamous inmate: Epstein; or former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez, who killed himself at Souza Baranowski Correctional Center in Shirley in 2017; or James “Whitey" Bulger, who was murdered last year after being transferred to a notoriously violent federal facility in West Virginia.
Likewise, few ordinary people were focused on the abysmal state of prison medical care until the revelation that former House speaker Sal DiMasi's cancer went undiagnosed for six months as he served a federal corruption sentence.
Still, infamy only goes so far: DiMasi's trials clearly did little to improve conditions in federal prisons. And it's unlikely the death of the detestable Epstein will do much to change them either.
What ails our corrections system is too mundane, too difficult to fix, to hold our attention for long — especially when we could enjoy a juicy conspiracy theory instead.

Texto completo: If, by some crazy chance, you wanted to be well-informed these past few days about the sudden death of Jeffrey Epstein, there was a way.
The minute you heard the news on Saturday morning that the financier and registered sex offender had died in his New York City prison cell, you would have turned off your digital devices.
You might have checked in briefly later, been immediately bombarded by conspiracy theories and inflammatory hashtags about body counts - including one irresponsibly retweeted by President Trump - and wisely walked away again.
By Sunday night, nearly 48 hours after Epstein died, you would have been able to get a preliminary handle on what had really happened: His death was called an "apparent suicide"; no, he was not on suicide watch at the time; no, he had no cellmate, nor had guards checked on him in at least an hour before he died.
These credible facts might have made you justifiably angry for any number of reasons. But your anger would have been grounded in reality - or something approaching it.
(Even in an article that established the believable basics mentioned above, the New York Times included this disclaimer within the first few paragraphs: "Officials cautioned that their initial findings about his detention were preliminary and could change.")
What we have here is an argument for what seems impossible in 2019: slow journalism.
That's not a joke or an unwitting oxymoron: It's a real thing, modeled after the 30-year-old "slow food" movement.
"We need to decide for ourselves what so-called news is worth our while, not just allow ourselves to be subjected to an endless barrage of unfiltered media assaults," wrote Peter Laufer, a University of Oregon professor and author of "Slow News: A Manifesto for the Critical News Consumer."
We're in danger, in the former NBC correspondent's view, "of missing the story because of the noise." (Doyle McManus sang the praises of slow journalism recently in a Los Angeles Times column unrelated to Epstein.)
Laufer's book (published in ancient times: 2011) advises such solid ideas as: "Trust accuracy over time," "Know your sources" and "Don't become a news junkie."
The multitude of worthy news-literacy efforts that have grown in recent years are preaching the same gospel: In journalism, speed kills. Be skeptical. Don't spread shaky information. Find reputable news sources; compare and contrast what they are reporting.
We know this. But it's not easy advice to follow.
"Three years of education, initiatives, conferences, philanthropic support to 'fight misinformation' . . . and here we are," wrote Emily Bell, director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, as unfounded theories - Epstein body doubles, anyone? - multiplied last weekend.
If we are to assess blame for the awful information mess in a single word, its name is Twitter, particularly the platform's in-your-face "trending topics" listing.
It was on Twitter, of course, that Trump amplified to his tens of millions of followers the suggestion of actor and comedian Terrence K. Williams that Epstein's death might be tied to former president Bill Clinton, hence the hashtag "#ClintonBodyCount."
Williams's claim, as a Washington Post news story put it bluntly, "is completely unsubstantiated."
So were plenty of other claims and counter claims ("#TrumpBodyCount").
Epstein must have been murdered was the one of the prevailing sentiments because, after all, he was on suicide watch - though he wasn't.
Lou Dobbs, the Trump confidant and Fox Business host, showed no qualms in spreading the ugliness.
Dobbs tweeted out his Clinton conspiracy theory to his 2 million followers over a New York Post story reporting that there hadn't been a suicide watch after all: "Epstein should at least have been on Arkanside Watch." And he added the obligatory, pro-Trump hashtag: #MAGA.
As Charlie Warzel put it in the New York Times: "Twitter's trending algorithms hoovered up the worst of this detritus, curating, ranking and then placing it in the trending module on the right side of its website." That can give misinformation a false sense of importance and factuality.
By Monday, actual facts were circulating more widely - though many of them were attributed to anonymous sources within the prison system or Justice Department. That sourcing, while necessary in some circumstances, often engenders mistrust because it is opaque.
None of this has ever been easy. It's a journalistic truism that the earliest reports of a major news story, whether a mass shooting or natural disaster, are likely to contain errors, sometimes serious ones. As Rebecca Greenfield detailed in an Atlantic article, "The Media Was Always Bad at Reporting Breaking News, a Brief History," that problem goes back way before Twitter - to JFK's assassination, to the sinking of the Titanic and to Dewey supposedly defeating Truman.
That's bad enough.
But when you stir in the toxins of today's politics, the lightning speed of social media and bad-faith amplification by powerful figures, the mixture is disastrous.
Breaking-news reporters don't have the luxury of slowing down their newsgathering, but they can avoid amplifying misinformation.
News consumers, though, can take an early look at a growing information disaster and make a healthy decision. They can shut off the fire hose of malignancy - and come back later when we might actually know something.

Texto completo: Headnote Democrats don't have easy path to goal
WASHINGTON - As Congress wrestles with how to respond to a wave of mass shootings, leading Democrats are raising an idea once viewed as political suicide: reviving the ban on assault weapons, which barred Americans from purchasing certain military-style firearms for a decade until Republicans let it expire in 2004.
The idea is gaining traction on the presidential campaign trail, where former Vice President Joe Biden, an architect of the original 1994 assault weapons ban, and nearly all of the other Democratic candidates have embraced it. In an opinion piece published Monday in The New York Times, Biden vowed to make the 1994 law "even stronger," adding, "We have to get these weapons of war off our streets."
Two centrist Democrats who flipped Republican House seats last year - Reps. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey and Jason Crow of Colorado - also came out on Monday in favor of the ban, with an opinion piece in USA Today. Both are military veterans; Crow ousted a Republican incumbent after running on an aggressive platform of combating gun violence.
With strong opposition from Republicans, who are in charge of the Senate, and President Donald Trump in the White House, an assault weapons ban has virtually no chance of being signed into law before 2021. Nearly 200 House Democrats are backing legislation to reinstate the ban, which is not enough to even pass the House, and voting on such a measure would be politically risky for vulnerable moderates.
Still, the push by prominent Democrats - including former President Bill Clinton, who signed the original ban into law and outlined his support for it last week in an essay in Time magazine - does force the issue onto the 2020 campaign agenda. And it demonstrates just how much the politics of gun safety have changed over the last several years - and especially the last few weeks, after the back-to-back massacres in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio.
"The public has supported the assault weapons ban and they really support it when you remind them that we had it already and that these are weapons that the military uses," said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster. "The intensity has always been on the anti-gun-control side. Now the intensity is shifting onto the other side and the refrain out of Dayton - which is exactly the refrain the public has - is, 'Do something.'"
Polls show that a majority of Americans support an assault weapons ban, but the support is not bipartisan. A July poll by National Public Radio found that 57% of respondents were in favor of a ban on the sale of semi-automatic assault guns such as the AK-47 or the AR-15. But while 83% of Democrats said they were in favor of the ban, just 29% of Republicans supported it.
For years, the assault weapons ban was considered politically toxic for Democrats. After Clinton signed the ban into law in 1994, Democrats were trounced in the midterm elections. They lost control of the House, which they had held for 40 years, and among those who lost their seats was Speaker Tom Foley, who drew the ire of the National Rifle Association when he came out in favor of the ban and was the first sitting speaker to lose an election since 1862.
The outcome rattled Democrats, and their fears of the NRA only grew after Al Gore lost the presidency to George W Bush in 2000. Many Democrats, including Clinton, blamed the loss on Gore's stance on gun control.
"The NRA could rightly claim to have made Gingrich the House speaker," Clinton wrote in his autobiography in 2004, referring to Newt Gingrich, the Republican who succeeded Foley.
That same year, the assault weapons ban expired. Some Democrats remain skittish about it.
"There's still a lingering worry, but I think it's dissipating a bit," said Jim Kessler, vice president for policy at Third Way, a centrist Democratic organization, adding, "For probably two dozen House Democrats, it is a risky vote."
Support for universal background checks - an idea embraced by Trump and by Democrats and some Republicans - is much stronger. The NPR poll found that 89% of Americans support background checks on all gun purchases, including sales at gun shows and on the internet. A bill mandating background checks has already passed the House, and Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, has said he expects the Senate to debate the issue when it returns in September.

Texto completo: Aug. 21, 1863, marks one of the bloodiest days in Kansas history.
On that day, William Quantrill led more than 400 pro-slavery guerillas in a surprise attack on the city of Lawrence, killing more than 150 men and boys. In addition to the murder of citizens, the guerillas burned buildings and looted stores during the approximately four hours they were in the city.
One of those killed in the raid was James O’Neil, of Lecompton, whose body was returned to his hometown and buried in the pioneer cemetery known as Bald Eagle Cemetery, located on a bluff overlooking the Kansas River. Over the years, the gravestones disappeared and were presumed lost forever. However, after the recent discovery of O’Neil’s tombstone and that of a Lane University student, a project to preserve these tombstones was developed and carried out through the cooperative efforts of the city and township of Lecompton and the Lecompton Historical Society.
Paul Bahnmaier, president of the Lecompton Historical Society, answered questions about the project and upcoming events offered by the organization.
First of all, can you tell us a little about the Lecompton Historical Society, its formation and purpose?
The Lecompton Historical Society was formed in 1969. The purpose is to preserve and promote the rich national, state and local history of Lecompton. We have about 600 members.
The Lecompton Historical Society recently worked with the Lecompton township and city to preserve a tombstone associated with Quantrill’s Raid on Lawrence in 1863. Why was its preservation not done earlier?
James O’Neil was killed during Quantrill’s raid in 1863. His body was returned to Lecompton and buried in the Bald Eagle Cemetery. Later his son and wife were interred in the same cemetery. In 1942 a rock company purchased the property and the cemetery. The tombstones were removed to the side of the property. The graves were destroyed. The tombstones remained at the side of this property for many years. They eventually disappeared and were assumed to be lost forever.
Robert Parker, a young man, discovered the two stones in an overgrown brush pile deep into the woods on the other side of the hill several years ago. The property changed hands, and the present owners, Chad and Amy Gustin, contacted the Lecompton Historical Society about moving the stones. The stones were moved July 24 with the help of Lecompton city and township employees.
How many people were involved with this project?
This was a major undertaking, and with the help of Rance Roberts, Kevin Powell, Casey Quigley and Keven Bonham this historical project was completed. The tombstones have been moved to Maple Grove Cemetery in Lecompton.
Since the graves themselves were destroyed, why is preserving the tombstones so important?
It’s a way of preserving the names and family history. It is very important to preserve this history, and in doing this we’ve preserved a bit of Lecompton history, Kansas history, and U.S. history. It’s often been said that if you don’t where you came from, then you don’t know where you are going.
What are some of the projects the Historical Society has been involved with in the past?
The promotion of Constitution Hall, a national landmark; preserving the Territorial Capital Museum; the Kansas Democratic Headquarters; and the 1892 city jail.
What are some of the projects planned for the future?
We are planning for the annual exhibit of the “Best in the Midwest” Christmas display beginning Oct. 15 and running through Jan. 1. The display contains 170 trees including 100-year-old feather trees, visca, brush and other example of trees. The trees are decorated with Victorian, antique, collectable and themed ornaments. We are also a partner with the Winter family in the restoration of the Winter one room school.
Lecompton has several historical buildings. Is the historical society involved with the upkeep and operation of these sites?
We are responsible for
the upkeep of the Territorial Capital Museum, Kansas Territorial Democratic Headquarters and the 1892 city jail. We also are responsible for the promotion of Constitution Hall, a national landmark.
What hours are these buildings open to the public?
Constitution Hall is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Wednesday through Saturday and 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Sundays. The Territorial Capital Museum is open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Wednesday through Saturday and 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Sundays.
Anything else you would like to add?
The tagline for Lecompton is the “Birthplace of the Civil War, Where Slavery Began to Die.” This is correct because the debate over the Lecompton Constitution in the House of Representatives in Washington, D.C., resulted in the Democratic Party being split and four candidates running for president in 1860: Stephen Douglas, Northern Democrat; John Breckenridge, Southern Democrat; John Bell, Conservative Whig; Abraham Lincoln, Republican.
Lincoln won with 39% of the vote. Jonathan Earle, a history professor at KU, said in an interview by the New York Times on Nov. 23, 2012: “Lincoln would not have been president except for the Lecompton Constitution.” Also Alexander H Stephens, vice president of the Confederacy, stated in his memoirs: “It was on the admission of Kansas under the Lecompton Constitution that a disastrous split took place in the Democratic Party.”
We are also proud of the fact that David Eisenhower and Ida Stover were married at Lane University on Sept. 25, 1885. They became the parents of President Dwight Eisenhower.

Texto completo: The Los Angeles Opera, which Mr. Domingo helped found, will launch an inquiry into allegations reported by The Associated Press.
The opera star Plácido Domingo was placed under investigation on Tuesday by the Los Angeles Opera, which he helped found and has led since 2003, after The Associated Press reported that multiple women had accused him of sexual harassment over the years.
The allegations shook the opera world -- where Mr. Domingo remains, at 78, an enormous force. The Philadelphia Orchestra withdrew its invitation for Mr. Domingo to sing at its opening night gala next month, and the San Francisco Opera canceled a concert with him in October. The Metropolitan Opera, where Mr. Domingo is scheduled to star in Verdi's "Macbeth" next month opposite the soprano Anna Netrebko, said it would await the results of the Los Angeles Opera's investigation "before making any final decisions about Mr. Domingo's ultimate future at the Met."
The Associated Press reported the allegations of multiple women who said that Mr. Domingo had pressured them into sexual relationships in a series of encounters beginning in the late 1980s -- including seven women who said that they felt their careers had been harmed after they rebuffed him. Mr. Domingo said in a statement that he believed "all of my interactions and relationships were always welcomed and consensual."
Mr. Domingo, who has been married for more than 50 years, said in the statement that "the allegations from these unnamed individuals dating back as many as 30 years are deeply troubling, and as presented, inaccurate," but added that "it is painful to hear that I may have upset anyone or made them feel uncomfortable -- no matter how long ago and despite my best intentions."
He said that "the rules and standards by which we are -- and should be -- measured against today are very different than they were in the past" and pledged to hold himself "to the highest standards."
Mr. Domingo occupies a unique position in the opera world. After shooting to fame as a star tenor -- then reaching a far broader global audience as one of the Three Tenors, alongside Luciano Pavarotti and José Carreras -- he also became a conductor; founded the prestigious young artist competition Operalia; and began adding managerial positions, becoming the general director of Washington National Opera and then the Los Angeles Opera, a position he still holds. He also continues to have a prolific singing career in baritone roles.
These activities have made him one of the most influential figures in opera.
The Los Angeles Opera said in a statement that it would engage an outside counsel to investigate what it called "the concerning allegations" against Mr. Domingo.
"Plácido Domingo has been a dynamic creative force in the life of L.A. Opera and the artistic culture of Los Angeles for more than three decades," the opera company said in a statement. "Nevertheless, we are committed to doing everything we can to foster a professional and collaborative environment where all our employees and artists feel equally comfortable, valued and respected."
The A.P. spoke with eight singers and one dancer -- all but one of whom were quoted anonymously -- who said that Mr. Domingo had used his power to pursue them sexually. They described him as calling them repeatedly and making dates, often under the guise of offering professional advice. One accuser told the news agency that Mr. Domingo had stuck his hand down her skirt, and three others said that he had forced wet kisses on their lips, in a dressing room, a hotel room and at a lunch meeting.
One singer told the news agency that Mr. Domingo had repeatedly propositioned her at the Los Angeles Opera in 1998, the year the company announced that he would become its artistic director, eventually taking her to his apartment for what she described as "heavy petting" and "groping."
"I was totally intimidated and felt like saying no to him would be saying no to God," she was quoted as saying. "How do you say no to God?"
She told the news agency she eventually told him to stop calling her, adding that she was never hired again in Los Angeles after Mr. Domingo got power over casting.
Patricia Wulf, the only accuser named in the A.P. article, told The New York Times in a telephone interview that her experiences with Mr. Domingo also dated to 1998, when she appeared with Washington National Opera, where he was then general director, in "The Magic Flute."
When Ms. Wulf left the stage during one rehearsal, she said, Mr. Domingo was waiting for her in the wings. He came up to her, she recalled, and said, "Patricia, do you have to go home tonight?"
Ms. Wulf said she laughed, thinking it was a joke, but later the situation repeated itself. "I remember thinking, 'That is not acceptable,"' she said.
Mr. Domingo did not inappropriately touch her, Ms. Wulf said, but he made her so uncomfortable that she hid in her dressing room and asked a colleague to walk her to her car so she did not have to risk encountering him. She said she did not report Mr. Domingo's behavior because she felt that doing so would damage her career.
She said she kept saying no to Mr. Domingo until he stopped, about two and a half years later.
In his statement, which was initially made to The A.P. and later sent to The Times, Mr. Domingo said, "People who know me or who have worked with me know that I am not someone who would intentionally harm, offend, or embarrass anyone."
At the Salzburg Festival in Austria, where Mr. Domingo is scheduled to sing in concert performances of Verdi's "Luisa Miller" this month, Helga Rabl-Stadler, the festival's president, said that he would perform as planned.
"I have known Plácido Domingo for more than 25 years," Ms. Rabl-Stadler said in a statement. "In addition to his artistic competence, I was impressed from the very beginning by his appreciative treatment of all festival employees. He knows every name, from the concierge to the secretary; he never fails to thank anyone performing even the smallest service for him. Had the accusations against him been voiced inside the Festspielhaus in Salzburg, I am sure I would have heard of it."
Joseph Volpe, the general manager of the Met from 1990 to 2006, also said that he had never heard any allegations against Mr. Domingo. "I've known Plácido since he made his debut at the Met in 1968, and there was never, ever a complaint made against him about sexual harassment," Mr. Volpe said in a telephone interview. "He's such a gentleman, and so caring about people."
The Met, which fired its former music director, James Levine, in 2018 amid allegations of sexual misconduct -- and which just last week quietly settled a rancorous lawsuit he had filed against the company -- said in a statement that it takes "accusations of sexual harassment and abuse of power with extreme seriousness." The statement noted that Mr. Domingo, as a guest artist, had never been in a position to influence casting decisions there.
Washington National Opera merged with the Kennedy Center in 2011, the year Mr. Domingo departed. The company's current general director, Timothy O'Leary, and Deborah F. Rutter, the president of the Kennedy Center, said in a joint statement that the allegations against Mr. Domingo had all predated the center's takeover of the company.
"The Kennedy Center did not receive any documented complaints about Mr. Domingo's behavior prior to W.N.O.'s affiliation with the Kennedy Center, and we have not received any since then," the statement said.
A spokesman for the Royal Opera House in London did not respond to questions about whether Mr. Domingo would perform there next year, as scheduled. The spokesman said in a statement that the company "has not been made aware of any accusations pertaining to Plácido Domingo's time as a visiting artist or conductor. However, we have a zero-tolerance policy toward harassment of any kind."
The San Francisco Opera said in a statement that it "places a great priority on creating a safe and secure environment where everyone can focus on their work and art, and in which colleagues are treated with respect, dignity and collegiality."
The company said that ticket holders would be able to exchange their tickets to the canceled Domingo concert for other performances this season, or request refunds.

Texto completo: Otro oficial de NYPD murió de un aparente suicidio.
Es el octavo oficial que se cree que se quitó la vida este año, según el registro oficial.
Se trata un veterano de 7 años, asignado temporalmente al Yankee Stadium , informó CBS2. El occiso no ha sido identificado.
Según The New York Times, tenía 35 años y su muerte ocurrió mientras estaba fuera de servicio, en Yonkers. Su hoja de servicio era limpia.
Más policías se suicidan cada año que los que son asesinados en el cumplimiento del deber. Desde 2014, un promedio de cinco oficiales han muerto cada año por suicidio en NYC , destacó el diario.
“Hay tensiones en el trabajo y en tu vida personal (…) tienes un arma en la cadera”, dijo en la radio esta mañana el jefe de departamento de NYPD, Terence Monahan. “Hemos comenzado la conversación. Estamos aportando recursos externos que podamos (…) para hablar con nuestros policías”.
El mes pasado, el Departamento lanzó un grupo de trabajo para prevenir los suicidios de oficiales. Equipos de apoyo también estaban comenzando a ir a los lugares de trabajo.
Tanto el comisionado James O’Neill como el alcalde Bill de Blasio han pedido a los más de 30 mil oficiales de policía de NYC que busquen ayuda si experimentan depresión.
En junio O’Neill admitió que la policía de Nueva York estaba en medio de una “crisis de salud mental” y anunció medidas para abordar el problema, incluida la prestación de servicios de asesoramiento en cada recinto policial.
En 2017, 140 hombres y mujeres de la policía y 103 bomberos se quitaron la vida en todo EEUU, con una tasa per cápita más alta que la población civil, destacó ABC News.

Texto completo: This is the centennial year of J.D. Salingers birth, and he just might be spinning in his grave.

Readers will rejoice, though. Salingers publisher, Little, Brown and Co., has announced that starting today all four books by one of the most influential authors of the 20th century will be available as e-books for the first time.

Thats not all. According to Salingers son, Matt Salinger, in the next few years new work by his father will be published  the first since the novella Hapworth 16, 1924 was printed in the New Yorker in 1965.

Salinger was most famous for his first book (and only novel so far), The Catcher in the Rye. Published in 1951 and never out of print, the first-person tale of angsty teenager Holden Caulfield has sold more than 65 million copies and become one of the most beloved and reviled works of American fiction, a perpetual presence on both school reading lists and the American Library Associations list of most challenged books. Salingers distinctive style has influenced authors from John Updike to John Green, and Catchers fans include Bill Gates and the late former President George H.W. Bush.

Salinger became a public figure by deliberately staying out of the public eye. At the height of his fame in the 1950s, he retreated to his home in a small town in New Hampshire and, although he reportedly continued to write, he didnt publish after 1965 and largely avoided interviews and public appearances until his death in 2010 at age 91. He resolutely refused to allow his books to be published in digital or audio forms; he also would not license them for movies, stage or television.

Matt Salinger and J.D. Salingers widow, Colleen, are the trustees of the J.D. Salinger Literary Trust. Until now, theyve abided by the authors wishes.

But, according to a news release from Little, Brown, Matt Salinger said, As it became clear to us that increasing numbers of readers today read only e-books, and after I was taken severely (if also humorously) to task by a reader with a disability in Ypsilanti, Michigan, who cant read except on an electronic device, we decided it was time.

In addition to Catcher, the e-book release includes Nine Stories (1953), Franny and Zooey (1961) and Raise High the Roof Beams, Carpenter and Seymour: An Introduction (1963).

Little, Brown said, to make the books accessible to more readers, it will offer a 1,000-book giveaway of digital copies to North American libraries through a sweepstakes at OverDrive, as well as special prices for libraries through the end of 2019.

In an interview in the New York Times on Aug. 11, Matt Salinger revealed that the long-lived rumors are true: His father did produce new work he intended for publication, and books will be released in the next five to seven years.

The younger Salinger said he has been working through the manuscripts since 2012. The only content he confirmed is that some of the writing is about the Glass family, the subjects of Franny and Zooey and other J.D. Salinger books.

He would want people to come to it with no preconceptions, Matt Salinger told the New York Times. I wanted people to know that, yes, he did keep writing, theres a lot of material, and yes, it will be published.

Matt Salinger has also worked with the New York Public Library on an upcoming first exhibition from his fathers personal archives. It will include the typescript of Catcher with the authors notes, photos, letters and additional items.

Violence by white nationalists can be fought without a new federal law Los Angeles times Editorial

Texto completo: After a shooting spree in El Paso, allegedly by a man who railed against the "Hispanic invasion of Texas," even President Trump, who has used similar language, acknowledged that racism, bigotry and white supremacy are "sinister ideologies" that "must be defeated." Trump was only confirming what law enforcement officials realized long ago: Violent white supremacists pose a major threat comparable to that presented by foreign terrorists and their U.S. sympathizers.
Legislation was introduced in Congress in March that calls for the establishment of domestic terrorism units in the Justice and Homeland Security departments and the FBI as well as the creation of a Domestic Terrorism Executive Committee. But some have called for more sweeping legislation to ensure that the FBI could investigate domestic terrorism as aggressively as it does terrorism with international connections. Congress needs to proceed cautiously on any such proposals.
Domestic terrorism motivated by racial or religious hatred is undoubtedly a pressing problem. Michael C. McGarrity, the FBI's assistant director for counterterrorism, told the House Homeland Security Committee in May that "there have been more arrests and deaths caused by domestic terrorists than international terrorists in recent years" and that racially motivated extremists were responsible for "the most lethal incidents."
It's also true that, while federal law contains a definition of domestic terrorism, there is no statute that makes all domestic terrorism a federal offense with prescribed penalties. This week the FBI Agents Association, representing more than 14,000 active and former agents, reiterated its call for such a statute.
But Congress could run into constitutional problems if it seeks to combat suspected domestic terrorism using the same legal tools employed against foreign terrorist groups. Besides, it's not clear that the laws already on the books prevent the FBI from aggressively investigating violent white supremacists or other domestic terrorists, or that they unduly hamper the U.S. Justice Department in prosecuting them.
David Cole, the legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, told The New York Times that proposals for a new domestic terrorism law "tend either to be duplicative of laws that already exist or expansive in ways that violate 1st Amendment rights of speech and association." An analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School notes that "there are already dozens of federal statutes carrying severe penalties that are available to investigators and prosecutors pursuing these crimes."
For example, acts of domestic terrorism motivated by racial or religious hatred can be prosecuted under the federal hate-crime statute and other laws. Robert Bowers, accused in the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue that killed 11 people, was charged by the Justice Department with hate crimes as well as other offenses including 11 counts of "obstruction of free exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death," a crime that can lead to the death penalty.
Although federal law lacks a catchall criminal offense of domestic terrorism, Robert Chesney of the University of Texas Law School points out that several federal terrorism-related statutes, including one dealing with the use of explosives, apply in cases of homegrown violent extremism. Timothy McVeigh, who perpetrated the 1995 bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building that killed 168 people and injured several hundred more, was convicted of federal charges including use of as weapon of mass destruction and murdering federal agents.
Those who are calling for a new domestic terrorism statute argue that there are still gaps in federal law, including the inability of the Justice Department to prosecute some acts of domestic terrorism committed with some categories of firearms. Congress should determine whether that is actually a problem, but it needs to do so in a deliberative way.
Congress also needs to recognize that some approaches to the investigation of foreign terrorism raise constitutional questions when applied to domestic activities.
For example, it's a crime for Americans to provide "material support or resources" to designated foreign terrorist organizations. But criminalizing support for domestic political groups, however extreme, could threaten speech protected by the 1st Amendment and the designations themselves might be subject to a constitutional challenge.
Testifying before the House Homeland Security Committee, Deputy Assistant Attorney Gen. Brad Wiegmann acknowledged that "picking out particular groups [whose views] you say you disagree with ... is going to be highly problematic."
Some advocates of new federal legislation admit that their purpose is to send a message that Congress and the nation deplore terrorist acts by white nationalists as much as they do acts of violence committed by Islamic extremists. That is an important message, and one that Trump has been shamefully slow to embrace. But legislation is about more than symbolism; it has practical consequences.
The best way to demonstrate that the federal government is serious about terrorism by white nationalists, anti-Semites and other bigots is for the Justice Department and the FBI to make full use of the ample authority they already possess.

Texto completo: If you want to be a better reader, you first need something to read. Start by asking yourself some questions:
Do you want to read for enjoyment or for knowledge? Do you want to stretch yourself in some way? Are you looking for escapism? (There's nothing wrong with that!) Do you want to be part of the cultural conversation around the current "it" book? Are you curious about a book that has been atop the best-seller list for months?
You don't need to buy one: Pluck a book from your shelves at home, borrow from a friend, download a book to your phone from participating libraries or simply swing by a Little Free Library on your way home to see what the reading fates have in store for you.
If you're still not sure what you want to read, here are some other ways to figure it out:
WhatShouldIReadNext.com. When you type in the name of a book you enjoy, you'll get a long list of titles you may also enjoy.
Check out Literature-Map.com which will give you suggestions based on your favorite author.
Ask a friend.
Follow famous readers online. Bill Gates writes a blog about what he's reading and loving. On Facebook, Barack Obama frequently posts lists of books he has finished and found meaningful.
Head to the library. Librarians are a terrific source of reading recommendations; the New York Public Library even offers dozens of online recommended reading lists. If you've got an e-reader or smartphone, you can download books from participating libraries with the Overdrive app.
Find a bookstore. Booksellers are great at recommendations, both in person and online. Barnes & Noble curates a large number of recommendation lists, and the Canadian book chain Indigo features recommendations from its C.E.O.
Look at a "best book" list, such as The New York Times's "100 Notable Books" of the year, which collects recommended titles from the previous year.

Jeffrey Epstein said he had dirt on tech oligarchs: Report

Texto completo: Convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein claimed to have dirt on prominent people in the technology sector.
The multimillionaire made the boast to New York Times columnist James Stewart during a conversation at his Manhattan mansion last year.
"He said people in Silicon Valley had a reputation for being geeky workaholics, but that was far from the truth: They were hedonistic and regular users of recreational drugs. He said he’d witnessed prominent tech figures taking drugs and arranging for sex (Mr. Epstein stressed that he never drank or used drugs of any kind)," Stewart wrote.
Stewart did not name anyone in particular and it is unclear whether Epstein told him any names.
Stewart said this 90-minute conversation was on background and could not be attributed to Epstein. But Stewart said he determined that condition expired due to Epstein's apparent suicide in a Manhattan jail cell over the weekend.
Stewart said he sought an interview with Epstein to discuss whether he was advising Tesla and founder Elon Musk to find a new chief executive. Tesla denies seeking Epstein's help, but Epstein told Stewart that he was considered "radioactive" and Tesla would deny that he had given advice if it ever became public.
Epstein said this stigma did not stop people from confiding in him and even told Stewart that he wanted to become a minister so that they could feel assured their disclosures would remain confidential.

Texto completo: Jeffrey Epstein died of an apparent suicide in his jail cell, now prompting an additional federal investigation into his death along with one already examining allegations of sexual abuse and conspiracy against him.

Epstein, a wealthy financier accused of orchestrating a sex-trafficking ring and sexually abusing dozens of underage girls, was found Saturday morning unresponsive in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. He was later pronounced dead at New York Presbyterian-Lower Manhattan Hospital.
Epstein had been placed on suicide watch after he was found a little over two weeks ago with bruising on his neck, according to a person familiar with the matter who wasn't authorized to discuss it publicly. But he was taken off the watch at the end of July and therefore wasn't on it at the time of his death, the person said.
Attorney General William Barr, calling for an investigation by the FBI and the Justice Department's inspector general's office, said he was “appalled” to learn of Epstein's death while in federal custody.
“Mr. Epstein's death raises serious questions that must be answered,” Barr said in a statement.
Epstein, 66, had been denied bail and faced up to 45 years behind bars on federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges unsealed last month. He had pleaded not guilty and was awaiting trial.
The federal investigation into the allegations remains ongoing, U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said. He noted in a statement Saturday that the indictment against Epstein includes a conspiracy charge, suggesting others could face charges in the case.
Epstein's death raises questions about how the Bureau of Prisons ensures the welfare of such high-profile inmates. In October, Boston gangster James “Whitey” Bulger was killed in a federal prison in West Virginia where had just been transferred.
Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, a Republican member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote Saturday in a scathing letter to Barr that “heads must roll” after the incident.
“Every single person in the Justice Department – from your Main Justice headquarters staff all the way to the night-shift jailer – knew that this man was a suicide risk, and that his dark secrets couldn't be allowed to die with him,” Sasse wrote.
Epstein's removal from suicide watch would have been approved by both the warden of the jail and the facility's chief psychologist, said Jack Donson, a former prison official who worked for the Bureau of Prisons for more than two decades.
On Friday, more than 2,000 pages of documents were released related to a since-settled lawsuit against Epstein's ex-girlfriend by Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein's accusers. The records contain graphic allegations against Epstein, as well as the transcript of a 2016 deposition of Epstein in which he repeatedly refused to answer questions to avoid incriminating himself.
Giuffre, in an interview with the New York Times, said she's grateful Epstein will never harm anyone again, but is angry that there would be no chance to see him answer for his conduct.
“We've worked so hard to get here, and he stole that from us, too,” she told the newspaper.
Sigrid McCawley, Giuffre's attorney, said Epstein's suicide less than 24 hours after the documents were unsealed “is no coincidence.” McCawley urged authorities to continue their investigation, focusing on Epstein associates who she said “participated and facilitated Epstein's horrifying sex trafficking scheme.”
Epstein's arrest drew national attention, particularly focusing on a deal that allowed Epstein to plead guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor for prostitution in Florida and avoid more serious federal charges.
Federal prosecutors in New York reopened the probe after investigative reporting by the Miami Herald stirred outrage over that plea bargain.
His lawyers maintained that the new charges in New York were covered by the 2008 plea deal and that Epstein hadn't had any illicit contact with underage girls since serving his 13-month sentence in Florida.
Before his legal troubles, Epstein led a life of extraordinary luxury that drew powerful people into his orbit. He socialized with princes and presidents and lived on a 100-acre private Caribbean island and one of the biggest mansions in New York.

LEBANON — Gov. Chris Sununu signed a bill in late July that will increase scrutiny of health care mergers, such as the proposed combination of the parent organizations of Lebanon’s Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center and Manchester's Catholic Medical Center. 
Under the new law, HB 552, the director of the New Hampshire Charitable Trusts Unit has specific authority to ask merging health care organizations how the transaction will affect the community’s “access to quality and affordable physical and mental health care services.”
It also increases the time the director has to review these proposed transactions and requires more than one public hearing on the proposals.
"Anytime New Hampshire's health care providers merge or affiliate, it only makes sense for the state to ensure that these transactions will benefit patients; especially those needing mental health or (substance use disorder) services,” Sununu wrote in a statement on July 29 after he signed the bill. “House Bill 552 provides the State with the ability to examine these arrangements to ensure that they result in lower costs to patients with a higher quality of care."
The legislation, sponsored by state Rep. David Luneau, D-Hopkinton, aims to clarify the director of Charitable Trusts Unit’s ability to ask these questions after the parent organizations for two hospitals in southern New Hampshire, Elliot Hospital and Southern New Hampshire Medical Center, objected to when current Charitable Trusts Director Tom Donovan asked them during a review of the merger that led to the creation of SolutionHealth last year.
Though Elliot and Southern New Hampshire responded to the questions in spite of their objection, health care advocates in the state hope the new law will avoid such objections in the future.
“Especially given the fact that a lot of the hospitals are now the hubs of the hub and spoke model for the opioid treatment to deal with the opioid crisis … if the hospitals aren’t willing to answer questions, what does that mean for the hub and spoke model?” said Holly Stevens, health policy coordinator for the Concord-based New Futures, a health care advocacy group that supported HB 552.
The question of how the Charitable Trusts Unit reviews these transactions is under scrutiny because health care mergers have become more commonplace in New Hampshire and nationally. At the same time, their value to consumers has been brought into question. For example, an analysis conducted by the Nicholas C. Petris Center at the University of California at Berkeley for the New York Times last year found that mergers have the effect of eliminating competition, which allows prices to rise. 
“Even though the hospitals say when they merge costs will go down (that’s) not what the research is showing,” Stevens said.
Though the law is a relatively minor tweak to an existing statute that outlines the director’s responsibilities in reviewing such transactions, Luneau said, “It’s more than window dressing.”
This ability is essential, he said, to ensuring that the public interest in these nonprofits is represented.
“This is in the public trust,” Luneau said. The “shareholders are the taxpayers of New Hampshire.”
Elliot and Southern New Hampshire said, through spokeswoman Susanna Fier, that they support the fundamental principles behind HB 552. But they also said they don’t see a problem with the review they went through to create their combined system.
“We have welcomed the opportunity to provide all of the information asked of us by the Director of Charitable Trusts relating to our combination relationship,” Fier wrote in an email. “We have every reason to believe that the Director has been satisfied with our submissions to date as no further inquiry has been made since our comprehensive and transparent responses to each of his questions. In fact, he has stated that we have met the statutory requirements.”
For their part, even though the New Hampshire Hospital Association and some of its members including Dartmouth-Hitchcock opposed the bill as it was initially proposed, they said last Wednesday that they came around to support it.
“Whether under existing law or as revised by HB 552, we will continue to satisfy the requirements that govern our efforts to combine with other health systems for the advancement of health and healthcare in New Hampshire,” D-H spokesman Rick Adams said in an email. 
By way of example, Adams pointed to D-H’s role in the hub and spoke model known as Doorway-NH to address addiction issues and to efforts to integrate mental health care into primary care.
“We have long been engaged in behavioral health solutions, statewide,” he said.
D-H and GraniteOne Health, the parent organization that includes Catholic Medical Center, announced their intent to combine efforts last January. They plan to file with the Charitable Trusts Unit in the fall, Adams said.

Texto completo: What's the point at which rhetoric forces action? When do words become incitement? At what point do political attacks get so reckless and unhinged that you can no longer heal the divide they create with politics? It's hard to know exactly, but the left is getting very close. Take, for example, this exchange on MSNBC, in which frequent guest Malcolm Nance accuses the president of the United States of sending secret messages to neo-Nazis:
"These people feel that they are the foot soldiers and executors of the disenfranchisement that the white race is feeling, and Donald Trump is giving them subliminal orders in their head," Mr. Nance said.
Subliminal orders? Whatever Mr. Trump's faults, you can be certain he isn't doing that. Mr. Trump is the least subliminal politician in American history. He has no subtext. If he's thinking it, he says it. The claim is ludicrous. But at MSNBC, it wasn't even the weirdest thing recently said on air. That distinction goes to Frank Figliuzzi, a former FBI official turned talking head-conspiracy nut. He used numerology to explain the president's coded messages:
"It's the little things and the language and messaging that matter," Mr. Figliuzzi said. "The president said that we will fly our flags at half-mast until Aug. 8. That's 8/8. Now, I'm not going to imply that he did this deliberately, but I am using it as an example of the ignorance of the adversary that's being demonstrated by the White House. The numbers 8, 8 are very significant in [the] neo-Nazi and white supremacy movement. Why? Because the letter H is the eighth letter of the alphabet, and to them, the numbers 8, 8 together stand for 'Heil Hitler.'"
Got that? Eight is a racist number. That's MSNBC's position. In other words, things are getting dangerously crazy on the left. How crazy? Last Monday, former Jeb Bush spokeswoman Nicolle Wallace explained that Mr. Trump is planning a genocide of Hispanic Americans:
"President [Barack] Obama used the power of the presidency to try to pass comprehensive immigration reform with the Latino community, Latino leaders at the table," Ms. Wallace said. "You now have a president ... talking about exterminating Latinos."
"Exterminating Latinos." Keep in mind Mr. Trump got a higher percentage of the Hispanic vote than Mitt Romney did. It turns out that not all Latinos believe in open borders. A lot of them agree with Mr. Trump. And yet, the left is now telling you - and demanding that you believe - that anyone who supports Mr. Trump is a white supremacist and must be destroyed. They're telling you that for political reasons. It's election season, and they want more power. But there are other reasons, too.
Ever wonder why rich people seem the most hysterical on the subject? Ever notice that it's the highest-paid people on TV who are the most determined to convince you white supremacy is America's biggest problem? Why is that? Simple: Every minute you spend angry about race is a minute you're not thinking about class - which, of course, is the real divide in this country.
Working-class people of all colors have a lot more in common with each other than they do with some overpaid MSNBC anchor. If you were allowed to think about that long enough, you might start to get unauthorized ideas about economics. That would be disruptive to a very lucrative status quo. So they whip you into a frenzy of racial fear so that it never enters your mind. It's a diversion. Everyone else hates each other. They get to keep their money. Pretty tricky. Unfortunately, it's destroying the country. This is the path to civil war.
So we want to take a second to pass on a sincere message to official Washington:
Please, for the sake of the nation, calm down. Yes, America has problems. Racism is one of those problems. But so are a fading middle class, a terrifying drug epidemic and a national debt that is growing by $1 trillion a year.
People realize their country is declining, and it's making them turn to new political leaders. Mr. Trump was one of them. Elizabeth Warren and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are others.
This is a time of frustration and change. But America is not on the brink of genocide, not even close. This is not a white supremacist country, plotting the slaughter of its own people. It's a kind country, full of decent people of all races who, like all people everywhere, make bad decisions from time to time but mean well and generally try their best. Going forward, give them the benefit of the doubt, even when you disagree with them - maybe especially when you disagree with them. These are your fellow Americans. Cut them a break. They deserve it. Remember: The alternative is disaster.

Case Against Bus Maker Exposes Broken Vows

Texto completo: In recent decades, government agencies across the country have used their buying power to benefit American workers.
When cities begin development projects or buy expensive equipment, they sometimes award contracts or subsidies contingent on job creation, or they impose wage requirements. The Obama administration required federal contractors to pay workers more than $ 10 an hour and to provide paid sick leave.
But enforcing such provisions can be a challenge, especially for local governments. Now, a fraud complaint against a major contractor is raising questions about the effectiveness of such commitments and the viability of the overall approach.
The contractor, New Flyer of America, a subsidiary of one of North America's largest bus makers, is a supplier to New York and other major cities. In a 2012 proposal to the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority for an order of up to 900 buses, New Flyer said it would create more than 50 full-time positions that paid $ 11 to nearly $ 50 an hour.
New Flyer won the contract, worth about $ 500 million. But the company did not pay the wages it said it would and misrepresented the value of the benefits it was providing, according to pay stubs and corporate reports recently unsealed in the fraud case.
"It was a commitment -- it matters," said Madeline Janis, the executive director of Jobs to Move America, the nonprofit group that filed the complaint against New Flyer in California state court. "This case is about holding a huge company's feet to the fire."
Jobs to Move America helped devise a model, applied by a number of agencies, in which manufacturers of public transportation equipment commit to creating American jobs as part of the contracting process. It helped persuade the Los Angeles agency, known as L.A. Metro, to link its purchasing to job commitments in a 2012 rail-car contract. The New Flyer contract took effect a short time later, in 2013.
Since then, at least eight other agencies -- including New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Chicago Transit Authority and Amtrak -- have sought promises from transportation contractors to create manufacturing jobs using the template that Ms. Janis's group developed.
Timothy J. Bartik, an economist at the Upjohn Institute in Michigan, said that the approach would most likely result in higher costs for government agencies, because companies bidding on contracts would probably raise prices to help finance the jobs they pledged to create. But he said it was plausible that the economic benefits would exceed the costs, and that the manufacturing jobs would probably provide some social benefit, too.
The New Flyer bid laid out the number of full-time-equivalent jobs the company planned to create and tallied the dollar value of the wages and benefits the workers in those jobs would receive over the contract's life. L.A. Metro then applied an economic multiplier to estimate the overall value of the jobs: nearly $ 18 million.
The agency deducted the amount from the price when evaluating the company's proposal, which widened its advantage over the next lowest bidder.
In its complaint, Jobs to Move America contends that New Flyer submitted at least two types of false information to L.A. Metro.
The company stated in its proposal that more than 90 percent of its new jobs in California would pay at least $ 18.35 an hour. But in quarterly progress reports to L.A. Metro in 2014, New Flyer said that most workers were earning $ 17 an hour or less.
In the same reports, the company said that the workers' benefits were worth $ 11.75 an hour, or about $ 2,000 a month. But pay stubs and other documents obtained by Jobs to Move America and reviewed by The New York Times show that the benefits were typically worth half that at best. (The group does not accuse the company of falling short on the number of jobs it created.)
Lindy Norris, a New Flyer spokeswoman, said that the company believed it had "fulfilled the terms and conditions" of its employment commitments. She declined to comment on pending litigation but said that the company would "vigorously defend this action."
L.A. Metro declined to comment, citing the pending litigation. Jobs to Move America is bringing the complaint on behalf of the agency and the state under a whistle-blower provision of an anti-fraud law.
Debbie Pitts, who worked at the New Flyer plant in Ontario, Calif., that completed production of the buses for L.A. Metro, was hired late in 2013. Her job was to put final touches, like decals, on buses and deliver them. According to a letter the company sent her on Dec. 2, 2013, her starting wage was $ 17 an hour, over $ 1 less than New Flyer had said it would pay such workers.
Ms. Pitts saved many of her payroll stubs, which itemized the value of her benefits and showed that they were typically worth less than $ 500 a month. The value of her benefits was lower than the benefits some of her colleagues received because she declined health insurance.
But documentation for nine workers at a unionized New Flyer plant in Minnesota show that the company typically spent $ 500 to $ 1,000 a month on health insurance for workers making similar wages.
Ms. Pitts, who left New Flyer in 2017, said in an interview that the payroll stubs reflected all of her benefits, except for the occasional hat, cup or T-shirt that the company gave out. As for the $ 2,000 in monthly benefits that New Flyer reported, Ms. Pitts said, "That was outrageous for them to even say that."
The New Flyer contract with L.A. Metro has ambiguous language about whether the company was obligated merely to deliver a certain aggregate level of compensation or -- as Jobs to Move America argues -- to deliver specific wages and benefits to workers in specific job categories.
Either way, New Flyer submitted false information about employee benefits in its quarterly statements, according to the complaint.
California's False Claims Act, under which the complaint was brought, bars fraudulent claims for payment from the state and local governments. Stephen M. Kohn, a lawyer who represents whistle-blowers and has brought numerous false-claims cases, said that failure to live up to wage commitments would be a potential violation, as would submitting false reports showing compliance.
If Jobs to Move America prevails, New Flyer could face significant penalties, including up to $ 11,000 for each false claim, and possible damages tied to underpayment of workers or harm to the government agency.
New Flyer is not the only company whose compliance with a contract Ms. Janis's group has questioned.
In an earlier case in Los Angeles, Jobs to Move America alerted city and state authorities that another bus manufacturer, the Chinese company BYD, had hired fewer workers than it promised and had paid workers less than the required wage for employees of companies receiving city contracts or subsidies.
BYD said at the time that it intended to hire more workers and that it believed it was exempt from the so-called living-wage rule. The dispute was effectively resolved after BYD reached an agreement with a group of nonprofits and unions, which led to better pay for workers.
Ms. Janis said the New Flyer case and others like it showed that public agencies could not simply write provisions into contracts and expect companies to honor them.
"They make deals with public agencies and promise whatever, and think they don't have to follow through," she said.

Texto completo: A medical examiner performed an autopsy Sunday on accused child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, who died in his cell at the Manhattan Correctional Center of an apparent suicide early Saturday morning, but no cause of death has officially been made public yet.
Dr. Barbara Sampson, New York City’s chief medical examiner, released a statement obtained by the Washington Examiner Sunday evening saying that the medical examiner’s final determination is "pending further information at this time." She did not elaborate on what that further information might be.
On Saturday, a representative for the medical examiner’s office stressed that “there is no official cause of death yet” because “the medical examiner has to do their job.” NBC News reported Sunday that suicide still remains the presumed cause of death, according to multiple people briefed on the investigation.TweetThe Bureau of Prisons said on Saturday that Epstein was found “unresponsive in his cell” in the Special Housing Unit that morning following “an apparent suicide.” Many questions remain about why Epstein was reportedly taken off suicide watch despite allegedly being found nearly unconscious on his cell floor with marks on his neck back in July, as well as about why such a high-profile prisoner wasn’t being closely monitored.
The New York Times reported Sunday that the two prison guards on duty in the wing of the prison where Epstein was being held did not follow protocol and failed to check on Epstein every half hour as required, noting that both guards were working overtime. The New York Post reported that there is no video of Epstein’s apparent suicide inside his cell because cameras are trained on rooms and corridors outside the cells rather than capturing what is going on inside the cells themselves.
Dr. Sampson said Sunday evening that, at the request of those still representing Epstein in death and with the awareness of prosecutors from the Southern District of New York, private pathologist Dr. Michael Baden was also allowed “to observe the autopsy examination.” Dr. Sampson called this a “routine practice.”
Dr. Baden, a former chief medical examiner for New York City in the late 1970s, has been a forensic science contributor for Fox News and has notably been involved in private autopsies, including the police shooting of Michael Brown and the death by suicide hanging of Aaron Hernandez.
Sampson said that, beyond the medical determination of how Epstein died, her office “defers to the involved law enforcement agencies regarding other investigations around this death.”
The FBI and the Justice Department’s inspector general both launched investigations on Saturday into the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death. Attorney General William Barr said he was “appalled” to learn of Epstein’s death and that it “raises serious questions that must be answered.”

The 14-page indictment against Epstein, the already-convicted sex offender and jet-setting financier, was unsealed in July and alleged that he “sexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls” at his homes in Manhattan and Palm Beach, among other locations, between 2002 and 2005 and perhaps beyond. Prosecutors claimed Epstein “enticed and recruited” minor girls to “engage in sex acts with him” and built a “vast network of underage victims.”

Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman vowed Sunday that SNDY’s investigation of Epstein’s crimes — and the crimes of his possible co-conspirators — would not end with Epstein’s death.

“To those brave young women who have already come forward and to the many others who have yet to do so, let me reiterate that we remain committed to standing for you,” Berman said in a brief statement. “And our investigation of the conduct charged in the indictment — which included a conspiracy count — remains ongoing.”

Texto completo: A Pure Heart
by Rajia Hassib 
Viking, 320 pp. $27
“A Pure Heart" begins with a news account, one that's become all too typical in spite of its atrocity: SUICIDE BOMBER KILLS 9 IN EGYPT. 
The author of this book, Rajia Hassib knows full well that we have grown accustomed to the clichés of terrorism: “. . . an improvised explosive device . . . ties to terrorist groups . . . extremists." Tucked within the expected details, however, is a fateful one about how the bomber had been profiled in The New York Times.
Cut to Rose, an Egyptian archeologist living in the West, gathering objects from her dead sister's Cairo bedroom: headscarves, a teacup, a necklace, two T-shirts, and a string of prayer beads that bear the 99 names of Allah — objects that reflect a specific young and devout, yet modern, Muslim woman.  
While everyone else assumes Gameela's death, 10 days earlier — she died in the the bombing from the news clip — can be chalked up to random violence, Rose has her doubts. She has the butterfly effect on her mind, afraid that if she can follow the tornado of Gameela's death backward to its origin, she won't like what she finds.
“A Pure Heart" is a timely, sweeping tale that examines the intersection of fate and choice, the pull of culture and identity, family and love. It takes us in and around the 2011 revolution in Egypt, through alternating points of view and alternating locations, with each character's story revealing how the pursuit of pure intentions is sidetracked until they reach the calamitous end. 
But it's in each of the characters' distinct stories — and in telling them each so skillfully, so movingly — that Hassib fulfills her mission to humanize the page-one news account, and to puncture our sense of moral certainty. 
At the center of the story are Rose and Gameela, two sisters who love each other but have kept a distance from one another. The consummate archeologist, Rose tells herself as she sifts through her sister's artifacts that the items might bring her sister's death into light: “Inanimate objects, as she once told her father when he asked about her work cataloguing artifacts, do speak, if they are only given a chance to."  
What Rose fears most is that her sister's possessions will tell a story about the choices Rose, herself, has made that may have endangered her sister — her marriage to an American journalist and his New York Times interview with the bomber are two that top the list. As Rose pieces together the hidden parts of her sister's life, it becomes apparent that the two represent the kinds of choices faced by modern Muslim women. 
Admittedly, they benefit from their upper-middle-class background and education, which provide them with choices. Rose's version of religious orthodoxy involved requiring her American, Christian suitor to convert to Islam before they married. Much more conservative Gameela, elects to wear a hijab — in spite of her parents' objections. 
Gameela is deeply conscious of her public and private observance of her faith. She's the one who connects us to the meaning of  jihad , reminding us several times throughout the story, that  jihad , to her, means an ongoing struggle to “be better, to do better, to let go of egotistical, selfish notions, to strive to be the best person one can be — a truly good person, a kindhearted, pure person." 
Hassib asks us to ponder action and reaction, and Rose struggles to understand what triggered what: Was it her suggestion that Mark return to Egypt to do some reporting because he “missed the revolution" so he could follow her to New York? Was it Gameela's profound commitment to lead an intentional and devout life while indulging herself in some personal — but very clandestine — happiness? Or was it Mark's own mission to make his mark writing about world events by looking deeply into the private lives of people? 
“Very few people can see the whole story when they are at its center," Mark acutely observes.  And that's the artistry of this novel: Each of the characters, in turn, is at the center; and each one, in a flawed and human way, is in pursuit of their own version of purity of heart. 
The suicide bomber, Saaber, whose name means “the patient one, the waiting one, like Job, who can withstand life's trials,"  is not just the main plot point in the story — the nexus of all the characters' paths — he's also well-drawn and compelling, one of several pieces of a complex story that showcases Hassib's skill at crafting convincing psychological shifts in her characters.
Might Saaber's destiny have been changed with a few tweaks — a less chaotic life, or more good fortune? Or could a simple act of kindness have been the butterfly effect that kept him from killing nine people? We cannot know, but the point of this beautifully written story is that you'll find yourself wondering.

Texto completo: When Dean & DeLuca opened on Prince Street in 1977, three years after New York Magazine declared SoHo the most exciting place to live in New York, the artist Donald Judd soon began doing his weekly grocery shopping there.
He and his wife, a dancer, lived nearby on Spring Street at a time when it was possible to hire Philip Glass or Richard Serra to do your plumbing but it was not possible, until Dean & DeLuca came along, to find arugula south of Eighth Street.
There are people who cannot understand why anyone would be nostalgic for New York in the chaotic 1970s. When I think about them, I think about the likelihood of running into a famous conceptual artist at Whole Foods.
As it happens, I have never noticed anyone familiar to me from the Whitney Biennial waiting on the long but quickly moving line, scrolling through his phone to present the necessary evidence of an Amazon Prime membership that earns him a 10 percent discount on cauliflower rice.
During the 1970s and '80s, the sophisticated shopping experience was not branded in efficiency or self-denial or schemes devised in investment banks. Dean & DeLuca was itself a work of art. This was also true of Barneys, another institution born of the ethos that shopping was an act of self-actualization. Now both institutions find themselves in financial free-fall.
Beginning in the late 1980s, Barneys emerged to define an intelligent urbanity in fashion, one that countered both the ostentation that consumed American tastes and the parodic masculinity imposed on women now entering the professional work force in large numbers.
Over the years both Barneys and Dean & DeLuca eventually veered far enough away from their origins to make them seem less necessary. They transformed into rarefied chains, serving the needs of a global moneyed class in many ways hostile to distinction, wanting in Hong Kong or Dubai what they are used to in Manhattan or Rome.
These kinds of changes would ultimately remake New York as well, as the city seemed to enter into a brutal and protracted phase of bad karmic trades, losing what made it extraordinary in exchange for the genericism that so many people for so long had come to the city to avoid.
Dean & DeLuca, now owned by a Thai real-estate outfit, is immersed in such steep debt that it can no longer pay vendors or employees, as my colleague Julia Moskin recently reported. The stores look like ghost malls on planet Humboldt Fog, with empty shelves and soda bottles and very little else. This has all unfolded as Barneys announced on Monday night that it is filing for bankruptcy, with plans to close 15 of its 22 stores.
In both cases, misfortune has come at the hands of overexpansion, of dramatically altered shopping practices, of New York's annihilating real-estate market. Barneys is controlled by the former hedge-fund manager Richard Perry, but even he could not insulate himself from a rent increase on the Madison Avenue flagship that nearly doubled annual leasing costs to $ 30 million.
Despite these abiding economic truths, it is also true that the city that produced a retail culture focused on discovery and experimentation has become a place with Amazon boxes on the stoop of every brownstone. We have allowed our habits to become so effectively manipulated toward convenience that is hard to imagine appreciating idiosyncrasy if it returned.
The world that created Dean & DeLuca was a world in which demand was not so obviously engineered. The store arose organically to serve a nascent colony of painters and sculptors (and the artistic hopeful), who since the early 1960s had been taking over loft spaces in industrial buildings in SoHo, fighting to remain in them as the city threatened evictions.
Though it is easy in retrospect to see the store as the beginning of SoHo's end, the incubator of a pernicious gentrification, the grocer had thrown in its lot with the rebels. One of its founding partners, Jack Ceglic, was a portraitist who designed the store to evoke a gallery or a museum using different gradations of white to showcase the tomatoes and figs and greens to greatest advantage.
An early review of the store in The New York Times described a space "lighted by a rear skylight and high-up fixtures that make a Pyrex double boiler seem practically sculptural." In the same vein, is hard to describe the energy that pervaded Barneys during the 1990s, a few years after it had opened its store for women, in Chelsea.
Beyond the store's great innovations, the garments themselves seemed to encode an entirely new understanding of femininity. The clothes weren't for women supported by rich men; nor were they intended for anyone coming apart beneath the storm of her own ambitions. Everywhere you looked you saw the sort of person you had come to New York to be: uncompromised, assured, inspired, composed.
As a young journalist just beginning my career I could afford to buy things at Barneys when I happened upon a good sale, just as I could afford morels or wild salmon at Dean & DeLuca from time to time when the numbers worked in my favor. It is hard to see how anyone in a similar position could make a habit of that now.
The cost of living in the city has become untenable, obviously. But beyond that, the creative industries that for a long time had provided the client base for these kinds of stores now produce uncertainty over consistency, compensation of the kind that does not easily accommodate luxury.
At the same time, the internet has reshaped desire; influencer culture has diminished the hunger for the exceptional. Those who can afford nearly anything so often are moved not by what no one else has but what Instagram suggests everybody else wants.
Barneys first came to the attention of the masses via legacy media, the HBO series "Sex and the City," a show about a writer who dressed beautifully, outlandishly, expensively guided simply by her own spirit.
During the period the show became iconic, we could still make sense of the idea, originating in the 19th-century conception of the department store, that shopping was a social experience. You went shopping with friends, you went shopping to look at people, because in the right contexts, those people were bound to seem interesting.
You might let your mind take you places -- you weren't constantly consulting your iPhone, which wouldn't be invented for a decade. You wrote stories in your head for the people you saw -- imagining what they did, where they were going in those pants, what they would do with that kimono, those boots, that lipstick, who they loved and who loved them.
On the recent occasions I have been to Barneys, the stories have written themselves. I move through quickly and with purpose and I see women around me who seem to be filling a void rather than satisfying an aspiration. I see only money and all its deprivations.

Texto completo: KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- At a training session on Wednesday ahead of the United States Gymnastics Championships, Simone Biles wore a leotard with a bedazzled goat on the back.
It was a reminder, in case people somehow forgot, that she is the greatest American gymnast of all time. With a combined 25 world championship and Olympic medals, including 18 golds, Biles stands alone atop the medal standings.
She got to this point by fearlessly performing elements that no one else has dared go near, and as Biles began her quest on Friday for a record-tying sixth national title, she became the first woman to perform a triple double (two flips with three twists) in the floor exercise of a competition.
Though she had trouble on the landing and had to steady herself by putting both hands on the mat, the judges ruled that Biles had completed the element. They awarded her 14.35 points for the routine, the highest total for the floor exercise on Friday, and Biles promised to try the triple double again on Sunday, when the women's all-around title will be decided. She finished Friday night in the lead, 1.75 points ahead of Sunisa Lee.
Biles said she thought she had too much adrenaline flowing to control her power on the triple double. "It's such a hard skill that I shouldn't be mad," Biles said of her fall, "but I'm so mad about it because in training I've never done it before."
Nevertheless, it was the third time in her career that Biles had introduced a new element to the women's side of the sport.
Biles tried another novelty later on Friday night, a double-double dismount off the balance beam, and landed it with a slight hop. Though Biles later called the triple double "the hardest move in the world," her dismount was another significant breakthrough for the sport.
"I feel like you should never settle just because you are winning or you are at the top," Biles said after her Wednesday training session, where she successfully completed the triple double four times. "You should always push yourself."
The triple double is a skill that, until this point, had been done only on the men's side, where it is still rare. None of the men at the national championships are expected to try one, and most of Biles's competitors can't even do a double double.
"If you had told me 10 years ago that someone would be doing that, I'd be like: 'That seems a little hard and dangerous. I don't know,"' Nastia Liukin, the 2008 Olympic all-around champion who is now an analyst for NBC Sports, said earlier this week. "Of course, if anyone can do it, it's obviously her."
When Biles's coach, Laurent Landi, approached her about working on the triple double last year, she had her doubts. She played around with the skill a few years ago, but only in a foam pit, which protected her from getting hurt if she messed up.
"My first reaction is no," Biles said. "Then he has to push me towards it until I'm ready to do it myself, and I'm like, 'O.K., it's really not that bad.'
"He almost makes the impossible possible sometimes, and I don't know how he does it."
Now Biles has such a command of the move that she often bounces out of the landing, a sign that she has more than enough power to complete it.
After taking nearly two years off from competition after the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, where she won the all-around title, Biles has been as dominant as ever, winning six medals, four of them gold, at last year's world championships.
Much has changed, though, within the United States national team. At 22, Biles is one of its oldest members, the designated leader of the team and an important example to the younger gymnasts.
She is also the only remaining member of the 2016 Olympic team and the only active elite gymnast who has publicly identified herself as a survivor of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Lawrence G. Nassar, the national team's former doctor.
While others in the sport, particularly her 2016 Olympic teammate Aly Raisman, spoke out about the failure of U.S.A. Gymnastics to protect its young athletes, Biles remained relatively quiet. Recently, though, her stance has shifted. Biles has used her Twitter account to express frustration with the sport's national governing body, and she became emotional while talking on Wednesday about the aftermath of the scandal.
"I do want to be a voice," Biles said, "but it takes time."
Although she is still figuring out how and when to best use her voice, Biles has always led by example. All eyes were on her during the training session: Her fellow athletes and coaches stopped their workouts to watch her, even applauding after she completed a skill.
Biles is also taking time to help the next generation. She was out on the floor 30 minutes before her training period, talking with the junior gymnasts, athletes under the age of 16, as they practiced.
"It's super helpful," said Karis German, 15, who trains at Biles's gym. "She gives us tips on how to make things."
At this stage, it has become Biles's goal to build a community for herself and the other gymnasts. Few people on the outside, she said, can understand what they are going through, so supporting one another is important.
Biles trained alone in the lead-up to the 2016 Olympics, but now has elite teammates at World Champions Centre in Spring, Tex., the gym her family owns. She trains alongside about a dozen other gymnasts and regularly invites teammates over to her house just to chill between training sessions.
Biles began working with Landi -- who previously coached Madison Kocian, one of Biles's 2016 Olympic teammates -- after she returned from Rio. She trained from age 7 to 19 under Aimee Boorman, who moved to become the executive director of a gym in Florida.
Biles has admitted that her love for the sport was sometimes diminished, especially as she grappled with the emotional trauma of the Nassar revelations. But she has worked to find more joy outside the gym, spending time with friends, family and Lilo, the French bulldog she adopted last year. It's important, she said, to have balance in her life as she trains for her second Olympic Games.
"At the end of the day, once I look up and it's coming to 6 o'clock, I'm out of there," she said with a smile. "I don't try to lollygag around the gym or anything. Sometimes I don't even stretch. I'm just like, 'O.K., I'm leaving, sorry."'
The shift in priorities has not reduced Biles's training, and she remains at the vanguard of her sport. If Biles completes the triple double at the world championships in Stuttgart, Germany, in October, the trick will be forever known as the Biles II.
Two previous innovations -- a floor exercise pass that succeeded at worlds in 2013 and a vault she landed last year -- are simply called the Biles, because each was her first addition to a particular event. The double-double dismount from the balance beam will also be called the Biles if she makes it in Stuttgart.
"They are being pushed by Simone," Tom Forster, the performance director for the national women's team, said of her competitors. "Let's be honest: Everyone is trying to keep up."

This skill had never been tried before in a women's gymnastics competition, and it will not be assigned an official value for scoring until Biles tries the element at the world championships this fall. Here is a look at the level of difficulty and point value of similar skills. Adding a second twist to a tucked double back flip is worth nearly twice the point value (from 0.5 to 0.9).

Texto completo: It is every American's right to make his or her own economic decisions.
Revile Remington Arms, maker of assault rifles? Withhold money from those with whom it does business. Dislike Fox News, CNN or MSNBC? Turn them off; even turn away from advertisers' products if you're so inclined. Hate a New York Times headline? Cancel your subscription if you feel you must, though you'll be mostly be punishing yourself when you miss the paper's great reporting because of a bad editorial decision.
Revile the president whose reelection a New York billionaire is supporting with multi-million-dollar fundraisers? Feel free to boycott businesses Steve Ross and his Related Companies owns: Soul Cycle, Equinox, the Miami Dolphins.
For ostracism enthusiasts, singling out an especially powerful enabler of Donald Trump makes strategic sense. It sends the message that high-profile help for an unstable, dangerous and divisive president may have consequences for the bottom line.
Ross, who released a statement distancing himself from some of Trump's views while embracing his economic agenda, should have known better: This is a package deal. You buy the tax cuts, you get Trump's racist rhetoric and xenophobic policy in the bargain.
Searching for enemies every time you open your wallet, however, is an exhausting, potentially expensive way to live in a nation where 62,979,879 people voted for Trump in 2016, where more than 90,000 individuals have already sent him political donations for 2020, and where a deeply interconnected populace makes countless economic decisions daily based on price, quality and convenience.
Taken to its logical conclusion, it is bound to deepen the cultural and political divides many of Trump's opponents rightly decry.
If Ross doesn't cave and cancel his fundraisers, will hardened Trump foes stop frequenting all businesses renting space in Ross' Hudson Yards, or the Shops at Columbus Circle? That would hurt many ordinary New Yorkers who work there, who are just doing their jobs.
Rep. Joaquin Castro spotlighted the names of 44 of his own constituents who gave the max to Trump this year. All perfectly legal. But group shaming of small business owners who donated $2,700 to the president is a path toward endless civic warfare.
Boycotts have a proud American tradition. But those bent on punishing all supporters of a president should be careful about the world they are creating.

Texto completo: Our guide to cultural events in New York City for children and teenagers happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
CELEBRATE THE CARIBBEAN at the Brooklyn Children's Museum (Aug. 10, 11 a.m.-5 p.m.). Come enjoy a day of liming, an activity that has nothing to do with citrus fruits (unless you encounter them in food or drink). In Trinidad and Tobago, liming refers to being social for its own sake, and this festival will have a lounge dedicated to just that, where little visitors can relax and play games. But they will find opportunities to create as well, including a workshop in which they can build an imitation coral reef, design their own festive headdresses and learn about Trinidad's Carnival traditions. The day will also feature Caribbean tales told by representatives of the organizations Drag Queen Story Hour and G for Griot; an investigation of the region's sand that will include art making and science; and a rooftop bazaar, where revelers can listen to soca, join Caribbean dances and watch stilt walkers perform. (A full schedule is on the website.)

COMMUNITY DAY AND BACK-TO-SCHOOL BASH! at BLDG 92, the Brooklyn Navy Yard (Aug. 10, 12:30-3 p.m.). A thriving industrial hub, the Navy Yard is a center for both steam (it helps supply Con Edison) and STEAM: science, technology, engineering, art and math. Those disciplines are the focus of this free celebration, which will offer computer demonstrations and other programs from local businesses, as well as information on youth internships and employment. Geared toward students in Grades 4-12, the event will feature a workshop on inclusive design with the architectural firm Eray/Carbajo; a chance to explore a tabletop scene that the Sodium Ranch, an entertainment company, has set up for a photo shoot; and an opportunity to create collaged decorative pins with a team from BLICK Art Materials. Participants can also learn about the Brooklyn STEAM Center, a new public high school in the Navy Yard complex.

FAMILY ADVENTURE RACES at Crotona Park (Aug. 10, 9 and 10 a.m.). Exercising together can keep families fit, but these events from the City Parks Foundation and New York Road Runners also aim to keep them having fun. Intended for children ages 8 to 12 and an accompanying parent or guardian (a team consists of one adult and up to two young athletes), these races feature 12 activity stations along a timed course. At each station, the team must perform a challenge -- the tasks include jumping rope, throwing a javelin, scaling a mini climbing wall and clearing hurdles -- before advancing to the next. Awards will go to the three fastest teams, and each participant who finishes, regardless of time, will receive a medal. Advance registration is encouraged, but not required, for the two heats, which will take place north of the tennis courts in this Bronx park.

FISHING CLINICS AT PIER 5, BROOKLYN BRIDGE PARK (Friday, 4-6 p.m.; Aug. 17 and Sept. 14, 11 a.m.-1 p.m.). At least one bucolic activity doesn't require young New Yorkers to leave the city. Several local organizations offer fishing, and the Brooklyn Bridge Park Conservancy has joined them this summer with these free drop-in rod-and-reel clinics, which teach participants how to tie line knots, bait hooks and cast. (The conservancy provides the equipment.) Even some aquatic species might approve: Nothing is destined to be eaten, except the bait -- sandworms and pieces of clam -- and little anglers will use only circular hooks, which don't harm the fish. Presented with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, the clinics function as citizen science projects that collect data on water quality and marine organisms' health; fish are measured, observed and then released. But before saying goodbye to their catches, children can expect close encounters with species like striped bass, bluefish, perch, American eels, dogfish sharks and the memorable-looking (and -sounding) oyster toadfish.

RAVE THEATER FESTIVAL: 'THE PERFECT FIT' (Aug. 11, 4 p.m.; Aug. 12, 6 p.m.; through Aug. 23) and '911 GNOMES: A CHRISTMAS EMERGENCY' (Aug. 14-15, 3 p.m.; through Aug. 18) at Teatro LATEA. This new Lower East Side festival is devoted to emerging playwrights, and you don't get much more emergent than Joshua Turchin. Only 12, Turchin is the composer, book writer, lyricist and co-star of "The Perfect Fit," a musical about a teenage actress who considers renouncing her dreams after the mother of one of her competitors sabotages her latest project. Recommended for theatergoers 4 and older, this developmental production is already a hot ticket: All dates are currently sold out, but the box office is maintaining a standby list, and a performance may be added. Shellie O'Neal's play "911 Gnomes," also for family audiences, begins with an interesting premise: Santa's staff is as vulnerable to nasty viruses as the rest of us. When all the elves get the flu right before Christmas, the North Pole has to turn to garden gnomes to finish the holiday preparation. They kind of look the part, but can they do the job? The festival invites you to find out in this vicarious escape from the August heat.

'SPIDER-MAN: INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE' at the Museum of the Moving Image (through Aug. 11, noon). Just when you thought all the good superhero jobs had been taken, along comes a film that proves that you can have not just one but multiple Spider-Men (and even Spider-Women). That situation requires many dimensions and an alteration of the space-time continuum, but those issues pose no problem for this animated picture, which this Queens museum is showing in 3-D as part of its series Summer Matinees: Fantastic Worlds. Here, though, the fantastic world is also contemporary Brooklyn, where the newest Spider-Man happens to be Miles Morales, a middle school student of black and Latino heritage. Directed by Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey and Rodney Rothman, "this may be the first 'Spider-Man' feature to qualify as a great New York movie, drawn from the life of the city rather than outdated stereotypes," A. O. Scott said in his review in The New York Times last year.

'STORY PIRATES FAMILY FLAGSHIP SHOW' at the Cherry Lane Theater (Aug. 10, 11 a.m.). A child's vivid imagination is a true treasure, and that's what the Story Pirates steal -- or rather borrow -- in their endlessly amusing work. Soliciting tales from kids, the company turns the submissions into sketches that combine the original plots, ideas and characters with music, sets and costumes created by the troupe. This show will feature numbers from the ensemble's new album, "Backstroke Raptor," which includes tunes like "A Hamster's Workday" and "The Giraffe Didn't Know," along with excerpts from the Story Pirates' podcast. But come prepared: The group also promises to improvise comic bits based on suggestions from the audience.

New leaders at Mill City Summer Opera; Cat Video Festival at CHS Field

Texto completo: What’s opera without drama? Mill City Summer Opera recently lost the venue for which it was named and where it has performed every summer since 2012. On Monday, it announced a new executive director and a new artistic advisor. Meanwhile, its most recent artistic director has quietly departed.
MCSO’s home from the start has been the Ruin Courtyard at Mill City Museum in Minneapolis. Mill City is a Minnesota Historical Society museum, and the society chose not to extend MCSO’s contract beyond the 2019 season. MCSO has already found a new home at Paikka, an indoor/outdoor event venue in St. Paul’s Vandalia Tower complex. It will lose the ambience of the Ruin Courtyard but gain the options of air conditioning and a roof when needed, two things everyone would have welcomed this summer. But will it still be called Mill City Summer Opera? Paikka Summer Opera doesn’t have the same ring.
Crystal Manich was named artistic director in September 2018 and led this summer’s production of “Cosi fan tutte.” She wasn’t mentioned in the release announcing the two new appointments.
Cory Johnson will be MCSO’s executive director, and Eric Einhorn will be artistic advisor. Johnson has been MCSO’s development director for two years. He brings extensive experience in arts fundraising and large-scale gala event management, along with global meeting and travel planning expertise. Einhorn is the co-founder of On Site Opera, a New York City-based company that specializes in immersive, site-specific productions. He has directed productions for Chicago Lyric Opera, Glimmerglass Opera, and Pittsburgh Opera, among others, and has been a member of the Metropolitan Opera’s stage directing staff since 2005.
In a statement, MCSO founder Karen Brooks praised Johnson and Einhorn’s “bold visions and willingness to innovate and take risks, allowing us to explore new opportunities, directions and approaches as we enter this new era.”
Manich wrote in an email to the Star Tribune: “I elected to not seek contract renewal as the company investigates new venues and enters a new artistic chapter. I look forward to following Mill City Summer Opera’s future success.”
Manich had taken over from Brian DeMaris, who served as interim AD following the departure of David Lefkowich, who was AD from “Pagliacci” (MCSO’s debut in 2012) through “Maria de Buenos Aires” (2017). Lefkowich is now AD of Out of the Box Opera in Minneapolis.
We don’t yet know what next summer’s opera will be, but we do know that MCSO has commissioned Minneapolis-based composer Mary Ellen Childs to write a new opera. “Stone Arch: A Walking Opera” will be performed on the Stone Arch Bridge sometime next year.
Hennepin History Museum names new ED
John R. Crippen has been named Hennepin History Museum’s new executive director. The Minnesota native was an undergrad at the University of Minnesota and earned his MS in history museum studies at SUNY-Oneonta. He spent 30 years at the Minnesota Historical Society, where his positions included director of Mill City Museum and director of historic sites and museums, overseeing all 31 of Minnesota’s state historic sites. Crippen helped form and sustain the Minneapolis Riverfront Partnership and co-founded the Mill City Farmers Market.
“After living in Hennepin County for the past twenty-five years,” Crippen said in a statement, “I am eager to get to know all of its communities better and find creative ways to tell their stories.” He’ll start his new position in early September.
Crippen succeeds Cedar Imboden Phillips, who served as director from 2014 until late last year. Phillips is now a foreign service officer at the U.S. Department of State.
Hennepin History Museum was founded in 1938, in part with funds from the Works Progress Administration. Located in the historic Christian Family Residence at 2303 Third Avenue South, just up the street from the Minneapolis Institute of Art, it offers exhibitions, an archive library, collections, publications and educational programs on Hennepin County history.
The picks
Tonight at CHS Field: Cat Video Festival. The passing of Grumpy Cat in May was widely mourned. This year’s Cat Video Fest – the eighth iteration of the popular annual event that began at the Walker – will feature a special tribute to Grumpy, whose family will be there. Also the usual videos, games, eating, drinking, costume-wearing and fireworks. 6-9:30 p.m. FMI and tickets ($10 general admission).
Now through Sunday: Minnesota Fringe Festival. The Fringe recommends, and rightly so, that you see your top picks ASAP – before the weekend rush, if you can. Don’t know what to see? Visit the website, scroll through the shows, look for the ones with high star ratings (five or four and a half), then read some reviews. “You Are Cordially Invited to the Life and Death of Edward Lear” by Winding Sheet Outfit has tons of five-star reviews. Ditto John Heimbuch’s one-man “Beowulf.” And “Chisago: The Musical.” Just to name a few. FMI. Last day: Aug. 11.
Friday at the Dakota: Joey DeFrancesco Trio. It’s been 30 years since Hammond B3 organist (and trumpeter, and singer) Joey D released his debut album, the strong and swinging “All of Me.” He was all of 17. His latest, “In the Key of the Universe,” released in March on Mack Avenue, is a mind-blowing collaboration with the great tenor saxophonist Pharoah Sanders. One word: whoa. We won’t see Sanders at the Dakota, but we will have a night with the artist who’s been called “the best B3 player on the planet.” With Troy Roberts and Khary Shaheed. Shows at 7 and 9 p.m. FMI and tickets ($25/35).
Friday at the Pantages: Bruce Hornsby & the Noisemakers. Hornsby’s signature song, “The Way It Is,” still rings with greatness (and relevance) 33 years after its release. Hornsby has had an amazing career since, collaborating with the Grateful Dead, Bon Iver, Spike Lee, the Staves and many others, exploring classical, bluegrass, gospel, and jazz. His latest album, “Absolute Zero,” described as “folk-jazz,” features Jack DeJohnette, Vernon, and the contemporary classical ensemble yMusic along with Twin Cities musicians JT Bates, Mike Lewis and Jeremy Ylvisaker. The New York Times called it “complex and untrendy.” Hornsby will perform here with his current band, the Noisemakers, and S. Carey, who will also open for him. 8 p.m. FMI and tickets ($68-78). Every ticket includes a download or CD copy of “Absolute Zero.”
Saturday at Hamline’s Sundin Music Hall: Lyra Baroque Orchestra: Across the Alps with Pedro Gandia, violin. Part of the Twin Cities Early Music Festival, this concert will explore the spread of the Italian Style across Europe in overtures, sinfonias, and concertos by Vivaldi, Biber, Bach, Locatelli and other composers. 7:30 p.m. FMI and tickets ($30/25/5).

Texto completo: Summer in Taos and all around the county means the air is abuzz with activity. From Angel Fire's Festival Eclectica to the Dog Days benefit concert in Taos, there's even more music, art and more. Here's a brief rundown of what's going on. For more, check out a copy of Tempo magazine, inside today's edition of Taos News on sale right now.
Car show winners announced
Miranda Vargas won first place, Robert Romero took second place and the Peoples Choice award went to Gilbert Tafoya at the big Car Show to benefit the Taos Integrated School for the Arts on Saturday (Aug. 3) on Civic Plaza Drive.
“We had an amazing turnout – we ended up with 32 cars,” organizer Yavanne Jaramillo said. “We gave trophies for first second and third place in the People’s Choice award. Mantes Chow Cart was our food vendor. Monica from Smoke & Mirrors was our DJ. We had a section for kids’ face painting; we had the Carson National Forest Service making Christmas ornaments to send to the U.S.Capitol with the Christmas tree that was a great turnout. It was a great family event.”
Free photography talk
Internationally known photographers Alex Webb and Rebecca Norris Webb will offer a free slide talk Aug. 29, 7:30 p.m., at the Taos Community Auditorium, 145 Paseo del Pueblo Norte. It is titled “Together and Apart: The Photographs of Alex Webb and Rebecca Norris Webb,” and is free and open to the public.
They are also planning a photography workshop Aug. 20-21 that is already sold out.
The slide talk will show a selection of work from both the photographers’ individual and collaborative projects. Webb will present work from “La Calle,” a book featuring 30 years of his photographs from Mexico, and Norris Webb will show work from her third book, “My Dakota.”
The Webbs will also present work from their joint book on Cuba, titled “Violet Isle,” as well as their upcoming collaborative book, “Brooklyn: The City Within” (Aperture, Sept. 2020). Following the slide talk, there will be a Q&A moderated by Taos Center for the Arts Executive Director Colette LaBouff.
Alex Webb has published 16 books, including a survey book of 30 years of color work, “The Suffering of Light.” He’s exhibited at museums worldwide including the Whitney Museum of American Art, the High Museum of Art, Atlanta, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. A Magnum Photos member since 1979, his work has appeared in The New York Times Magazine , National Geographic and other publications. He has received numerous awards including a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2007 and an NEA grant in 2019.
Originally a poet, Norris Webb often interweaves her text and photographs in her six books, most notably with her monograph, “My Dakota,” an elegy for her brother who died unexpectedly. It appeared in a solo exhibition of the work at the Cleveland Museum of Art in 2015. A recipient of a 2019 National Endowment for the Arts grant, Noris Webb’s work has appeared in The New Yorker, The New York Times Magazine , Le Monde , among other publications, and is in the collections of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Cleveland Museum of Art and George Eastman Museum, Rochester, New York.
For questions about this event, contact LaBouff at colette@tcataos.org. For further information about Taos Center for the Arts, call (575) 758-2052.
Taos Watercolor Society gets set for big annual show

Texto completo: After each mass shooting in America, the nation relives a near-scripted clash: calls for stricter gun laws, pushback from pro-gun activists led by the National Rifle Association, and an ultimate impasse.
But this time — following seven days that left at least 35 people dead in shootings in Gilroy, California; El Paso, Texas; and Dayton, Ohio — one side of that power struggle appears to have shifted.
The NRA is busy managing another crisis: Its own.
For months the organization has weathered a series of public spectacles stemming from both infighting and outside scrutiny. Most recently, in the middle of last week’s mass shootings, three members of the NRA board resigned, citing concerns over irresponsible spending by the organization’s leaders.
The NRA’s opponents see the chaos as a vulnerability, something not lost on supporters who have grown frustrated with the national organization.
“Those of us who are plugged into this, who are living it, are wondering why this is happening and why it seemingly isn't being fixed,” said Mark Walters, an NRA member and host of the syndicated Armed American Radio. “[Especially] at a time it is so important that we have a strong National Rifle Association coming into 2020, in particular on the heels of this mess with California, El Paso, and Dayton. ”
A spokesman for the NRA did not respond to a request to interview Chief Executive Officer Wayne LaPierre, instead providing a statement that touted “a string of recent victories” under the NRA’s new political team.
“With many in the media writing the obituary of the NRA, we are scoring big wins in the legislative, legal, and public policy arenas,” Andrew Arulanandam wrote.
The NRA’s opponents see them as putting on a good face.
“I've never seen them weaker,” said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a national advocacy group. “I think that they have been very much sidelined. ”
As proof, he pointed to the fact that gun control groups outspent gun rights groups in the 2018 midterm elections. The gun control lobby spent about $12. 1 million to the gun rights’ $10 million ($8. 2 million of that coming from the NRA), according to numbers compiled by Open Secrets, a nonpartisan group that tracks lobbying and election spending.
And that, he said, was all “before the five-alarm fire. ”
The turmoil in the NRA has been unfolding for months.
The group began the year by downplaying its relationship with Maria Butina, a Russian agent later convicted and sentenced to 18 months in prison for trying to infiltrate political organizations on behalf of the Kremlin. Butina had become cozy with the group, including helping to host a delegation of NRA insiders in Moscow in 2015. McClatchy has reported that the Justice Department is investigating whether one of her associates, former Russian official and NRA member Alexander Torshin, illegally moved Russian money through the group to back President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign.
Then in April, the organization’s president, Oliver North, was forced out after raising concerns about the group’s finances and amid allegations that he had attempted to engineer the removal of LaPierre. LaPierre, who accused North of extortion, is now facing increased pressure to resign, including from deep-pocketed donors concerned about the ongoing strife, the New York Times has reported. The palace intrigue continued in June when the group ousted its longtime top lobbyist, Chris Cox, saying he also engineered the attempted coup against LaPierre.
The New York Attorney General's Office also is investigating the organization’s tax-exempt status. And the District of Columbia attorney general has another probe into the organization and its charitable foundation.
Even with public pressure from the recent mass shootings, many watching the debate are skeptical that the NRA’s troubles will dramatically move the needle on gun control legislation. Congress has failed to pass broad reform for decades. And Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has thus far ignored Democrats’ calls for a special vote over the summer recess to consider gun measures.
Some Republican lawmakers have signaled a willingness to consider “red-flag” legislation that would allow law enforcement, family members and other concerned individuals to ask a judge to confiscate guns from those who may be a danger to themselves or others. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R. -S. C. , this week said he planned to introduce a bill that would create a federal grant program to encourage states to pass such laws.
Trump in remarks at the White House on Sunday backed the idea of red-flag laws, while blaming violent video games and mental illness as causes of mass shootings. On Wednesday, the president said he is also considering tougher background checks for gun buyers, calling such checks “important. ”
The NRA praised the president’s Sunday call to address “the root causes” of violence and said the organization believes anyone “adjudicated as a danger to themselves or others should not have access to firearms. ”
Lawmakers considering new gun measures know that how they vote will influence whether the NRA endorses them — one of the most powerful tools at the organization's disposal, said Adam Winkler, a professor at the UCLA School of Law and author of "Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America. "
“The threat is always there and I think that is enough to sway a lot of lawmakers,” he said. “But we’ll have to see how it plays out. I think the NRA is going through remarkable internal strife right now. ”
Harry L. Wilson, a political scientist at Roanoke University who focuses on gun control,said he doubts the NRA’s troubles will have much impact on the current legislative debate. In the short term, he said, there’s “nothing the NRA honestly needs to do. ”
“The sides are pretty firmly dug in, I think, legislatively,” he said. “Most elected officials are representing districts that are pretty firmly Democrat or pretty firmly Republican and they're not going to change their positions because there's no incentive for them to change their positions. ”
The majority of NRA members, also, won’t be swayed by the national strife, according to Jerry Henry, executive director of gun-rights group Georgia Carry.
“A lot of people belong to organizations just to say they belong to them. . . . That’s what the majority of basically what all NRA members are,” said Henry, who has been a member for more than five decades. “They just follow it because they know that it can help them. They know it’s not going to hurt them, and they know they can get hurt without organizations like the NRA. ”
Wilson said the impact of the NRA’s infighting could be more dramatic down the line if the problems persist and discourage donations. He said while it’s impossible to know how much money the organization has lost due to the crisis, “it has to be having an impact on fundraising. ” Walters, the radio show host, said the same, noting that many of his callers have vowed to not donate to the NRA until LaPierre resigns, something Walters has publicly called for.
Some former NRA supporters appear to be taking their money elsewhere. Alan Gottlieb, founder of the Second Amendment Foundation, said he’s seen at least a 20 percent increase in donations and memberships since April, likely a combination of those disenfranchised by the NRA and those motivated by seeing “20 plus Democratic candidates for president out there attacking gun rights every single day. ”
“They play into each other,” he said. “One, the Democratic candidates screaming for gun control creates the threat. And two, people can't necessarily count on the NRA to be there to solve all the problems for them. ”
Gottlieb said his organization is trying to “fill up some of the gaps” created by the NRA’s turmoil, not just legislatively but looking ahead to the 2020 general election.
Activists in battleground states are watching the national organization’s strife closely. Shira Goodman, executive director of the nonprofit CeaseFire PA, said she hopes the “the lawsuits, the turmoil, the internal dissension, the attempted coups” will damage the NRA’s brand. Over time, she said, that could weaken the group’s own support and strengthen the other side by motivating those who had viewed the NRA as unbeatable. “Having a belief that you will ultimately prevail is critical,” she said.
She and others stressed, though, that the NRA still has its biggest asset: single-issue, pro-gun voters it can mobilize in an election.
“Those people will take the NRA voting guide to the polls,” Goodman said. “And that is not going to disappear overnight. ”

Texto completo: A caftan puts April Matthis in a sultry frame of mind. "They give you a feeling of air on your skin," said Ms. Matthis, an actress in New York. "When the wind hits you a certain way, the line of your body is there. That's sensual. It's pleasurable."
It's a mood, she might have added, that runs counter to the caftan's current rep.
Tentlike and engulfing, the caftan has been touted of late as a chaste, distinctly freeing alternative to the pantsuit, its shroudlike silhouette embraced by politicians, celebrities, Brooklyn moms and faux boho influencers as a banner for the #MeToo generation, a curve-annihilating badge of wokeness.
It may be all that. But to dismiss it, as a New York Times article did last year, as a "boxy, ankle-length" robe, with all the allure of a garbage bag, is to miss the mark. The caftan is sexy.
In the hands of designers who over the years have included Balenciaga, Yves Saint Laurent, Thea Porter, Halston and Anna Sui, caftans, slit to the hip or slashed at the bodice, projected an erotic charge.
"There is something hidden, something secret about it," said Stephanie von Watzdorf, who offers caftans in breezy and more formal variations in her Figue fashion line, and who is besotted with their aura of mystery. "For me what's always been a point of curiosity is that you don't quite know what's underneath."
Resurrected in the 1960s as the high-style insignia of the beautiful people, caftans carried a whiff of indolent sensuality -- a hint of depravity that fires imaginations to this day. They wafted steamily through resort 2020 collections, among them Valentino, Gucci and the Row.
As often as not, designers' point of reference was Patrick Lichfield's 1970 portrait of Talitha Getty poised with her husband, the oil heir John Paul Getty Jr., on a rooftop in Morocco, the train of her caftan eddying around her.
Elizabeth Taylor, widely regarded as the caftan queen, has been just as inspiring. In the 1965 melodrama "The Sandpiper," she works her wiles on a priest (Richard Burton), enveloping him in the ample folds of her bell-sleeve crimson robe.
In Joseph Losey's 1968 film, "Boom!," an enduring cult favorite with the fashion set, La Taylor is more haute than hippie. As an overwrought society moll, she drifts across her terrace in Capri in a frothy white caftan, its sheerness both a taunt and tacit invitation.
Coolly regal variations included the translucent sequin-embroidered Mila Schön caftan worn by Marella Agnelli in 1966 to Truman Capote's era-defining Black and White Ball.
"It hinted at her shape, but it didn't give away too many naughty bits," said Rachel Elspeth Gross, a writer and amateur fashion historian who recently posted an image of Ms. Agnelli on Instagram. In its day, Ms. Gross said, Ms. Angelli's gown provoked heated debate "about what you can and can't show in public."
There was the French model Simone d'Aillencourt, who posed for Vogue in the 1960s wearing a diaphanous Pucci caftan, the gown and her loose-jointed posture sending come-hither signals.
The caftan today can be just as suggestive. "But its sexiness is not in your face," said Ellen Carey, whose fashion showroom Seed represents Monica Patel, the name behind the label Two New York, as well as the Australian designer Megan Park. Their caftans bring to mind an ethereal woman, Ms. Carey said, one who during the 1990s may have worn the billowy, exotic confections of the Milanese designer Romeo Gigli.
The counterparts of that woman now are less formal, if not less provocative, and as likely to saunter on the beach as to step out at night in a peach-tone linen caftan by Ms. Park; a shirt-collared interpretation in black and gold stripes by Lisa Marie Fernandez; an awning stripe rendition by Tory Burch; or one of Ms. Patel's multihued demi-sheer caftans made from hand-woven Indian sari cloth.
Body-skimming or flowing, wildly colored or plain, the caftan has an air that is relaxed, even hedonistic at times, its attitude eminently boudoir worthy.
"What makes it so sexy," Ms. Patel said, "is the way that you feel when you're wearing it."

We can't blame other nations for warning against U.S. visits High health care costs, gun violence and other realities of Trump's America justify caution.

Texto completo: Have we become a country to avoid?
Uruguay seems to think so. Its Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued an alert after the El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, shootings for Uruguayan nationals traveling to the United States. It advises they "take extreme precautions in the face of growing indiscriminate violence, mostly hate crimes, including racism and discrimination, which killed more than 250 people in the first seven months of this year."
Blaming the "indiscriminate possession of firearms by the population," it recommends that everybody, but particularly children, avoid shopping malls, theme parks, religious activities and cultural and sporting events. It warns about cities such as Detroit, Baltimore and Albuquerque, "among the 20 most dangerous in the world."
Venezuela piled on - not entirely credibly, given U.S. efforts to remove that country's regime - by recommending Monday that its citizens postpone travel to the United States or take "extreme precautions" given the "violence and crimes of indiscriminate hatred" perpetuated by "the supremacist elite that holds political power in Washington."
The Japanese are spooked, too: Japan's consulate in Detroit warned this week that its nationals "should be aware of the potential for gunfire incidents everywhere in the United States," which they called "a gun society," the Los Angeles Times reported.
Mexico, which lost several of its citizens in the El Paso massacre, even announced that it is considering legal action because the United States isn't adequately protecting Mexican nationals in the United States. Its Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced "a series of legal, diplomatic and protective measures to guarantee justice for the victims of the shooting and to protect the rights of Mexican communities in the United States." It will confer with other Spanish-speaking countries with similar concerns.
Suddenly, we're the banana republic, and the rest of the world is warning about the dangerous and hate-filled place under President Trump's administration. Pretty soon they'll be warning visitors to boil drinking water and to take preventive antibiotics.
But that's how it has been lately. In 2017, The New York Times reported, the Canadian and British governments updated their warnings to travelers about violence after the Las Vegas massacre. In 2016, when Trump's anti-Muslim rhetoric on the campaign trail was accompanied by an increase in anti-Muslim violence, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain cautioned its citizens about demonstrations against police violence, CBS News reported. The Bahamas advised young men to "exercise extreme caution" in "interactions with the police."
New Zealand warns visitors to the United States that "a number of politically motivated attacks have occurred," and, citing the Las Vegas shooting, cautions about "active shooter incidents" and "higher incidence of violent crime and firearm possession."
Germany warns of terrorist attacks, "an increased risk of politically motivated violence" and easy access to firearms. It also cautions about "long distances" to hospitals and says "treatments are expensive."
Britain, too, warns that "medical treatment is expensive" and cautions about "indiscriminate" terrorist attacks and border crime and drugs.
Canada warns about gang violence and says "even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time."
Now, where would they get such ideas about the United States?
Well, maybe it's because the president of the United States has been declaring to all the world that gangs and illegal aliens have "overrun" the border and flooded the country with drugs. American cities are so "dangerous," "filthy" and full of rodents that "no human being" would want to live in them. The leadership of the FBI is "corrupt" and the Justice Department is so dubious that "Justice" must be put in quotes. There is "no border security," there are "killers coming in and murderers coming in," and "deadly sanctuary cities" release "dangerous criminals." American carnage!
That vision of America, as outlined by Trump, is largely fiction. But our friends around the world would be justified in warning their citizens about certain realities of Trump's America.
FOREIGN MINISTRY ALERT! Travelers to the United States should be aware that: Air and water standards have been loosened, millions have lost health care, the military has been politicized, opposition lawmakers face calls to be deported, children have been taken from their parents and caged on the border, aviation safety has come into question, sea levels are rising with no countermeasures, the free press and courts been threatened, the most senior government official flouts the law with impunity, religious bigotry and racial hatred have been stoked at the highest level and violence by white nationalists has surged.
Foreign nationals should take extreme precautions in Trump's America. So should the rest of us.

Proposed California Law Would Punish Companies for Failing to Limit Harm to the Planet’s Forests

In an effort to cut carbon emissions and forestall the climate crisis, California legislators are pushing a new law aimed at helping limit deforestation around the globe.
The proposed bill, called the California Deforestation-Free Procurement Act, or AB 572, would require companies that contract with the state to certify that their products do not cause the cutting of sensitive tropical forests or the destruction of boggy peatland soils in tropical regions — both of which contain enormous stores of carbon dioxide.
The bill appears meant to add muscle to what are currently voluntary corporate pledges to limit environmental harm in the production of soy, cattle, rubber, timber and palm oil. It could mean new restrictions on everything from the paper used in California’s office printers, to the wooden conference tables furnishing those offices, to the food served in state cafeterias, which may contain palm oil grown on former forestlands.
“Hundreds of companies have made a rhetorical commitment to remove deforestation from their supply chains,” said Jeff Conant, senior international forests program manager for Friends of the Earth, an environmental organization that is backing the legislation. “But the only incentives for them to implement those commitments is market pressure or reputational risk.”
“This would be the first piece of legislation,” Conant said, “that puts that kind of commitment under the scrutiny of legislators.”
The bill’s backers assert that tropical forests cover 7% of the earth’s surface and are home to roughly half of the world’s species. Eighteen million acres of tropical forest are cut each year, the bill says, an act that both releases the carbon dioxide in the timber and ends the abilities of the trees to absorb additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. As a result, tropical deforestation is one of the largest global drivers of carbon emissions.
California’s proposed legislation follows an investigation last year by ProPublica and The New York Times Magazine into Indonesia’s role in producing palm oil on tropical forestlands and vulnerable peatland. That investigation found that some companies were illegally destroying protected forests there, leading to the release of more carbon in a year than all of Europe. The palm oil is used in food, but also for “green” biofuels once meant to serve as their own check on carbon emissions in Europe and the United States.
See the Investigation
Fuel to the Fire
A decade ago, the U.S. mandated the use of vegetable oil in biofuels, leading to industrial-scale deforestation — and a huge spike in carbon emissions.
The bill’s author, San Jose assembly member Ash Kalra, also travelled to Brazil last year, where he witnessed a similar scope of forest destruction.
How such a bill would be enforced and exactly what it would mean for California remain open questions. In places like Indonesia, loopholes in regulations have allowed deforestation to continue despite laws banning it. California would not actively investigate compliance; it would instead rely on companies to self-certify that their supply chains are not contributing to tropical deforestation or peatland destruction.
But companies found to violate the commitment could see their contracts canceled and face fines — potentially even misdemeanor criminal charges — according to Kalra’s office. The bill would require the state’s Department of General Services to develop a set of formal guidelines for compliance, including a list of commodities that present a potential risk to forests.
“Unlike most corporate policies, the fact that this one includes real penalties for fake commitments gives it teeth,” said Glenn Hurowitz, chief executive of the anti-deforestation group Mighty Earth.

Texto completo: Lawyers bringing a lawsuit against the Boy Scouts of America said Tuesday they believe they've turned up allegations of sexual abuse against more than 350 people not previously identified in files released by the organization.
Attorneys with the Abused in Scouting group filed a lawsuit Monday in Philadelphia Common Pleas Court, alleging a one-time scout leader sexually abused a minor identified only by initials.
The suit alleges that the abuse of the then-12- or 13-year-old victim by an assistant scout leader began in 1974 or 1975 and continued until about 1980.
It also says that the lawyers received allegations of abuse from their clients against more than 350 people involved with the scouts who had not previously been named.
The Irving, Texas-based scouts compiled so-called ineligible volunteer files for years on people considered to pose a risk of abuse, and about 5,000 of these files have been made public as a result of court action.
Monday's suit is claiming that the lawyers now have hundreds of names that were not in those public files. It does not list the names.
An email message seeking comment was sent to the Boy Scouts.
The lawsuit comes as states have begun changing their statutes of limitations to make it easier for long-ago victims of sexual assault can seek damages in court.
The Boy Scouts have said previously that when any volunteer is added to the database for suspected abuse, "they are reported to law enforcement, removed entirely from any Scouting and prohibited from rejoining anywhere."
China vows to counter if US places midrange arms in Asia
BEIJING - China said Tuesday that it "will not stand idly by" and will take countermeasures if the U.S. deploys intermediate-range missiles in the Asia-Pacific region, which Washington has said it plans to do within months.
The statement from the director of the Foreign Ministry's Arms Control Department, Fu Cong, follows the U.S. withdrawal last week from the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, a move Fu said would have a "direct negative impact on the global strategic stability" as well as security in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.
Fu also advised other nations, particularly South Korea, Japan and Australia, to "exercise prudence" and not allow the United States to deploy such weapons on their territory, saying that would "not serve the national security interests of these countries."
Court allows Palin's lawsuit against NY Times to proceed
NEW YORK - The New York Times Co. must face a defamation lawsuit by former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin over a 2017 editorial that linked her to the 2011 shooting of Sen. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., a federal appeals court said.
The ruling is a win for the 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate, though the court said the bar remains high for Palin ultimately to prevail in the case.
The 21-page decision, which reinstated a lawsuit dismissed by a lower-court judge, is largely procedural, with the New York-based appeals court saying Palin's complaint "plausibly states a claim for defamation."
But it now allows her lawyers to obtain documents from The New York Times Co. and also question editorial page editor James Bennet.
Peter Strzok sues FBI for firing him over anti-Trump texts
WASHINGTON - A veteran FBI agent who wrote derogatory text messages about Donald Trump filed a lawsuit Tuesday charging the bureau caved to "unrelenting pressure" from the president when it fired him.
The suit from Peter Strzok also alleges he was unfairly punished for expressing his political opinions, and that the Justice Department violated his privacy when it shared hundreds of his text messages with reporters.
"This campaign to publicly vilify Special Agent Strzok contributed to the FBI's ultimate decision to unlawfully terminate him," the lawsuit says.
The complaint revisits a political drama that was seized on by conservative critics of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation as proof that the bureau was biased against Trump.
US envoy to Russia Jon Huntsman to resign post
WASHINGTON - Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Russia, is resigning from the diplomatic post he has held for almost two years, a period marked by growing confrontation and friction between Moscow and Washington.
In a resignation letter sent Tuesday to President Donald Trump, Huntsman characterized his tenure as a "historically difficult" time in bilateral relations. He will depart Oct. 3.
Huntsman had resigned during his second term as Utah governor in 2009 and became the U.S. ambassador to China under the Obama administration. He left that post two years later for an unsuccessful run for president. When he became ambassador to Moscow, he said he would take the job for two years.
In his resignation letter Huntsman, 59, said he wanted to return "to reconnect with our growing family and responsibilities."
Trump, RNC challenge California law on tax returns
WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee filed two lawsuits Tuesday against California officials, challenging a new law that would bar Trump from appearing on the state's primary ballot next year if he declines to disclose his tax returns.
The federal lawsuits, which were threatened last week when Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the bill into law, argue that the measure requiring presidential and gubernatorial candidates to release five years of tax returns runs afoul of the U.S. Constitution.
Newsom responded on Twitter to the lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court in Sacramento: "There's an easy fix Mr. President - release your tax returns as you promised during the campaign and follow the precedent of every president since 1973."
In Britain: A youth court in London ordered a teenager held on an attempted murder charge Tuesday for allegedly throwing a 6-year-old boy from a viewing area at the top of the British capital's Tate Modern museum.
The French boy was a short distance from his parents Sunday when he was picked up and thrown over the railing of the 10th-floor observation deck.
The police said other museum visitors stopped a 17-year-old British citizen from leaving until officers arrived, and that the two boys had no prior connection.
The 6-year-old is hospitalized in critical but stable condition with a sustained brain bleed and fractures to his spine, legs and arms.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Trump and the Republican National Committee filed a pair of lawsuits Tuesday against officials in California, challenging a new law requiring presidential candidates to release five years of tax returns in order to be placed on the state primary ballot in 2020.
The RNC suit, which was filed in the Eastern District of California and included the California Republican Party and several California Republican voters as plaintiffs, called the law a “naked political attack against the sitting president of the United States." It was filed against Governor Gavin Newsom and the California secretary of state.
Trump and his campaign filed a second suit challenging the constitutionality of the new law, and it named the California secretary of state and the state attorney general. In that suit, they argue that states do not have the power to “supplement" the qualifications for the president, set forth by the Constitution.
The California law, known as the Presidential Tax Transparency and Accountability Act, was signed by Newsom last week and was the latest flashpoint between the White House and the state of California, which is involved in more than 40 lawsuits against the Trump administration, on issues including environmental regulation and immigration.
The California state Legislature approved a similar measure in 2017, but the governor at the time, Jerry Brown, vetoed it, raising questions about whether it was constitutional.

McConnell campaign criticizes protesters
WASHINGTON — The reelection campaign of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, on Tuesday decried the actions of protesters outside his Louisville, Ky., home over the weekend as "serious calls to violence" and said it had notified law enforcement.
A group of 20 to 30 people gathered outside McConnell's home on Sunday night, with some voicing threats and shouting profanities during a protest that was broadcast on Facebook Live, according to an account in the New York Post.
The protesters reportedly were responding to McConnell's refusal thus far to allow the Republican-led Senate to consider bills passed by the Democratic-led House that seek to strengthen background checks for gun sales. The protest followed the mass shootings over the weekend in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, that left 31 people dead.
The senator was reportedly home recovering from a fractured shoulder at the time of the protest. Facebook video captured a moment where one of the protesters urged another to stab a voodoo doll representing McConnell in the heart.
In tweets Tuesday, McConnell's campaign characterized the protesters as "an angry left-wing mob of Amy McGrath supporters," referencing a Democrat who is seeking to topple McConnell in next year's election in Kentucky.
"These threats go far beyond a political cartoon or a broken shoulder, they are serious calls to physical violence and we've alerted law enforcement," the campaign said in one of its tweets.
In another tweet, the campaign referenced another episode over the weekend in which several McConnell supporters wearing "Team Mitch" T-shirts were photographed around a cardboard cutout of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, with some groping it and kissing it.
In a tweet Monday night directed at McConnell, Ocasio-Cortez asked whether the Senate leader was "paying for young men to practice groping & choking members of Congress w/ your payroll, or is this just the standard culture of #TeamMitch?"
The McConnell campaign's tweets on Tuesday suggested that McConnell faced a far greater danger.
"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and liberal Twitter personalities are trying to dox some underage kids for taking a photo with a cutout at the Fancy Farm political picnic and are cheering on thousands of accounts calling for Senator McConnell to 'break his neck,' " a campaign tweet said.
Washington Post
Trump accuses Google of bias against him
President Trump once again accused Alphabet Inc.'s Google of amplifying negative news stories about him, this time citing an ex-employee who claims he was fired for conservative bias.
“All very illegal. We are watching Google very closely!" Trump said in a series of tweets Tuesday, adding he'd met with Google CEO Sundar Pichai, though didn't say when. Trump tweeted a pair of clips from the segments late Monday, and continued to tweet about the subject Tuesday morning.
The Twitter storm is an indication that the president continues to try to rev up his base with charges of tech company bias as the 2020 election approaches.
Trump said he'd watched comments by Kevin Cernekee in a Fox News interview, where the former Google employee alleged that conservatives were harassed at the company. Cernekee said Google wants Trump to lose the 2020 election, and that Google executives wept after Trump's victory and “vowed that it would never happen again." Cernekee told Fox he's in a legal fight with the search engine giant after he was fired.
Google spokeswoman Jennifer Kaiser said Cernekee's comments “are absolutely false."
“We go to great lengths to build our products and enforce our policies in ways that don't take political leanings into account," Kaiser said.
Trump also cited comments to Fox Business by author Peter Schweizer, who alleged Google suppressed negative stories about Hillary Clinton.
Pichai “was in the Oval Office working very hard to explain how much he liked me, what a great job the Administration is doing, that Google was not involved with China's military, that they didn't help Crooked Hillary over me in the 2016 Election and that they are NOT planning to illegally subvert the 2020 Election despite all that has been said to the contrary," Trump said in a pair of Tuesday tweets.

New York Expands N.R.A. Investigation to Include Group's Board Members

Texto completo: With the gun debate intensifying in the wake of last weekend's mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, the National Rifle Association's problems deepened Monday evening as the New York attorney general's office issued a subpoena seeking documents from more than 90 current and former members of the organization's board.
The subpoena is an escalation of a continuing investigation into the tax-exempt status of the N.R.A., which is chartered in New York, and engulfs the organization's board of directors in the inquiry. The subpoena seeks financial records and other documents that would shed light on spending decisions made by the board.
The latest moves come in a year when the N.R.A. and its board have been in turmoil. Its finances and political machine are being strained amid a host of legal battles, as well as a rebellion from some donors and members and infighting that has led to the departures of the board's president, Oliver North, and the N.R.A.'s top lobbyist and second-in-command, Christopher W. Cox.
A spokeswoman for Letitia James, the New York attorney general, who opened the inquiry in April, declined to comment. Ms. James's office has broad authority to investigate nonprofits, and has been scrutinizing whether the N.R.A. was using funds designated for charitable purposes appropriately, and if payments made to board members, officers and affiliated parties complied with relevant tax laws and fiduciary requirements.
Her office can pursue potential remedies in court; a previous inquiry by Ms. James's predecessors led to the shuttering of President Trump's charitable foundation, a far smaller enterprise.
William A. Brewer III, the N.R.A.'s outside counsel, said in a statement: "As we understand it, counsel to the N.R.A. board accepted service of a subpoena to the board that relates to the production of documents and information."
He added: "Such a request was expected and, as we have said many times, the N.R.A. will cooperate with any reasonable, good faith request for information given the organization's commitment to good governance."
The group is also facing a separate inquiry by the attorney general for the District of Columbia, Karl A. Racine, who is focusing on the N.R.A. Foundation, a large affiliated charity chartered in Washington. Its ties to Russia have also been the focus of Congressional inquiries.
The latest development will apply new pressure to the board, which has largely but not uniformly supported Wayne LaPierre, the N.R.A.'s longtime chief executive, amid the recent power struggle that led to the departures of Mr. North and Mr. Cox. Last week, three board members who had opposed Mr. LaPierre's management -- Sean Maloney, Esther Schneider and Timothy Knight -- resigned from the board. On Monday, the N.R.A. disputed a report on a gun blog that its board had been dropped by the insurer who provides insurance against litigation, calling it untrue.
This year, a number of news accounts have raised questions about the N.R.A.'s spending decisions, many approved by its board. In March, The New York Times reported that Mr. North, then the board's president, had a lucrative financial contract with the N.R.A.'s most important contractor, the advertising firm Ackerman McQueen. (Ackerman and the N.R.A. subsequently embarked on a bitter legal battle.) The Times also reported that the N.R.A. had directed $ 18 million to a production company in which an N.R.A. official, Tyler Schropp, had a stake.
The organization's payment practices were further examined in an April story in The New Yorker. And in May, leaks revealed that Wayne LaPierre, the N.R.A.'s longtime chief executive, billed $ 275,000 through Ackerman McQueen for purchases at the Zegna luxury men's wear boutique in Beverly Hills and $ 267,000 in personal expenses, including flights and limousine service for trips to the Bahamas, Florida, Nevada, Budapest and an Italian lake resort. Payments made by the N.R.A. to its board members have also been an area of continuing scrutiny.
Ms. James's inquiry has aroused the ire of President Trump, a key N.R.A. ally. He tweeted in April, after the investigation was opened, that Ms. James and New York Governor Andrew M. Cuomo, whose administration is locked in its own legal battle with the N.R.A., were "using the State's legal apparatus to take down and destroy this very important organization."
Ms. James's office, in its own tweet later that day, wrote: "Attorney General Letitia James is focused on enforcing the rule of law. In any case we pursue, we will follow the facts wherever they may lead. We wish the President would share our respect for the law."

Her Life Was a Dance

Texto completo: There's an image that will stay with me forever: Toni Morrison, Bill T. Jones and Max Roach were all onstage together. Toni Morrison read her beautiful text, Max Roach was at the drums and Bill T. Jones was dancing. And at the end of the evening, Jones took Morrison in his arms and waltzed across the stage. I have spent the better part of today searching for that picture, the one of Toni Morrison dancing. There are several photos here from that performance, but the image of the curtain-call waltz may exist only in my memory of the evening.
The three artists had collaborated on a piece called "Degga" for the Lincoln Center Serious Fun festival. It was a fitting title because that evening, pictured here, was seriously fun. The year was 1995, and as The Times noted, "This was an evening spent with three icons of American culture, who hold among them two MacArthur grants, a Pulitzer and a Nobel Prize." The writer, Jennifer Dunning, went on to note, "Luckily, the three are also artists of irresistible vitality, whose intensity as performers made for theater that was a voyage of discovery."
Irresistible vitality and intensity were cornerstones of Morrison's extraordinary life. She wrote some of the finest novels in the English language. Yes. She was the first and remains the only African-American woman to win a Nobel Prize. Yes. But she also wrote plays: "Desdemona" and "Dreaming Emmett." She wrote the libretto for the opera "Margaret Garner," which traced the life of the woman who inspired her masterpiece, "Beloved." She wrote essays and picture books. In 2008, she was even nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children for her performance of a picture book she wrote with her son Slade, "Who's Got Game?"
The earliest photos of Morrison here aren't of her as the vaunted author but of her as editor. She was an editor at Random House who thought in 1970 that Muhammad Ali, still on the outs with the United States government over his draft status, should write an autobiography. She also worked closely with Angela Davis -- recently acquitted of murder, kidnapping and conspiracy charges -- to do the same.
Jill Krementz photographed her during these early years, when Morrison was a single mother of two young sons, who got up early to write before going into her publishing job. In these photos, you see her writing on the couch in her living room, you see her embracing her son. From the beginning, she never strived to be mysterious, as so many authors do. The photographs confirm what those of us who spent any time with her knew, she was gregarious and honest. She always let the world in -- especially women and people of color.
[ Read Toni Morrison's New York Times obituary.]
In a 1977 interview with The New York Times Book Review she talked about how she juggled motherhood, her job at Random House and a part-time job teaching fiction at Yale. "It does seem hectic," she said. "But the important thing is that I don't do anything else. I avoid the social life normally associated with publishing. I don't go to the cocktail parties. I don't give or go to dinner parties. I need that time in the evening because I can do a tremendous amount of work then."
She went on to explain that at 46, and after the success of her first three books -- "The Bluest Eye," "Sula" and "Song of Solomon" -- she was at long last finding the financial freedom to devote more of her time to writing. "I've always thought about writing full time, but there was so much insecurity about not having a job," she said. "I wanted to make a big score first."
The photos here can be viewed in some way as a travelogue, images along the path that was the big score of Morrison's legacy. She did not do cocktail parties, but she made time for a party in celebration of her winning the Nobel Prize. You can see her here, joyful and in her element, at Maya Angelou's home, with Oprah Winfrey; Susan L. Taylor, the longtime editor of Essence magazine; and Angela Davis. This photo captures "black girl magic" incarnate: There is so much beauty, so much power, so much excellence and activism and joy.
There came a point in Morrison's life when her very portrait became a kind of shorthand for literary gravitas. With her silver locks, she was, in her last decades, a lioness of letters. Images of her remind me of the Zora Neale Hurston quote: "I love myself when I am laughing. And then again when I am looking mean and impressive." Morrison could do serious like nobody's business, but she had the best laugh, the biggest smile. Her voice remained until the end, a seductive Marilyn Monroe-esque whisper. That comes through in the photos too, how her beauty had complexity. The books she wrote are an indisputable bounty, but the photos of her are their own kind of gift: a reminder that her life was a dance, a voyage of discovery, decades in the making.

Texto completo: One of the most closely watched #MeToo-related legal battles in classical music -- pitting the eminent conductor James Levine against the Metropolitan Opera, which fired him in 2018 amid accusations of sexual misconduct -- came to an inconclusive end on Tuesday, when the two sides announced that they had quietly settled their claims against each other.
The terms of the settlement between the Met and Mr. Levine, 76, were not disclosed in a stipulation discontinuing the case that was filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. Neither side would comment on the details, or whether money changed hands.
"I can't comment, other than to say it's settled," Edward J.M. Little, an attorney for Mr. Levine, said in a brief telephone interview. Tim McKeough, a spokesman for the Met, said in an email that he could not comment except to say that the "legal dispute with James Levine has been resolved, and as a result the case will not be moving forward."
The settlement brought the court battle to a close just as it threatened to air more dirty laundry about both Mr. Levine, who at his zenith was the most acclaimed American conductor since Leonard Bernstein, and the Met, which, with an annual budget of roughly $ 300 million, is the largest performing arts organization in the United States. Mr. Levine, whose musical leadership defined the Met for four decades, is unlikely ever to return to the company.
The Met initially suspended Mr. Levine in late 2017 after The New York Times published the accounts of several men who said that they had been sexually abused by him as teenagers; Mr. Levine denied their accusations. The Met fired him in March 2018, saying that its own investigation had "uncovered credible evidence that Mr. Levine engaged in sexually abusive and harassing conduct towards vulnerable artists in the early stages of their careers."
Mr. Levine then sued the Met for breach of contract and defamation. He sought more than $ 5.8 million, noting that his 10-year contract as music director emeritus, the title he took after stepping down as music director in 2016, entitled him to a salary of $ 400,000 a year and an additional $ 27,000 per performance. The Met responded by filing a counterclaim against Mr. Levine for roughly the same amount -- detailing accusations that Mr. Levine had abused or harassed people for decades, and accusing him of violating his duties to the Met and harming the institution.
A judge dismissed almost all of Mr. Levine's defamation claims against the Met this spring, but Mr. Levine's breach-of-contract claims may have been strengthened by the fact that his agreement with the Met did not contain a so-called "morals clause" holding him to certain standards of behavior. Mr. Levine's lawyers, who denied all the allegations against him, argued in court papers that the contract contained no provisions that would have allowed the Met to remove Mr. Levine "due to alleged or actual misconduct or wrongdoing."
Were the case to have entered the deposition phase, there would have been risks to both sides. The case could have put into the public record more details of the accusations against Mr. Levine, and about his closely guarded private life; before the suit was settled, Mr. Levine's lawyers had been fighting a request by the Met for his medical records. And it could have renewed questions about what the Met knew, or should have known, about the behavior of its longtime music director, given the misconduct it said it had found evidence of.
The lawsuit was already a major public relations concern for the company. In one court filing, the Met's lawyers said the company had incurred "significant reputational and economic harm as a result of the publicity associated with Levine's misconduct."
But the confidential settlement leaves some of the big issues raised by the case unresolved, at least in public.
The Met detailed some of the allegations against Mr. Levine in its counterclaims, which described a pattern of abusive and harassing conduct dating back to the mid-1970s, soon after Mr. Levine's debut with the company in 1971, saying that he had "demanded and received sex acts" from a musician whose opportunities in the Met orchestra he had exerted "influence and control over."
Among other incidents, the Met said that Mr. Levine had groped and kissed an opera singer, against the singer's will, after an audition at the Met in the 1980s, and then placed the singer in a prestigious program at the Met. And in 1999, the company said, Mr. Levine had "inappropriately touched" a member of the Met's young artist program, which he oversaw, "on his knees, legs and hands," and then invited the singer to his dressing room "to engage in sexual activity."
Lawyers for Mr. Levine emphatically denied the Met's allegations. "The Met's so-called 'investigation' of Levine's conduct," they wrote in court papers, "was nothing more than a pretext for the Met to suspend, fire and defame him."
From the start, Mr. Levine's lawyers described his firing as a result of a vendetta by the Met's general manager, Peter Gelb, whom they accused of "cynically hijacking the good will of the #MeToo movement" and of seizing upon the allegations of misconduct "as a pretext to end a longstanding personal campaign to force Levine out of the Met."
The first public allegations came out in late 2017, when The New York Post and The Times reported detailed accusations by a man, who later identified himself as Ashok Pai, who said Mr. Levine had abused him for years, beginning when he was a teenager, at the Ravinia Festival in Illinois.
Mr. Pai had reported his experience to the Lake Forest Police Department in Illinois in 2016. No criminal charges were brought against Mr. Levine; Illinois officials noted that, among other things, while the state's age of consent is higher now, it was still 16 in 1986, the age Mr. Pai was and the year in which he said Mr. Levine, then in his early 40s, had first sexually abused him.
The Met suspended Mr. Levine the next day, when The Times reported the accounts of more accusers, including Chris Brown, a bassist who said that Mr. Levine had abused him in 1968, when he was a 17-year-old student at the Meadow Brook School of Music in Michigan and Mr. Levine, then 25, led the school's orchestral institute; and James Lestock, a cellist, who said that he, too, was abused at the school and later, when he joined a tight-knit clique of musicians known as Levinites who followed Mr. Levine as his career began to flourish. In addition, Albin Ifsich, who became a violinist in the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra, said that Mr. Levine had abused him when he was a member of the clique.
Met officials said at the time of Mr. Levine's suspension that they were only aware of two occasions when allegations of misconduct by Mr. Levine had been brought to the company's leaders. In 1979, Anthony A. Bliss, the Met's executive director, wrote a letter to a board member who had received anonymous allegations about Mr. Levine, saying that he had "no knowledge of criminal activities on the part of Mr. Levine" and that "scurrilous rumors" had circulated for months. And in October 2016, after Mr. Levine had become music director emeritus, Mr. Gelb was contacted by the Lake Forest Police about Mr. Pai's report. Mr. Gelb said that he had briefed the board's leadership about the inquiry and that Mr. Levine had denied the accusations; Mr. Gelb said that the company took no further action at the time, waiting to see what the police determined.
But the company said that the investigation it commissioned had found numerous instances of misconduct. "During the course of the investigation, the Met for the first time uncovered credible evidence that Levine (during his association with the Met) engaged in sexually abusive and harassing conduct towards numerous artists," it wrote in court papers.
The day the allegations against him were first made public in 2017, Mr. Levine had just conducted his 2,577th, and very likely final, Met performance: the Verdi Requiem.

Texto completo: Our firefighting truth tellers in the national news media have decided to attack the New York Times as fake news. The crime leading to the Grey Lady getting canceled? A few dozen characters of a headline attempting to describe President Trump's extended response to two mass shootings with different motives: "TRUMP URGES UNITY VS. RACISM."
Leftists and leftists disguised as journalists who have spent the past two years melting down in apoplectic rages over Trump's crude and demeaning demeanor toward the free press have responded by spearheading a #CancelNYT movement.
TweetTweetTweet
And the cherry on top:
Tweet
On a purely practical level, the irony of Qatari funded lobbyists and cable news contributors scoffing from their Georgetown estates at late-night copy editors attempting to objectively describe one of the most politically charged tragedies of our century's most polarizing presidency is laughable. But more importantly, how the New York Times responded illustrated a growing failure in the public's expectations of the news.
Tweet
This objectively true headline earned the scorn of journalists again, but not for the reason it should have. Predictably, leftists fulminated online that the Times still failed to insert an editorial condemnation of Trump. But the true problem lies in the updated headlines description of reality in relation to Acela corridor expectations rather than on its face.
Although the NRA has gotten in line behind the Trump administration, the president is exceptionally eager to entertain extreme forms of gun control for a Republican. Even given his willingness to sign off on bump stock bans and flex the power of the executive in the name of gun violence more than any other GOP president in a generation, no one with a brain is expecting an assault weapons ban or anything of the sort. So what's the point of a headline that acts as though that had been likely or even possible? It simply confirms the prior expectations of a tiny class of elite Americans who have come to expect that they're entitled to the news media sharing information through the prism of their imagination.
CNN reporters woke up this morning to a smaller version of the same sophomoric backlash. Unlike the obviously white supremacist El Paso shooting, the motive behind the Dayton shooting remains unclear, so responsible reporters have been sharing relevant details while the authorities ascertain a definitive motive. CNN did a deep dive into the Dayton shooter's social media and independently confirmed that he espoused, among apolitical hints at violence, extreme left-wing views. Somehow, to report this is problematic because ... reasons.
Tweet
I hate to break it to the Beltway elite, but telling the truth to the public in an objective vacuum isn't carrying water for your political adversaries; that's just the actual job of journalists.

Video games link to shootings is an old claim not backed by research

Texto completo: Hours after a mass shooting in Dayton, Ohio, brought the weekend death total to 29, following a Saturday massacre in El Paso, Texas, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., offered his take on what helped fuel the latest round of unspeakable violence: video games that "dehumanize individuals.
Echoing similar sentiments from Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, R, McCarthy suggested that games have led to increased violence by young Americans.
"I've always felt that it's a problem for future generations and others, McCarthy said on Fox's "Sunday Morning Futures. "We've watched from studies, shown before, what it does to individuals, and you look at these photos of how it took place, you can see the actions within video games and others.
From Jeff Sessions in 1999 after the Columbine shooting to President Donald Trump last year following the Parkland attack, lawmakers have long blamed video games for sparking some of the country's deadliest violence.
The problem, however, is that researchers have repeatedly debunked the claim. The notion was even dismissed by the Supreme Court in 2011, when Justice Antonin Scalia wrote that violent video games had a similarly minimal effect on children as cartoons starring Bugs Bunny or the Road Runner.
"It's become a script, James Densley, a criminal justice professor at Metropolitan State University, said in an interview with The Washington Post. "People have said it so many times that because we have so many of these tragedies, it's become routine by now. The same old tropes keep getting revisited.
This time, Patrick was among the first prominent politicians to point a finger at video games. Appearing Sunday morning on "Fox & Friends Weekend, the Texas lieutenant governor noted that "Call of Duty, the popular first-person shooter, was briefly referenced in a manifesto authorities believe was posted by Patrick Crusius, the 21-year-old charged in the attack.
"We've always had guns. We've always had evil. But what's changed where we see this rash of shooting? Patrick said. "I see a video game industry that teaches young people to kill.
Asked about Patrick's comments later that morning, McCarthy agreed that video games, in general, play a role in mass shootings. "The idea of these video games, they dehumanize individuals to have a game of shooting individuals and others, he said.
That message has been repeated for so long because it's easier than addressing politically charged issues like gun control, said James Alan Fox, a criminologist who has been writing about the topic for almost four decades.
"Video games are an easy scapegoat, said Fox, a professor of criminology at Northeastern University. "They don't lose votes by blaming the video-game industry. You can lose votes blaming the gun industry, which is why some people choose not to do that.
Experts say there is little evidence linking video games to violence, and ample evidence to the contrary. Researchers at Oxford University earlier this year found that there was no correlation between the time spent playing video games and aggressive behavior in young people.
"When we talk about games in this way and take them this seriously, it really risks trivializing what we know leads to other violent behavior, said Andrew Przybylski, a psychologist at Oxford and lead author of the January study, which was published in the peer-reviewed, open-access journal Royal Society Open Science.
The trend of connecting mass shootings to video games gained steam in April 1999, after two high school gunmen killed 12 students and a teacher at Columbine High School. The gunmen had made casual comparisons between "Doom, one of the most popular games of the '90s, and the mass shooting they would eventually carry out. A Gallup poll conducted shortly afterward found that 62 percent of adults nationwide believed entertainment was the major catalyst for the tragedy, and that 83 percent supported restrictions on the sale of violent media to children. President Bill Clinton even called for an investigation on how the advertising industry sold violent entertainment.
In a Senate hearing after the attack, Sessions, then an Alabama senator, called playing video games "a very intense experience that causes "people to be killed. But the criticism extended across the aisle, Przybylski said, with Democrats just as likely to draw a straight line from virtual violence to real-world bloodshed.
"If you were Mario and you jumped on turtles, you were more likely to kill turtles in real life, he said of the approach to mass shootings and video games at the time.
Even after a 2004 report conducted by the Secret Service and the Education Department found that only 12 percent of perpetrators in more than three dozen school shootings showed an interest in violent video games, lawmakers and public figures continued to blame the industry. In his 2008 presidential campaign, Mitt Romney cited "pornography and violence in media, such as video games, as an inspiration for the 2007 shooting at Virginia Tech that killed 32 people.
In 2011, the Supreme Court weighed in after Democrats in California passed a law restricting the sale of violent video games to minors. The court's 7-2 decision found the law to be unconstitutional, with Scalia offering a majority opinion.
"Psychological studies purporting to show a connection between exposure to violent video games and harmful effects on children do not prove that such exposure causes minors to act aggressively, Scalia wrote. "Any demonstrated effects are both small and indistinguishable from effects produced by other media.
That ruling did not lead to an end of calling out video games after massacres. After the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School that killed 26 children and teachers in 2012, Wayne LaPierre, the chief executive of the National Rifle Association, said the video game industry was a "corrupting shadow industry that sells, and sows, violence against its own people, the New York Times reported.
Fox, the criminologist, refutes this idea, pointing out that sales of video games have gone up as the rate of youth homicides have dropped since the '90s. In the case of Adam Lanza, the Sandy Hook shooter, Fox said that while he did enjoy video games, "they didn't make him into a killer, noting Lanza's particular affinity for "Dance Dance Revolution.
"If video games are driving people to kill, then we'd be in a lot more trouble than we already are since it's a big industry, he said. "If it's as dangerous as people say, we'd have far more mass killings than we already do.
Trump also blamed video games for real-world violence during a roundtable meeting last year with lawmakers after the Parkland shooting, saying, "I'm hearing more and more people say the level of violence on video games is really shaping young people's thoughts.
Such claims muddy the discussion, said Densley, who has been studying the life histories of mass shooters in the U.S. since 1966 in a project funded by an arm of the Justice Department.
"The easy thing is to point at violent video games . . . and that's a distraction from the reality of the gun culture in United States, he said. "We have many young people who are in crisis for various reasons and are struggling with their well-being, and we have to be more attuned to with those struggles to do something about them.
Sentiments like McCarthy's and Patrick's might eventually go by the wayside, Przybylski said. Recent research from Pew found that more than half of Americans ages 18 to 49 play video games with some regularity. When the activity becomes the norm, unlike in an older generation that did not grow up with video games, leaders may be less likely to blame them for society's ills.
"As the average age of gamers rises, using video games in this way is going to be like blaming socks, he said of the mass-shooting excuse. "It's going to become a silly thing to discriminate against.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Trump and the Republican National Committee filed a pair of lawsuits Tuesday against officials in California, challenging a new law requiring presidential candidates to release five years of tax returns in order to be placed on the state primary ballot in 2020.
The RNC suit, which was filed in the Eastern District of California and included the California Republican Party and several California Republican voters as plaintiffs, called the law a “naked political attack against the sitting president of the United States." It was filed against Governor Gavin Newsom and the California secretary of state.
Trump and his campaign filed a second suit challenging the constitutionality of the new law, and it named the California secretary of state and the state attorney general. In that suit, they argue that states do not have the power to “supplement" the qualifications for the president, set forth by the Constitution.
The California law, known as the Presidential Tax Transparency and Accountability Act, was signed by Newsom last week and was the latest flashpoint between the White House and the state of California, which is involved in more than 40 lawsuits against the Trump administration, on issues including environmental regulation and immigration.
The California state Legislature approved a similar measure in 2017, but the governor at the time, Jerry Brown, vetoed it, raising questions about whether it was constitutional.

McConnell campaign criticizes protesters
WASHINGTON — The reelection campaign of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, on Tuesday decried the actions of protesters outside his Louisville, Ky., home over the weekend as "serious calls to violence" and said it had notified law enforcement.
A group of 20 to 30 people gathered outside McConnell's home on Sunday night, with some voicing threats and shouting profanities during a protest that was broadcast on Facebook Live, according to an account in the New York Post.
The protesters reportedly were responding to McConnell's refusal thus far to allow the Republican-led Senate to consider bills passed by the Democratic-led House that seek to strengthen background checks for gun sales. The protest followed the mass shootings over the weekend in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, that left 31 people dead.
The senator was reportedly home recovering from a fractured shoulder at the time of the protest. Facebook video captured a moment where one of the protesters urged another to stab a voodoo doll representing McConnell in the heart.
In tweets Tuesday, McConnell's campaign characterized the protesters as "an angry left-wing mob of Amy McGrath supporters," referencing a Democrat who is seeking to topple McConnell in next year's election in Kentucky.
"These threats go far beyond a political cartoon or a broken shoulder, they are serious calls to physical violence and we've alerted law enforcement," the campaign said in one of its tweets.
In another tweet, the campaign referenced another episode over the weekend in which several McConnell supporters wearing "Team Mitch" T-shirts were photographed around a cardboard cutout of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, with some groping it and kissing it.
In a tweet Monday night directed at McConnell, Ocasio-Cortez asked whether the Senate leader was "paying for young men to practice groping & choking members of Congress w/ your payroll, or is this just the standard culture of #TeamMitch?"
The McConnell campaign's tweets on Tuesday suggested that McConnell faced a far greater danger.
"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and liberal Twitter personalities are trying to dox some underage kids for taking a photo with a cutout at the Fancy Farm political picnic and are cheering on thousands of accounts calling for Senator McConnell to 'break his neck,' " a campaign tweet said.

Trump accuses Google of bias against him
President Trump once again accused Alphabet Inc.'s Google of amplifying negative news stories about him, this time citing an ex-employee who claims he was fired for conservative bias.
“All very illegal. We are watching Google very closely!" Trump said in a series of tweets Tuesday, adding he'd met with Google CEO Sundar Pichai, though didn't say when. Trump tweeted a pair of clips from the segments late Monday, and continued to tweet about the subject Tuesday morning.
The Twitter storm is an indication that the president continues to try to rev up his base with charges of tech company bias as the 2020 election approaches.
Trump said he'd watched comments by Kevin Cernekee in a Fox News interview, where the former Google employee alleged that conservatives were harassed at the company. Cernekee said Google wants Trump to lose the 2020 election, and that Google executives wept after Trump's victory and “vowed that it would never happen again." Cernekee told Fox he's in a legal fight with the search engine giant after he was fired.
Google spokeswoman Jennifer Kaiser said Cernekee's comments “are absolutely false."
“We go to great lengths to build our products and enforce our policies in ways that don't take political leanings into account," Kaiser said.
Trump also cited comments to Fox Business by author Peter Schweizer, who alleged Google suppressed negative stories about Hillary Clinton.
Pichai “was in the Oval Office working very hard to explain how much he liked me, what a great job the Administration is doing, that Google was not involved with China's military, that they didn't help Crooked Hillary over me in the 2016 Election and that they are NOT planning to illegally subvert the 2020 Election despite all that has been said to the contrary," Trump said in a pair of Tuesday tweets.

Some sports stories just don't make any sense

Texto completo: Couch Slouch
When I take a column vacation each summer - which often coincides with a reality vacation in Las Vegas - I am soothed by the extended break from the noxious nuttiness that usually provides my wakeup call every weekday afternoon the rest of the year.
(Yes, I said "my wakeup call every weekday afternoon." That's right - I sleep in. Why wouldn't I? They can't do as much damage to you when you're not awake, and if there's a lot of bad swirling around out there, well, ignorance is bliss; I'll take my nightmares over their nastiness.)
Alas, when I wandered back into Sports Nation the other day, I immediately got a cold splash of verisimilitude.
Let's go to the videotape to review three of these transgressions:
* Maryland will cancel afternoon classes on Sept. 27 because the football team is playing Penn State that evening. My beleaguered, misguided alma mater continues to make decisions that compel sober-minded people to scratch their heads and go, "Really?"
Maryland Provost Mary Ann Rankin said that canceling classes in advance of the 8 p.m. game was to "ensure that visitors, students, faculty and staff are not inordinately inconvenienced by the inevitable traffic issues."
Really?
For starters, "inevitable traffic issues" are such a constant in the Washington, D.C., area that the federal government should shut down daily at 10:30 a.m. Plus if I were the university, I might consider nixing all classes during football season because nothing athletic should ever be "inordinately inconvenienced" by anything academic.
Then again, I remain an outlier proponent of folding the school's athletic department; to replace the revenue loss, simply ticket every seventh car on campus on a daily basis.
Heck, when I matriculated at College Park, I was not allowed to graduate until I settled all my parking-violation fees, which, in those simpler days, exceeded my annual tuition costs.
* Carnegie Mellon and Facebook A.I. have developed a poker bot called Pluribus that solves six-player no limit Texas hold 'em. Big deal. Show me some type of A.I. device that can beat keno and sidestep casino resort fees, and then I'll be impressed.
I am tired of these computer science research mavens spending untold hours sipping Coke Zeroes while devising useless algorithms to topple games of skill that mean little in our complex, ever-darkening cosmos.
And I'll still take Doyle Brunson over a Dell desktop anytime, particularly in a Laredo roadhouse.
Besides, if computers solve EVERYTHING, the only thing left for humankind will be Rubik's cubes, the Sunday New York Times crossword puzzle and figuring out how to open a jar of kosher pickles in under 45 seconds.
* A Louisiana judge ruled that a state lawsuit can continue against the NFL over the Rams-Saints non-call in January. Nicole Sheppard also ruled that attorney Antonio LeMon can request documents and ask questions of three NFL game officials in depositions over the lack of a pass-interference penalty against Rams cornerback Nickell Roby-Coleman when he hit the Saints' Tommylee Lewis near the end of the NFC championship.
The suit alleges fraud by NFL officials.
I don't know if we have lost our minds, but something tells me they won't be found anytime soon.
"The purpose of the lawsuit is not to get some miniscule amount of money," LeMon said. "It's to get at the truth."
Uh, you want the truth?
The officials made a bad call. End of story.
Yes, it likely changed the winner of the game. But there was no corruption or conspiracy to uncover, no toxins were discovered on the premises and no animals were harmed in the making of this result.
Hey, I didn't like the call either. What did I do? I waved my hand dismissively at the TV screen, then took Daisy out for a walk. We both took a nap when we got back and slept in the following morning.
Sometimes, there's nothing better than a dog's life.
Ask The Slouch
Q. Your summer hiatus keeps getting lengthier. Frankly, it's more of a leave of absence, no? (Alex Talbot; Spokane)
A. The plan is to increase vacation by one week annually so that, by age 95, I will be down to four columns per year.
Q. Your vacations come earlier every year, and last longer. Are you sneaking into retirement? (Don Pollins; Hyattsville, Md.)
A. Johnny Carson - one of my heroes - was working a three-day week on "The Tonight Show" over his last decade hosting it.
Q. Who waters your Chia Pet when you vacate the premises for several fortnights? (Bill Hayes; Carmel, Ind.)
A. Why is everyone obsessed with the amount of time I take off? Just follow the lead of my wife Toni - when I leave the house, she never asks when I am coming back.
Q. What exactly are you taking vacation from? (Chris McCormick; Houston)
A. Pay the man, Shirley.

Statesman’s owner to acquire Gannett in $1.4 billion deal

Texto completo: GateHouse Media, the company that owns the American-Statesman, on Monday said it is acquiring Gannett Co., a $1.4 billion deal that will create the nation’s largest newspaper chain.
GateHouse — the operating subsidiary of New Media Investment Group — will combine with Gannett, the larger of the two companies, in a cash-and-stock deal that will be financed in part with new private-equity debt.
The combined new company would take the Gannett name and keep its headquarters in Gannett’s current home of McLean, Virginia.
New Media Investment Group CEO Michael Reed will remain CEO, and Paul Bascobert was appointed CEO of Gannett and a member of the Gannett board.
The deal is worth $12.06 a share in cash and stock, or about $1.4 billion. Several industry experts said they do not expect the Justice Department to have an issue with the deal, as the two companies have papers in different markets. The companies expect it to close this year.
The combined company would operate more than 260 daily newspapers in the United States, along with more than 300 weeklies. It would be the largest U.S. newspaper company by far, with a print circulation of 8.7 million, or about 7 million more than the new No. 2, McClatchy, according to media expert Ken Doctor.
The companies estimated they can save $275 million to $300 million in annual costs within 24 months. New Media shareholders will own 50.5% of the combined company, while Gannett shareholders will own 49.5%.
“We believe this transaction will create value for our shareholders, greater opportunities for our employees, and a stronger future for journalism,” Reed said in a written statement.
GateHouse bought the American-Statesman from Cox Enterprises in April 2018 for $47.5 million. Other GateHouse newspapers include the Columbus Dispatch, Palm Beach Post, Sarasota Herald-Tribune and Providence Journal, while Gannett’s flagship properties include USA Today, Arizona Republic, Cincinnati Enquirer, Louisville Courier-Journal,
Nashville Tennessean and Detroit Free Press.
In Texas, the combined company will double its reach, adding Gannett-owned papers such as the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, El Paso Times and San Angelo Standard-Times to GateHouse’s stable that includes the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal, Amarillo Globe News and Sherman Herald Democrat.
Newspaper consolidation has picked up as local papers find it hard to grow digital businesses and replace declines in print ads and circulation. Although newspapers with national readerships like the New York Times and the Washington Post have had success adding digital subscribers, local papers with local readerships are having a difficult time. Hundreds of such papers have closed, and newsrooms have slashed jobs.
According to a study by the University of North Carolina, the United States has lost almost 1,800 local newspapers since 2004. Newsroom employment fell by a quarter from 2008 to 2018, according to Pew Research, and layoffs have continued this year.
Both GateHouse and Gannett are known as buyers of other papers. Bulking up lets companies cut costs — including layoffs in newsrooms — and centralize operations.
Those cuts could give the owners “a cushion of time” to figure out how to improve their digital businesses, longtime industry analyst Rick Edmonds of the Poynter Institute wrote Sunday.
A bigger, combined newspaper company could sell more national ads and boost ad revenue, Butler University journalism professor Nancy Whitmore said. But it’s no panacea.
“I don’t think, just by these companies merging, they’re going to somehow magically find a new business model, make everything all right and produce robust journalism at a local level,” Whitmore said.
Consolidation is nothing new to either company. Gannett’s last big U.S. print purchase was in 2016, when it bought papers in the Journal Media Group chain for $280 million, including the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and the Commercial Appeal in Memphis. Gannett also owns dailies in major cities such as the Detroit Free Press and Arizona Republic, as well as publishing national newspaper USA Today.
GateHouse, a little-known name to U.S. readers, is owned by the publicly traded New Media Investment Group, itself managed by investment firm Fortress Investment Group, which is in turn owned by Japanese tech giant SoftBank. Gannett and GateHouse said Monday that Fortress will end its management arrangement at the end of 2021.

Biden, like Trump, once targeted violent video games

Texto completo: In citing violent video games as a potential root cause of mass shootings like the ones in Ohio and Texas over the weekend, President Trump may have an unexpected ally — Joe Biden.
“This includes the gruesome and grisly computer games that are now commonplace,” Trump said Monday morning, in remarks after mass shootings in El Paso Texas on Saturday claimed 20 lives, and killed nine people in Dayton, Ohio. “It is too easy today for troubled youth to surround themselves with a culture that celebrates violence.”
Biden raised similar issues as vice president, amid a series of mass shootings during President Barack Obama's administration. In the wake of the 2013 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre that left 20 children and six adults dead, Biden convened a group video game industry representatives to discuss possible preventative measures. The meeting came after reports surfaced that gunman Adam Lanza had grown obsessive over hyper-violent games like Call of Duty.
During that meeting, Biden called for federal research into whether video games can encourage individuals to commit acts of violence. While he acknowledged that there was no consensus on the issue by the medical community, he said "we shouldn't be afraid of the facts," if evidence of "a pathology related to gun violence," is found. Biden also cited a study by the American Academy of Pediatrics that concluded children who spent multiple hours a day playing video games exhibited more aggressive behavior than others.
In a press conference with the gaming executives, Biden insinuated that the proliferation of violent video games was similar to the phenomena of violent imagery in other forms of media as noted by late Sen. Daniel Moynihan of New York, in his 1993 essay "Defining Deviancy Down," which discussed how newspapers like the New York Times would feature gruesome imagery on its front pages.
"There's no measure, that I'm aware of, to determine whether there's a coarsening of our culture that is not healthy, I don't know the answer to the question, but I'm not sure the impact it would or wouldn't have on the impact on what happened [in Newtown]," Biden said.
During a separate closed door meeting with members of the religious community that same year, Biden reportedly "floated the idea that media and entertainment that portray violence should be subject to a special tax, with the proceeds going to help victims and their families," arguing that "there's no legal reason why they couldn't" industries who produce violent entertainment, according to a source in the room.
The Obama administration continuously pushed for Congress to lift a ban by the Center for Disease Control that prohibits the organization from researching the causes of gun violence.

Gunmakers' stock rises following mass shootings

Texto completo: FIREARMS INDUSTRY
Gunmakers' stock rises following mass shootings Shares of US gunmakers rose Monday, bucking huge declines in the broader market, amid renewed calls for gun control measures following mass shootings in Texas and Ohio over the weekend. Gun company stocks have typically traded higher after mass shootings as consumers may step up purchases to get ahead of potential regulatory changes that could make it more difficult to obtain guns. President Trump on Monday morning tweeted about linking “strong background checks" and immigration reforms, although he didn't discuss gun control in later remarks on the shootings. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
BANKING
Fed wants workers to get paid more quickly The Federal Reserve said Monday that it will create a real-time payments system, with the goal of making paychecks and money transfers available for use more immediately. The move is aimed at narrowing the amount of time between when money is deposited or transferred into an account and when it is available for use. That gap can span several hours or several days, putting individuals — particularly low-income Americans — at a disadvantage. Community groups, smaller banks and advocates for low-wage earners have been calling for the Fed to limit the delay and to create a public sector option for real-time payments. But some in the banking industry, particularly large banks, have pushed back against the effort over concerns that the Fed's involvement will compete with their products and potentially crowd out private-sector efforts. The round-the-clock service will be called FedNow and is expected to become available in 2023 or 2024, according to the Fed's news release. — NEW YORK TIMES
BRANDING
Vegas stadium being built for Raiders will bear Allegiant name A $1.9 billion stadium being built for the NFL's Oakland Raiders when the team moves to Las Vegas next year is being named for Allegiant Travel Co., team and company officials said Monday. The announcement came during a ceremony marking installation of the final steel beam for the roof of the 65,000-seat indoor stadium just off the Las Vegas Strip. Las Vegas-based Allegiant Travel is the publicly traded corporate parent of Allegiant Air, a low-fare carrier with 55 nonstop routes in the United States. Company chairman and chief executive Maury Gallagher said in a statement the facility name will "amplify" the airline's focus on leisure and vacation travel and its own resort development in Florida. Terms of the agreement weren't made public, but experts told the Las Vegas Review-Journal the deal might cost up to $25 million annually in cash and in-kind services. The Raiders are moving after the upcoming season. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
AVIATION
Planned strike at Heathrow averted, for now Heathrow management made an 11th-hour offer to a union representing thousands of ground staff, leading to the suspension of a planned strike on Tuesday which would have disrupted flights at Europe's busiest airport. The Unite labor group will take the improved offer to members for a vote and hold off on plans for a walkout, according to a statement Monday from the airport. A planned walkout on Aug. 23 and 24 is still planned. The union said it would not disclose details of the pay offer until after the ballot. The announcement came just hours before the workers were set to walk off the job, although the chances of getting a breakthrough had improved after the two sides in the pay dispute agreed to continue to talk. While the first day of the labor action on Monday was cancelled, 16 of 676 scheduled departures were still scrapped, according to the airport, with five more moved to other London terminals. “We remain hopeful that we can find a resolution and stop this disruptive and unnecessary threat of strike action," Heathrow said in the statement. “We regret that passengers have been inconvenienced by this." The threat of travel upheaval at Heathrow adds to risks at British Airways, where a separate dispute over pay between management and pilots may also lead to strikes. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
SHIPBUILDING
Yard that built Titanic in danger of sinking The Belfast shipyard that built the Titanic has called in administrators after last-ditch efforts failed to rescue a company that had once typified Britain's industrial might. Harland and Wolff appointed BDO as administrators after its Norwegian parent company, Dolphin Drilling, failed to find a buyer, union officials said. An insolvency hearing is set for Tuesday. The shipyard was best known for constructing the doomed White Star liner, Titanic, which sank on its maiden trans-Atlantic voyage in 1912 after striking an iceberg. But the firm was one of the UK's key industrial producers during World War II, building some 150 ships. Its massive yellow cranes, Samson and Goliath, are considered landmarks of Belfast — a point of pride. It once boasted a workforce of 30,000, but now employs only about 125, though it supported hundreds of other jobs in its supply chain. Workers vowed to occupy the shipyard until heavy industry and shipbuilding could be secured, but the government so far has declined to intervene. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
BANKING
HSBC chief executive resigns after just 18 months HSBC's chief executive, John Flint, is stepping down after 18 months in the role, a surprise announcement that the bank said Monday was “by mutual agreement with the board." Noel Quinn, the bank's chief executive for commercial banking, will fill the top job on an interim basis while the bank begins a global job search. Flint resigned on the same day that HSBC, Europe's largest bank by assets, reported what several analysts described as solid results. Profit after tax for the first half of 2019 rose 18.1 percent to $9.9 billion, while revenue was up 7.6 percent to $29.4 billion. But the bank also announced job cuts amounting to nearly 2 percent of its global workforce of close to 238,000. One analyst, Benjamin Toms at RBC Capital Markets, an investment bank, cited “geopolitical uncertainty" as affecting the bank's global business. HSBC, with headquarters in London, appears to be preparing for a more challenging environment as the trade wars between the United States and China cast shadows over its critical Asia businesses, and Brexit remains unresolved. — ASSOCIATED PRESS

Senators want Google to offer temp workers staff jobs A group of Democratic senators has demanded in a letter sent to Google's chief executive, Sundar Pichai, that the Internet giant convert its more than 120,000 temporary and contract workers to full-time employees. The letter, written by Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, also urged Google to stop its “anti-worker practices" and treat everyone at the company equally. Among the 10 senators who signed were three running for president: Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren. As of March, Google had more temporary workers than full-time employees — 121,000 temps and contractors and 102,000 full-timers, according to company data viewed by The New York Times. The senators pushed for a number of changes to how the company treats temps and contractors, including moving them to full-time status after six months as well as equalizing their wages and benefits with permanent staff. While many of the temps and contractors sit in the same offices as Google employees and often do similar work, they usually make less money, have worse benefit plans, and do not enjoy the same rights. — NEW YORK TIMES

Requiem for White Men

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Once upon a time ... in America, it looked as if white men were at long last losing their tenacious grip on power.
A black man had made it into the White House. A woman in hot pink claimed the gavel in the House. A Latina congresswoman with a Bronx swagger emerged as the biggest media star in the capital. Six Democratic women -- five pols and one mystic -- earned their spots on the stage in the first presidential debates.
Male candidates who might have jumped to the head of the presidential pack in earlier eras are finding it impossible to rise anywhere near double digits in polls.
When I asked a friend who once worked for Barack Obama why a smart and appealing Obama protégé, Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, was having a hard time breaking through, she replied: "The bar is much, much higher for white guys these days. You just have to be especially special."
In New York magazine, Madeleine Aggeler wrote "A Guide to All the Indistinguishable Men Running for President." Under a picture of Steve Bullock, the governor of Montana, she wondered, "O.K., this is clearly just Michael Bennet with a wig and a different name?" Under a picture of John Delaney, Aggeler offered a tip to remember which unmemorable white guy he is: "He looks like if a thumb split from the other fingers and went to dine at Hooters alone."
White male privilege is out of fashion these days. Yet we are awash in nostalgia for it.
Donald Trump has built a political ideology on nostalgia. And Quentin Tarantino has built a movie ideology on nostalgia.
In The Los Angeles Times, Mary McNamara observed that the moral of Tarantino's new fairy tale, "Once Upon A Time In ... Hollywood," is, "Who doesn't miss the good old days when cars had fins and white men were the heroes of everything?"
Dubbing the cowboys-versus-hippies movie starring Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio "nostalgia porn," McNamara notes: "Watching two middle-aged white guys grapple with a world that does not value them as much as they believe it should, it was tough not to wonder if that something was the same narrow, reductive and mythologized view of history that has made red MAGA hats the couture of conservative fashion."
In The New Yorker, Richard Brody called the movie, Tarantino's biggest opening ever, "obscenely regressive," a phrase that could easily be applied to the man in the Oval.
Tarantino's movie is about illusion, two TV entertainers clinging to a vanishing macho myth. Trump's White House is about illusion, one TV entertainer clinging to a vanishing macho myth.
Both the Tarantino creation and the Trump creation feature scripted tough-guy dialogue, rough treatment of women and slurs against Mexicans. ("Don't cry in front of the Mexicans," Pitt warns an emotional DiCaprio in a tinsel town parking lot.)
But -- except for the usual burst of violence that the director justifies the usual way, by leveling it at the most evil people ever, in this case the Manson Family -- Tarantino's time machine is a gentler ride. (This may mark the first time "Tarantino" and "gentler" have appeared in the same sentence.)
Bathed in a golden glow, Brad Pitt plays a world-weary stunt man and handyman to Leo's Western star, Rick Dalton. Pitt's character is a former war hero in the great midcentury tradition of American cinema. He reflects many of the values that America once proudly stood for: toughness without belligerence, charm without smarminess, loyalty without question. He is masculine yet chivalrous.The iconic performance evokes other movie exemplars of the American male: Humphrey Bogart in "Casablanca," Paul Newman in "Cool Hand Luke," Steve McQueen in "Bullitt," Clint Eastwood in "Dirty Harry." (Pitt's significant other is a pit bull named Brandy -- another contrast with Trump, who avoids dogs.)
Trump's time machine is a vicious and vertiginous journey, all about punching down, pulpy fictions, making brown and black people scapegoats and casting women back into a crimped era of fewer reproductive rights.
Trump has inverted all the old American ideals, soiling the image of our country in the world and reshaping it around his grievances and inadequacies.
He is a faux tough guy who lets other people do the fighting for him, a needy brat who never accepts responsibility for his actions, an oaf with no trace of courage, class or chivalry.
While Pitt's Cliff Booth is a study in stoicism and style, President Trump is a master class in whining and looking cheesy. One man lives by his word; the other never bothers to keep it.
Tarantino fashioned his nostalgic world out of love, while Trump fashions his out of hate.
His entitled and grabby ways illustrate why we need to leave that world behind. America is struggling to find a new identity with a more colorful mosaic, moving beyond our monochromatic past. More new heroines and heroes need to emerge, both onscreen and in life.
But first we need the credits to roll on Trump.

How Trump’s Political Appointees Overruled Tougher Settlements With Big Banks

Since Donald Trump’s election, federal white-collar enforcement has taken a big hit. Fines and settlements against corporations have plummeted. Prosecutions of individuals are falling to record lows.
But just how these fines and settlements came to be slashed is less well understood. Two settlements with giant banks over financial crisis-era misdeeds provide a window into how the Trump administration has eased up on corporate wrongdoers.
In settlements last year with the two big U.K.-based banks, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland, political appointees at the Trump administration Justice Department took the unusual step of overruling staff prosecutors to reduce the settlements sought, leaving billions of dollars in potential recoveries on the table, according to four people familiar with the settlements.
In the case of RBS, then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein decided that the charges should not be pursued as a criminal case, as the prosecutorial team advocated, but rather as a less serious civil one.
Both cases were developed by the Obama administration DOJ and involved accusations that the banks misled buyers of residential mortgage-backed securities before the 2008 financial crisis. Prosecutors seemingly found numerous examples of bankers knowingly selling lemons to their customers. The mortgages they were putting into securities were “total fucking garbage,” one RBS executive said in a phone call that was recorded and cited in a DOJ filing. A Barclays banker said a group of loans “scares the shit out of me.” Mortgages that went into the two banks’ securities lost a total of $73 billion, according to calculations used by the government.
In March 2018, the DOJ settled with Barclays for $2 billion, a sum dictated by Trump appointees that was far below what the staff prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn had sought. The settlement with RBS occurred in August 2018, for $4.9 billion. After Rosenstein downgraded the case from criminal to civil, other Trump appointees concluded that the settlement amount should be about half of what staff prosecutors in the District of Massachusetts had sought.
DOJ spokeswoman Sarah Sutton said that the Barclays and RBS settlements held the banks accountable for serious misconduct, and that the penalties recovered from the banks were fair and proportionate compared with those previously obtained from other banks. She did not respond to detailed questions about how the two settlements were reached and why key decisions were dictated from Washington. “They were largely negotiated by career attorneys in the Department and U.S. Attorneys’ offices with the support and collaboration of Department leadership,” Sutton wrote in an email.
The Average Size of DOJ Mortgage-Related Settlements With Banks Has Shrunk Under the Trump Administration

Source: Public Citizen, staff research (Lucas Waldron/ProPublica and Kevin Wack/American Banker)
Aspects of how the DOJ came to settle the cases have been recounted. The New York Times reported on Rosenstein’s decision in the RBS case. But this is the first extensive account of how the banks secured the favorable outcomes.
The British banks employed an old playbook, one that proved effective with the Trump administration: Hire prominent former high-level DOJ officials who were now at major law firms. These attorneys won access to the top echelons of the Trump DOJ, where they found an audience receptive to their arguments that the staff prosecutors were unfairly singling out their clients for excess punishment.
The two cases stemmed from the Obama administration’s efforts to bring charges against banks for misdeeds that contributed to the financial crisis. Critics assailed the Obama DOJ for what they perceived as tardy and inadequate policing of financial crisis malfeasance. For example, the Obama DOJ did not prosecute any top bankers for actions related to the crisis. But it did belatedly bring civil charges, and it reached large settlements with numerous banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America. Moreover, the Obama-era DOJ consistently required the banks to acknowledge their bad acts, a practice that has ceased during the Trump administration.
As the Obama administration was winding up in the fall of 2016, the DOJ had not completed all that it aspired to. It rushed to reach settlements with foreign banks that had shown less urgency to resolve the allegations than some of their U.S. counterparts.
Less than a week before Trump’s inauguration, the DOJ announced that Deutsche Bank had agreed to pay a $3.1 billion civil penalty, and that Credit Suisse would pay $2.48 billion. But there were holdouts, including Barclays and RBS.
Prosecutors in Brooklyn wanted Barclays to pay somewhere within a range in the high single digits of billions of dollars, according to two people familiar with the negotiations. Barclays balked, drawing a line at $2 billion, according to a Bloomberg News account.
Barclays hired an all-star team of defense lawyers. The roster included Karen Seymour, a partner at Sullivan & Cromwell who had previously served as chief of the criminal division in the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan and has since become general counsel at Goldman Sachs.
Also on Barclays’ legal team was Kannon Shanmugam, a former high-ranking official in the George W. Bush DOJ who was then a partner at Williams & Connolly.
With the two sides far apart in December 2016, the DOJ sued Barclays. Prosecutors also brought civil charges against two former executives at the bank who played key roles in its pre-crisis subprime mortgage operations.
Suing was an unusual step — cases against large corporations normally settle before a complaint is filed — and it was meant to send an implicit message to Barclays. Because the DOJ had been forced to go to court, the British bank could expect the price tag of an eventual settlement to be higher.
Barclays was making the opposite bet: that it would be able to negotiate a more favorable settlement once Trump appointees were in place at DOJ.
In a 192-page complaint, the DOJ alleged that Barclays engaged in fraud on a massive scale, deceiving investors about the characteristics of mortgages used to create securities that sold for tens of billions of dollars.
A Barclays employee commented during a 2006 phone call that one particular pool of mortgages was “about as bad as it can be,” but he did not abandon the loans or modify the bank’s standard disclosures to investors, according to the government’s complaint. In another example, when that same banker said that a particular pool of loans “scares the shit out of me,” because he believed the company that originated the mortgages was likely to go bankrupt soon, Barclays bought the loans anyway. The bank deliberately did not conduct due diligence on the mortgages and then packaged them into bonds, the complaint asserted, all the while falsely telling a rating agency that due diligence had been done on 100% of the loans.
“More than half of the underlying loans defaulted,” the complaint stated, causing huge losses for investors.
Barclays’ legal team argued that the bank should not pay higher penalties in a settlement than other banks had paid relative to their market share. Barclays had been a relatively small player in the residential mortgage-backed securities, or RMBS, market, and its settlement should be sized accordingly, they reasoned.
This was an argument that the DOJ had long rejected. In a 2014 speech, then-Associate Attorney General Tony West argued that a firm’s market share should not outweigh evidence of the extent of its wrongdoing. “The facts and evidence of a particular case — they are what will ultimately matter the most,” he said.

Texto completo: Una serie de incidentes concluyó ayer con Nathaniel Brown, un hombre sin hogar, dominado por varios pasajeros en el suelo de la estación Broadway-Lafayette de la línea F, en el Bajo Manhattan.
Brown (41) supuestamente robó un teléfono celular y luego empujó a un ilustrador del diario New York Times a las vías del Metro cerca de las 10 a.m. La víctima de 30 años, que no quiso ser identificada, fue hospitalizada con fractura en la cadera y cortes.
Cuando Brown intentó huir, un grupo de pasajeros lo detuvo hasta que llegó la policía. El confuso incidente fue captado por un pasajero en un video divulgado por New York Post.
En un momento, Brown se quita la camisa para limpiarse el sudor de la frente antes de intercambiar golpes con un transeúnte que intenta bloquear su escape, según muestran las imágenes.
También se le puede ver corriendo a través de una falange de samaritanos, pero mientras sube las escaleras, otro viajero baja y lo derriba. Sin inmutarse, Brown intentó volver a levantarse, pero otro pasajero le engancha el tobillo y lo envía de vuelta al suelo.
Fuentes policiales dijeron que minutos antes Brown le había robado a alguien un teléfono celular en un tren de la línea 6 entre las estaciones Spring y Canal.
La policía usó el propio dispositivo para localizar a su propietario legítimo, dijeron las fuentes.
También Brown escupió a un joven de 25 años que intentó ayudar a la primera víctima que lanzó a las vías, según la policía.
Brown fue arrestado por cargos de asalto y resistencia. Estaba gritando “Allahu akbar”, una oración musulmana común, cuando fue arrestado.

Texto completo: United States One of the world’s most threatened species of fish is rebounding. Sturgeon populations were in decline from more than a century of water pollution and dam construction. Efforts to limit fishing and install fish elevators around dams are showing promise, and cleaner water and dam removals are also helping. Maine’s sturgeon population has doubled to 10,000 since the 1990s. Researchers had thought sturgeon were gone from the Chesapeake Bay, but their numbers are now back in the thousands. Conservationists say that protections are still necessary as sturgeon populations are a fraction of what they once were. (The Associated Press)
Canada The Kwanlin Dün First Nation is piloting a public safety task force and seeing improvements. Launched in 2016, the four-
person team in Whitehorse, the capital of Yukon, serves as a middle step of enforcement between the indigenous community and the police. Patrolling the city without weapons, the team aims to build trust and deter crime by maintaining a presence. And their work is being noticed: Indigenous groups within Canada and from New Zealand have traveled to see the task force in action. Statistics aren’t available yet, but drug trafficking, breaking and entering, and public intoxication have noticeably decreased. Locals told a reporter that children are playing outside again. (The Globe and Mail)
Zimbabwe A program is helping small-scale farmers boost yields and income through drought-resistant practices. Drip-irrigation systems are improving water efficiency. One farmer told a reporter he uses 90% less water than traditional flood irrigation and it’s less labor-intensive. By introducing crop diversity, farmers are increasing food production; they now have multiple yields and are less reliant on one crop. But many farmers are not able to secure enough money for startup costs from the program. (Reuters)
Europe For the first time, the European Commission has chosen a woman as president. Ursula von der Leyen will lead 32,000 staff members and will be in charge of billions of euros. She will represent the European Union at international summits, negotiate trade deals, and also oversee Brexit on behalf of the commission. Ms. von der Leyen, Germany’s outgoing defense minister and a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union party, promises a minimum wage and a plan for a carbon-neutral Europe. (The New York Times)
Thailand As concern grows around the world about the treatment of elephants, a new tourist attraction has opened in Chiang Mai called ChangChill or “relaxed elephants.” It’s billed as the world’s first humane elephant camp. The ChangChill model shifts from activities in which humans have direct contact with elephants and cause stress for the animals. Visitors observe the elephants grazing and socializing, and they can still bathe elephants from observation decks and feed them indirectly. The change was inspired by a growing public demand for humane animal attractions; 226 travel companies vowed to no longer sell or promote cruel elephant entertainment. (Travel Pulse)

Gillibrand's Clorox line was a big hit; she honed it on campaign trail

Texto completo: Kirsten Gillibrand, the New York senator struggling to gain footing in the 24-person Democratic presidential field, scored what most candidates dream of in a crowded, nationally televised debate: a viral soundbite.
During Wednesday night's Democratic primary debate, CNN's Dana Bash asked Gillibrand about her support for Green New Deal legislation and whether its job-security promises are realistic.
But first, Gillibrand shoehorned in a laugh line that served as a dig at President Donald Trump.
"So the first thing that I'm going to do when I'm president is I'm going to Clorox the Oval Office," Gillibrand said.
The partisan crowd at Detroit's Fox Theatre erupted in laughter and applause. Gillibrand began trending on Twitter, where thousands of people tweeted the line. Outlets like The New York Times and Marie Claire suggested it was the quote of the night.
Gillibrand had been using the line for weeks For those closely following Gillibrand's campaign, the line wasn't a surprise.
Gillibrand had been using the Clorox quote on the campaign trail for weeks. And it's easy to understand why: It's been a reliable hit among her supporters and those who come out to hear her speak.
Take her talk at the National Urban League Conference in Indianapolis last Friday, when a moderator asked how she would stop the "antics" of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
"On the first day that I become president, after I Clorox the Oval Office" —the crowd guffawed and the moderator chuckled — "which as a mother, I would do," Gillibrand said, "the second thing I will do is restore our moral leadership on the world stage."
In a small gathering in New Hampshire early last month, a voter asked Gillibrand how she would repair the United States' reputation in the eyes of world leaders.
"So, after I Clorox the Oval Office," Gillibrand started in response, according to a video from New York Now, a weekly television show.
Again, it got big laughs.
At a Mic town hall in Manhattan on July 22, Gillibrand worked in her reliable line after a question on the Green New Deal, much like she did during the debate.
That time, it only got a few chuckles.
Roots of Clorox line date back months Gillibrand's Clorox line has roots going back at least to February, about a month after she launched an exploratory committee for a presidential run.
At a small gathering Feb. 17 in Keene, New Hampshire, an attendee asked Gillibrand what her first act in the Oval Office would be "after fumigating the White House, of course."
The crowd laughed at the woman's joke before Gillibrand responded, according to a video posted by The Hill.

Hitting an operatic high Baritone Green returns home to rehearse, give back

Texto completo: Ryan Speedo Green has had a busy week.
The world-traveling opera singer returned home to Hampton Roads to spend a few days pulling together a new, highly personal show that he will premiere in Newport News on Saturday.
He and his collaborator, Daniel Bergner, have spent much of the week holed up in the Peebles Theatre inside the Ferguson Center working on "Sing for Your Life," a show that takes its title from the 2014 biography Bergner wrote about Green's unlikely journey from juvenile detention centers to international opera stages.
But true to form, Green found time to get out and pay visits to the Boys and Girls Club in Newport News, the Foodbank of the Virginia Peninsula, and the Newport News Public Schools' summer arts program.
On previous trips home, he has returned to the youth facility where he spent time as an angry, insecure kid growing up in Suffolk and Isle of Wight County.
"I can't take credit for the idea of giving back, but it's something I always try to do," Green said in his warm bass-baritone voice. "Growing up, I had a lot of people, a lot of educators, who weren't supposedto love me, but who chose to go the extra mile for me. I will never forget that.
"When I go to these places, I'm not just there speaking to the child. I'm speaking to educators and donors and people who give hard-earned time and emotional investment to these causes. Even though they might not see it now, I want them to know, 'What you're doing is changing people's lives. What you're doing is worth it.' When you give love and encouragement to a child who might not be getting that at home."
Green and Bergner want "Sing for Your Life" to reflect that. It will feature plenty of musical selections, including opera, spirituals and classical tunes. The two men will explain to the audience what specific resonance or connection each song has to Green's life.
"I suppose what will happen Saturday night is a grand experiment - and let's underline experiment," Bergner said with a laugh. "The only things I can guarantee are: one, we'll tell an amazing story; two, there will be some just great music; and three, we'll have a real cross-racial conversation of the type that happens all too rarely in our society."
The two men met eight years ago. Bergner, who contributes stories to the New York Times Magazine, was writing about the Metropolitan Opera National Council auditions, and of the 22 candidates, Green was the only one who declined the interview request. He simply didn't think he had anything interesting to share.
When Green was one of the five winners, Bergner approached him again and this time offered to buy him lunch. This time Green accepted, and over the course of three hours talked about growing up in a trailer home, spending time in juvenile detention, and how his life was turned around by Bette Hughes, a York County school teacher who took on students who were too unruly for mainstream classroom, and her husband, Leon.
"It's an amazing story of transformation," Bergner said. "An extremely difficult home life, and then locked up as a kid in an institution of last resort, and in solitary in that institution. And then, some years later, singing on stage at the Met Opera in New York. I had to tell that story: How did he get from there to here?"
Today Green, 33, lives in Austria and performers with Vienna State Opera. He and his wife have a 22-month-old son, Alexander Leon Robert Green, who takes his two middle names from Leon Hughes and from the late Robert Brown, the voice teacher at the Governor's School for the Arts who instilled the dreams and ambitions of opera stardom.
Saturday night at the Peebles Theatre on Christopher Newport University's campus will make the debut of the interactive recital they have spent this week crafting and rehearsing. (The show is open to all ages but may contain language that is inappropriate for kids.)
Always careful to thank those who have supported him, Green said he is grateful to CNU and to Ferguson Center director Bruce Bronstein for their generosity in providing space and opportunity.
If the performance on Saturday goes well, if Bergner and Green are satisfied with it, they plan to take it to other theaters in other states and other countries, sharing a story of beating the odds.
Wherever they go, Green will continue to share his story both on and off stage in the hopes of inspiring those who listen.
"Time is precious as an artist - you never know when your career will end," Green said. "If you can affect one teacher who teaches one child to have a big dream, that's not bad. That's something that students and adults need to learn."

Texto completo: Los fiscales no han decidido, de momento, su próximo paso en el caso penal contra Juan Rodríguez, padre ex militar que encontró muertos a sus gemelos tras supuestamente dejarlos olvidados por ocho horas en su auto al irse a trabajar en un hospital en El Bronx (NYC), el viernes 26 de julio.
“Estamos hablando con la oficina del fiscal de distrito para transmitirles lo que creo que saben y entienden. Que fue una tragedia horrible y terrible “, dijo el abogado de Rodríguez, Joey Jackson.
Rodríguez compareció hoy en el tribunal penal de El Bronx para una breve audiencia en la que los fiscales le dijeron al juez que “no se ha tomado ninguna acción del gran jurado” en este momento, informó a New York Post la portavoz de la Fiscalía del Distrito, Patrice O’Shaughnessy.
“Todavía estamos investigando”, dijo.
Rodríguez, que está en libertad bajo fianza, sigue acusado de dos cargos de homicidio involuntario y dos cargos de homicidio por negligencia criminal en las muertes del 26 de julio de sus gemelos Luna y Phoenix de un año de edad.
Si se presenta el caso, un gran jurado finalmente podría decidir acusar al veterano de la guerra de Irak.
Su próxima cita en la corte es el 27 de agosto. Su esposa, Marissa A. Rodríguez, ha estado a su lado, afirmando que fue un “accidente” horrible.
“Mi cliente está desconsolado”, dijo Jackson. “Ciertamente comprende la gravedad de lo que ocurrió. Su familia comprende la gravedad de lo que ocurrió. Son fuertes, resistentes y superarán este momento difícil”.
Rodríguez (39) es un Trabajador Social Clínico con licencia y también un veterano del ejército que sirvió en Irak. En el hospital “James J. Peters VA” en Kingsbridge asiste a otros ex combatientes sin hogar y enfermos.
“¡Mis bebés están muertos! ¡Maté a mis bebés!”, gritó al descubrirlos muertos y con espuma en la boca en su automóvil .
Quedó en libertad tras pagar una fianza de $100 mil dólares, en un caso que ha impactado al país, pero que no es una excepción.
Médicos y autoridades han recordado que desde 1998 alrededor de 440 menores en todo el país han muerto de golpes de calor después de ser olvidados en automóviles, generalmente no por falta de amor, sino por cómo funciona la memoria humana, según el doctor David Diamond, profesor de psicología en Florida a quien Rodríguez ha consultado tratando de explicar lo sucedido, según The New York Times.
No criminal case at this time against Juan Rodriguez, the father involved in twins' hot car death in the Bronx. He'll be back in court at the end of the month. https://t.co/YMAXUGIyQA

Texto completo: Hamza Bin Laden, the bloodthirsty son of the terrorist mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, is dead, according to reports Wednesday.
Bin Laden, who had been groomed to follow in his father's twisted footsteps and take over leadership of Al Qaeda, was killed at some point in the past two years, but it took U.S. intelligence agencies until Wednesday to confirm his death, multiple sources told The New York Times.
The Times' sources said the U.S. government played some type of role in the assassination, but details about Bin Laden's death, including where and how it happened, were not immediately known.
President Trump was asked by reporters about Bin Laden on Wednesday afternoon but uncharacteristically declined to comment.
In his last public statement released by Al Qaeda's media arm last year, Hamza Bin Laden called for attacks against the U.S. similar to the one his father launched on the World Trade Center in Manhattan on Sept. 11, 2001.
The terror attack - the worst in American history - took the lives of 2,996 people and continues to cause pain for first responders who spent months searching for survivors in the rubble of the twin towers.
After a Navy SEAL team killed Osama Bin Laden in 2011 during a raid on his hideout in Abbottabad, Pakistan, the Al Qaeda leader's top lieutenants began training the younger Bin Laden to take over his father's role as the top official of the extremist group.
Hamza Bin Laden pledged to avenge his father's death, and fled to Iran with other Al Qaeda members. Iran held them in detention but eventually allowed them to leave and it is believed Bin Laden relocated to an area near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.
In February, the State Department announced a $1 million reward for information about Bin Laden's whereabouts.
However, sources told The Times that the terrorist heir had already been killed at that point, but that U.S. intelligence agencies had not yet been able to confirm it.
The CIA continues to hunt Ayman al-Zawahiri, one of the elder Bin Laden's senior deputies who took over Al Qaeda's leadership after his death.

Michigan's status as Midwestern state suddenly called into question

Texto completo: "By definition it's in the Eastern Time Zone. It's very difficult to say that any state in the Eastern Time Zone is Midwest."
Dennis Lennox
political consultant and travel writer
Michigan is part of the U.S. Midwest, most authorities agree, possibly laying to rest one major disagreement that emerged from Tuesday's Democratic presidential debate in Detroit.
Amid a discussion on Twitter about what sort of political promises "play well" in the Midwest, New York Times Deputy Washington Editor Jonathan Weisman sent a tweet that many interpreted as an assertion that neither Detroit nor Minneapolis are part of the Midwest.
He later deleted the tweet after a war of words erupted on Twitter.
Both the U.S. Census Bureau and National Geographic include Michigan in the Midwest in their maps showing the various geographic regions of the U.S. They also vouch for Minnesota.
"There is no confusion over that," Joe Darden, a professor of geography at Michigan State University in East Lansing, said Wednesday. "I don't know why there is any discussion about it."
But in fact there has been a quiet debate for decades over whether not only Michigan, but other states such as Ohio, should be counted as Midwest states. Some note that much earlier in America's history, Michigan was considered part of the Northwest. Others insist it is much more Northeast than Midwest.
Exactly how the geographic debate began within Tuesday's political debate is not precisely clear.
But at least two Democratic candidates — Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts — referenced Michigan as a Midwest state at various points.
"I win in the Midwest," Klobuchar said at one point. "I can win in states like Wisconsin and Michigan and Iowa."
In his tweet, Weisman said that to say that U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Detroit, or U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., are from the Midwest is like saying that U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin, is from Texas, or that U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-Atlanta, is from the Deep South.
What appeared to get lost by many who read the tweet was that Austin is in fact the capital of Texas and Georgia is generally agreed to be part of the Deep South.
Weisman later deleted the tweet, saying he was trying "to make a point about regional differences in politics between urban and rural areas" that was misunderstood.
But by then, a fight was raging on Twitter, with FiveThirtyEight Editor-in-Chief (and Michigan native) Nate Silver accusing Weisman of saying "people from major cities in the Midwest are not really from the Midwest."
Since both Tlaib and Omar are part of the "squad" of congresswomen of color that President Donald Trump has said should go back where they came from, some saw the singling out of Tlaib and Omar in the context of the debate over where the Midwest is located as racist.
But even earlier in the evening, among those arguing that Michigan is not part of the Midwest was Michigan Republican political consultant and travel writer Dennis Lennox.
"Note to Klobuchar," Lennox tweeted less than 25 minutes into the debate at the Fox Theatre. "#Detroit (and #Michigan) is not Midwest."
Lennox pointed to a 2008 article in Hour Detroit that questioned whether Michigan should be considered part of the Midwest, said that the U.S. Census Bureau did not adopt the term "Midwest" until 1984, and quoted a history professor at Miami University in Ohio as saying the term is a "cultural construct" that can mean different things to different people.
A Google search also turned up an article titled, "Why are Ohio and Michigan considered part of the Midwest ..." among others questioning the classification.
Lennox said that he thinks Michigan historically and culturally has much more in common with northern Ohio, the northeast, and upper New York State than it does with the Midwest states of Kansas or Nebraska.
"By definition it's in the Eastern Time Zone," Lennox said. "It's very difficult to say that any state in the Eastern Time Zone is Midwest."
"We basically are like New York, politically," Lennox said.
But many appeared as flummoxed by the debate as Darden.
"Apparently a hot debate about whether Michigan is actually 'Midwestern' or not erupted on Twitter during the debates last night," tweeted Jordyn Hermani, a writer for the Lansing-based political newsletter Gongwer.
"I really gotta ask: If we're not Midwestern, what are we? South Canadians?"

Texto completo: Sanders, Warren will beat a path for a Trump cakewalk
Re “Democrats battle over party's direction" (Page A1, July 31): Should either the angry old senator from Vermont (“I wrote the damn bill") or the sharp-tongued senator for Massachusetts (“I have a plan for that") become the Democratic candidate for president, we are in for very dark days ahead, and almost assuredly another four years of Donald Trump in the Oval Office.
While I believe this country needs big, bold ideas, Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, and the forgiving of all student debt will brand the Democrats, in the words of many Republicans, as “crazy socialists." There is only one issue to be resolved in the 2020 presidential election, and that is removing the metastasizing cancer in the White House. Unless and until that happens, there is no saving the Affordable Care Act, or making significant strides to combat climate change, or having a sane and sound immigration policy.
Democrats are polarizing themselves in an effort to stand out and score political points, while the juggernaut of Trump supporters and dark money is rushing to get this faux president reelected. As Thomas Friedman said in a recent New York Times column, we can have a revolution, or we can elect a sane and decent president, but we cannot accomplish both at the same time.
Henry A. Lowenstein

Democrats need to steer to middle to attract independents
As a lifelong independent voter, I'm pleading with the Democratic Party to nominate a presidential candidate who will attract independent voters in 2020. In 2016 my vote was to write in Evan McMullin. The Democratic candidate for 2020 should be able to beat Donald Trump. Beating Trump needs to be the Democratic Party's top priority.
That will happen if moderates are on the Democratic ticket. Extremes in politics are harmful to getting things done. Pushing an agenda that alienates middle-thinking voters is no way to take back normalcy.
Further, impeaching Trump is a bad idea. He will become the victim. With a Mitch McConnell-controlled Senate, Trump would never be voted out of office. Impeaching him would serve no purpose but to invigorate his base.
Please focus on voting Trump out of office in 2020.

Texto completo: El magnate Jeffrey Epstein, acusado de tráfico sexual de menores , tenía planes científicos de gran alcance.
De acuerdo con el New York Times, Epstein tenía contactos con reconocidos hombres de la ciencia con el fin de desarrollar varios proyectos. Uno de ellos era impregnar mujeres con su ADN en Nuevo México. El reporte revela que el multimillonario era un entusiasta del transhumanismo , un movimiento que tiene el “fin de transformar la condición humana mediante el desarrollo y fabricación de tecnologías ampliamente disponibles, que mejoren las capacidades humanas, tanto a nivel físico como psicológico o intelectual”.
Las íntimas fotos que muestran el gusto sexual de Jeffrey Epstein por las niñas
La idea de Epstein era reclutar mujeres jóvenes y “guapas” para inyectarles su “semilla”. Esto indica que era simpatizante de la eugenesia, una filosofía en la que se buscan humanos “más fuertes, sanos e inteligentes”.
De acuerdo con el Times, Epstein también tenía interés en la criónica , una práctica científica que busca la preservación de humanos a bajas temperaturas con el objetivo de tratarlos médicamente y reanimarlos en el futuro. Una de las fuentes del Times dijo que Epstein buscaba que congelaran su cabeza y su pene.
Epstein enfrenta la cadena perpetua por sus delitos. El 25 de julio fue hallado semiinconsciente en su celda.

Texto completo: Osama bin Laden's son, Hamza, heir apparent to leadership of the militant group al-Qaida, is dead, according to multiple U. S. officials.
He was killed sometime in the past two years, during the Trump administration, but officials took some time to confirm his death, The New York Times reported.
In February, the State Department said Hamza was emerging as the new leader of the group and offered a $1 million reward for information on him. He was thought to be about 30 years old and based somewhere near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.
"He has released audio and video messages on the Internet, calling on his followers to launch attacks against the United States and its Western allies, and he has threatened attacks against the United States in revenge for the May 2011 killing of his father by U. S. military forces," the State Department said at the end of February.
However, Hamza had already been killed by February – although his death had not yet been confirmed by U. S. military and intelligence agencies, according to the Times.
The U. S. government had a role in the Hamza bin Laden's death, but it remains unclear what that role was. Officials provided scarce details on when and where his death occurred, discussing the matter anonymously because it involved sensitive information and intelligence gathering, the Times reported.
When asked by reporters on Wednesday about bin Laden's reported death, President Donald Trump declined to comment.
Hamza bin Laden's last known public statement was released by al-Qaida's media arm in 2018, NBC reported. In that message, he threatened Saudi Arabia and called on the people of the Arabian Peninsula to revolt.
He is believed to have been born around 1989. His father moved to Afghanistan in 1996 and declared war against the U. S. Hamza, who moved with him, later appeared in al-Qaida propaganda videos, NBC reported.
He was 'brainwashed': Osama bin Laden's mom speaks out in interview
Hamza was married to the daughter of Mohammed Atta, the lead hijacker involved in al-Qaida's attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001.
His father was killed by U. S. Navy SEALs in Pakistan in 2011. Letters found by the Navy SEALs during the raid on his hideout showed that Hamza had asked his father to train him to follow in his footsteps, and that the elder bin Laden was preparing him for the role.
Osama bin Laden was believed to have fathered at least 20 children with half a dozen wives and was himself the 17th of 52 children. The letters uncovered in the raid after his death suggest that Hamza was one of his favorites.
Despite Hamza's death, al-Qaida is still a problem for the West, according to Nathan Sales, a counterterrorism expert at the State Department.
"Al-Qaida . . . has been relatively quiet. This is a strategic pause, not a surrender," he said in a briefing Feb. 28, after the State Department announced the reward for information on Hamza's whereabouts.
"Al-Qaida is not stagnant. It's rebuilding. And it continues to threaten the United States and its allies. . . . Make no mistake, al-Qaida retains both the capability and the intent to hit us," Sales said.

The Long, Steamy Journey to Cool Subways

Texto completo: It was a long, stop-start journey to the near-perfectly cooled subway fleet New York City has today.
(Emphasis on the "near-perfectly." Who among us hasn't sweated it out in a hot car?)
Fifty-two years ago this month, Mayor John V. Lindsay and a few thousand of the city's millions enjoyed a late afternoon on an air-conditioned ride. In the following months, a Metropolitan Transportation Authority pilot program of six chilled F train cars became a hit.
One passenger, a lanky 14-year-old, memorized the schedules and spent up to six hours in the cars every day for a week, The New York Times reported in 1967. Another passenger mistook the bottle-shaped thermometers inside the cars for bombs and reported them to transit officials.
As it goes with subway improvements, the transition to cool cars wasn't easy or smooth. The goal of chilling trains was attempted as far back as 1910, when the first car with an electric fan departed what was then called the Brooklyn Bridge subway station.
"The breeze was almost refreshing," The Times wrote.
The M.T.A. again tried to cool cars in 1933 and 1952. In 1955, the M.T.A. chairman, Charles L. Patterson, rode during a semi-successful test of an air-conditioned car, but seven years and $ 300,000 later, he ended the experiment.
But after the 1967 F train pilot, air-conditioned cars became common enough that savvy riders learned to play "subway roulette," watching carefully for exterior features that signaled a climate-controlled car.
In 1973, officials pledged to spend $ 35 million a year to air-condition every bus and subway car by 1980. But once air-conditioning became the default, problems arose. By 1981, because of aging equipment and inadequate facilities, just a third of subway cars were cooled, instead of the M.T.A.'s goal of over 90 percent.
By 2002, the success rate was near 97 percent, though that hasn't stopped New Yorkers -- including former Mayor Michael Bloomberg -- from getting stuck in a stifling car or two.
In 2019, commuters can report hot cars via the M.T.A.'s website, though the Twitter user @1trainstruggle1 called the process "enraging," saying, "I recently got on the same hot car twice in one week."

Texto completo: President Donald Trump’s weekend exchange with Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the Rev. Al Sharpton and the city of Baltimore was devoid of tact, a quality whose demise is among the more lamentable casualties of today’s political world. Criticizing an American city as a “disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess” and asserting “no human being would want to live there” is unbecoming of the country’s leader.
Still, the comments raise an important question: What’s going on with America’s cities?
They’re failing, to put it bluntly. Some of the country’s crown jewels are drowning in violence, drug abuse, homelessness and poverty. Shifts away from market principles and strong civil societies have left families fleeing for the suburbs. Bringing them back is a key to revitalizing America’s urban cores.
Baltimore may not be a place where “no human would want to live,” but it’s also not a beacon of safety. It consistently sits in the top 10 most dangerous cities when accounting for various crime statistics, and the FBI reports it has the highest number of homicides and the second highest murder rate in the U.S.
San Francisco has a serious housing crisis, where the annual salary needed to buy a median-priced home is now $322,480, according to the California Association of Realtors. Its power to draw in lucrative startups, combined with a vocal group of “not in my backyard” activists, has made the City by the Bay the world’s home to the most billionaires per capita. Yet, The New York Times reports, street corners are spilling with trash, human waste and drug needles.
The homeless situation in Seattle is a living Kafka novel. The city’s budget for combating homelessness has topped $90 million, but for all the taxpayer dollars spent on building tiny homes and designating “safe drug injection spaces,” Seattle still houses more than 12,000 homeless people, many of whom come from out of state, says Christopher Rufo in City Journal.
Perhaps these are among the more visible of urban failures, so it’s worth pointing out that cities have been cleaning up their act for several decades. In general, crime rates are down and economic development is up. But, as Derek Thompson writes in The Atlantic, this revitalization is missing one thing: families.
Strong families are the bedrock of society, so they ought to be the foundation of America’s cities. But young, professional urbanites are staying single longer and having fewer children, if they have children at all. Since 80% of the country resides in urban areas, this spells trouble for the ability to replace an aging population and financially support the pending growth of government services.
The question city leaders ought to ask themselves is simple: What do we want to prioritize? Some families will always prefer the suburbs, but enticing those who enjoy the urban aesthetic to return to the city would bring numerous benefits. Leaders need to prioritize family-friendly infrastructure projects, use market principles and zoning laws to lower rents and abandon what Aaron Renn, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, calls “official toleration of social disorder.”
Running a city on government projects and interventions isn’t working. Embracing market principles and building family-friendly environments, on the other hand, is an integral part of a complex solution to restore urban centers and benefit others in the process.

CANCELING QUENTIN TARANTINO? THOUGH PROBLEMATIC, THE FAMED AUTEUR REMAINS AN ESSENTIAL AMERICAN FILMMAKER

Texto completo: A writer for the Guardian suggests we cancel Quentin Tarantino because his films "have reveled in extreme violence toward women." Debatable, but this is quite a paragraph:
...
In Tarantino's debut directorial feature, "Reservoir Dogs," the only female characters in the credits are "Shot Woman" and "Shocked Woman." "Pulp Fiction," his second film, features female characters more prominently, but a trend of reveling in the abuse of women began to emerge. One of "Pulp Fiction's" most famous scenes involves Uma Thurman's character getting stabbed in the heart with a shot of adrenaline to resuscitate her after a drug overdose. (Though it's fair to say male characters were also subjected to extreme violence.)
...
Well, every important character in "Reservoir Dogs" suffers extreme violence and they're all men. Is the problem that there are not enough women getting aggressed in the film? No fair leaving women out of the ear-removal party, Q.T.!
As writer Roy Chacko seems to know but doesn't quite concede, the vast majority of the violence in Tarantino films is directed at men. True, the Bride played by Ms. Thurman in the "Kill Bill" movies suffers horribly, but this is in the service of her being justified in meting out lots of violence toward her antagonists (some male, some female). Violence is Mr. Tarantino's idiom.
Mr. Chocko doesn't mention it, but the climactic scene of Mr. Tarantino's latest, "Once Upon a Time.in Hollywood," has a scene depicting violence against a woman that goes on a bit too long. And when I say "a bit too long," I mean it's grotesque. There's also a running joke about how Brad Pitt's character killed his wife and got away with it. Mr. Tarantino finds this detail hilarious; I don't see the humor. The beatings given to Jennifer Jason Leigh's character in "The Hateful Eight" are likewise gruesome and gratuitous. Extreme, cartoonish gore can be funny, but it's a lot less funny when a woman is the target. Women are naturally more vulnerable, and this alters our emotional reaction.
What about the violence directed by Mr. Tarantino at women during the making of his films, though? Mr. Tarantino admits spitting on Ms. Thurman during "Kill Bill" filming (because her character was being spit on and he didn't trust an actor to nail it in a single take) and also told her to drive a car she wasn't prepared to drive, which resulted in a crash. Mr. Tarantino says she was a shaky driver but didn't consider the task particularly complicated. He does regret this last, though, and gave The New York Times footage from "Kill Bill" for a story as a mea culpa.
At the New York Post, my longtime colleague Sara Stewart says "Tarantino's Exploitation Has No Place in Hollywood Anymore." Why, she asks, does the female lead of his new picture, Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate, get almost nothing to say?
"I just reject your hypothesis," Mr. Tarantino said to a reporter who asked a question along these lines.
"That's interesting," Ms. Stewart responds, "because I reject some of Tarantino's hypotheses, including the one about [Tate's husband Roman] Polanski's innocence regarding the sexual assault of a 13-year-old. ('Look. She was down with it . He didn't rape a 13-year-old, it was statutory rape, all right? . She wanted to have it,' Mr. Tarantino said in a 2003 interview with Howard Stern.)" Mr. Tarantino later apologized for saying this. She continues:
...
In a world where we have an increasing number of heroic females - especially in films written and directed by actual women - it may be game over for male auteurs who create supposedly strong women on-camera and denigrate them from behind it. In 2019, we don't need that type of guy anymore, especially one who thinks silencing Sharon Tate for most of his film is somehow a fitting homage.
...
I would disagree that we "don't need" Mr. Tarantino, one of our most interesting filmmakers.
The New Yorker's Richard Brody dings the new film for a different reason: It's too white. The movie "celebrates white-male stardom (and behind-the-scenes command) at the expense of everyone else."
Mr. Brody points out that a movie villain played by Leonardo DiCaprio's actor character refers to a Mexican as a "beaner," but then again, villains do tend to say mean things.
There's also another slur in the movie that bothers Mr. Brody: "There's no slur delivered more bitterly by Cliff and Rick than 'hippie,' and their narrow but intense experiences in the course of the film are set up to bear out the absolute aptness of their hostility." I guess the use of this epithet might cause me sorrow if I had once been a hippie. But then again, the hippies in question are . the Manson Family.

Next in Line as Puerto Rico's Governor Is Also Next in Line as Target of Protests

Texto completo: CORRECTION APPENDED. SAN JUAN, P.R. -- The message from the public to the woman who is in line to become Puerto Rico's next governor has been as clear -- and as literal -- as the writing on the wall: "We are coming for you," said a patch of graffiti on a building in Old San Juan.
It was addressed to Wanda Vázquez, who is set to step into the job later this week.
Some of the protesters who successfully ousted Gov. Ricardo Rosselló after two weeks of rallies appear now to have set their sights on Ms. Vázquez, the secretary of justice, who under the territory's Constitution will become governor when Mr. Rosselló's resignation becomes effective at 5 p.m. on Friday.
Several hundred people banged on pots and pans while marching in front of her office on Monday, demanding that she not only decline to take the governor's post but resign from her current job as well.
"She has acted more like Rosselló's lawyer than a justice secretary," said Marta Quiles Jiménez, 33, a San Juan psychologist who was among the protesters.
The latest signs of opposition to Ms. Vázquez, who is seen as too close to cover-ups and corruption in Mr. Rosselló's unpopular administration, present a test for the new revolutionary movement that unseated the current governor: Can the loosely organized street protests that mobilized hundreds of thousands of people to oust Mr. Rosselló be channeled into longer-term change in Puerto Rico?
Protesters ran Mr. Rosselló out of office last week after the release of a series of offensive text messages tapped into longstanding public frustration over corruption, economic problems and a slow response to Hurricane Maria in 2017.
Emboldened by their victory, some of the leaders of the demonstrations are making it clear that their demands went beyond simply ending the governor's term a year and a half early. They are insisting on fundamental democratic changes in a place where two-party politics have traditionally played out within a relatively limited circle of power. Fears that party leaders are negotiating secret deals to name a crony as the governor's replacement -- or that Ms. Vázquez could in fact end up as governor -- have already led to the threat of ongoing protests.
[Read: 15 Days of Fury: How Puerto Rico's Government Collapsed]
"It's like they haven't learned a thing," said Melissa Mark-Viverito, a former New York City Council speaker whom the governor insulted in the chats and who has been participating in the protests. "For them to be striking back-room deals to pick a new governor is everything that the people found repugnant and everything that has the people marching again. You cannot replace one corrupt administration with another corrupt administration."
Mr. Rosselló was forced out after two weeks of immense pressure both on the streets and within his party. The secretary of state, who would normally take the governor's place, had already resigned over his own role in the bawdy text exchange. That means Ms. Vázquez is next in line -- unless the governing New Progressive Party can name and confirm a new secretary of state by Friday.
Party leaders have encouraged the governor to name someone quickly, but no acceptable candidates have emerged.
On Friday, the governor posted photos of himself and Ms. Vázquez together planning the "transition."
But on Sunday, she posted on Twitter that she does not really want the job. "I reiterate, I have no interest in occupying the governor's post," she wrote. "It is a constitutional rule. I hope the governor identifies and submits a candidate for the position of secretary of state before Aug. 2, and I have told him so."
Some news outlets took that to mean that Ms. Vázquez was turning down the job. A spokeswoman for her office, Mariana Cobián, clarified on Monday that the justice secretary was simply saying that she has never been an elected politician and does not seek to become one.
"She is a believer and follower of the law and the Constitution," Ms. Cobián told The New York Times. "It is what the Constitution says, and she will do what the Constitution says."
In recent days, Ms. Vázquez has come under fire because she had declined to investigate trailers loaded with unused hurricane aid that were found a year after Maria. Leaked messages showed that she had not only passed on looking into the matter but had also discussed the issue with the governor's chief of staff before doing so.
Ms. Vázquez, a former prosecutor, had also been the head of the island's women's affairs office. The occupant of that position, a 10-year appointment, is supposed to serve as an advocate for women's issues. Ms. Vázquez was the subject of controversy from the start after suggesting that domestic violence victims should take up arms against their abusers. But feminist groups said that when it came to new policies to help women, she had failed to act.
The feminist groups had pushed for the administration to declare a state of emergency after a spike in gender-based violence, but Ms. Vázquez, they complained, did not take a position on the matter. She left the position after seven years to become secretary of justice.
Ms. Vázquez was briefly suspended as Puerto Rico's justice secretary last year after she was accused of meddling in a case in which her daughter was the victim of a burglary. A judge cleared her, and she returned to her post.
Opposition to Ms. Vázquez began building even before Mr. Rosselló announced his resignation on Wednesday. The hashtag #WandaRenuncia ("Wanda Resign") has been shared on Twitter 62,129 times in the past week.
"Instead of being a person who opens a path to justice, she puts up obstacles to favor her party," said Yaddeliz Martínez, an activist who created a Facebook invite to promote Monday's demonstration against Ms. Vázquez. "If we manage to take down someone who is corrupt, we cannot allow a person who is the same to replace him.
"This is not over."
René Pérez, the rapper known as Residente, canceled engagements in New York to continue to protest even after Mr. Rosselló announced his resignation. "Even if he resigns, the next person in line to be governor is going to be corrupt, so that's why we have to stay on the streets fighting the same way we fought," Mr. Pérez said in a voice mail message to The Times. "I think we need new faces."
Yadira Carrasquillo González, a 45-year-old activist who joined the protest outside Ms. Vázquez's office, said many of those who were still in the streets were hoping to change the status quo in favor of a community-based system in which candidates are chosen not by party leaders but by the public.
"We want them all to resign," Ms. Carrasquillo said. "My God, yes, let them all go. They are all part of the system of corruption. We don't want any of them."
If Ms. Vázquez were to decide not to accept the position, the job would fall to the secretary of education, Eligio Hernández, who is fifth in line and has been in his job only since April. The person who is fourth in line, the treasury secretary, would be passed over because the Constitution dictates that the governor has to be at least 35 years old.
The treasury secretary, Francisco Parés, is only 31.
"The people don't trust anyone who is tied to this cabinet," said Alvin R. Couto de Jesús, a lawyer and activist who helped to organize Monday's march. "Nobody tied to this administration can take that seat. Nobody who has been tainted by corruption should become the next governor."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
Correction: July 30, 2019, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article included a statement by René Pérez, the rapper known as Residente, that misstated the origins of Puerto Rico's Constitution. It was not written by officials in Washington; it was written by a Puerto Rican constitutional assembly, then amended and approved by the United States Congress.

Texto completo: U. S. women's soccer star Megan Rapinoe said in an interview published Monday that she doesn't think any of her teammates are interested in visiting President Trump at the White House — and she doesn't believe any conversation she could have with Trump would change his perspective on fundamental issues in which they disagree.
Rapinoe told The New York Times Magazine that her public back-and-forth with the President didn't cause any consternation within the U. S. women's national soccer team because her teammates largely shared her views. ("I haven’t done the roll call, but I don’t think anybody’s interested (in visiting Trump)," Rapinoe told the magazine. )
She also said she doesn't see any value in meeting with Trump, even in an attempt to discuss their differences.
"A lot of people have said, 'Why don’t you make a demand of the president that he’ll sit down and talk with you if go to the White House?'" Rapinoe told The New York Times Magazine. "But I’m not going to be naïve and think that I’m going to sit down with Trump and he’s going to change his mind. There are children locked up at the border who are dying, and that’s not fazing him. So why would I faze him?"
In the remainder of the interview, Rapinoe spoke at length about her reaction to Trump's now-famous tweet during the World Cup, in which he said Rapinoe should "WIN first before she TALKS" about not wishing to visit the White House, as is customary for sports champions. She also discussed her upbringing, the future of women's soccer and her penchant for political activism.
"In this incredible moment that I have, I would like to use this platform to unify people," she told the magazine. "That doesn’t mean get everybody to the left, but I want to bring everybody to the conversation, and the basis of it is equal rights. "

Texto completo: In Point Pleasant, a Mason County town with a population of 4,350 in 2010, pharmacists at Fruth Pharmacy gave out 7.3 million painkillers between 2006 and 2012.
Less than a block away, across Jackson Avenue, a Rite Aid dispensed more than 3.9 million pills in the same seven-year window.
Those numbers come from recently released U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency data, which shows how chain drug stores around West Virginia put hundreds of millions of powerful painkillers into the hands of West Virginians while overdose death rates surged.
Chain drug stores' individual locations reported lower pill dispensing totals than many of the smaller, family-owned pharmacies that topped the DEA's list for opioid disbursements.
Two West Virginia pharmacists, who were indicted earlier this month on federal charges of conspiring to distribute controlled substances, ran two of these smaller "pill-mills - Tug Valley Pharmacy, in Williamson, where pharmacists dispensed the fourth highest number of pain pills in the state; and Westside Pharmacy, in Oceana, which was 13th on the list.
An analysis of DEA data, however, shows the outsize role corporations played at the end of the pharmaceutical supply line.
According to the DEA data, in West Virginia between 2006 and 2012:
Rite Aid pharmacies dispensed 140 million painkillers at 108 locationsCVS pharmacies dispensed 96.7 million painkillers at 50 locationsWalmart pharmacies dispensed 67.4 million painkillers at 41 locationsKroger pharmacies dispensed 58 million painkillers at 43 locationsFruth pharmacies dispensed 35.2 million painkillers at 14 locationsWalgreens pharmacies dispensed 17.1 million painkillers at 16 locations
This data was submitted in federal court as part of litigation brought against a wide range of pharmaceutical companies from hundreds of towns, cities and counties affected by the opioid epidemic. The companies are accused of conspiring to saturate the country with opioids. The data was not available to the public until attorneys for HD Media, which owns The Charleston Gazette-Mail, and The Washington Post successfully fought for its release.
While a total of 67 pharmacies were operating and dispersing pain pills in Charleston over this time, six Rite Aid locations alone provided nearly 8.8 million doses to the city - nearly 30 percent of all the opioid prescriptions filled in the state's capital over those seven years.
In Belle, an eastern Kanawha County town where 1,260 residents lived in 2010, two Rite Aids were the only pharmacies in town, according to DEA data. There, the stores provided nearly 2.8 million doses of pain pills between 2006 and 2012.
Concurrently, the age-adjusted rate of drug overdose deaths tripled between 1999 and 2016 around the country, federal data shows. Between 2005 and 2015, heroin use doubled in adults aged 18 to 25. About 45 percent of people who used heroin were also addicted to painkillers.
In the Brooke County seat of Wellsburg, population 2,805 in 2010, Rite Aid and Kroger pharmacies provided 2.4 million pain pills to residents.
Brooke County has the second-highest rate of opioid-related hospitalizations in the state, behind only McDowell County, according to data from the federal Department of Health and Human Services.
Walgreens, Walmart, CVS Health, Rite Aid and Kroger are among the pharmacies named in federal lawsuits accusing them of flooding the country with billions of opioids and flouting requirements that they notify the DEA of suspicious orders.
Attorneys for the plaintiffs say an official at CVS who was listed as the company's DEA compliance coordinator admitted it was not her real job, and that other drug store chains did almost nothing to report suspicious orders, according to The New York Times.
Michael DeAngelis, senior director of communications at CVS Health, said in a statement that pharmacists at the company evaluate all prescriptions they receive for controlled substances, like opioids, before filling them.
"While we have taken numerous actions to strengthen our existing safeguards to help address the nation's opioid epidemic, it is important to keep in mind that doctors have the primary responsibility to make sure the opioid prescriptions they write are for a legitimate purpose, DeAngelis said. "Opioid medications are only a small percentage of the overall prescriptions our pharmacies dispensed.
He noted that no individual CVS pharmacy topped the DEA's database for the highest number of pain pills dispersed.
Unlike the other chain pharmacies, Fruth Pharmacy is a West Virginia-based company, operating about 30 pharmacies in West Virginia, Ohio and Kentucky.
Fruth Pharmacy President Lynne Fruth said she would not comment on data "she has not been given a chance to see. Invited to view the numbers, she said she wouldn't have time to look.
Chris Krese, a spokesman for the National Association of Chain Drug Stores - an industry group - warned that people should "take care in drawing conclusions from the data released by the federal court.
"It does not lend itself to clear interpretations, and it is leading to some incorrect conclusions that are harmful to entire communities, Krese said.
Krese would not elaborate on what conclusions were incorrect, or how communities were being harmed.
Walgreens spokesman Phil Caruso said the company's pharmacists are highly trained and committed to dispensing legitimate prescriptions.
"Walgreens has not distributed prescription controlled substances since 2014 and before that time only distributed to our chain of pharmacies, he said. "Walgreens has been an industry leader in combating this crisis in the communities where our pharmacists live and work.
None of the representatives speaking for the pharmacy chains would discuss whether the companies' prescription-filling practices played a role in the opioid epidemic that has taken thousands of lives in West Virginia alone.
Representatives from Rite Aid, Kroger and Walmart did not respond to requests for comment.
The pills don't just go out'
Dr. Rahul Gupta, West Virginia's former state health officer, said the data indicates the pharmacies didn't seem to be reporting suspicious orders to the federal government.
"Clearly, the retail pharmacies were not looking to actually look at these orders with a suspicious eye. They were dispensing; they saw their role as being dispensers, said Gupta, currently chief medical officer for the March of Dimes.
However, he said there was a culture of "complicitness up and down the supply chain, including doctors writing prescriptions, distributors delivering the pills, and pharmacies giving them to patients, that ultimately cost human lives.
"Everyone that touched these pills & is responsible ultimately for the end results that happened and continues to happen, he said.
Mike Goff, executive director of West Virginia's controlled substance monitoring program, declined to comment on the chain drug stores' role in the opioid epidemic.
However, Goff said some blame lies with the doctors who wrote the prescriptions, not just the pharmacies that filled them.
"The pills don't just go out, he said. "The pharmacies filled them and the numbers are big, but there are also doctors out there who wrote those prescriptions to be filled. So there's another piece to this.
Dr. Michael Brumage, former director for the West Virginia Office of Drug Control Policy, said that while it's easy to point fingers and shift blame, no one involved in these practices - executives, distributors, doctors or pharmacists - are innocent.
"They all have plausible deniability by blaming everybody else, but in truth, everybody was culpable in this, Brumage said. "Anybody who made a lot of money off the opioid crisis, at some point or another, conveniently looked the other way.
Brumage, who currently works as the medical director for Cabin Creek Health Systems and as a program director at West Virginia University's School of Public Health, characterized the opioid epidemic as one of the "biggest catastrophes in the history of public health. He called it "a Vietnam [War] happening practically every year because of the number of lives lost.
Those responsible for negligent prescription practices here, Brumage said, are all concerned with the same thing: making a profit. It's not a lack of information or understanding that has distributors sending pills to the area, doctors writing prescriptions for them and pharmacists filling those prescriptions, he said.
"It's indifference. It's indifference to the harm you're causing by focusing on the bottom line, Brumage said. "That's sort of the lesson here: Big pharma and these pharmacy chains and the distributors, they don't care about the common person. I think they knew damn well what they were doing, but they were blinded by the inflow of cash.
Money, Gupta agreed, is what's at the center of it all.
"Everyone that monetized it has to be held responsible, he said. "It's a monetary thing at the end of the day.

THAT MIRACLE OF ALL MIRACLES

Texto completo: This month's appropriate reverence for the 50th anniversary of the moon landing didn't fully illuminate the extent of the enduring end-to-end American craziness that was 1969.
With the Pirates in New York this weekend, it re-occurs to me that I still can't look at the Mets without time-travelling back to that summer, when their miraculous story earned its historical place as perhaps the craziest of all. Ten games out of first on Aug. 13, they won the division by eight games, swept the Hank Aaron-led Atlanta Braves in the inaugural National League Championship Series, and steamrolled the defending World Series champion Baltimore Orioles of Frank Robinson, Brooks Robinson, Boog Powell, Paul Blair, Jim Palmer, Mike Cuellar, etc. to win it all.
Prior to that, they had never finished higher than ninth in a 10-team league.
How on earth?
Two words - scary pitching.
"We're in Shea Stadium and I'm in the on-deck circle, and here's this freaking kid out there, Nolan Ryan," said Steve Blass, the Pirates ace who would win his own World Series two years later. "I got into the box and said to [catcher Jerry] Grote, I said, 'Look Jerry, here's the deal, I gotta new baby; I don't want to die tonight. Three pitches, I'm out of here, no problem. Look at that SOB out there. He's 19 years old, there's stuff coming out of his nose, his eyes are crossed, he's pawing at the dirt like a freaking bull, he throws 200 miles an hour and he doesn't know where it's going.'"
And Ryan, then actually 22 but at the start of a Hall of Fame career that would include seven no-hitters, could not crack the Mets starting rotation. Tom Seaver won 25 games, Jerry Koosman another 17, and a Gil Hodges-managed team that didn't need a lot of offense from its undistinguished lineup somehow generated plenty.
Everyone was struck with how the Mets story started just seven years earlier, with a still-record 120 losses and with The New York Times game stories that would begin, "Even in the autumn of their pathetic despair ... "
But the whole other-worldliness of that year, 1969, probably started with Joe Namath, explaining that January how the Jets would beat the Colts in the Super Bowl, essentially the equivalent of saying that not only could a canary not only eat a cat, but in the coming days, it would.
After Jets 16, Colts 7, America was suitably primed to withstand any amount of culture-rattling turbulence. The fates conspired. The fates delivered. Slaughterhouse Five came out in March. The Stonewall riots went down in June. July brought Chappaquiddick and the moon landing, August the Manson murders and Woodstock. By August 23, the greatest rock n' roll song ever recorded, "Honky Tonk Women," made it to the top of the American charts and stayed there until the Mets, who had lost 100 games in five of their first six years, had overtaken the Cubs, who had spent 129 days in first place.
Yeah, that's all.
The Pirates, who would somehow finished third despite having Stargell, Clemente, Oliver, Mazeroski, Hebner and Sanguillen in the lineup and Blass, Veale, Ellis and Bunning on the mound, were absolutely pivotal in all of this. They enabled the Mets. They devastated the Cubs. They had nothing to do with the moon landing, but a couple of them achieved considerable altitude Friday, Sept. 5 in Chicago.
"That was Maz's birthday, Sept. 5, and we were roomin' together," Blass remembered. "So I had the day of my life [4 for 5 with a homer in a 9-2 victory] and it was Maz's birthday, and we're on the streets of Chicago at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, ain't nothin' better. I didn't have to pitch for four days, but Maz had to play the next day."
According to baseballreference.com, Maz actually was scratched. Perhaps some head discomfort. The Pirates won anyway, 13-4, and won the next day, 7-5. For the Cubs, that lost weekend at home comprised the second, third and fourth losses on an eight-game slide that wouldn't end until they had lost twice in New York to Koosman and Seaver. They never saw first place again.
By contrast, here is how the Pirates treated those Mets in the season's most urgent moments. The Mets arrived at Forbes Field for a twilight-night doubleheader Sept. 12 leading the Cubs by two games. The Pirates, five of whom would hit .300 or better (Sanguillen .303, Hebner .301, Stargell .307, Matty Alou .331, Clemente .345), scored zero runs that night. The Mets won, 1-0 and 1-0. New York's two starting pitchers, Koosman and former Pirate Don Cardwell, drove in the only runs. They won again the next day, and even though Blass beat Ryan in the series finale, the Mets left Pittsburgh up 3½ games.
They wound up winning 38 of their final 49. From Pittsburgh to Rush Street to the Sea of Tranquility and back, no one saw that miracle coming. No one.

Pignanelli and Webb: Trump, more Trump and term limits

Texto completo: In the last several weeks, the country has endured incredible searing heat. But that’s not just the record-breaking weather — it’s the never-ending political controversies: Allegations of racism, immigration pressures and dramatic congressional investigations. We explore the impact on Utah.
Recently, a poll conducted by UtahPolicy.com and reported in the Deseret News indicated a majority of Utah voters disapprove of Pres. Donald Trump’s job performance and only a plurality of voters support his reelection. What does this mean for “red state” Utah politics?
Pignanelli: "Trump has a tendency to make his own weather” — Maggie Haberman, The New York Times
This poll is extremely valuable to politicos as a treasure map, detailing land mines and obstacles lurking along an election path. Obviously, Trump is the antithesis of the average Utahn in so many ways — explaining why 53% disapprove of him.
These dynamics are challenging for all candidates of either stripe in 2020. Republicans cannot be viewed as too close to the president. Yet, the survey subtly reminds Democrats to establish clear distance from their party nominee — especially if debate statements indicate campaign promises.
The GOP should be concerned as this poll highlights that 67% of millennials and Generation Z dislike the president. Also, 18-34 year-olds really do care about tolerance and diversity, demanding such behavior in officials. This is especially reflected in the younger 4th Congressional District and its lower acceptance for Trump. However, most older Utahns support the president — and they vote.
Although the poll provides a path, implementation is difficult. Republicans who stiff-arm Trump face outcry from the right as will Democrats confront criticism when maintaining distance from the other presidential candidate.
Trump wins Utah again, while smart politicians in tougher races follow the map, thereby deftly avoiding land mines and shrewdly maneuvering through obstacles.
Webb: Trump isn’t going to lose Utah to one of the very liberal Democratic presidential candidates, but he also isn’t going to be any real help, and he might hurt, in the 4th Congressional District where Republicans hope to defeat Democratic Rep. Ben McAdams .
Attitudes about Trump basically split three ways: His base absolutely loves him and will stick with him no matter what he does. They love his political incorrectness, his brashness, his certainty, and especially his willingness to take on the news media, the establishment, illegal immigrants and foreign countries.
Another group absolutely hates everything about Trump. They hate his personality, his policies, his cockiness, his arrogance. To them he’s a juvenile delinquent.
A final group is in the middle (me among them). Most of the people in this group don’t like Trump’s personality, his incessant tweeting, his name-calling and the way he mocks other people. But they do like most of his policies, his economic success and many like his tougher stance against America’s adversaries and trade fairness.
I don’t believe Trump can win only with his base. But he seems not interested in appealing to anyone else.
For those of us in the middle group, the choice comes down to whether we like Trump’s policies enough to vote for him, despite his character flaws, or will we take a chance on an arch-liberal whose answer to every problem is more government and higher taxes.
While most Utahns were celebrating Pioneer Day last Wednesday, former special counsel Robert Mueller testified before two congressional committees. Does anyone in the Beehive State care?
Pignanelli: Although a weird news junkie, even I could not stomach the entire ordeal, and often switched channels for glimpses of parade floats and bands. Mueller’s testimony did not provide any clear winners and losers. One media pundit conveniently observed Mueller was neither a punching bag nor a pawn.
Muller is a decent person who cares about his country and holds concerns about foreign governments corrupting our election process. Hopefully leaders take heed. Otherwise, the greatest tragedy is allowing these attacks on America to continue.
Webb: Here’s how to reelect Trump: Continue investigating every detail of his life. Keep holding hearings. Start impeachment proceedings. Ignore the problems facing the country and obsess about Trump. Make every news story every day about Trump, Trump, Trump.
Voters aren’t paying attention. Voters are much more concerned about health care, immigration, the economy and taxes.
Attempting to leverage frustration with politics, the United Utah Party launched an initiative petition to impose term limits on state officials. Does this effort have a chance?
Pignanelli: The biggest lesson learned from the unprecedented number of initiatives filed in 2018 is success depends upon money — mostly from out of state. Unless these resources materialize, this effort gains little traction. Further, Utah defeated the 1994 Term Limit Initiative and no one raised a peep when the statutory limitations were erased nine years later.
Webb: Successful or not, proposing a ballot measure is a good strategy to draw attention to the United Utah Party and give it a reason to exist. The party can ride this ballot proposal, get some visibility and make it an election issue if they can get it on the ballot.

Investigan a ex policía por heridas en cuello de Jeffrey Epstein, y a su novia como cómplice de sexo con menores

Texto completo: Es posible que las heridas en el cuello que llevaron al detenido magnate Jeffrey Epstein al hospital, hayan sido causadas por otros preso y no un intento de suicidio o de llamar la atención para que le aprueban la libertad bajo fianza, como se había sugerido inicialmente.
La noche del martes Epstein (66) fue descubierto en el suelo por guardias del Centro Correccional Metropolitano, en el Bajo Manhattan, donde está recluido sin fianza por cargos de tráfico sexual. Lo llevaron a un hospital por lesiones en el cuello y al regresar a prisión fue puesto en vigilancia suicida, informó New York Post.
La policía ha interrogado como sospechoso del posible ataque a Nicholas Tartaglione (51), un ex policía arrestado y acusado en 2016 por el asesinato de cuatro mexicanos en Chester (NY), en medio de una conspiración por narcotráfico.
“Las marcas son más consistentes con ser estrangulado que con colgarse”, dijo una fuente. Las especulaciones se mantienen porque Epstein se ha negado a cooperar con los investigadores.
Tartaglione afirmó que no escuchó nada y que no fue responsable de las lesiones de Epstein, según los reportes.
Epstein está alojado en la unidad “10 South”, un bloque de seis celdas conocido como el “ala del terror” porque es donde se encuentran los presos federales más peligrosos de la ciudad , incluidos presuntos terroristas.
Allí estuvo alojado hasta ser sentenciado la semana pasada el narcotraficante Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán. “El lugar es tan asqueroso”, había denunciado el abogado del mexicano, Jeffrey Lichtman.
Al mismo tiempo, la relación personal de muchos años de la británica Ghislaine Maxwell con Epstein ha generado dudas sobre lo que ella pudo haber sabido sobre las denuncias de tráfico sexual .
Ahora, miles de páginas de documentos sellados derivados de su relación están a punto de hacerse públicas, anunció The New York Times.
Fotografías de Maxwell con diversas personalidades han circulado por años en la prensa, incluyendo su presencia en primera fila en la boda de Chelsea Clinton en 2010.
Su papá, el ex presidente Bill Clinton, fue uno de los primeros en distanciarse de Epstein a través de un comunicado luego de su detención el 6 de julio en el aeropuerto Teterboro (NJ), al regresar de París en un vuelo privado.
También ha salido a flote la vieja amistad del acusado con Donald Trump. El escándalo de abuso sexual de menores ya causó la renuncia del Secretario del Trabajo, Alex Acosta, el único latino en el gabinete, debido a que fue él quien, siendo fiscal en Miami, negoció el acuerdo de culpabilidad en 2008 que mantuvo a Epstein libre hasta ahora.
En medio del escándalo, trascendió que NYPD también falló en supervisar la libertad condicional de Epstein.

Ghislaine Maxwell was Jeffrey Epstein’s girlfriend. She was also called his “fixer.” One of his accusers called her his madam. And now with Epstein under federal indictment, there are mounting questions about what she knew about his alleged predation. https://t.co/FF8eL2rhG3

Texto completo: Es posible que las heridas en el cuello que llevaron al detenido magnate Jeffrey Epstein al hospital, hayan sido causadas por otros preso y no un intento de suicidio o de llamar la atención para que le aprueban la libertad bajo fianza, como se había sugerido inicialmente.
La noche del martes Epstein (66) fue descubierto en el suelo por guardias del Centro Correccional Metropolitano, en el Bajo Manhattan, donde está recluido sin fianza por cargos de tráfico sexual. Lo llevaron a un hospital por lesiones en el cuello y al regresar a prisión fue puesto en vigilancia suicida, informó New York Post.
La policía ha interrogado como sospechoso del posible ataque a Nicholas Tartaglione (51), un ex policía arrestado y acusado en 2016 por el asesinato de cuatro mexicanos en Chester (NY), en medio de una conspiración por narcotráfico.
“Las marcas son más consistentes con ser estrangulado que con colgarse”, dijo una fuente. Las especulaciones se mantienen porque Epstein se ha negado a cooperar con los investigadores.
Tartaglione afirmó que no escuchó nada y que no fue responsable de las lesiones de Epstein, según los reportes.
Epstein está alojado en la unidad “10 South”, un bloque de seis celdas conocido como el “ala del terror” porque es donde se encuentran los presos federales más peligrosos de la ciudad , incluidos presuntos terroristas.
Allí estuvo alojado hasta ser sentenciado la semana pasada el narcotraficante Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán. “El lugar es tan asqueroso”, había denunciado el abogado del mexicano, Jeffrey Lichtman.
Al mismo tiempo, la relación personal de muchos años de la británica Ghislaine Maxwell con Epstein ha generado dudas sobre lo que ella pudo haber sabido sobre las denuncias de tráfico sexual .
Ahora, miles de páginas de documentos sellados derivados de su relación están a punto de hacerse públicas, anunció The New York Times.
Fotografías de Maxwell con diversas personalidades han circulado por años en la prensa, incluyendo su presencia en primera fila en la boda de Chelsea Clinton en 2010.
Su papá, el ex presidente Bill Clinton, fue uno de los primeros en distanciarse de Epstein a través de un comunicado luego de su detención el 6 de julio en el aeropuerto Teterboro (NJ), al regresar de París en un vuelo privado.
También ha salido a flote la vieja amistad del acusado con Donald Trump. El escándalo de abuso sexual de menores ya causó la renuncia del Secretario del Trabajo, Alex Acosta, el único latino en el gabinete, debido a que fue él quien, siendo fiscal en Miami, negoció el acuerdo de culpabilidad en 2008 que mantuvo a Epstein libre hasta ahora.

Texto completo: René Samaniego, detective de NYPD que fungía como el principal cómplice en la red de prostitución y apuestas de su colega Ludwig Paz y su esposa dominicana Arelis Peralta, fue sentenciado ayer a una pena de 2 a 6 años de prisión.
Los tres ya se habían declarado culpables por el caso, que involucraba a más policías y operaciones en al menos ocho burdeles y salones de belleza en Brooklyn, Queens y Long Island, en uno de los peores escándalos policiales en los últimos años en Nueva York.
Samaniego (44) cobraba $500 dólares semanales por el soborno, detalló The New York Times.
Ronald Hollie, juez de la Corte Suprema de Queens, impuso la sentencia luego de que el ex policía se declarara culpable de dos cargos de intento de corrupción empresarial.
“Este acusado tomó un juramento para proteger y servir cuando entró al NYPD, en lugar de ello tristemente, escogió la ambición sobre el honor”, dijo el fiscal asistente John Ryan, citado por NY1 Noticias. “Ensució la placa que portaba para llenar sus bolsillos con efectivo”.
Samaniego fue acusado de ayudar al ex detective Paz, avisándole cuando habría operaciones de la policía en los lugares donde funcionaba la operación de prostitución y juego ilegal.
“Este oficial disminuyó el trabajo de decenas de miles de otros policías honestos y éticos”, denunció el comisionado James O’Neill.

Border pollution report award finalist

Texto completo: The series "Poisoned Cities, Deadly Border" has been recognized as a finalist for the 2019 John B. Oakes Award for Distinguished Environmental Journalism.
The four-part series by The Desert Sun chronicles how lax regulations and growing industrialization led to rampant pollution in the Mexicali area, creating an environmental and public health crisis on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border.
Reporter Ian James and photojournalist Zoë Meyers spent nearly two years investigating how government officials from both the United States and Mexico allowed the region's air, water and ground to suffer from dumping and toxic pollution.
They traveled regularly to the California-Mexico border from The Desert Sun's newsroom in Palm Springs, and collaborated with journalists at The Arizona Republic and USA TODAY to produce the project, which featured an online design with multiple entry points, including interactives, video and VR.
The series, published in English and Spanish, examined how toxic pollution hurt people on both sides of the border, from air so contaminated it kills people to a river of sewage that flows from Mexico into California. The reporters also offered 10 steps Mexican and U.S. government agencies could take to reduce pollution on the border.
Go to environment.azcentral.com to read the series.
Judges for the Oakes Award commended the reporting team for an "evocative, immersive and deeply reported series and the changes it has spurred for the people living along the California-Mexico border."
After the investigation was published in December 2018, California announced plans to hire a new regulator to oversee border pollution and deliver 50 air quality monitors to better track pollution in Mexicali. Lawmakers have also cited the series in pushing for additional funding to clean up and protect the New River.
The Columbia Journalism School presents the Oakes Award annually for news reporting that makes an exceptional contribution to the public's understanding of environmental issues.
In June, "Poisoned Cities, Deadly Border" also won the Society of Professional Journalists' New America Award. The award honors journalism that sheds light on important issues of immigrant or ethnic communities in the United States.
The winner of the Oakes Award was InsideClimate News, for the report "Harvesting Peril: Extreme Weather and Climate Change." The Oakes Award also recognized ProPublica and The New York Times Magazine as a finalist for "Fuel to the Fire."
Environmental news coverage on azcentral.com and in The Arizona Republic is supported by a grant from the Nina Mason Pulliam Charitable Trust. For more stories visit environment.azcentral.com or follow OurGrandAZ on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Texto completo: U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a South Florida Democrat, and U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, want President Donald Trump to take action to bolster election security in time to protect the 2020 elections.
They called integrity of the nation's elections "a matter of great national security."
"It is your responsibility, as commander in chief, to address the threat of cyber-attacks, influence operations, disinformation campaigns, and other activities that undermine the security and integrity of U.S. democratic institutions," they wrote in letter to Trump. "We implore you to treat this issue with seriousness and with the utmost sense of urgency and concern that it demands."
The letter, dated Wednesday and publicly released by the members of Congress on Thursday afternoon, also excoriates Trump for ignoring the problem.
"Although individual agencies are working to do their party to prevent another attack on our elections - by all accounts - you are not," they wrote. They said the president's lack of interest or action on the issue is "deeply troubling and suggests a total disregard of a proven threat to our national security and our democratic system of government."
The New York Times reported in April that former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen had tried to get the White House interested in preparing for Russian attempts to interfere in the 2020 election but was told by Trump's acting chief of staff not to bring the subject up in front of the president.
Wasserman Schultz and Thompson asked Trump to designate a point person at the White House to coordinate efforts to defend against the kind of foreign interference that marked the 2016 presidential election.
Extensive evidence gathered by former Special Counsel Robert Mueller, congressional committees and news organizations shows that Russia engaged in widespread efforts to manipulate public opinion.
The issue received renewed attention in Florida after Muller's report was released, and the FBI in May confirmed to Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Florida congressional delegation that voter registration records - but not voting systems - in two Florida counties were hacked by the Russians in 2016. The elected officials said the names of the counties are classified, and they couldn't identify them. Elections officials in Broward, Palm Beach and Miami-Dade counties have said repeatedly it wasn't them.
Russian hackers were responsible for stealing emails from the Democratic National Committee and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman. The emails were published by WikiLeaks and often were timed to hurt the Democrats.
Wasserman Schultz, who represents parts of Broward and Miami-Dade counties, was a casualty of the Russian hacking and email publication. She was chairman of the Democratic National Committee until emails stolen by the Russians showed some party staffers favored Clinton while Bernie Sanders was still a contender for the Democratic presidential nomination. That produced a firestorm that led her to announce her resignation as national chairwoman on the eve of the 2016 convention.
Thompson is a Mississippi Democrat.

Texto completo: The mountains above El Valle amass columns of clouds, but in a low-lying pasture near the home of author William deBuys, 70, four horses graze peacefully, oblivious to the darkening sky. The whir of activity on the sleepy afternoon I show up for an interview concentrates around the bird feeders.
We watch broad-tailed hummingbirds vie for airspace. "When I first arrived here in the mid-'70s," says deBuys, "I'd hear cordilleran flycatchers singing all day long. This whole area of sky filled with violet-green swallows and nighthawks. Now, nearly none."
It's a somber note with which to begin the interview, one that will sound like distant thunder throughout the conversation.
"The rufous hummingbird is usually here by Fourth of July," he continues. "I haven't seen it yet."
DeBuys, who once served as director of the North Carolina Nature Conservancy and in the early aughts as chair of the Valles Caldera Trust, resides and writes full time in El Valle, a mountain village some 40 miles southeast of Taos. His writing studio was the first structure he built on the property. He constructed several more, including a garage, barn, toolshed and his present residence.
"I only built this house in 2007. Moved in at the very end of the year. And began to enjoy this incredible, modern innovation called indoor plumbing," he says with a chuckle. "I wanted the house to look like it had been here for a while and to blend into the landscape."
Inside we sit at a hefty, rough-hewn table with a view of the portal and the hummingbird feeder. So far, no rufous.
We're chatting about the summer writing workshop he taught (and I attended) July 12 at the third annual Taos Writers Conference, presented by SOMOS, the literary society of Taos.
DeBuys was a thoughtful facilitator and careful listener who sprinkled a generous helping of writing tips with self-deprecating humor. During the workshop he joked about his "crackpot theories," so now I ask him to elaborate on what he meant by "the fractal nature" of good writing.
"It has to do with the importance of the end of the sentence, end of paragraph, end of chapter, etc. They all resonate in different ways, so the careful writer will pay special attention to those placements, to what goes into those endings.
"And the beginnings, of course, are the second most important. And those bear close attention at all those different scales as well. And frankly, what we didn't get into in the class is the idea that the same applies to turns and pivots of action and logic, to contradictions or things that don't add up, to little mysteries, confusions, places where answers are lacking. Doubt draws us in."
DeBuys has authored nine books, including "River of Traps: A New Mexico Mountain Life," co-authored with photographer Alex Harris and a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in general nonfiction in 1991. It was subsequently reissued in 2007 by Trinity University Press. He received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2008.
His first book, "Enchantment and Exploitation: The Life and Hard Times of a New Mexico Mountain Range" published in 1985, launched a successful writing career. He cracks a one-liner about the 2015 revised and expanded edition: "It's very rare in life you get a chance to correct the mistakes you made 30 years ago."
His has been a life enjoyed outdoors. Recently, he floated with a group of friends 90 miles along the Hulahula River, which flows due north from the Brooks Range in Alaska and out into the Arctic Ocean.
"Quite an adventure," he says, shaking his head. "We were in the midst of the migration of portions of the Porcupine caribou herd. Saw thousands and thousands of caribou, also wolves, Dall sheep, grizzly, arctic fox. An epic journey. Tundra country is so beautiful."
Beautiful and under threat. Here are the opening sentences from his op-ed about that trip, published July 19, in The New York Times : "Many junkies, before hitting bottom, stoop low enough to steal their mothers' jewels. That's what's happening at a national scale on the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska."
His group journeyed right through the portion of the refuge that Congress authorized for drilling in a rider to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Yet, he remains hopeful the rush to drill will be slowed down by litigation and that the pro-drilling forces will be voted out of office.
Will he assume a role, either through writing or speaking, in the 2020 election cycle? "I'll have my oar in the water," he says, then gets up, walks to the sink for a glass of water.
That's when I notice a glint of copper near the feeder.
"The rufous hummingbird has arrived," I chirp.
"And so it has," he adds, staring out the window with an air of contemplation.
I tell what little I know of the rufous: "For its size, it has the longest migratory route of any bird, including the arctic tern."
In the Sonoran Desert of Mexico and the United States, its very survival is under siege by development, loss of habitat and climate change. This long-distance traveler calls to mind another kind of migration -- a human migration -- along the southern border. DeBuys writes about the work of volunteers and the humanitarian group No More Death in "A Great Aridness: Climate Change and the Future of the American Southwest" (2011).
"That book," says deBuys, "deals with climate change. I'm trying to complete the trilogy that consists of 'A Great Aridness' and the book that came after, 'The Last Unicorn,' which is about extinction fundamentally. And now I'm trying to write about what we know about the very great losses being suffered by the diversity and the beauty of the world. Then, what do we do, how do we carry on, without giving up, without despairing, without shutting down?
"The narrative spine of the story comes from two long expeditions I was on in the Himalaya in 2016 and 2018 as part of a medical expedition providing primary medical care to a very remote area of Nepal."
After a pause, he adds: "It's a bit of a struggle. Every good book is."

Dr. Leana Wen's departure from Planned Parenthood exposes the organization's true identity

Resumen: Leana Wen's firing captures what pro-life activists have been arguing for years, that Planned Parenthood cares only about maintaining abortion clinics

Texto completo: There are public relations problems and there are public relations crises. Then there is what Planned Parenthood is experiencing with the departure of its former president, Dr. Leana Wen.
Wen, the first doctor to run the abortion chain in nearly five decades, is not going quietly into the night. Rather, she is essentially blowing the whistle on the organization on her way out the door, making her the most senior staff member ever to publicly duke it out with the billion dollar behemoth.
Wen smartly got ahead of the narrative, laying down rhetorical stakes in a tweet immediately after news broke of her firing. She and Planned Parenthood had "philosophical differences. " She wanted Planned Parenthood to prioritize women’s health. The board did not.
In a piece for the Sunday pages of The New York Times, Wen expanded on what she meant by women’s health. Planned Parenthood has a duty, she argued, “to increase care for women before, during and after pregnancies,” care such as mental health care for women suffering from postpartum depression or treatment for pregnant women struggling with addiction. Though I am an ardent anti-abortion activist, I found myself admiring Wen for what is clearly a genuine commitment to providing care and treatment to women as a whole.
Women's health as a front, not an aim
Here’s why I also admire Wen. As she makes clear, the board that hired her tasked her with refashioning the organization — beleaguered by things like prior President Cecile Richards' highly publicized admission that Planned Parenthood doesn’t offer mammograms, or campaigns catching them offering ultrasounds only to confirm fetal gestational age for an abortion — as one that is about women’s health, not just abortion advocacy.
Abortion access: Texas made it hard to have my abortion. With Roe at stake, I’m going home to expand access.
With a wink and nod of course.
No doubt what the board really meant was Wen should pretend Planned Parenthood care about the full spectrum of women’s health, not actually start implementing programs that amounted to “mission creep,” as anonymous staff called it in The Times. Board members wanted to use Wen’s medical credentials and obvious passion for women’s health care to prop up the sagging myth that Planned Parenthood is more than just the most well-oiled abortion lobbying machine in the world. No doubt Wen figured it out, and refused to play along.
Planned Parenthood is vulnerable
Then came the biggest legal and financial blow dealt to Planned Parenthood perhaps ever. Undoubtedly, it was expecting the new regulation from the Department of Health and Human Services requiring family planning clinics that receive taxpayer dollars not to promote abortion as a method of family planning to be struck down in court. Shockingly, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the rule, meaning that tens of millions of Planned Parenthood dollars, in addition to its entire business model, are now on the line.
The day after the Trump administration announced it would begin enforcing the rule immediately, Wen was out.
Coincidence? Hardly.
Commonality across politics: I'm pro-life, but I have a lot in common with Planned Parenthood's Cecile Richards
Wen’s departure has left Planned Parenthood perhaps more exposed than ever. She didn’t just ding the organization for failing to prioritize women’s health. She irreversibly exploded the myth that comprehensive women’s health is something it cares about. The proof is Planned Parenthood's willingness to take the extreme public heat for firing a passionate young doctor, and a minority immigrant at that, eight months into the job because the board so badly wants to protect access to abortion and little else. That board members were OK with being exposed as a pure political advocacy group despite the public relations toll it would bear belies just how extreme they have become.
Wen forced out for moderation
Wen also revealed her willingness and interest in working with those who disagreed about abortion. Though her goal was, as she put it, “to normalize abortion care as the health care it is,” she also wanted to help find “space for those of us in the middle to come together around shared values. ”
The problem is that, for pro-lifers, there is no middle ground on abortion. It is, every single time, the unjust and violent taking of a life from the most vulnerable class of human beings. We will never stop working until it is not just illegal but unthinkable. An important part of that work is exposing Planned Parenthood for what it really is, a taxpayer-funded abortion political advocacy group and abortion chain. By firing its best hope at masking that reality, Planned Parenthood is now doing our work for us.

Texas bucks downward trend in overdose deaths

Texto completo: Drug overdose deaths are on track to fall in the United States for the first time since the opioid crisis began in 1990, preliminary government data finds. But in Texas, deaths are expected to increase yet again, something addiction experts attribute to problems with methamphetamine and cocaine in the state.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is still counting overdose numbers from last year, but according to provisional data released last week, it expects to tally 68,557 deaths in 2018, a 5% drop from the previous year, when 72,000 overdose deaths were recorded.
The numbers could still change between now and December, but public health officials are hopeful the tides are at last turning in the opioid crisis. They attribute the drop, which is the first in nearly 30 years, to the Trump administration's multibillion-dollar investment in drug treatment and recovery services, as well decreases in the number of opioid prescriptions.
"America’s united efforts to curb opioid use disorder and addiction are working," U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said last week in a statement. "Lives are being saved, and we’re beginning to win the fight against this crisis."
Some of the largest drops in overdose deaths are expected in Rust Belt states like Pennsylvania and Ohio that have been hit hardest by the opioid crisis, with declines in those states expected to be around 20% and 22%, respectively.
Meanwhile, states in the Southwest, including Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California, are still projected to see slight increases in overdose deaths, something University of Texas addiction researcher Jane Maxwell attributes to the methamphetamine and cocaine problems in those states.
Compounding the problem is the lack of effective treatments for those addictions, Maxwell said. Opioid addiction, however, can be managed effectively with medications like buprenorphine and methadone. Opioid overdoses also can be reversed with the drug naloxone.
"That really worries me because, in Texas, it’s methamphetamine and cocaine that are the leading causes for poison center calls, for deaths, for treatment admissions and for toxicology lab identifications," Maxwell said.
Increases in overdose deaths in Texas, though, are projected to be much smaller than in previous years, up only 1.5% from 2017 to 2018, compared to the previous year when they increased by 4% and the year before by 7.4%. The CDC expects to record 3,028 overdose deaths in Texas in 2018, up from 2,984 in 2017. It did not release the figures by substance for the state, which would have helped determine why Texas is still seeing increases.
Maxwell did say that this is the earliest she has seen the CDC numbers released, which shows the efforts states are making at improving data collection in response to the opioid crisis.
Texas has received criticism for its data collection, with public health officials saying they can't accurately gauge the number of overdose deaths in the state, because only 13 of 254 counties have medical examiners trained to recognize them. Justices of the peace often record the causes of death and can miss the signs of an overdose, experts say.
"It’s been really important to know what the numbers are because there has been so much federal money put into it so they need to be able to show they have made a change," Maxwell said.
Health officials were quick to say that the drop in overdose deaths does not signal a cause to celebrate just yet. If the figures are correct, the number of drug overdose deaths in 2018 will still exceed the nation's peak yearly historical deaths from car wrecks, AIDS or guns, the New York Times reported. Further, overdose deaths from synthetic opioids like fentanyl and stimulants like methamphetamine and cocaine are still trending upward, the data find. Missouri is expected to see the biggest increase in overdose deaths, up 16% from 2017 to 2018.
"While the declining trend of overdose deaths is an encouraging sign, by no means have we declared victory against the epidemic or addiction in general," Azar said. "This crisis developed over two decades and it will not be solved overnight."
Texas has received $176 million in federal funds since 2017 to combat its own problems with opioids in the state, which, according to a March report, has given nearly 6,000 people access to substance abuse treatment and saved more than 225 lives. In that time, the state has also seen a nearly 100% increase in the number of people with opioid use problems who have gained access to medication-assisted treatment. The state's grant funds are set to run out in 2021.

Which Disneyland attraction has the most riders since Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge opened? You’ll be surprised

Texto completo: You’d be forgiven for assuming the new Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run attraction has had the most riders of any Disneyland attraction since Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge opened — but you’d be off by a long shot.
Disneyland announced last week that 1 million riders have ridden the Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run attraction since Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge debuted. That statistical peek behind the curtain tells us a lot about the ride capacity of the E-Ticket attraction and the number of people visiting the new themed land .

The Ridgeway family of Ocean Springs, Miss. were recognized as the 1 millionth riders of Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run on July 16, according to Disneyland.
Touring Plans, which uses big data and statistical analysis to calculate daily crowd sizes and ride wait times at theme parks, says that based on the available information Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run has averaged about 27,000 riders per day since May 31, approximately 76% of the attraction’s ride capacity.
That pales in comparison to It’s a Small World (57,000 riders per day) and Pirates of the Carribbean (55,000) during the same period and is just short of Big Thunder Mountain (35,000), Hyperspace Mountain (31,000) and Indiana Jones Adventure (31,000), according to Touring Plans estimates.
You read that right: The half century-old Small World has had way more riders than the 2-month-old Smugglers Run.
But of course, Small World and Pirates are high-capacity people-eater rides that vacuum up visitors and often still manage to maintain relatively short wait times.
Disneyland officials said Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run has performed extremely well with very little downtime during the million-rider run thanks to the hard work and dedication of cast members and Walt Disney Imagineering, the creative arm of the company.
“Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run is among our highest rated attractions and we are thrilled by the guest reviews we have received since opening,” Disneyland officials said in a statement.

Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge officially debuted on May 31 after a series of employee and media previews. Disneyland instituted a reservation-only period for Galaxy’s Edge that ran through June 23. Beginning June 24, the new Star Wars land was opened to all visitors. A virtual queue boarding pass system put in place to manage crowds has been rarely used.
While the million-rider mark sounds impressive, other Disneyland attractions likely outpaced Smugglers Run during the same period.
During Smugglers million-rider run, Small World and Pirates could have hit the same mark operating at approximately 45% of their hourly capacity while Big Thunder could have done it at 70% capacity and Hyperspace Mountain at 80%, according to Touring Plans.
Smuggler’s Run can accommodate up to 1,800 riders per hour, according to the New York Times.
The average wait time for Smugglers Run dropped from 47 minutes on opening day to 22 minutes on June 23, according to Touring Plans data. The average Smugglers Run wait time spiked to 59 minutes on June 24 — the first day guests could enter the land without a reservation — and reached a high of 89 minutes over the Fourth of July holiday weekend.
Using Smugglers Run ridership as a guide, Touring Plans estimates that Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge has attracted between 2.7 million and 5 million visitors since opening day.
“My strong suspicion is that the number is toward the bottom end of that range based on the low wait times we saw throughout June,” said Len Testa, president of Touring Plans, an online subscription service that lets users create custom theme park itineraries.
Disneyland rarely if ever talks about attendance numbers or ridership figures.
Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run is the lone anchor attraction in Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge until the Rise of the Resistance dark ride debuts on Jan. 17, six months behind schedule.
To the surprise of many theme park observers, Disneyland has experienced lighter than usual summertime traffic since Galaxy’s Edge opened May 31.

Resumen: The Federal Trade Commission says Facebook will be a safer social network due to the agency's $5 billion settlement over privacy violations.

Texto completo: Facebook must pay a record-breaking $5 billion fine as part of a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, by far the largest penalty ever imposed on a company for violating consumers' privacy rights.
Facebook also agreed to adopt new protections for the data users share on the social network and to measures that limit the power of CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
"We've agreed to pay a historic fine, but even more important, we're going to make some major structural changes to how we build products and run this company, Zuckerberg posted on Facebook.
Under the settlement, which concludes a year-long investigation prompted by the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal, the social networking giant must expand its privacy protections across Facebook itself, as well as on Instagram and WhatsApp. It must also adopt a corporate system of checks and balances to remain compliant, according to the FTC order. Facebook must also maintain a data security program, which includes protections of information such as users' phone numbers.
Facebook-FTC deal: Settlement means a $5B fine for social network, but not much on face for users
Goodbye to Apple's iPhone 6: So now what smartphone should I buy as a budget option?
The company separately agreed to pay $100 million to settle data misuse charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
"Public companies must accurately describe the material risks to their business," Stephanie Avakian, co-director of the SEC's Enforcement Division said in a statement. "As alleged in our complaint, Facebook presented the risk of misuse of users data as hypothetical when they knew user data had in fact been misused. "
Facebook's privacy practices have long been in the government crosshairs and under the scrutiny of consumer watchdog groups, not all of which are satisfied with the terms of Wednesday's agreement.
Zuckerberg has appeared in congressional hearings after the Cambridge Analytica scandal surfaced. Facebook suspended the data analysis and political consulting firm in March 2018 for improper access to user data. That move came after The New York Times and U. K. 's The Observer said Cambridge Analytica had access to 50 million profiles and used them to target ads during the 2016 presidential election campaign. At the time, Facebook said it knew the firm had violated its policies by obtaining and secretly passing on the data, which users had agreed to share with a personality prediction app.
The separate SEC complaint also dates back to Facebook's response to Cambridge Analytica. The allegation, which Facebook while agreeing to the final $100 million judgment neither admits nor denies, is that in 2014 and 2015, Cambridge Analytica paid an academic researcher to "collect and transfer data from Facebook to create personality scores for approximately 30 million Americans" and that Facebook discovered this misuse in 2015 but failed to correctly disclose it for more than two years.
The $5-billion FTC fine is nearly 20 times greater than the largest privacy or data security penalty that has ever been assessed worldwide and is one of the largest imposed by the U. S. government for any violation.
As part of the settlement, the FTC's order also curbs Zuckerberg's oversight in privacy and security matters, with the requirement Facebook create a new privacy committee with independent board members who cannot be removed without a two-thirds shareholder vote. Zuckerberg and designated compliance officers each must submit individual quarterly compliance reports to the FTC.

Equifax-FTC settlement: What does Equifax's $700M settlement over its data breach mean for you?
Additionally, a third-party assessor will monitor Facebook's privacy-related decisions going forward.
The commission approved the settlement with a 3-2 vote, with the dissenting commissioners wanting tougher action taken against Zuckerberg.
But the order achieves more than the FTC could have achieved by going to court, says chairman Joe Simons and the commissioners Noah Joshua Phillips and Christine Wilson, who approved the settlement in their lengthy statement.
"The Order significantly diminishes Mr. Zuckerberg’s power – something no government agency, anywhere in the world, has thus far accomplished," the statement says. "The provisions of this Order extinguish the ability of Mr. Zuckerberg to make privacy decisions unilaterally by also vesting responsibility and accountability for those decisions within business units, DCOs (digital compliance officers), and the privacy committee. "
The settlement hasn't placated Facebook's harshest critics.
"A penalty that doesn’t require real structural changes, that financially is a drop in the bucket, and that appears to absolve Facebook of any liability over additional abuses like tricking kids into in-app purchases, is a get out jail free card for Facebook and sends a signal to the rest of the industry that business as usual is acceptable," said Common Sense CEO James Steyer in a statement. "This punishment simply does not fit the crime and we strongly encourage policymakers to consider this just the very beginning of a long way we have to go to hold Facebook and the tech industry accountable for protecting the privacy of users, especially young people. "
Consumer Reports President and CEO Marta Tellado, added, “As expected, the size of the settlement is historic, but these attempts to hold Facebook accountable are not enough to make a real difference. With a weak and under-resourced FTC, and a glaring need for far more comprehensive privacy laws, Congress must raise the standards for consumers and hold Big Tech accountable. "
Similarly, earlier this week, the FTC, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and 50 states and territories reached a settlement with credit-reporting company Equifax over allegations that it did not implement sufficient security measures to prevent a massive data breach. Equifax must pay at least $575 million and potentially as much as $700 million.
Previously, the FTC’s highest fines were to Google, which paid $22. 5 million in 2012 and Upromise, which paid $500,000 in 2017.
Facebook agreed to the settlement with the agency over allegations it broke a previous agreement over privacy protections.
The changes the company agreed to will likely make it take longer to bring new features to Facebook and its other products, Zuckerberg said.
But, it is the company's "responsibility to protect people's privacy. We already work hard to live up to this responsibility, but now we're going to set a completely new standard for our industry," Zuckerberg said. "Overall, these changes go beyond anything required under US law today. The reason I support them is that I believe they will reduce the number of mistakes we make and help us deliver stronger privacy protections for everyone. "
Facebook (FB) shares were down more than 1% in early trading to $199. 94; the ended the trading day up $2. 30 to close at $204. 66. Shares have risen 47% so far this year. The company is expected to release its second-quarter results after the market closes Wednesday.
The FTC also announced separate settlements with Cambridge Analytica, its former CEO Alexander Nix, and Aleksandr Kogan, an app developer who worked with the company. The actions allege Cambridge "used false and deceptive tactics to harvest personal information from millions of Facebook users" and all face restrictions on future business.

Texto completo: Several Lancaster County immigrant-run restaurants and food businesses were featured in a New York Times article on Tuesday.
The focus of the article was not Lancaster's classic Pennsylvania Dutch comfort food, but instead the increasing number of restaurants and food businesses in the county run by immigrants and refugees.
Lancaster ranks on Forbes list of best U.S. places to travel in 2019
"This small city, best-known for its Amish and Mennonite communities, is a welcoming home for immigrants, refugees and their cooking," the New York Times introduction to the story reads.
Several stands in Lancaster Central Market were mentioned, such as Rafiki Taste of Africa, Christina's Criollo, Havana Juice, and Guacamole Specialist. Restaurants Namaste, Issei, Sprout of Rice & Noodles, Rice & Noodles, Upohar, Grape Leaf Cafe, C Street Market, and Stroopie Co. are also mentioned.
One standholder, Omar al Saife, who runs Saife's Middle Eastern Food, mentioned the visit of Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai to Central Market.
Dozo by Issei Noodle opens in Central Market, one of several recent stand changes

The article was written by Priya Krishna, a freelance food writer who regularly contributes to the Times along with Bon Appetit, The New Yorker and other publications.
She also wrote for the influential Lucky Peach food magazine, which ceased publication in 2017.
Krishna visited Lancaster during the last couple of days of May, visiting local restaurants and researching the story.

Racism is no longer about race, it's about 'privilege'

Texto completo: Count on Charles Blow to always, always, always blurt out in the most indelicate way possible what Democrats and liberals in the media have been trying to do with at least some discretion.
Blow wrote Monday in the New York Times that it should be pro forma to call someone, anyone, a racist, regardless of whether it can be proven. So long as it feels right, the label should be generously applied.
“How is it that America insists on knowledge of the unknowable — what lurks in the heart — in order to assign the appellation?” pondered Blow. “Why are so many Americans insisting that racism requires conscious, malicious intent in order for the title to be earned?”
See, being called a “racist” should no longer demand any concrete proof that an individual believes one skin color is inherently superior to another. As described in my forthcoming book Privileged Victims: How America’s Culture Fascists Hijacked the Country and Elevated Its Worst People, Democrats and liberals in the news media believe that earning the “racist” label requires only an affirmative answer to three questions:
1. Is the target of the “racist” label white?
2. Is the target of the “racist” label deemed to benefit from any “privilege,” such as wealth or male heterosexuality?
3. Did the target of the “racist” label say anything at all, regardless of race, that could be construed as derogatory to an individual who is not white?
If each of those can be met with a yes, then the Democratic Party, the national news media, academia, and even Hollywood will feel well within their right to call a person “racist” or, at the least, strongly imply that a person is racist.
That is exactly what happened last week with the saturated coverage of President Trump and the “squad” of House Democrats. Trump questioned their patriotism and said they should leave the United States if they were so unhappy with it.
If there existed a liberal congressman with blonde hair, blue eyes, who spoke with a German accent, and who said the things about America that Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., has said, I’m certain Trump would have told that representative to “go back,” too.
But because Omar and the rest of the “squad” are nonwhite minorities, and because Trump is a wealthy, straight, white male, his comments were presumed as a fair mark for the “racist” label.
That is the same formula applied to the media’s coverage each and every time Trump directs an insult to any person who isn’t white.
Trump appears to hate former House Speaker Paul Ryan and he most certainly hates the late senator, John McCain. But they’re both white, so you’ll never see the “racist” accusation come up.
But when Trump’s ire is directed at Omar, Barack Obama, or even former White House official Omarosa Manigault? Racist!
It’s what animates news coverage of almost any conflict. Georgia state Rep. Erica Thomas, a black Democrat, accused a man of being inspired by Trump to make what she considered a racist remark toward her in a grocery store last weekend. "'Go Back to Where You Came From,' Georgia Lawmaker Says She Was Told," read the New York Times’ initial headline covering the story.
It would later turn out that the accused man is Cuban and also a Democrat.
But the national media at large don’t want the general public to catch on to their warped race logic. They want people to believe that there is no question as to whether Trump and his supporters are “racist” because after all, they wouldn’t say it if it weren’t expressly true.
Blow, on the other hand, wants the media to be more open about it.
He wrote that his “white colleagues in journalism,” including at the New York Times, “have done a tremendous injury to truth and honesty by providing the dangerous illusion that racism was hard to define and racists were hard to designate” in their apparent failure to more frequently call Trump a racist.
Give Blow credit. He’s at least up-front about needing no proof in order to call someone a racist.Story URLPhoto Caption:President Donald Trump arrives at the White House in Washington, Sunday, July 21, 2019, after spending the weekend at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J.

Coca-Cola stock boosted by sales of less sugary drinks Coca-Cola Co. shares surged to open at a record high Tuesday after its latest earnings got another boost from drinks with less sugar, more than offsetting the company's sluggish home market. It also updated its forecast for the full year, saying it now expects to post organic revenue growth of 5 percent, up from the 4 percent target it had issued earlier. Coke, as it tries to fend off Pepsi and other competitors, has been diversifying beyond sugary drinks. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
SHIPPING
UPS to begin Sunday pickups and deliveries next year United Parcel Service Inc. will begin Sunday pickup and delivery next year, joining competitor FedEx Corp., which announced the move to seven-day service in May. The two largest US couriers are under pressure to speed up deliveries as longtime customer Amazon.com Inc. morphs into a competitor by building out an overnight cargo-airline and ground-delivery service. UPS said the Sunday service would include SurePost, which are packages handed off to the US Postal Service. A new five-year union contract created a new class of driver that gave UPS the flexibility to deliver on weekends. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
RIDE HAILING
Lyft is making research data on self-driving technology public Lyft Inc. is making research data on self-driving technology available to the public in a bid to accelerate the development of robotic cars, which is seen as critical to the ride-hailing giant's future viability. Billing it as the largest such trove of data made available to researchers and rivals, Lyft said Tuesday the initiative includes more than 55,000 three-dimensional frames gleaned from cameras, lidar, and radar installed on its research fleet. It also includes data from highly detailed maps created by Lyft's test vehicles, which have been gathering data for nearly two years. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
TECHNOLOGY
NYC City Council to consider banning sale of cellphone location data New York's City Council will consider a bill to ban the sale of cellphone users' location data to marketers. The New York Times reported that the bill to be introduced Tuesday would make it illegal for cellphone companies and app developers to share location data with third parties while a customer's mobile device is within city limits. Telecommunications companies make billions of dollars a year selling customer location data to a variety of businesses. Mark Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, says the collection of location data "raises far-reaching privacy concerns." No federal law specifically protects cellphone customers' location data. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
MEDIA
Veteran NYT editor and reporter to lead The Forward The Forward, a 122-year-old Jewish publication, named a new leader of its newsroom Tuesday, appointing Jodi Rudoren, a veteran editor and reporter at The New York Times, as editor-in-chief. In hiring Rudoren, a former Jerusalem bureau chief for The Times, The Forward is taking another step past a tumultuous period. After moving from a weekly to a monthly schedule, the publication ceased its print edition this past spring. It also cut nearly 30 percent of its staff, including the previous editor-in-chief, Jane Eisner. Last week, the publisher and chief executive, Rachel Fishman Feddersen, announced the receipt of a $500,000 gift from Craig Newmark, the Craigslist founder and media philanthropist. Feddersen said the money would be used to revitalize The Forward's website and expand its readership. Rudoren, who joined The Times in 1998, is an associate managing editor at the paper, developing strategies to better engage readers. She is expected to start her new job in September. — NEW YORK TIMES
MOTORCYCLES
Harley-Davidson cuts outlook on weak global sales Harley-Davidson Inc. cut its full-year operating margin outlook and 2019 bike shipment forecast after weak global motorcycle sales and the impact of tariffs dented second quarter earnings. The Milwaukee-based manufacturer slashed its shipment forecast this year to 212,000 to 217,000, from a previous range of 217,000 to 222,000. Lower shipments also prompted it to reduce its expected 2019 operating margin on its motorcycles to 6 percent to 7 percent of revenue, from a previous 8 percent to 9 percent. Retail sales in the United States, its biggest market, fell 8 percent, the 10th consecutive quarter of declines, while worldwide sales dropped 8.4 percent. European deliveries, which had resisted steep declines in recent quarters, tumbled 12.5 percent. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
SOCIAL MEDIA
Snapchat recovers after improving mobile phone app Snapchat's growth accelerated after the social-media company rolled out an improved version of its Android mobile phone app, a sign of recovery after a rocky period. Snapchat, the messaging and photo-sharing app owned by Snap Inc., said an average of 203 million users logged in daily in the second quarter, well ahead of the 191.7 million estimated by analysts. In a statement on Tuesday, the Santa Monica, Calif.-based company also said sales in the period jumped 48 percent to $388 million, topping the $360.5 million average projection, according to a Bloomberg survey. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
TOYS
Hasbro profit up on sales of Avenger and Aladdin toys Hasbro Inc. reported second-quarter profit and sales that exceeded analysts' projections as shoppers snapped up Avengers and Aladdin toys following the latest blockbuster film releases. Shares surged to the highest intraday level on record. Revenue for the world's largest publicly traded toymaker was $984.5 million, the second straight quarterly gain. Chief financial officer Deborah Thomas reiterated that Hasbro expects to return to profitable growth in 2019. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
REAL ESTATE
Home sales fell in June US home sales tumbled 1.7 percent in June, with rising prices and a scarce supply locking out many Americans from ownership. The National Association of Realtors said Tuesday that homes were sold last month at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 5.27 million units. Sales have shriveled 2.2 percent over the past 12 months, despite such positive trends as a robust job market and falling mortgage rates. But home prices have been climbing faster than incomes for the past seven years. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
AUTOMOTIVE
Chinese company buys bigger share of Daimler Beijing Automotive Group said Tuesday that it would acquire a stake in the German carmaker Daimler, deepening the company's ties to China's vast but troubled car market and illustrating the country's growing clout in the global auto industry. The Beijing company said it would acquire shares and voting rights equal to a 5 percent stake in Daimler. The two companies are already partners in China, which has long required foreign automakers to strike comprehensive joint ventures with Chinese firms in order to make cars. — NEW YORK TIMES
FAST FOOD
Austrian McDonald's to paste over slogan that angered Italians The Austrian branch of McDonald's says it will paste over a slogan that drew the ire of Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini on posters in an Italy-themed ad campaign. McDonald's put up posters with the slogan "Fuer echte Mampfiosi," or "for real Mampfiosi" — the latter apparently a play on the German "Mampf," meaning "chow," and mafiosi. Salvini on Sunday tweeted a picture of a billboard with the comment: "Italians all Mafiosi? How sad." The company's Austrian branch said Tuesday the offending slogan will be pasted over with the words "Fuer echte Amici" (“for real friends") in the coming days. Marketing director Joerg Pizzera said that "of course it wasn't our intention to insult Italians in any way and we apologize to all those who feel insulted." — ASSOCIATED PRESS

Texto completo: U.S. numbers expected to drop, but not in Texas; experts attribute it to problems with meth, cocaine
Drug overdose deaths are on track to fall in the United States for the first time since the opioid crisis began in 1990, preliminary government data finds. But in Texas, deaths are expected to increase yet again, something addiction experts attribute to problems with methamphetamine and cocaine in the state.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is still counting overdose numbers from last year, but according to provisional data released last week, it expects to tally 68,557 deaths in 2018, a 5% drop from the previous year, when 72,000 overdose deaths were recorded.
The numbers could still change between now and December, but public health officials are hopeful the tides are at last turning in the opioid crisis. They attribute the drop, which is the first in nearly 30 years, to the Trump administration’s multibillion-dollar investment in drug treatment and recovery services, as well decreases in the number of opioid prescriptions.
“America’s united efforts to curb opioid use disorder and addiction are working,” U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said last week in a statement. “Lives are being saved, and we’re beginning to win the fight against this crisis.”
Some of the largest drops in overdose deaths are expected in Rust Belt states like Pennsylvania and Ohio that have been hit hardest by the opioid crisis, with declines in those states expected to be around 20% and 22%, respectively.
Meanwhile, states in the Southwest, including Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California, are still projected to see slight increases in overdose deaths, something University of Texas addiction researcher Jane Maxwell attributes to the methamphetamine and cocaine problems in those states.
Compounding the problem is the lack of effective treatments for those addictions, Maxwell said. Opioid addiction, however, can be managed effectively with medications like buprenorphine and methadone. Opioid overdoses also can be reversed with the drug naloxone.
“That really worries me because, in Texas, it’s methamphetamine and cocaine that are the leading causes for poison center calls, for deaths, for treatment admissions and for toxicology lab identifications,” Maxwell said.
Increases in overdose deaths in Texas, though, are projected to be much smaller than in previous years, up only 1.5% from 2017 to 2018, compared to the previous year when they increased by 4% and the year before by 7.4%. The CDC expects to record 3,028 overdose deaths in Texas in 2018, up from 2,984 in 2017. It did not release the figures by substance for the state, which would have helped determine why Texas is still seeing increases.
Maxwell did say that this is the earliest she has seen the CDC numbers released, which shows the efforts states are making at improving data collection in response to the opioid crisis.
Texas has received criticism for its data collection, with public health officials saying they can’t accurately gauge the number of overdose deaths in the state, because only 13 of 254 counties have medical examiners trained to recognize them. Justices of the peace often record the causes of death and can miss the signs of an overdose, experts say.
“It’s been really important to know what the numbers are because there has been so much federal money put into it so they need to be able to show they have made a change,” Maxwell said.
Health officials were quick to say that the drop in overdose deaths does not signal a cause to celebrate just yet. If the figures are correct, the number of drug overdose deaths in 2018 will still exceed the nation’s peak yearly historical deaths from car wrecks, AIDS or guns, the New York Times reported. Further, overdose deaths from synthetic opioids like fentanyl and stimulants like methamphetamine and cocaine are still trending upward, the data find. Missouri is expected to see the biggest increase in overdose deaths, up 16% from 2017 to 2018.
“While the declining trend of overdose deaths is an encouraging sign, by no means have we declared victory against the epidemic or addiction in general,” Azar said. “This crisis developed over two decades and it will not be solved overnight.”
Texas has received $176 million in federal funds since 2017 to combat its own problems with opioids in the state, which, according to a March report, has given nearly 6,000 people access to substance abuse treatment and saved more than 225 lives. In that time, the state has also seen a nearly 100% increase in the number of people with opioid use problems who have gained access to medication-assisted treatment. The state’s grant funds are set to run out in 2021.

Texto completo: Are Academy Award nominees Rooney Mara and Joaquin Phoenix engaged?
Us Weekly said Sunday that after "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo" star Mara, 34, was seen in May wearing an apparent engagement ring, the magazine had confirmed that she and Phoenix, 44, were affianced. The notoriously private couple, who have no known social media, have not commented.
Phoenix, younger brother of the late star River Phoenix, conceded to The New York Times Style Magazine in mid-2017 that he and Mara lived together in Los Angeles' Hollywood Hills neighborhood. This would be a first marriage for both.
Mara, younger sister of "Pose" and "House of Cards" actress Kate Mara, had appeared with Joaquin Phoenix in the 2013 film "Her" and the two became a couple three years later while shooting the movie "Mary Magdalene," said Us. That Biblical film, in which Rooney Mara played the title role and Phoenix played Jesus, was released overseas in 2018, and in U.S. theaters this April. The couple had made their red carpet debut at the Cannes Film Festival, in May 2017.
The actress, a scion of longtime New York Giants owners the Mara family, also starred with Phoenix in director Gus Van Sant's "Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot" (2018), and the two were among the narrators of the animal-agriculture documentary "Dominion" (2018).
Mara received Oscar nominations for "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo" (2011) and "Carol" (2015). Phoenix was nominated for "Gladiator" (2000), "Walk the Line" (2005) and "The Master" (2012).

The Mueller hearing is a mulligan for the media

Texto completo: In political media, as in love, there aren't many chances to correct a serious wrong.
But the news media will get just that on Wednesday when Robert S. Mueller III testifies before Congress, months after his long-awaited report on Donald Trump and possible Russian collusion to swing the 2016 election was competed.
Recall how gullible - and therefore misleading to the public - the news media was in March when Attorney General William Barr characterized the unreleased report in a four-page letter.
Coverage of that letter set in place an inaccurate narrative that has been almost impossible to dislodge.
Many news organizations, including some of the most prominent, took what Barr said at face value or mischaracterized the report's findings.
They essentially transmitted to the public - especially in all-important headlines and cable-news bulletins - what President Trump desperately wanted as the takeaway: No collusion; no obstruction.
Not only that, much of the media treatment failed to emphasize sufficiently that this was Barr's rendering of Mueller's conclusions.
And many early headlines and tweets went so far as to state that Mueller found no evidence of conspiracy, although that's not the whole story.
(While the report did not find sufficient evidence to bring charges of criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, it stated that Trump could not be exonerated of trying to obstruct the investigation itself. And it said that Mueller's conclusions were informed by his reasoning that Trump couldn't be indicted, at least partly because of a Justice Department opinion against prosecuting a current president.)
Yet here was the Philadelphia Inquirer's big, bold headline: "No evidence of conspiracy."
And here was a Bloomberg Markets tweet on March 25: "Now that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has found no evidence that President Trump colluded with Russia in the 2016 presidential campaign, the question becomes how much of the news is already baked into markets."
And the Wall Street Journal - like many others - apparently found no need in its main headline for attribution to Barr. It merely stated: "Mueller Finds No Collusion." (Barr was mentioned in a much smaller sub-headline.)
And the much-watched "60 Minutes" lead-in on CBS stated baldly that the report exonerated Trump.
The pro-Trump media went much further, of course. The New York Post, in huge red letters, wrote "No Collusion, No Obstruction" - and (implicitly) slammed the media: "Two Years of Hysteria End in Trump Vindication."
And Trump himself was trumpeting just that, and more, from every available rooftop.
All of this put Barr, as the New York Times's James Poniewozik put it, in the position of "the editor who writes the clickbait headline for all the browsers who never actually read the piece."
Those who read the full report, or detailed coverage of its findings, or even the more nuanced, less breathless press coverage, would have come away with a far different view.
As The Washington Post reported in late April, Mueller himself objected to the way Barr's letter failed to fully capture the "context, nature and substance" of his report.
But by then, it was far too late to change the hardened narrative, or to suggest a more accurate reading, though many have tried.
Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, in a MSNBC town hall, said she had three takeaways after an intensive, into-the-night reading of the full report:
"Part 1, a hostile foreign government attacked our 2016 elections for the purpose of getting Donald Trump elected. Part 2, then-candidate Donald Trump welcomed that help. And Part 3, when the federal government tried to investigate Part 1 and Part 2, Donald Trump as president delayed, deflected, moved, fired and did everything he could to obstruct justice."
It is true, of course, that Mueller's investigation did not bring what many of Trump's political foes - and some irresponsible media commentators - were hoping for: indictments of Trump or of his closest associates, possibly family members.
It's also true that some of the media reporting and commentary over the past two years has been over the top: far too speculative about what the report would say and result in.
On Wednesday, the national media will be in "flood the zone" mode as Mueller finally testifies.
Not only will the hearing be carried live on cable news but the major broadcast networks will set aside their regular schedules to do the same. And there will be special reports aplenty, as well as a great deal of newspaper and other text coverage.
Some damage is irretrievable. Many Americans have made up their minds already about Mueller's findings - and about Trump himself, no matter what he is or does.
And the hearing no doubt will be heavily politicized by questions and concurrent grandstanding from those posing the questions.
But hearing from Mueller directly is important, even if it does nothing other than reiterate what's in his report. And this new round of media coverage is important, too, if only because it can clarify and drive home what Mueller originally said.
There is an opportunity here to remove a false, cartoon version of Mueller's investigation and to substitute a well-rendered portrait of a subject that could hardly be more important to the country.

Texto completo: Whether you're a stage, TV or film fan, you'll be seeing a lot of actor Jonathan Groff between now and the end of the year.
Groff, the two-time Tony Award nominee who grew up in Ronks, will star in an off-Broadway production of the musical "Little Shop of Horrors" this fall, the New York Times reported today.
In "Little Shop," Groff, 34, a Conestoga Valley High School graduate, will play Seymour, the nebbishy plant shop employee and caretaker of the man-eating plant Audrey II.
Before that, the second season of "Mindhunter," the Netflix crime drama in which he stars as 1970s FBI profiler Holden Ford, premieres on the streaming channel Friday, Aug. 16.
And "Frozen" fans will hear Groff's voice on the big screen in November, as he reprises his role as Kristoff the mountain man in "Frozen II." The sequel to the Oscar-winning animated Disney film will hit theaters Nov. 22.
Revival
The "Little Shop" revival will start previews Sept. 17 and open Oct. 17 at the 270-seat Westside Theatre in New York's Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, the Times reported.
Groff, a two-time Tony Award nominee, will be directed in "Little Shop" by Michael Mayer, who directed Groff in his role as Melchior Gabor in the 2006 Broadway show "Spring Awakening."
Tony nominee Tammy Blanchard, who won an Emmy for her role as Judy Garland in "Life With Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows," will play Audrey, Seymour's love interest, the Times reported.
Tony winner Christian Borle of NBC's musical drama series "Smash," is set to portray Audrey's sadistic dentist boyfriend, Orin.
In the musical, Seymour gains fame and Audrey’s affection as his strange and magnificent plant grows — and humans mysteriously disappear.
'Mindhunter' 2
"Mindhunter" executive producer David Fincher, known for the Netflix series "House of Cards," announced the "Mindhunter" season 2 release date on a recent episode of a Los Angeles radio station podcast.
He said the second series, in which Groff again plays serial killer profiler Ford — based on real-life FBI profiler John E. Douglas — will deal with the Manson Family killings in Los Angeles 50 years ago this summer and the Atlanta child murders of 1979-81.
Actor Damon Herriman will play the role of serial killer Charles Manson in the series; he plays the same role in Quentin Tarantino's new film, "Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood."
Groff won a 2018 best-actor Satellite Award for his work on "Mindhunter."
All of the "Mindhunter" episodes for season two are scheduled to be released on Aug. 16. The 10 episodes of season one are still available for streaming on Netflix.
Groff, who performed in high school theater and on other Lancaster County theater stages before moving to New York, was Tony-nominated for his Broadway work in "Spring Awakening" and "Hamilton," in which he played King George III.
Groff co-starred in the series “Looking” on HBO and had a recurring role on Fox TV’s “Glee.” He appeared in such films as "Taking Woodstock," "The Conspirator" and "American Sniper."
Groff recently narrated the audiobook “The Killer Across the Table: Unlocking the Secrets of Serial Killers and Predators with the FBI's Original Mindhunter," written by Douglas and Mark Olshaker.

Texto completo: After an unconscionable five-year wait, the Justice Department announced last Tuesday that it would not bring any criminal charges in connection with the death of Eric Garner. Yet again, we have another failure to pursue a criminal charge for the police killing of an unarmed African American man. Yet again, we fail to get anything approaching real transparency.
The Justice Department's decision flies in the face of the reality we all have seen on video: Officer Daniel Pantaleo put Garner into what the prior New York Police Department commissioner acknowledged was a prohibited chokehold and, as a result, Garner died before our eyes. This in itself is tragic.
More broadly, the decision highlights the urgent need to reform the federal criminal law governing excessive force. Congress needs to do away with the requirement of proof that officers have acted "willfully" when they use excessive force. This intent requirement is far higher than what states generally use. Congress also must mandate public reporting explaining the Justice Department's reasoning in detail when it decides not to bring a charge.
I previously served as the special prosecutor in New York state, tasked with handling police killings of unarmed civilians. This position was created in 2015 to have someone handle these cases who, unlike the local prosecutor, does not work daily with the police department whose officer is under investigation. Similarly, the Justice Department can step into the breach when a local prosecution does not result in a conviction. So, what is Justice's explanation for not bringing charges in the face of the video that shows Mr. Pantaleo choking Garner?
As outlined in its brief news conference last week, there are three key things that the Justice Department would be required to prove: Mr. Pantaleo used excessive force, such force caused Garner's death, and Mr. Pantaleo's use of excessive force was willful. The Justice Department sidestepped the first issue, saying there was no need to resolve this issue, because it could not, in its view, prove that Mr. Pantaleo caused Garner's death or acted willfully. As for the second issue, the Justice Department looked past the New York medical examiner's conclusion that the chokehold led to Garner's death and pointed to "another medical examiner" (apparently one commissioned by Mr. Pantaleo) who it said could not support that determination.
It is the third issue - whether Mr. Pantaleo willfully used excessive force - that the Justice Department appears to view as the most important. As a general matter, an officer acts willfully if the officer acts with a "bad purpose" to disobey the law. As the Justice Department acknowledges, willfulness can be established through circumstantial evidence. But the Justice Department's cursory analysis does not tell us what circumstantial evidence it looked at. The department made reference to Mr. Pantaleo's training and experience but told us nothing about either. The Justice Department also failed to note whether it took into consideration Mr. Pantaleo's disciplinary history. It is wholly unacceptable that DOJ's answer for how it justifies its conclusion on willfulness is, essentially, to direct us to look at the video we have had for five years - especially given that a jury could reasonably find willfulness based on the video alone.
The department's wholly deficient rationale for the decision not to prosecute Mr. Pantaleo highlights the need for fundamental change moving forward. Congress should do away with the willfulness standard. Excessive-force cases often turn on a self-defense argument: If an officer reasonably believes deadly force is necessary to save his or her own life, then the officer may lawfully use deadly force. This argument almost always works in the officer's favor. Requiring proof of bad purpose on top of the reasonable belief requirement serves no meaningful public policy objective. To the contrary, the bad purpose requirement can insulate from criminal liability an officer who needlessly uses excessive force. Rather than insulate officers in this way, Congress should be pushing the law in the other direction. Congress should make clear that an officer's reasonable belief that force is necessary means that the officer exhausted all other options and had no reasonable alternative to the use of deadly force. In the Garner case, such a law would have shifted the Justice Department's focus to the question of whether Mr. Pantaleo's use of force was reasonable. The department's decision not to answer this question speaks volumes.
Congress also should mandate that the Justice Department provide detailed public reporting on its reasoning if it declines to bring charges. The only explanation the public received on the Pantaleo decision was a brief news conference: no medical reports, no policy or training materials on chokeholds, and no disciplinary history for Mr. Pantaleo. Public reporting is crucial to restore trust in our criminal-justice system. Prosecutors routinely claim that such reporting would have a chilling effect on an investigation or otherwise hamper law enforcement. My experience in New York - where we did public reports in every case where there was no criminal charge and pointed out ways to improve law enforcement practices that might avoid future tragedies - tells me this is not so.
It is fundamentally unfair and unjust to wait five years to receive an answer that defies what we have all seen. We must fix this system before it collapses under its own weight.

Texto completo: LONDON -- In 2004, years before he was poised to become Britain's next prime minister, Boris Johnson published "Seventy-Two Virgins."
His novel, which has sold more than 46,000 copies according to Nielsen Book Research, is a farce about a terrorist plot to assassinate America's president during a state visit to Britain, featuring a contest reminiscent of reality television, much talk of buxom women and occasional mocking of Britain's welfare policies.
Reviewers called it everything from an "effortlessly brilliant page-turner" to "not quite a novel." But it was most noted for its hero, Roger Barlow, a member of Britain's parliament.
Barlow is bumbling and gaffe-prone, not unlike Johnson, who has been typecast as both throughout his career. Barlow rides a bike, not unlike Johnson. And Barlow spends much of the book hounded by a newspaper for what appears to be a sexual indiscretion. Johnson was fired as a shadow minister just months after the novel came out for lying about an affair.
In Britain, the novel has largely been forgotten, except by political commentators. In June, Marina Hyde, a columnist for The Guardian, highlighted some of its worst moments in a series of tweets (one character is said to look "like a lingerie model only cleverer, and, if anything, with bigger breasts"; another has so much machismo "he was sometimes considered a danger to himself").
But to some, "Seventy-Two Virgins" and Johnson's other books -- which include a love letter to Winston Churchill and an illustrated book of verse about pushy parents -- deserve a closer look. "They're all part of the wider Boris project. They're not just books," said Steven Fielding, a politics lecturer who has studied how British politics is represented in culture.
Sonia Purnell, a former colleague of Johnson's at The Daily Telegraph who has written a biography of him, said "Seventy-Two Virgins" had proved invaluable to her research. "He is a very secretive person, but he allows glimpses of himself," she said. "He would expect the books to be dissected, but I think they're quite telling."
That Johnson would write a novel is not surprising, said Andrew Gimson, another Johnson biographer. Stanley Johnson, his father, has written a series of political thrillers. Rachel Johnson, his sister, is also a novelist (she won the Bad Sex in Fiction award in 2008). Members of this family have always been competitive, Gimson said, and Johnson might have wanted to show he could write a novel, too.
Johnson's office did not reply to an interview request for this article. But he said in a 2004 interview with The Evening Standard that he wrote it out of "pure vanity" on holiday, "just to see that I could."
"He's not me, by the way," Johnson added of Barlow, in an interview with The Times of London. "But you've got to use what you know, haven't you?"
While writing the book, Johnson was "terrified" that it would come across as a pale imitation of P.G. Wodehouse or Evelyn Waugh, two of his favorite authors, he told The Sunday Business Post (other favorite authors include Chaucer, whom Johnson once praised for "his pricking of hypocrisy and his terrible puns," and the crime writer Carl Hiaasen).
There is a long tradition of Conservative Party politicians writing novels, Fielding said. Winston Churchill, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature, wrote one novel, "Savrola," about a revolution in a fictional country. The hero was a faintly disguised version of Churchill, Fielding said.
Benjamin Disraeli, another key figure in British politics, wrote romantic novels in the 1800s, many with a political message. In "Sybil," for instance, a working-class heroine finds love with an aristocrat, a barely disguised call for Britain's lower and upper classes to unite against the evils of industrialization, Fielding said.
In "Seventy-Two Virgins," the political message at times seems at odds with Johnson's right-wing politics. The most sympathetic character is Dean, a young terrorist from Britain's Midlands whose back story involves petty crime, a racist foster parent and a next-door neighbor obsessed with cheese. A traffic warden from Nigeria plays a key role. And there is anti-Americanism running through the novel ("Britain slavishly followed America into the war on terror," Johnson writes).
But Fielding said that Johnson -- who has been criticized for stoking Islamophobia, including through his book "The Dream of Rome," which included an appendix saying there was "more than a grain of truth" to the idea that the "real problem with the Islamic world is Islam" -- was trying to show he was a liberal Conservative to appeal to voters in the early 2000s. Johnson would write a different novel today, Fielding said.
"Johnson's a political chameleon," Purnell said. "He was left-leaning London's mayor and now he's going for the far-right Brexit crowd. He was once pro-immigration, and now we're not so sure. He was a petrol head and now he's made himself an eco-warrior. There are no core beliefs, no values, just instincts."
Gimson agreed that the book showed Johnson's lack of core beliefs but said that was a good thing for a potential prime minister. "Both in politics and the arts, you shouldn't be improbably reaching after certainty," Gimson said. "Politicians often get stuck with an ideology that makes sense at one point, but circumstances change."
The book's sympathetic portrayal of a terrorist showed Johnson's humanity, Gimson added. "People often miss that about him," he said. "There are strong feelings hidden behind all the jokes."
In 2005, Johnson talked about "Seventy-Two Virgins" on "Desert Island Discs," a British radio show where celebrities are asked about their favorite music (Johnson picked Brahms, Beethoven and "Pressure Drop," by the Clash).
Sue Lawley, the show's presenter, called the book "chillingly prescient." But she then asked Johnson why he'd written a novel that reminded people of his own extramarital activity. "You do like playing with fire, don't you?" she said.
"I suppose there might be an element of truth in that," Johnson eventually replied.
Johnson has not left writing behind. He is working on a book about Shakespeare called "The Riddle of Genius," due in 2020. In June, Johnson said that deadline would slip if he became prime minister.
The book will be Johnson's second on a British cultural icon, following 2014's "The Churchill Factor." While the Churchill biography sold more than 280,000 copies, according to Nielsen Book Research, academics criticized it for slapdash research and its attempts to link Johnson to the former prime minister and war leader.
"My biggest problem with it was it was a lazy book," said Richard Evans, a historian who reviewed the book for The New Statesman, a left-leaning magazine. "The book is a bit of political propaganda, not serious research. He's just trying to persuade people he's another Churchill."
At one point, Johnson writes that Churchill became prime minister despite members of the Conservative Party having been "conditioned to think of him as an opportunist, a turncoat, a blowhard, an egotist, a rotter, a bounder, a cad and on several well-attested occasions a downright drunk."
"Seventy-Two Virgins" ends with Roger Barlow, the Johnson-like member of Parliament, giving a speech in an attempt to save the American president's life.
A terrorist cuts Barlow short, which so annoys our hero that he kicks the terrorist in the elbow. Barlow's "beautiful research assistant" cries out his name. Barlow then hits the terrorist on the head with a statue, using a motion he "first learned as a child when thwacking the tops of thistles in the meadow."
Barlow may have bumbled his way through much of the book's 326 pages, but at the last minute he saves Britain from becoming a global embarrassment.
How does he celebrate? By cycling home.

Sexual misconduct claims at Morehouse

Texto completo: Headnote School staffer on unpaid leave; accused of being inappropriate with students at all-male college
The first video detailing allegations of sexual misconduct came with a plea: "Please get Morehouse's attention."
The second followed soon after: "I too had the same experience."
In separate posts on Twitter this week, two young men who identified themselves as students at Morehouse College detailed their experiences with a staff member at the college who they said had been sexually inappropriate with them. They complained of sexualized comments and inappropriate references to their sexuality.
The videos were shared thousands of times, leading to an investigation by the college and prompting a vocal online conversation about the handling of sexual misconduct at Morehouse, an all-male, historically Black institution in Atlanta.
In statements this week, Morehouse said it was investigating the complaints and had placed the staff member on unpaid administrative leave. The staff member, DeMarcus Crews, is identified on the college's website as a member of its student services leadership team. He is an alumnus of the college who has worked there since he graduated in 2015, according to his LinkedIn page.
Crews did not respond to an email request for comment.
By Thursday, the college announced it was expanding its investigation to include additional complaints it had received against other employees.
"We have begun investigating all new complaints that have been reported over the past 24 hours," the institution said on Twitter. It included the phone number for an anonymous ethics hotline.
On Friday, Aileen Dodd, a Morehouse spokeswoman, declined to answer questions about the number or nature of the complaints received.
"The education and development of the men of Morehouse is our top priority, and the College will take the necessary action to protect the safety of its students," the college said in a statement.
The allegations surfaced late Tuesday in a video posted by Michael Key, who was identified by his lawyer as a 20-year-old entering his junior year at Morehouse.
In the video, Key said that, starting in his first year as a student, Crews made sexual comments to him, hugged him, pinched his cheek and tried to "force me to come out about my sexuality."
"It got to the point where I went into a really bad depression," he said.
He said he reported the behavior to Morehouse, but it did not take action.
Morehouse is consistently ranked near the top of the list of more than 100 schools designated by the Department of Education as historically Black colleges and universities, or HBCUs.
"This story has pierced the hearts of graduates of HBCUs," his lawyer, Tiffany Simmons, said in a statement Friday. "It is a disgrace that a black institution of higher learning would allow this to happen and it be swept under a rug."
A few hours after Key's video was posted, a second student reposted it with a video of his own. That student, who identified himself by name and as a first-year student at Morehouse, also accused Crews of inappropriate behavior. He alleged that Crews falsely told another student that he had come out to him as gay.
The second student did not respond to messages seeking an interview Friday.
The videos prompted a broader conversation online about the environment for those who experience or report sexual misconduct at Morehouse, a small community of about 2,200 students. The conversation follows a reckoning at other college campuses across the country, where issues surrounding Title IX, the federal law that protects against sex discrimination, have become central.
Morehouse has said it has zero tolerance for campus sexual harassment and assault.
In 2018, the college's president, David A. Thomas, said Morehouse had made progress on the issue in recent years, including hiring a Title IX coordinator.
The Title IX coordinator, Terraine Bailey, is no longer in that position.
Dodd, the university spokeswoman, declined to comment Friday about Bailey's departure, citing the confidentiality of personnel matters. She said Morehouse's vice president for human resources, Cassandra Tarver-Ross, was handling Title IX matters on an interim basis.
Tarver-Ross did not immediately respond to phone and email requests for comment.

Texto completo: La historia de amor de Emma Coronel y Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera tuvo su más reciente capítulo el último día que se vieron en la Corte del Distrito Este de Nueva York, con sede en Brooklyn, pero tuvo diversos momentos en que ella le envió mensajes de apoyo incondicional.
Lo primero que hizo el líder del Cártel de Sinaloa al ver a su esposa el día de su sentencia fue un “saludo militar” y enviarle un beso con la mano, pero luego no dejó de buscarla con la mirada, incluso en momentos clave, como cuando una de sus víctimas Andrea Velez , narraba que el mexicano intentó matarla.
Durante ese último día, la exreina de belleza portó joyas estimadas en $86,000 dólares , incluido un juego de pulseras Cartier de la colección Love, creada en 1970 por el diseñador Aldo Cipullo, que supone un mensaje “mensaje secreto” a su esposo sobre el amor que le tiene.
La casa Cartier define a su colección Love como un símbolo “de amor eterno”, tienen pequeños círculos formados por dos semicírculos que simbolizan la unión de los enamorados y supone un símbolo entre parejas cuyos sentimientos no pueden romperse , afirma la revista Quién.
La relación entre Guzmán Loera y Coronel ha sido complicada ante las condiciones de encierro del primero, aunado a que han decidido no escribirse más, luego de que sus primeras cartas no fueron entregadas por los fiscales federales y utilizadas como pruebas.
Sin embargo, la exreina de belleza ha enviado varios mensajes a su esposo para mostrarle su amor, todos en público, señales que parecía que solo ellos podrían entender, pero que fueron evidentes.
Uno de los momentos clave fue cuando decidieron lucir el mismo tipo de saco, uno de terciopelo color púrpura, como una forma de confirmarle al mundo que estaban juntos a pesar de cualquier situación . Lo lucieron cuando declaraba Lucero Guadalupe Sánchez López , mejor conocida como la “ Chapodiputada ”, examante de Guzmán Loera.
Coronel también envió mensajes a su esposo en Instagram, aunque difícilmente él podría verlos, ya que no tiene acceso a internet.
“Todo va estar bien, tal vez hoy no, pero sí con el tiempo” , escribió a pocos días de iniciar el juicio.
Una vez iniciado el proceso en la Corte de Brooklyn, Coronel volvió a escribir.
“Cuando de ti se trata, la luna siempre será mi cómplice” , publicó Coronel en su cuenta en noviembre, a pocos días de iniciado el juicio.
Hay diversas interpretaciones sobre los mensajes “ocultos” que ella ha enviado, pero para José Reveles, autor del libro El Chapo, Entrega y Traición, podrían ser una forma de para mostrar al mundo que la vida sigue para una mujer joven .
“Tal vez quiere demostrar una liberación de que su vida más allá de lo que pueda pasar con su marido”, consideró.
En una entrevista a The New York Times, Coronel expresó que admiraba a su esposo y que lo amaba, un mensaje que es claro y ella no ocultó al acudir casi todos los días al juicio.

Texto completo: "Wherever I have gone outside, I have never tried to hide Marion C.I. I never forget No. 125734."
Don King
For an afternoon in 1977, Marion was at the epicenter of the sporting world.
That's what happens when Don King and Howard Cosell, boxing and national television, future world champions and an all-time great are mixed together inside the walls of a prison.
It's a story — a weird story — but it's our story.
And it started in the late 1960s when Marion received a new resident. King, better known then as inmate 125734 according to a story written by Pulitzer Prize winning sports writer Red Smith in The New York Times, was sent to prison for manslaughter, but paroled in 1971.
As he left the gates of Marion Correctional Institution, he vowed to come back.
Some might have taken it one way, but he meant something else. Once on the outside, King made up for lost time. In less than six years, he became boxing's biggest and most famous promoter.
And he fulfilled that promise. He returned to MCI, only this time he brought a few friends with him.
The crowning of U.S. champs In 1976, America was giddy with patriotism while celebrating the Bicentennial, and the country couldn't get enough of boxing. At that year's Olympics in Montreal, five Americans brought home gold medals, while "Rocky" was winning over fans at the box office.
King, who was quickly becoming a major player in the sport, saw the confluence and the connection. He quickly conceived of the idea of a tournament called the United States Boxing Championships that would crown undisputed American champs in all weight classes.
He partnered with Ring Magazine to make it so.
"I needed their reputation and their ratings and their sanction to give validity and authority to the tournament," King told Sports Illustrated.
He then sold the concept to ABC Sports President Roone Arledge, the man better known for constructing the NFL's Monday Night Football franchise. It was to be a centerpiece of programming for ABC's Wide World of Sports show that owned the 1970s sporting consciousness.
One quarterfinal of the tournament was held on the deck of an aircraft carrier off the coast of Florida. Another was held at the Naval Academy. The third installment was the strangest venue yet.
The show was coming to Marion — not to be held in its coliseum, but its prison.
King was indeed coming home.
A captive audience The seven-fight card was set for Sunday, March 6, 1977. An unprecedented 90-minute block would be set up to broadcast at least two matches live from 3 to 4:30 p.m.
It was the first nationally televised live program from a prison, so the logistics were many. MCI is not Madison Square Garden. According to a recap in The Marion Star, to get a TV signal out of the prison, it had to be beamed to a dish atop Central Soya's grain silos in town and then on to WTVN-TV in Columbus where it went international from there.
Cosell was the voice of boxing in the '70s and called the matches.
Beloved former heavyweight champion Joe Louis was ringside, while former Olympic heavyweight boxer Pete Radamacher was a referee and judge.
Other dignitaries were Smith, who was writing his "Sports of the Times" column about the event, as well as the New York Post's Vic Zeigel, AP boxing writer Ed Schulyer and Time Magazine female writer P.J. Phillips among others.
By this time Arledge didn't go on the road much, but the head of ABC Sports was in Marion to make sure it went off without hassle.
The show was not open to the public. Save for the media members and a few local VIPs, the room was packed with MCI's 1,400 inmates. And they were ready to be entertained.
Before the matches, King climbed into the ring wearing a gold jacket over a frilled white shirt and took the microphone.
"I look around and see many familiar faces," Smith reported of King's brief speech. "I am one of you."
The crowd ate it up.
"It is with mixed emotions that I am coming back to what was trauma in my life," he continued. "I am happy and proud to be able to bring back some entertainment for you because you have been part of my life."
The inmates went wild with cheers and applause.
"Wherever I have gone outside, I have never tried to hide Marion C.I. I never forget No. 125734," King said with the crowd going bonkers.
Following King's introduction, in came Louis for a wave, which the inmates heartily appreciated. Then Cosell was introduced as a couple ringsiders held up signs that said, "Finally, Howard is where he belongs," and "Howard got in — will he get out?"
MCI Superintendent Pete Perini was "warmly booed," according to Smith, while prison chaplain Father Fred Furey was cheered. Walter Hampton, head of the parole board, brought a great many jeers upon his introduction, which caused King to tell the crowd, "That's the dude that sprung me."
Boxing at the prison King was sure his captive audience would be entertained.
Art "Tap" Harris, a former world-ranked welterweight from Akron, was in one of the featured bouts. Harris, like King before him, was also an inmate at MCI, serving time for shooting a man in a bar.
Fighting for the third time inside the prison's gates, Harris won by TKO in the fourth round over Johnny Heard of Chicago after Ray Phillips backed out days before the middleweight fight.
"This is my home now," Harris told The Marion Star's Bob Thatcher after winning his 29th straight match. "I wish I had looked better. I've told them I'm the best middleweight. I need some high-caliber fighters to show it. I've got a debt to pay to society, and I feel four-and-a-half years is enough. I hope society feels I should have a chance."
Harris would get out soon enough and resume his career with five more wins before losing his final two pro bouts, first to "Sugar" Ray Seales in 1980 and then to Manning Galloway in 1981.
Back inside the gates of the prison, heavyweights Stan Ward and Kevin Issac did not entertain. After two rounds of circling one another, someone in the crowd yelled, 'Come on! I've only got 20 years!"
Ward won by decision, but another match was lively. Rocky Mosley was knocked down in the first round but rallied to beat Johnny Baldwin when he couldn't answer the bell in the fifth.
Future heavyweight champion Michael Dokes of Akron, competing in just the fourth fight of his career, handled oval-shaped Charlie Jordan, showing flair in doing so.
Featherweight Ruben Castillo earned his 22nd straight win in an eight-round decision over Kenny Weldon, and lightweight Ruby "The Snake" Ortiz of Brooklyn took a unanimous decision over Vinnie DeBerros of Connecticut.
The main event included 18-year-old welterweight phenom and top-ranked Wilfredo Benitez and No. 10 Mel Dennis of Houston.
Benitez was 29-0-1 and recognized as the world junior welterweight champion at the time of his bout in Marion, becoming the youngest world champ in history at the age of 17. He won the eight-round fight at MCI via a decision in what BoxRec.com considered a four out of five star match. Benitez would leave Marion and go on to win two more world titles in two other weight classes in his hall of fame career.
The show was a success across the board.
Plug pulled on tourney But as entertaining as it was in Marion, the U.S. Boxing Championships were on the ropes.
A month later, ABC cancelled televising the series when investigative reports found at least 11 fighters in the tournament had false win-loss records with King associates allegedly buying rankings from Ring Magazine to bolster the boxers' statures.
There were further charges of promised kickbacks from fighters to bookers to get into the tournament, plus lots of other shenanigans.
By May, Sports Illustrated ran a piece spelling out all the trouble associated with the boxing championships, including FBI and IRS probes and a federal grand jury in Baltimore looking into it.
As said, it's a story — a weird story — but it's our story.
And it fittingly came to an end in a prison in Marion, Ohio, in March of 1977.

Texto completo: Fifty years ago this month, with what looked like an over-starched flag, Americans turned the moon into their own backyard sandlot. Yet back here on Earth, any number of places can rival the moon's all-in-the-family strangeness – a truth for which writers give unceasing thanks. 
Consider Oklahoma City. It may not top most lists of must-see destinations, but Sam Anderson can assure you it is “one of the great weirdo cities of the world." As “a laboratory for unavoidable American problems," he proposes, it is also a worthy case study.
A staff writer for The New York Times Magazine, Anderson developed an outsider's affection for the city when, thanks to considerable maneuvering, it acquired the professional basketball team now known as the Thunder. His “Boomtown – The Fantastical Saga of Oklahoma City, its Chaotic Founding, its Apocalyptic Weather, its Purloined Basketball Team, and the Dream of Becoming a World-class Metropolis" attempts to explain everything in its subtitle and then some.
The 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building still unfortunately dominates most people's conception of Oklahoma City. Anderson argues that the Thunder's arrival 13 years later, and the team's unexpected brilliance, have been essential to the community's healing. 
The city abruptly sprouted with the land run of 1889, an event Anderson recounts in lively detail. (At times he can seem like the desperate-to-amuse guy on the next barstool, but bear with him.) Although the sections on the Thunder may be a little too much inside basketball for some readers, Anderson balances his account with wonderful historical and cultural nuggets (my favorite: the museum devoted to free enterprise). He also delivers a powerful reconstruction of the bombing, as well as an indelible portrait of Gary England, a meteorologist venerated for his life-saving tornado forecasts. 
If Oklahoma City almost never came to be, Los Angeles was at least as improbable. Gary Krist's “The Mirage Factory – Illusion, Imagination and the Invention of Los Angeles" illuminates the city's rise through three notable figures: William Mulholland, the architect of its water system; D.W. Griffith, the master filmmaker who helped bring a fledgling movie industry west; and the wildly popular evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson.
Krist's scrupulously researched history shows how three intersecting dreams created the unlikely fact of LA, as well as its illusion-loving soul. (“Whether you like it or not," Charlie Chaplin once tellingly told McPherson, “you're an actress.") 
At the turn of the last century, Los Angeles was smaller than Fall River. Mulholland's scheme to poach water from the north, and the 1913 completion of his aqueduct, proved vital to attracting investment. 
Griffith was drawn by the promise of sunny days and virtually year-round shooting. McPherson, she would attest, arrived on instructions from the Lord. At 28, she quit the East Coast and, with her mother and two children, headed to LA, driving most of the way herself. In California, she drew thousands with her upbeat gospel of salvation and, not incidentally, reports of faith healing. Followers soon donated enough to erect a lavish million-dollar temple, with seating for 5,300. 
In the years when Los Angeles was coming of age, Pittsburgh had already reached maturity.
The Pennsylvania coal capital is probably best known as the stamping ground of Andrew Carnegie, and other Gilded Age titans. But in “Smoketown – The Untold Story of the Other Great Black Renaissance," Mark Whitaker unearths a second, lesser-known city. Much like Harlem, Pittsburgh was home to a vibrant black community that flourished from the 1920s through the 1950s. Its newspaper, the Pittsburgh Courier, played an outsized role in shaping black opinion across the country.
Like Sam Anderson, the Courier's editors understood the power of sports to lift the profile of a community. The paper was an early champion of Joe Louis, presenting the Alabama fighter's rise as a vindication of black flight from the South. Pittsburgh's integrated school system and rich musical culture helped produce several jazz greats, including Billy Strayhorn, Billy Eckstine and Erroll Garner. The city also molded August Wilson, one of the postwar era's greatest playwrights.
Family ties encouraged Whitaker to bring this lesser-known history to light. But as Anderson demonstrates, it sometimes takes an outsider to bring a place fully into focus. As a visitor to the deep South, the British travel writer Richard Grant was so entranced that he impulsively purchased a grand plantation house. “Dispatches from Pluto — Lost and Found in the Mississippi Delta" is his mind-blown account.
Arriving from New York with his girlfriend, Grant discovers nature in all its summertime fecundity (snakes, clouds of mosquitoes and armadillos that need killing). He quickly takes on his own prejudices, among them a dim view of gun culture and weed killers, and is entertainingly humbled. Questions of race assume an equally humbling complexity. Full of outlandish stories, eccentrics and lessons in neighborliness, Grant's report from the Mississippi swampland washes down like sweet tea.

Texto completo: Un juez federal se mostró dispuesto a aprobar un acuerdo preliminar presentado este viernes por el que la cadena de hospedaje Motel 6 pagará 10 millones de dólares, y que sería el punto final de una querella interpuesta tras descubrirse que se compartía información de huéspedes con ICE .
El juez David Campbell señaló a los abogados de ambas partes que una vez se entregue la documentación requerida para finales de este mes no tendría objeciones en aprobar el acuerdo preliminar, que eleva la cifra previa de 7.6 millones alcanzado entre la organización civil MALDEF y la cadena, y que la Fiscalía había considerado insuficiente.
“Este acuerdo es una gran victoria para nuestra comunidad, envía un fuerte mensaje: Motel 6 violó los derechos de cientos de personas compartiendo su información con ICE ” (Inmigración y Control de Aduanas), dijo a Efe Thomas Saenz, presidente del Fondo Mexicano Estadounidense para la Defensa Legal (MALDEF).
La compensación monetaria en esta demanda colectiva, en la que se denunció que empleados de la cadena entregaban información de los huéspedes a ICE, dependerá de si los afectados fueron cuestionados, arrestados o inclusive deportados. También si tenían hijos menores o familiares que fueron afectados por su detención.
Como parte de este nuevo acuerdo se eleva la compensación monetaria para aquellos que fueron víctimas de esta práctica, y en todos los hoteles de la cadena en Arizona y no solo unos cuantos que fueron mencionados en el primer acuerdo.
Aquellos cuyo nombre fue entregado a ICE en 2017 cuando se hospedaron en Motel 6, recibirán ahora 75 dólares, 25 dólares más que los mencionados en el acuerdo original.
La compensación no excederá los 200,000 dólares por persona .
También se modifico la cantidad que serán otorgadas de este acuerdo a organizaciones que luchan en favor de los migrantes.
Según escritos judiciales, los empleados de Motel 6 entregaban información privada a ICE de aquellos que se registraban utilizando matriculas consulares, pasaportes o identificaciones extranjeras.
Los abogados estiman que el número de víctimas se podría incrementar hasta 50,000 .
Saenz indicó que a partir de agosto comenzará un periodo de gracia donde aquellos que no estén conformes con este nuevo acuerdo podrán apelar, y quienes consideren que fueron víctimas de Motel 6 también se podrían agregar a la demanda.
Por su parte, la oficina del Fiscal del Estado de Arizona, Mark Brnovich dijo a Efe que revisaran el nuevo acuerdo.
El pasado mes de mayo, Brnovich pidió a la corte rechazar el primer acuerdo debido a que lo consideraba injusto para las víctimas, porque iban a recibir muy poco dinero.

Foiling Crime in the City, Just Like His Ancestor

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
On the 13th Floor of Police Headquarters in downtown Manhattan, there is an ink drawing of a stern-looking man with a piercing gaze.
It is Jacob Hays, and his image is the first in a long series of framed portraits of the department's police chiefs.
For four decades before the Police Department was formed in 1845, Mr. Hays served as New York City's highest-ranking law enforcement official: a now-defunct position known as high constable -- a "top cop" post that also required street-level patrol and detective work.
"You could probably more accurately describe him as the whole Police Department," Edward Conlon, a communications director for the department, said. "He was doing the job that cops and detectives do."
The department never had a photograph of Mr. Hays until recently, when a faded image appeared on the desk of Benjamin Singleton, 28, director of analytics for the department's Detective Bureau.
Mr. Singleton, as it turns out, is Mr. Hays's great-great-great-great-grandson.
Even in a department rife with so-called cop families boasting generations of service on the force, the connection between Mr. Hays and Mr. Singleton might reach back the longest.
At first glance, their law enforcement roles could not seem more dissimilar. The physically fearsome Mr. Hays became high constable in 1802, when the city was essentially 60,000 residents clustered in Lower Manhattan.
He was, as one contemporary newspaper put it, "the terror of rascals of every grade."
The less imposing Mr. Singleton, on the other hand, dresses in a suit and tie and develops computer programs that identify crime patterns in a city of more than eight million people spread across five boroughs.
But there are similarities. For one, neither man was a likely candidate for a career in law enforcement.
Born in 1772, Mr. Hays grew up in a family of Jewish shopkeepers in rural Westchester County with little education, while Mr. Singleton grew up on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and attended Regis High School and Yale University.
His family members worked largely in finance, not law enforcement.
A college law enforcement class helped spark an interest in police work, as did this distant family connection to Mr. Hays, a mythical police figure Mr. Singleton heard about often from his grandmother.
"It just seemed serendipitous that I would go into law enforcement, having an ancestor who was one of the forefathers of modern American policing," he said. "It was always in the back of my head and reinforced my connection to law enforcement in the city."
But unlike his forebear, who was a law enforcement lifer, Mr. Singleton never saw police work as a lifelong vocation. And after four years at the Police Department, he is preparing to leave for an analytics job at an airline.
With a desk in the chief of detectives' office, Mr. Singleton, a civilian in the department, has spent those four years walking past the drawing of Mr. Hays. But in December, his aunt found the old photograph of Mr. Hays -- the only known portrait of him -- in a family collection.
The family connection came to the attention of Mr. Conlon, 54.
Mr. Conlon, a Harvard-educated author and former detective who writes material for the department's website, is a fourth-generation police officer whose great-grandfather was a New York City patrolman a century ago. He was fascinated by Mr. Singleton's connection and began researching Mr. Hays, whose prominence in city history had been largely forgotten.
Mr. Conlon got in touch with Patrick Bringley, a writer who in 2014 wrote a thesis on Mr. Hays while at Hunter College in Manhattan.
Mr. Hays also served as a captain of the city's Night Watch patrol, which kept a lookout for crime after dark. He gained international fame by tracking notorious criminals, including counterfeiters, across state lines and even into Canada.
For his longevity, he gained the nickname "Old Hays." Parents used to warn misbehaving children that "Old Hays will get you."
"Back then, everybody in New York City knew who Jacob Hays was," Mr. Bringley said. "He was the dominant figure in law enforcement because his institutional knowledge trumped everyone else's by miles."
Mr. Hays had an exceptional understanding of the city's criminal dynamics and had such an uncanny memory for criminals that he could spot them with a glance on a crowded street.
"Half a look is enough for old Jacob" was how one newspaper described it, Mr. Bringley said.
Mr. Hays, who is buried in Marble Cemetery in Manhattan's East Village, has lineage that includes the novelist John Dos Passos and A.G. Sulzberger, the publisher of The New York Times.
Mr. Conlon and Mr. Stapleton recently met Mr. Bringley at the Museum of the City of New York in Manhattan, where they perused Mr. Hays's personal indexes of criminals.
Even as an appointed high constable, Mr. Hays drew no base salary and had no official authority over the other constables assigned to each neighborhood.
Instead, the constables vied for rewards, bounties and fees to make a living. Essentially competing as individual freelancers, they were unlikely to share information on criminals.
"Hays was the top cop because he knew the most, and hoarded information on crooks and their patterns in ledgers and in his head," Mr. Bringley said. "Nowadays you need a computer guy like Singleton for that and we call it data."
Since citywide criminal records were not compiled at the time, Mr. Hays assembled his own.
One of his notebooks was a list of offenders of Sunday laws enforced to promote religious days of rest. This included selling alcohol on Sundays, using firecrackers, fishing and driving a horse and cart faster than five miles an hour. The notebook listed Mr. Hays arrest of a young Cornelius Vanderbilt for ice skating on a Sunday, years before Mr. Vanderbilt would become a shipping magnate and one of the country's wealthiest men.
Then there was a prison ledger Mr. Hays kept with some 6,000 inmate names, ages and crimes and sentences.
"It was kind of like his own intelligence ledger, his suspect book," recalled Mr. Singleton, who compared it to a contemporary database of gang members and was struck that his forebear was essentially conducting an early form of police analytics, albeit using less sophisticated methods.
"All those things he logged are still important to us today as well," Mr. Singleton said. "Like him, we try to filter out information in a systematic way to better understand the people who are driving crime patterns. We have a fancy database, but we still rely on the same techniques."
Those methods include programs and algorithms developed by Mr. Singleton that analyze crime trends.
One algorithm identifies crime spikes based upon type and location of offenses.
Mr. Hays, who died in 1850 at age 78, maintained a leadership role in the constabulary until it was replaced by the Police Department.
"He had an extraordinary memory and recognition abilities," Mr. Singleton said, "but data still mattered back then."

The Most Important Ingredient in Hit Cooking Videos—Beautiful Hands; Chefs tend to wear their scars and burns as a badge of honor, unless their hands are ready for a close up

Texto completo: Alvin Zhou laid all the ingredients for a triple-decker cheesecake tower on a kitchen counter. Then he reached into his backpack for a secret one—concealer to hide a small scar just above his left knuckle.

No scars, please
"This stuff is like magic," says Mr. Zhou, who makes cooking videos. "We get comments all the time about our hands."
It used to be that chefs considered burns and scars a badge of honor. Now, bird's-eye views of cooks slicing and dicing and performing kitchen magic have become big business on Instagram, Facebook and YouTube. They want their hands looking dazzling.
Stubby, gnarled, hairy or pudgy fingers are all considered unappetizing. Long nails and bright polish usually are no-nos, too, because they could clash with the food, says Sharon Rechter, president of First Media, a company that produces cooking videos through its So Yummy brand.
With the average food publisher notching five times as many video views on Facebook last year than the average U.S. publisher, according to media monitoring company Shareablee, presentable paws command a premium.
Many video chefs had little or no cooking experience before landing their jobs. Producers try to match those with precise, graceful hand movements to intricate work such as decorating cakes. Those with heftier hands are tasked with making comfort food such as macaroni and cheese, says Ms. Rechter.
"The hands are the primary means to establish trust with our viewers," says Tess Panzer, creative director at So Yummy. "If the hands aren't confident and relaxed, the viewers aren't confident and relaxed. When I get newbies, the minute the camera goes down, the hands become tense and malfunctioning, and they have no idea what they're doing. That's the biggest point of training. Get the hands to be completely and utterly relaxed."
Mr. Zhou, whose hands appear in some of the internet's most-watched cooking clips, has been making videos for Buzzfeed's Tasty brand since 2015. His hits include "Sliders 4 Ways" (211 million views on Facebook) and "Mirror Glaze Cake" (more than 150 million views).
Tasty alone notched 1.2 billion Facebook views for its videos in May, nearly double what it did in June of last year. Many were shot with a camera pointing down from the ceiling to the kitchen counter. They rarely show the cook's face—only a tight frame around a dish being prepared by a graceful, beautifully cared for pair of hands.
Share Your Thoughts
Do you get a manicure before chopping vegetables? Join the conversation below.
Mr. Zhou, who trained as a classical pianist before landing his video-chef gig, has muscular hands. Besides the damage to his knuckle, he covers up a scar on his right hand where a piano teacher, he says, once stabbed him with a pencil after he flubbed a note.
When Mr. Zhou seasons a dish, "he likes to do a swirl, like he's casting a spell," says Vaughn Vreeland, a former colleague at Tasty who now works at a New York Times cooking site. "He swishes and flicks." The idea, Mr. Vreeland says, is to make viewers feel "they are the ones doing the cooking."
Mr. Vreeland says he got a $20 manicure before his own job interview with Tasty.
At Hearst Magazines' Delish brand, Lauren Miyashiro is known for making large foods, such as 8-pound bagels, giant Pop-Tarts and doughnuts as large as a dozen. She has two burn scars from working at Delish: one on her right hand and the other on the left arm. She doesn't bother to cover them up.
Her former Delish colleague Lindsay Funston was known as the master of the "cheese pull," the photogenic effect that comes when melted cheese is pulled apart in long strands, often leading to more views. Some of the people she used to work with said her hands look like claws in some of the videos.
Viewers can be unforgiving. When Tara Maini made mac-and-cheese burgers for the U.K.-based cooking brand Twisted, viewers called her fingernails "grubby" and "gross." "Let's hope she didn't lose a nail in there somewhere," one wrote.
Ms. Maini is more careful now about taking care of her hands. She says she gets fortnightly manicures and expenses them to her company. When she joined a netball team last year, a referee asked her to cut her nails so she wouldn't scratch anybody. She wouldn't. "I'm now the oddball wearing gloves to play," she says.
Video editing can correct some mistakes by online chefs, and camera angles can make hands appear smaller and daintier than they really are. Even so, Mr. Zhou says it is important to make sure his movements are as fluid as possible, like a choreographed routine.
"Cooking on camera is different," he says, "but trying to keep it natural is still key. It needs to be realistic."
Ms. Panzer, the So Yummy creative director, says there is another element to the best cooking videos. "What I try to establish with my hands, in particular, instead of just doing it, I'm doing it just so. There's this grace and elegance to it. It's very relaxing. People tell me they lie in bed at night and just watch videos till they fall asleep."
Hand models looking to break into the cooking-video business realize that they can't get by on beauty alone.
Johnny Tyronne got work modeling watches and colognes before investing $100 in a course on knife skills at the Institute of Culinary Education in New York. He says he wanted to learn how to quickly and safely chop fruit and vegetables like his knife-work role model, British chef Jamie Oliver.
He recommends that other hand models get their own sets of knives and keep them sharp.
"Food is the biggest market," says Mr. Tyronne, who lives in New York. "Just by learning how to use knives, I booked quite a bit of work."

Texto completo: As the three Apollo 11 astronauts approached the moon 50 years ago this week, Pittsburgh, like the rest of the country, watched with awe - along with some silliness and some doubts.
The township of Moon hosted an all-day celebration featuring a re-enactment in which an "astronaut" parachuted from a helicopter and landed in the "Sea of Tranquility" - the town park. A baby born in Harrison one minute after the July 20 landing was given the middle name Diana - the Roman goddess of the moon.
And the Post-Gazette spoke to two locals named Neil Armstrong. "I'm glad it was him and not me," said Neil J. Armstrong, of New Kensington.
Amid the celebration, though, there were dissenters. Splashed across the pages of the city's papers were the voices of Pittsburghers who wondered whether the billions of dollars devoted to the Apollo program would have been better spent on anti-poverty programs or on the Vietnam War effort.
A Post-Gazette editorial from July 18, 1969, pointed to the "uglier side of the moon expedition," noting that in the shadow of the Apollo launch site in Florida, "some 7,000 earthlings of the same nationality as the astronauts struggle to avoid death by starvation."
The critics were correct in saying that the effort to put humans on the moon was a hugely expensive and resource-sucking endeavor. The Apollo program, launched by President John F. Kennedy in 1961, employed more than 400,000 people and cost more than $24 billion (more than $150 billion in today's dollars) - the costliest peacetime mobilization in history.
In the half-century since those missions, a sort of legend has taken hold that emphasizes the primitive technology that those early Apollo astronauts had to work with. The best example may be the Apollo guidance computer, which charted the spacecraft's course, using only about 64 kilobytes of memory - less than in most modern toasters and a tiny fraction of the memory in the smartphones we fit in our pockets
But the focus on the technology's simplicity distracts from how remarkable it really was, says Jay Apt, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University's College of Engineering and a former astronaut who flew four NASA missions between 1985 and 1997. Mr. Apt referred to a well-known saying that Apollo 11 was "a piece of 21st century technology that was picked up by Jack Kennedy and moved into the 20th century."
"The technology that was used in Apollo was truly stunning in many ways," he said.
It's hard to overstate how far the program went in just eight years. In a new book on the Apollo program, excerpted in Smithsonian Magazine, historian Charles Fishman wrote that when Kennedy set his 1961 goal, the U.S. lacked nearly all of the equipment needed for a moon mission - it had no rockets, launchpads, spacesuits or computers that were up to the task. Some doctors even feared that astronauts would lose the ability to think in low-gravity conditions.
Then there was the matter of actually landing on the moon. Early plans called for flying straight there and landing on the moon's surface - it wasn't until years into the planning that NASA realized this would have required an impractically huge rocket and enormous amounts of fuel.
Instead, they went with a lunar orbit rendezvous, in which the smaller "Eagle" lander detached from the main spacecraft, made its famous visit, then flew back up to rejoin the main craft circling the moon. This delicate maneuver set the example for future in-space dockings - including Mr. Apt's fourth spaceflight, in which the space shuttle rendezvoused and docked with the Russian space station Mir in 1996.
Mr. Apt also credited the Apollo planners for building multiple guidance modes into the lander's computer, allowing the pilot to gradually take control of more aspects of the navigation as it neared the moon.
"When the commander would want to take over just before landing to avoid some boulders, for example, he could have full control," Mr. Apt said.
When Cmdr. Neil Armstrong encountered unexpectedly rocky terrain in the spot where he'd planned to land, he used manual control to keep flying for a few more minutes, finally choosing a safer landing spot after burning much of the lander's limited fuel. The Eagle landed, and the rest was history.
A half-century later, space exploration no longer is the national focus that it was in the Apollo era. At the program's peak in the mid-1960s, the U.S. devoted more than 4% of its annual budget to NASA - today, it is less than half of 1%.
That shift in priorities has created opportunities for privately held space companies such as Astrobotic Technology, based in Downtown Pittsburgh. The company, founded in 2008, is partnering with NASA in an effort to land its own rover on the moon by 2021.
But Apollo still looms large. Almost every component of a modern spacecraft owes its existence to those missions, said Astrobotic CEO John Thornton, from computers to sensors to spacesuits. While the Apollo workers had to develop these components, today's companies can typically purchase them off the shelf.
"There's a $360 billion space industry worldwide that has built an industrial base of components that makes it very easy for folks to assemble spacecraft relative to the Apollo era," Mr. Thornton said. "What Apollo built is continuing today, because that was the foundation for the entire space industry."
Search "Apollo guidance computer" on eBay, and you'll find functional, 3D-printed replicas of the original device, on sale for a few thousand dollars. And the source code that powered the computer is freely available online, full of jokes and 1960s pop culture references left by the original programmers.
Given this continued legacy and public-private partnerships, Mr. Thornton doesn't see the government's declining spending on space as cause for concern. (NASA's funding actually ticked up in the most recent federal budget, approved in February.)
Mr. Apt said he's excited for what's to come. Aside from a mission to Mars, he cited a planned mission to explore Titan, a moon of Saturn, as well as the Trump administration's stated goal to land the first woman on the moon by 2024.
"Any of these things fire up my imagination," Mr. Apt said. "Taking people into space, wherever we go, is just tremendous."
There's something timeless about that sense of wonder, which, despite the concerns about Apollo's costs, seemed to be the prevailing emotion around Pittsburgh 50 years ago this week.
In the July 16, 1969, Pittsburgh Press, photographer Gilbert Love wrote a piece reflecting on the upcoming moon landing styled as a letter to his ancestors.
He described the vehicles, like carriages with engines, that propel us for hundreds of miles and the little boxes that transmit sounds from the other side of the world. "Fantastic developments have come to us so rapidly that we have almost ceased to marvel at them," he wrote.
"We have difficulties and perils these days, but nevertheless we're living in a golden age. Nowhere is it more evident than in our ability to see and hear the world in which we live and, increasingly, the universe."

Texto completo: Mikey Mosher is a self-proclaimed "wife guy. "
While less Instagram-famous than the viral versions of partner-obsessed men before him, Mosher floods his follower's timelines with content about his girlfriend – including but not limited to her looking at stained-glass windows or lying with her eyes closed on the beach.
There are several solo photos of her on his Instagram account, often with no caption, and on Twitter, he retweets comments like, "After much deliberation, I have decided to stan, my own girlfriend. " For the record, 'stan' refers to being an overzealous fan of a particular person.
Mosher says the wife guy title suits him because "there’s this whole movement around being obsessed with your wife and being very outwardly open about loving her on social media," the 25-year-old from Massachusetts said. "I noticed that, and I post about my girlfriend a lot, and I guess that makes me a wife guy. "
In June, The New York Times published a story titled, "The Age of the Internet ‘Wife Guy,’" where the writer explores the latest social media phenomenon – men being praised, then mocked, for being openly consumed by the lives of their significant others.

Who is 'wife guy'?
The definition of wife guy is somewhat loose.
It's fair to say that he is more than just an ordinary husband, spouse or boyfriend.
He may incessantly post photos of his wife online, he may be accused of over-celebrating his partner's achievements or he may go viral for curating entire music videos dedicated to his affinity for her body.
In some cases, it encompasses the personas of recurring online characters who appear to partly define themselves through exaggerated reactions to being in a union with a female. The Times defined the category of men as existing "at the intersection of relationship status and influencer branding. "
According to the Outline, a wife guy is "defined by the fact that they have done something which involves a wife, whether their own or someone else’s. ” And New York magazine says wife guys are the men "who make themselves famous for things their wives did, or qualities their wives have or had. "
The subject can be confusing, though, because the internet amplifies some wife guys who are divorced and others who aren't even real.
"Elf Wife Guy" became part of the social conversation after he blocked his wife on Twitter, and "Fake Wife Guy" was a man who posed as his wife on social media until the two were going through a divorce. "Cliff Wife Guy" joined the club over Memorial Day weekend when he posted a video of his wife falling down a cliff. She turned out to be OK, and he told USA TODAY in an email that he "wasn't a fan of the spin the internet took on an actual scary situation involving my family. "
The consensus seems to be that the everyday lives of women give wife guys a wider platform, and a large part of his digital identity is based on the woman he has in his life.
Perhaps the resurgence in popularity of Borat Voice "My Wife" has contributed to the spread of "wife guy" humor. Actor-comedian Sacha Baron Cohen's character Borat coined the catchphrase in the 2006 movie "Borat! Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan. "
"After being a popular reference to the film in the years following its release, it grew into an ironic signifier for a poor sense of humor, referenced in pop culture" and later parodied on Twitter, according to Know Your Meme, a website tracking viral content.
Or maybe the phenomenon was advanced by today's women's movement, with men using their wives to publicly declare that they are feminists and allies. Relationship experts say that the trend could also be attributed to a man's need to be approved and validated from outside sources, among other circumstances.
"If the relationship is in its infancy, it's a natural response to say, 'Look at what I’ve achieved, I’ve been able to marry this kind, beautiful and ambitious woman,'" said Patrick Wanis, human behavior and relationship expert. "But when it becomes obsessive or appears to be extreme then the motivation could be one of two things: deep insecurity . . . or the person is trying to tell other people, ‘Hey, look I’m taken. ’"
'Curvy Wife Guy'
Robbie Trip is probably the most famous wife guy out there. In fact, he's widely credited as being one of the first.
After posting content about his love for his girlfriend, now wife, for years, the 28-year-old was launched into internet fame when he shared a photo on Instagram about how much he adored his "curvy" wife in 2017.
Two years later, he released a music video titled “Chubby Sexy" that rubbed some people the wrong way, with some accusing him of objectifying women. Since going viral, he told USA TODAY that "a majority of the time" the term wife guy has been used "in a mocking way to denigrate the guy in the relationship – that somehow he would be nothing without his wife or that he is less of a man because he so adores his wife. "

Tripp said that the song's backlash is outweighed by the public support from men and women who understand his central message of female empowerment. In a tweet, Tripp called the video a "body-positive curvy girl summer anthem. "
Tripp said becoming what people refer to as a wife guy was "a natural transition. "
“I think the whole concept of the wife guys is funny. With social media today, everything has to be a thing," Tripp said. "I’m a writer. I’m a poet. I’m a romantic soul. If you scroll all the way back to 2013, that type of post was always typical on my feed. I posted about me marrying the woman of my dreams – me loving her. "
As time progressed, Tripp leveraged his social media fame into brand deals including Dunkin’-themed sneakers. His wife, Sarah, is also a social media influencer.
While he has never referred to himself as a wife guy, Tripp says, "Now that the internet has made it a thing, there’s no doubt that I am the king, the pioneer of the wife guy. Every other is a trending blip that people on Twitter like to laugh about. This is my career. "
While some people use the term "wife guy" as an insult, Tripp says, "There are worse things to be known as than a guy who loves his wife. "

Mass. Senator says he will do 'whatever is necessary' to ensure new Celtics center can travel safely

Texto completo: It's not every day a US senator takes a diplomatic interest in the affairs of a new Boston Celtics signing, but Enes Kanter faces a unique set of challenges.
Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, plans to meet next week with Kanter, the new Celtics center, who has drawn the ire of the Turkish government, a fact that has complicated his foreign travel during his NBA career.
“Senator Markey will do whatever is necessary to make sure Enes Kanter can travel safely outside the United States to do his job, exercise his right to free speech, and help the Boston Celtics win next season," read a Wednesday statement from Markey's office.
Kanter is a vocal critic of Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has been accused of increasingly authoritarian tendencies.
Kanter has called Erdogan “the Hitler of our century." Earlier this year, The New York Times, citing pro-government newspapers, reported Kanter was indicted on a charge of violating a law against insulting Turkey's president, and prosecutors in the country have sought an international arrest warrant for the basketball player because of his support for a Muslim cleric who lives in exile in the US.
Erdogan has accused the cleric, Fethullah Gulen,of instigating a coup attempt against him. Turkish authorities have arrested thousands of people thought to be supporters of Gulen since the failed coup. Gulen has denied involvement in the attempted overthrow.
Kanter has also denied the allegations made by Turkish authorities against him, saying that government cannot present “any single piece of evidence of my wrongdoing."
Markey “hopes to be of assistance and will share his strong support of free expression and his commitment to push back against moves toward authoritarianism overseas, " according to a statement from his office.
It wouldn't be the first time a senator tried to help Kanter.
In May, when Kanter's team, the Portland Trail Blazers, were in the playoffs and there was a chance they would face the Toronto Raptors for the title, US Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, wrote to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau asking his government to facilitate Kanter's safe passage to and from Canada if the Blazers made the championship round, according to the Associated Press.
The Golden State Warriors swept Portland in the Western Conference finals, making the matter moot.
In March, the Associated Press reported Kanter did not travel with the Blazers to Toronto while on a road trip, fearing reprisal for his outspoken disapproval of Erdogan. The Celtics played the Raptors twice in Toronto last year.
During his stint with the New York Knicks earlier in the season, Kanter did not travel for a January game in London because he feared he could be killed or attacked.
Kanter's passport Turkish passport was revoked in 2017 and he was detained in a Romanian airport before being released.
During his introductory Celtics press conference on Wednesday, Kanter addressed his political dissent, saying there “is no freedom, there is no democracy, and there is no human rights" in Turkey.
“What I'm trying to do is just bring awareness to all these people what's really going on in Turkey," he said.

Texto completo: New York, like other metropolitan cities including Philadelphia and Chicago, faces a major rat problem.
According to the New York Times, rat complaints have risen from 12,617 in 2014 to 17,353 last year. That's a 38% jump citywide — and comes even after Mayor Bill de Blasio allocated $32 million in 2017 to reduce the number of the rodents.
"As a result, we saw a 9% decline in rat complaints across the city last year, the biggest drop in 12 years," Seth Stein, a spokesperson for the mayor's office, told USA TODAY.
The mayor's plan focused on Lower Manhattan, Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood and the Grand Concourse along the Bronx, according to the New York Times.
But now, the trash-loving rodent gang has migrated to the city's Upper West Side, according to the New York Post. The neighborhood boasts the highest number of rat complaints across the city.
OpenTheBooks. com analyzed the number of calls for rats to 311 and found that, according to the Post, "the rats are running wild in this fancy area. "
A local publication called West Side Rag agreed that the Upper West Side has an extreme rat problem. "We’re like the Tom Brady of rats. All we do is win," an article reads.
The New York Post reported that since the New York City Department of Sanitation pulled 110 trash cans out of the neighborhood over the last 12 months, trash has been overflowing.
"In the past year, we removed bins in this district because they did not fit the criteria or were being chronically misused," Dina Montes, press secretary for the New York City Department of Sanitation, told USA TODAY.
But the removal of the bins might not be having the proper effect.
Assemblywoman Linda B. Rosenthal of Manhattan told the New York Post that her office receives calls about the trash. “I don’t think removing garbage cans does what they think it is supposed to do. "
Stein said the mayor's office has ordered the Department of Sanitation to stop removing bins immediately: "We will not be removing any of the 800-plus bins the district currently has," said Montes.

Though the number of complaints regarding rats coming from the Upper West Side is the highest, it may not reflect the actual population of rats in the area.
"There has been an increase in complaints, but this, in part, is due to high numbers of duplicate complaints in this neighborhood," Michael Lanza, spokesperson for the New York City Department of Health, told USA TODAY.
The department leaves a 90-day window to address complaints of rats, and any complaints made again within that time are classified as duplicate, Lanza explained.
Melissa Elstein, secretary and co-founder of the West 80s Neighborhood Association, said the problem could be solved if neighborhoods were to institute bins for recycling and for food waste.
The rats come to areas with overflowing trash cans because they are a food source.
Regardless of how the situation is addressed on the Upper West Side, rats are a forever presence in New York City. The Yankees' minor league baseball team even considered a name change to the "Staten Island Pizza Rats" in 2016. They kept it for a season and now it's back by popular demand.

Texto completo: Planned Parenthood on Tuesday removed its president after less than a year in the job, seeking new leadership at a time when abortion rights have come under increasing attack from statehouses and Republicans in Washington.
The sudden ouster reflected a widening disagreement between the president, Leana Wen, and the board of directors over her management style and which direction to steer one of the nation's leading women's reproductive rights groups.
Her departure followed a series of negotiations that appeared to end acrimoniously on Tuesday. In a Twitter post, Dr. Wen said her fate had been decided at a "secret meeting," which the organization disputed. She later issued a statement saying she was "leaving because the new board chairs and I have philosophical differences over the direction and future of Planned Parenthood."
The urgency of the abortion issue appeared to be at the heart of the disagreement. Dr. Wen, the first physician to lead the organization in decades, said that she believed "the best way to protect abortion care is to be clear that it is not a political issue but a health care one, and that we can expand support for reproductive rights."
But four people familiar with the matter said the group's board of directors felt it needed a more aggressive political leader to combat the current efforts to roll back access to abortions.
[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter. ]
Dr. Wen's brief tenure -- she took over last November -- coincided with a particularly fraught moment for abortion-rights advocates. In recent months, Republican-controlled statehouses in Ohio, Alabama, Indiana, Louisiana and Missouri have moved decisively to restrict abortion access as they take aim at the protections enshrined in Roe v. Wade.
That has put abortion rights groups, including Planned Parenthood, on the defensive as they battle conservative messaging, much of it ominous and some of it false, such as claims about infanticide.
And in Washington this week, Planned Parenthood is confronting a new Trump administration rule stating that taxpayer-funded family planning clinics must stop referring women for abortions.
With health centers nationwide, Planned Parenthood receives close to $ 60 million each year through the federal family planning program, and the new edict is widely seen as being aimed at the organization. The Trump administration won a key victory last week as the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit declined to block it from enforcing the rule.
Anti-abortion groups were quick to respond to Dr. Wen's ouster on Tuesday. Americans United for Life, a leading anti-abortion legal firm, said in a statement that Dr. Wen "has consistently traded on her training as a physician to perpetuate Planned Parenthood's falsehood that 'abortion is health care."' It promised to pursue court victories "until we reach a post-Roe v. Wade era."
The conservative anti-abortion push gained momentum after Brett M. Kavanaugh replaced Anthony M. Kennedy on the Supreme Court, giving conservatives a possible fifth vote to uphold new limits on abortion.
Amanda Skinner, the president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood Southern New England, said the attacks from Republicans represented an "alarming" moment for abortion-rights supporters.
"This is a crisis time in terms of the impact on the patients we serve and the communities we serve," she said, adding: "I think that Dr. Wen is obviously a very thoughtful leader in health care. I think what is critical for Planned Parenthood is how much we all have to really lean hard on all of the elements of our mission." (Those elements are health care, education and advocacy.)
Planned Parenthood, a more than 100-year-old organization with 600 affiliated health centers nationwide, has simultaneously served as both a health care provider for millions -- it provides cancer screenings, contraception, disease testing and abortion services -- as well as one of the leading advocacy organizations for women's reproductive rights.
The group's board voted unanimously on Tuesday to appoint Alexis McGill Johnson, the co-founder of the Perception Institute, an anti-bias research group, to temporarily replace Dr. Wen. Ms. McGill Johnson will serve as acting president and chief executive of both Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the nonprofit that provide health care services, and Planned Parenthood Action Fund, its political arm.
In a joint statement, Aimee Cunningham and Jennie Rosenthal, the chairwomen of the two Planned Parenthood boards, said, "We thank Dr. Leana Wen for her service to Planned Parenthood in such a pivotal time and extend our best wishes for her continued success."
A 36-year-old former health commissioner in Baltimore, Dr. Wen was among Time magazine's 100 most influential people earlier this year. She replaced the group's longtime leader, Cecile Richards, a former Democratic political aide and the daughter of the former Texas governor Ann Richards, who had been a forceful voice on the national stage for women in general and abortion rights in particular.
But inside Planned Parenthood, there had been significant turnover at the top of the organization since Dr. Wen's arrival and disagreements over the group's direction.
Multiple senior officials at Planned Parenthood have departed since Dr. Wen's appointment, including Dawn Laguens, the former executive vice president; Deirdre Schifeling, the former executive director of the group's political arm; and Wendi Wallace, the group's former director of political outreach. A top official, Dana Singiser, was announced as the senior vice president for policy, advocacy and campaigns in January, but instead departed the organization months later. Another Planned Parenthood vice president announced taking a new job this week.
Dr. Wen arrived last fall at Planned Parenthood with a compelling life story, having grown up poor and on Medicaid in California after her family moved there from China.
"When I was 16 and I wanted information about birth control, Planned Parenthood was the first and only place that I could think of going for my health care and education," she told The New York Times in May.
She would rise to serve as health commissioner in Baltimore, working to close racial disparities in health care outcomes there as she sued the Trump administration for cutting teen pregnancy funds.
But former Planned Parenthood officials said she was quickly seen as a poor fit as top talent departed. The board and Dr. Wen had been discussing her future at the organization for several weeks, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Earlier this month, Dr. Wen wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post disclosing her own recent miscarriage and how she was recovering over the Fourth of July weekend.
"I decided to write about my experience because I want to break the silence and shame that often come with pregnancy loss," she wrote. "I also write because my miscarriage has made my commitment to women's health even stronger."
Dr. Wen's replacement, Ms. McGill Johnson, has served on Planned Parenthood's board for nearly a decade, including previously as its chairwoman.
"I am proud to step in to serve as acting president and facilitate a smooth leadership transition in this critical moment for Planned Parenthood and the patients and communities we serve," Ms. McGill Johnson said in a statement. "I thank Dr. Wen for her service and her commitment to patients."

Texto completo: John Paul Stevens, who was named a Supreme Court associate justice in 1975 because of his judicial centrism yet came to be its most consistently liberal vote, died Tuesday at a hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He was 99.
A Supreme Court announcement said Justice Stevens had suffered a stroke Monday.
Justice Stevens, who stepped down from the court in 2010, at age 90, was the second-oldest justice to serve, after Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., and his nearly 35-year tenure was the third longest in the court's history. Appointed by a Republican president, Gerald Ford, he was praised by a Democratic incumbent, Barack Obama, when he left the court.
Obama appointed Elena Kagan to his seat.
In a statement late Tuesday, Chief Justice John Roberts said, "He brought to our bench an inimitable blend of kindness, humility, wisdom and independence. His unrelenting commitment to justice has left us a better nation."
With his white hair, bow tie, and puckish smile, Justice Stevens had the look of an avuncular professor. He had a reputation for great kindliness — “If Stevens ran a gas station, it would be a wonderful place to work," one of his law clerks once observed — and also for brilliance and intellectual flair. In 1988, Justice Harry Blackmun described him as “perhaps the most imaginative of all of us."
A “judge's judge," Justice Stevens prided himself on writing his own opinions. After his retirement, he frequently wrote articles for The New York Review of Books and published several books, including “Five Chiefs: A Supreme Court Memoir" (2011) and “Six Amendments: How and Why We Should Change the Constitution" (2014). In a 2018 op-ed article in The New York Times, Justice Stevens called for repeal of the Second Amendment.
“He writes his opinions himself and he writes them in English," Susan Estrich, a University of Southern California law professor who once clerked for Justice Stevens, wrote in USA Today in 1995. “Maybe he would have had more influence on the court if he'd been more interested in winning five votes than in thinking."
Preferring to go his own way, Justice Stevens eschewed behind-the-scenes politicking and coalition building. “The audience that I most frequently address," he said of his fellow justices in a 1986 speech, “does not always seem to be listening to what I have to say."
That changed in 1994. That year Justice Stevens became senior justice, which meant he assigned opinions whenever the chief justice wasn't in the majority.
During his first term, Justice Stevens set a record for individual dissents for a freshman justice. It set a standard for independence he would maintain throughout his term on the high court. Justice Byron White nicknamed Justice Stevens “the one-eyed jack" because he so often went his own way, writing such a large number of dissents and concurring opinions.
For many years, a running joke among Supreme Court law clerks was that a ruling would be “4, 4, and Stevens" or “5, 3, and Stevens."
“I just usually have trouble with the main dissent or the majority opinion, and don't quite agree with the rationale," Justice Stevens once said. “I think I have an obligation to explain my own reasoning."
Justice Stevens did his explaining in notably clear and forthright prose.
“We simply hold that when the commission finds that a pig has entered the parlor, the exercise of its regulatory power does not depend on proof that the pig is obscene," he wrote in his majority opinion in the Court's 1978 ruling upholding the Federal Communications Commission's decency standard.
In his 2000 Bush v. Gore dissent, he ringingly declared, “Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of the this year's presidential election, the identity of the loser is perfectly clear. It is the nation's confidence in the judge as the impartial guardian of the rule of law."
A judicial maverick, Justice Stevens was predictable only in his unpredictability. Although his vote was crucial in helping restore the constitutionality of the death penalty in 1976, he frequently voted to curb its use. He was a strong defender of the First Amendment, yet he cast a heated dissent when the court judged flag burning to fall under the heading of free speech in 1989.
“I'm the most conservative justice up here," Justice Stevens liked to say. By conservative, he meant observing legal precedents and avoiding sweeping rulings. Even so, he was widely considered the leader of the court's liberal wing during much of his final two decades on the bench.
Justice Stevens was born in Chicago on April 20, 1920, the fourth and youngest son of Ernest James Stevens and Elizabeth (Street) Stevens. He grew up a child of privilege. His father had built the largest hotel on Michigan Avenue, the Stevens Hotel. As a boy, Justice Stevens met the aviators Amelia Earhart and Charles Lindbergh. Apparently, the meetings made an impression: For many years, Justice Stevens piloted his own plane.
He was also at Wrigley Field for the 1932 World Series game where Babe Ruth is said to have called his home run.
Justice Stevens attended the University of Chicago's Laboratory School, where he was cocaptain of the soccer team and picked up the habit of wearing a bow tie. He had difficulty tying more traditional neckware.
An English major, he studied Shakespeare with Norman Maclean, who would later write the classic novella “A River Runs Through It," at the University of Chicago
“He taught me to read every word of a poem," Justice Stevens said in a 2002 address. “That training helped me later, when trying to decipher law statutes."
Justice Stevens earned his bachelor's degree in 1941 and joined the Navy a year later. Stationed in Washington, he was awarded a Bronze Star for his work breaking Japanese codes.
After the war, he attended Northwestern Law School, where he graduated first in his class, and earned the highest grade point average in the school's history. He clerked for Associate Justice Wiley Rutledge during the Supreme Court's 1947-48 term.
Justice Stevens spent the next two decades in private practice in Chicago, gaining a reputation as one of the nation's foremost antitrust experts. He took time out during the early '50s to serve as associate counsel for a House subcommittee studying monopoly. He also taught antitrust law at Northwestern and the University of Chicago.
In 1969, Justice Stevens served as general counsel for an Illinois state crime commission investigating public corruption. The commission's findings led to the resignation of two state Supreme Court justices and brought Justice Stevens widespread praise.
In 1970, Richard Nixon nominated him as a judge for the US Circuit Court of Appeals on the recommendation of a University of Chicago classmate, US Senator Charles Percy, an Illinois Republican.
Five years later, Justice Stevens helped solve a thorny problem for President Ford. Ford had to fill the seat of Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, whose impeachment then-House minority leader Ford had urged a few years earlier. The president needed the least-objectionable nominee possible.
“Find me another Lewis Powell," Ford told Attorney General Edward Levi, referring to a sitting justice whose nomination by Nixon had elicited no controversy and much praise. Levi offered the name of Justice Stevens, describing him as a “moderate conservative in his approach to judicial problems."
Justice Stevens's nomination was widely hailed.
“He's a first-rate lawyer, a first-rate judge, and a first-rate person — more than that you can't ask for," said University of Chicago law professor Philip Kurland.
The confirmation hearings took less than two days.
“It is the business of a judge to decide cases on the narrowest grounds possible and not to reach out for constitutional questions," he told the Senate Judiciary Committee. “You don't have the freedom to substitute your own views for the law."
The Senate confirmed him unanimously.
In 2005, Ford said “I am prepared to allow history's judgment of my term in office to rest (if necessary, exclusively) on my nomination 30 years ago of Justice John Paul Stevens to the US Supreme Court."
In 1979, Justice Stevens divorced his first wife, Elizabeth (Sheeren) Stevens, and married Maryan (Mulholland) Stevens. She died in 2015.
He leaves two daughters, Elizabeth Jane Sesemann and Susan Roberta Mullen, nine grandchildren, and 13 great-grandchildren, according to The New York Times.
A bronze life master in bridge, Justice Stevens was a devoted tennis player, golfer, and ocean swimmer. In a 2014 interview, he told The New York Times that he no longer went into the water alone.
“My ocean swimming," he lamented, “is dependent on the availability of handy lifeguards."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — John Paul Stevens, the second oldest and third longest-serving Supreme Court justice in history and a Republican president's nominee who went on to lead the court's liberal wing, died Tuesday. He was 99.
Stevens died in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, from complications of a stroke he suffered on Monday, according to a Supreme Court of the United States press release.
“On behalf of the Court and retired Justices, I am saddened to report that our colleague Justice John Paul Stevens has passed away," Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said in the release. "He brought to our bench an inimitable blend of kindness, humility, wisdom, and independence. His unrelenting commitment to justice has left us a better nation. We extend our deepest condolences to his children Elizabeth and Susan, and to his extended family. ”
In a statement late Tuesday night, the White House said President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump offered "their deepest condolences to the family and friends" of the retired justice and noted his military service, legal acumen and "affection for his beloved Chicago Cubs. "
"His work over the course of nearly 35 years on the Supreme Court will continue to shape the legal framework of our Nation for years to come. His passion for the law and for our country will not soon be forgotten," the statement said.
For 35 years, Stevens’ trademark bow tie and gentle mien belied a competitive edge that turned up in his opinions and dissents, most often defending the rights of individuals against the government.
Stevens’ brand of conservatism – a term he insisted still applied until his retirement in 2010 – all but disappeared during his long and distinguished career. He was a proud veteran of World War II and a code-breaker who went on to become a corruption-buster in his native Chicago. President Gerald Ford not only nominated him in 1975 but proudly defended him 30 years later in a letter to USA TODAY.
“I am prepared to allow history’s judgment of my term in office to rest (if necessary, exclusively) on my nomination thirty years ago of Justice John Paul Stevens to the U. S. Supreme Court,” Ford wrote a year before his death.
In lengthy interviews with The New Yorker and The New York Times near the end of his career, Stevens insisted that he had not changed his stripes but had simply withstood the court’s transformation from liberal to conservative. During that time, he came to align more with the court’s liberals than its new brand of conservatives, eventually becoming the senior justice on that side with the power to assign opinions and dissents.
Those dissents often went to himself and were perhaps his greatest contribution. In his last term, he penned a 90-page dissent to the court’s decision in Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission, which gave corporations the right to spend freely on elections.
“While American democracy is imperfect, few outside the majority of this court would have thought its flaws included a dearth of corporate money in politics,” he wrote.
And a decade earlier, he led the opponents of the high court's ruling in Bush v. Gore, which ended the Florida recount and handed the 2000 election to George W. Bush.
“Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this year’s presidential election, the identity of the loser is perfectly clear," he wrote. "It is the nation’s confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law. ”
That concern over impartiality led Stevens to oppose Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation in October 2018, following Kavanaugh's intemperate performance at the Senate Judiciary Committee's hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct during his youth.
Guns, abortion, death penalty
On other issues, Stevens appeared to be a true liberal. He fiercely opposed Associate Justice Antonin Scalia’s opinion in 2008 that said the Second Amendment gave Americans the right to keep guns at home for self-defense, later calling for its repeal. And he stood firmly behind women's right to choose their reproductive future.
"The societal costs of overruling (Roe v. Wade) at this late date would be enormous," he wrote in a 1992 case. "Roe is an integral part of a correct understanding of both the concept of liberty and the basic equality of men and women. ”
Stevens enjoyed his share of victories on the closely-divided court, including on a series of cases during Bush’s administration that gave prisoners at Guantanamo Bay the right to challenge their incarceration in U. S. courts, rather than military tribunals.
And in his last decade, the court also upheld the McCain-Feingold campaign finance law and banned the use of the death penalty against juveniles and those with intellectual disabilities, with Stevens leading the liberal wing against the court’s conservatives.
His greatest regret, he would later say, was his vote in 1976 to reinstate the death penalty after a four-year hiatus. By the end of his time on the high court, he had decided capital punishment was unconstitutional.
Court's last World War II vet
Born in 1920, Stevens enlisted in the Navy just hours before the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor and later served out his time there as a cryptographer. His fierce patriotism led him to oppose the Supreme Court’s ruling that burning the American flag was a protected form of speech – a decision even Scalia supported.
Stevens had plans to become an English teacher until he was convinced he should attend Northwestern University School of Law, where he graduated at the top of his class in two years.
Content as a lawyer in Chicago, he was entering his sixth decade when President Richard Nixon named him to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit in 1970. Five years later, Ford named him to succeed Justice William O. Douglas, whose record 36 years on the high court Stevens nearly matched. He was succeeded by Justice Elena Kagan in 2010.
Over the years, Stevens survived both prostate cancer and heart bypass surgery and was the picture of good health. He would spend nearly half the time the court was in session at his condominium in Fort Lauderdale, reading briefs on the beach between tennis and golf matches. He swam in the Atlantic Ocean regularly until recent years, when he decided he was no longer safe without someone nearby to help him get out.
A devoted Chicago Cubs fan, Stevens was at Wrigley Field in 1932 when the New York Yankees’ Babe Ruth called his famous shot to center field. He threw out the first pitch at age 85, and attended Game 4 of the 2016 World Series in a red bowtie and Cubs jacket.
'Maybe I should have had seven'
Since retiring from the court, Stevens maintained an active schedule of public speaking and wrote three books: “Five Chiefs: A Supreme Court Memoir,” “Six Amendments: How and Why We Should Change the Constitution,” and "The Making of a Justice: Reflections on My First 94 Years. "
“It’s certainly not easy to get the Constitution amended, and perhaps that’s one flaw in the Constitution that I don’t mention in the book,” he said during a wide-ranging interview with USA TODAY in 2014. While the book called for six new amendments, he mused, “Maybe I should have had seven. ”
During the interview, Stevens correctly predicted the court would soon address same-sex marriage and government surveillance programs, and he said the court’s 2008 decision on guns wouldn’t be the final word.
As for bringing cameras into the court, Stevens was a traditionalist. “If you leave it up to members of the court, I don’t think there’s a chance in the foreseeable future,” he said. “The downside is that whenever you bring television into a new arena, you’re never sure what’s going to happen. ”
And as for retirement, Stevens reveled in the time for golf, tennis and reading – lots of reading, particularly history.
“It’s amazing,” he said, “how many interesting things there are to learn about the world. ”

Texto completo: It would seem that the band of young progressives in Congress driving the Democratic Party to the left have struck a chord in American politics.
Our Question of the Week for readers: Is it a symphonic G major, or a flat discord?
Even the Executive Branch Tweeter in Chief seems to be fascinated by the group.
Are especially the members of “The Squad” — the four young women members of Congress President Trump told to “go back” to ancestral home countries over the weekend — creating important new policy discussions that will add oomph to the Democrats’ brand?
Or are they a danger to their party, increasing the chances that Trump will easily be re-elected by an American people worried about radicalism under the banner of “democratic socialism”?
In a recent New York Times interview, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was fairly critical of The Squad, which is made up of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Michigan, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minnesota and Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Massachusetts.
The irony of course is that Pelosi has long been viewed by many Americans as a stalwart liberal from elitist San Francisco. If she is instead the leader of the moderate wing of the Democratic Party, does that mean the center cannot hold?
The four were the only Democrats to vote against the House version of a border funding bill backed by Pelosi. The speaker angrily said they had supporters in “their Twitter world” but not on Capitol Hill.
But after the racially tinged tweets from the president, Pelosi spoke out in support of her junior colleagues.
Some note that The Squad and other newly elected House Democrats are really more representative through their youth of the Millennial generation than of their ethnic backgrounds.
Will they energize young people who haven’t been involved in the political process before? Will they bring to the polls some minority voters who stayed out of the Hillary Clinton-Trump election in 2016?

Has the media 'sanitized' the accusations against Jeffrey Epstein?

Texto completo: As Jeffrey Epstein, the registered sex offender and wealthy financier, faced charges of sex trafficking girls as young as 14 in federal court this week, the investigative reporting of Julie K. Brown of the Miami Herald received credit for reigniting the case 11 years after Epstein's plea deal for soliciting minors for prostitution.
But other media outlets have drawn critique from some sexual abuse survivors and advocates who point to language choices they say sanitize the accusations against Epstein, who has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
The media has been blasted for using terms such as "underage women" instead of "children," for saying "sex with minors" instead of "rape," for using the phrase "paid for sex," which they say erases coercion.
Epstein fallout: Trump's Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta resigns
"When journalists use words associated with consensual sex to report on sexual assault, they omit the very elements that make it a headline in the first place … coercion, threats, violence, manipulation … or even the legal charges. Legally, there is no such thing as 'sex with a minor. ' It’s instead recognized as statutory sexual assault, child sexual abuse, rape, or corruption of minors, or any other legal charge … but 'sex' by itself implies consent," said Kristen Houser, chief public affairs officer at the National Sexual Violence Resource Center.
Experts in human trafficking, sexual violence, law and media ethics say the media's language around such cases reflect a combination of factors, including adherence to legal definitions rather than colloquial terms, avoiding words that would compromise the presumption of innocence prior to conviction and reporting limitations, such as having access to court documents but not victims.
But experts also note that word choices carry weight and excessive caution could whitewash the charges.
Epstein's alleged targets: 'The more vulnerable the better'
'Underage women' vs. 'children'
Dozens of news outlets have referred to Epstein's victims as "underage women":
Fox News: "The businessman stands accused of sexually abusing underage women at his residences in Florida and New York. "
New York Magazine: "Jeffrey Epstein, the man now accused of running a sex trafficking ring involving underage women, some of them in their early teens. "
New York Times: "Very embarrassing that [Labor Secretary Alexander] Acosta is one of the people who’s supposed to protect underage women from being sold as sex slaves. "
Donna Hughes, a leading international researcher on human trafficking, said she finds the term "strange. "
"A female under the age of 18 is a girl, while a female over 18 is a woman or young woman," she said. "Using the term 'underage woman' implies that she is a mature woman, but the law has made her 'underage. ' The implication is that the law could be changed to lower the age of consent —- or even eliminate it. . . . Personally, I would not use 'underage woman. '"
Houser said the term is inaccurate.
"It is a word that implies the ability to make adult choices such as engaging in an adult sexual relationship," she said. "But that’s not the case in this story. It would be more appropriate to say 'teenaged girls' or 'girls' or 'children. '"
In a post on the website Fatherly, "Stop Calling Epstein’s Victims Young Women. They're Children," the writer says "in no world is a 14-year-old an underage woman. "
"Proper terminology is important," the post read. "And using the incorrect terms obscures the fact that Epstein, a billionaire adult, is accused of assaulting children and trafficking them for nonconsensual sexual acts. "
A spokesperson for New York Magazine said going forward it will use “children” or “underage girls” depending on context.
'Sex with minors' vs. 'rape'
In referencing Epstein's previous plea deal, Bloomberg wrote that the "agreement allowed the wealthy money manager to dodge federal charges for having sex with minors. "
In a Facebook post that has since gone viral, a childhood rape survivor took issue with the term, saying, "it's rape. Call it rape. "
"When we use our 'polite words,' we create the impression that sexual abusers aren't really THAT bad," Jenna Glatzer wrote.
Experts say one reason why reporters are not using the term "rape" in this week's coverage is because it is not used in the legal definition of sex trafficking.
"The crimes the media is reporting on are federal crimes — there is no federal rape statute per se — they are using the language federal prosecutors are using, which is the language of sex trafficking," said Martina Vandenberg, founder and president of the Human Trafficking Legal Center,
Donna Hughes, a leading international researcher on human trafficking, said rather than “sex with a minor," she would say “victim of child sex trafficking. "
Gene Rossi, who has three decades of criminal and civil litigation experience at the U. S. Department of Justice, says sometimes the media can be overly cautious.
"Generically, there is no legal barrier to a reporter calling it as it is," Rossi said. "The media tend to somewhat sugarcoat the essence of the allegation when it comes to sexual violence. . . . It would be like if someone was accused of murder and the article on the murder said 'the alleged defendant took the life of of another person. '"
'Paid for sex'
A story in the Washington Times this week read, "Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein ran a 'vast network of underage victims' he paid for sex. "
Houser said she takes issue with that term when referring to victims under the age of 18.
"When we say 'paid for sex' it erases the coercion, manipulation, intimidation or even violence inherent in the situation and instead sanitizes it to sound like a business transaction between consenting people," she said.
What the media has done right
Despite some criticism, experts say many news organizations have used proper terminology and given the Epstein case appropriate weight.
"I think the media is doing a good job stressing that it is a big and dramatic event," Rossi said. "That this could be a small part of a bigger puzzle. "
As Vandenberg notes, there might not have been a case if not for Brown's November investigation on Epstein. The Herald identified about 80 victims who alleged they were abused by Epstein from 2001 to 2006.
"This story is a tribute to the power of investigative reporting, because this case would have died long ago," she said. "Those girls, now women, would have been completely forgotten but for this one journalist who would not let it go. "

Texto completo: Ahora resulta que otra persona reclama ser quien presentó al presidente Donald Trump y a la primera dama Melania Trump .
En el libro “El método de la locura: el ascenso de Donald Trump según lo dicho por aquellos que fueron contratados, despedidos, inspirados e investidos” , escrito por Allen Salkin y Aaron Short se afirma que el empresario italiano Paolo Zampolli fue quien a la pareja presidencia.
La información fue revelada en Page Six y desmiente los reportes The New York Times de que supuestamente Jeffrey Epstein –acusado de tráfico sexual de menores– afirmó haber presentado al presidente Trump y a su ahora esposa en 1998.
Según el relato de Salkin y Short preguntaron al empresario Zampolli, si Epstein había asistido a la fiesta donde supuestamente se conoció la pareja presidencial.
“¡De ninguna manera!” , fue su respuesta. Agregó que la noticia de que Epstein había presentado al mandatario y la exmodelo fueron calificadas de falsas.
De esa afirmación, lo único que no cambió fue que la pareja se conoció durante una fiesta en la Semana de la Moda.
La Primera Dama ha contado que conoció a Trump en el Kit Kat Club en Nueva York en 1998 .
Reportes indican que en aquel entonces, la exmodelo no tenía suficiente dinero, por lo que conocer al empresario neoyorquino fue “su salvación”.

Texto completo: Daryl Impey of South Africa won Stage 9 of the Tour de France, on a day when the top contenders for the overall race victory were happy to take it easy far behind on the hilly trek through the Massif Central mountains. Impey pointed to the South African flag printed on his jersey as he crossed the line in the agricultural town of Brioude, having beaten Belgian rider Tiesj Benoot in a two-man sprint. They were part of a 14-man group that rode away shortly after the stage start in the mining town of Saint-Etienne. Because none of the breakaway riders were contenders for the Tour title in Paris on July 28, race leader Julian Alaphilippe and other top riders allowed them to scoot off ahead. The stage victory was Impey's first in seven Tours. He also held the race lead for two days at the 2013 Tour.
SOCCER
Women's equal-pay bid gets a boost One of US Soccer's official sponsors has sided with the World Cup-winning US women's team in its fight with the federation for equal pay, urging its partner, the governing body for soccer in the United States, “to be on the right side of history." The sponsor, Procter & Gamble, declared its support for equal pay in a full-page ad in Sunday's editions of The New York Times. It is the first of more than a dozen US Soccer partners and sponsors to side so openly with the team in the equal pay fight, and its support could increase the pressure on federation officials on the eve of mediation discussions to try to resolve the players' federal gender discrimination lawsuit.
Football
Players union rejects 18-game season The leader of the NFL Players Association shot down a proposal from league owners to expand the regular season to 18 games, a sign that both sides remain diametrically opposed in what will be one of the linchpin issues in the league's next labor deal. Owners suggested lengthening the season by two games, but capping players' participation to only 16 of them to conform to the union's player-safety concerns about a longer season. But DeMaurice Smith , the NFLPA's executive director, dismissed the idea. "If somebody wants to make an 18-game proposal, we'll look at it," he told ESPN on Friday. "I haven't seen anything that makes me think that it would be good for the players."
WNBA
Sun snap four-game losing streak Jonquel Jones had 16 points, 8 rebounds, 3 steals, and 3 blocks to help the Connecticut Sun beat the Indiana Fever, 76-63, and snap a four-game road losing streak. Jasmine Thomas added 14 points and Shekinna Stricklen scored 12, hitting four 3-pointers . . . The Seattle Storm cleared Natasha Howard to play Sunday night against the New York Liberty, a day after her wife posted a video that alleged abuse. The team issued a statement that the All-Star forward would be in the lineup. Team officials said they are still looking into allegations on social media that Howard had physically threatened and abused her wife.

With the safety car still out after Antonio Giovinazzi spun off in his Alfa Romeo, Hamilton rejoined ahead of pole-sitter Bottas.

Texto completo: Grabbing a copy of the newspaper at your favorite coffee shop is a thing of the past, at least it is if you frequent Starbucks.
The coffee chain will quit selling USA TODAY as well as The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal in more than 8,600 U. S. stores in September. Starbucks has sold The Times since 2000 and other papers since 2010.
The New York Post first reported Starbucks' decision to drop newspapers.
The decision was attributed to the decline of in-store sales of newspapers.
"We are always looking at what we offer our customers in our stores and making adjustments to our portfolio based on changing customer behavior," said Starbucks spokesperson Sanja Gould. "As part of our continuous efforts to enhance the overall experience in our stores for both partners and customers, we are removing select fixtures from our retail lobby in September. "
These fixtures include shelves with whole bean coffee and snacks, although these items will be available elsewhere in the store.
Newspapers won't necessarily be out at all Starbucks locations. Licensed locations in hospitals, universities and other institutions might continue to sell newspapers since they are not operated by the coffee chain itself.
The company has looked to simplify and reduce the number of products included in the store, including tumblers and specialty drinks, based on what customers are buying.

Though java and journalism have been a classic pairing for generations, indeed, the smells and smears of newsprint are in decline. While some papers are adding digital subscribers, newspaper weekday circulation has declined by more than half since its peak in the mid-'80s.
The Times says it is "disappointed" and the Journal confirmed that Starbucks is stopping print sales. No one was immediately available to comment from Gannett, the parent company of USA TODAY.
This isn't the first time Starbucks has decided old media is too passe for its cafes. It dropped the sale of CDs – remember those? – in 2015. .

Texto completo: Southwest Key houses migrant children; he left amid earnings criticism
The former leader of a nonprofit organization that shelters migrant children for the U.S. government resigned this year after it was publicly disclosed that he earned nearly $1.5 million in 2016. New tax records obtained by The Washington Post indicate he earned more than double that - $3.6 million - in total compensation in 2017.
Juan Sanchez, founder of Southwest Key Programs, the Texas-based nonprofit that houses thousands of children and teens for the Department of Health and Human Services, left his job on April 1 amid outrage over his compensation and business dealings. Members of Congress fumed about individuals profiting off migrant detention just as the Trump administration was separating migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border, prosecuting adults for illegal entry and shuttling their children to Southwest Key and other shelters.
Southwest Key is one of the main contractors involved in housing unaccompanied migrant children as they wait to be placed with family members or sponsors, housing approximately 4,500 minors in Texas, California and Arizona. The organization cares for just more than one-third of the 12,500 minors in HHS custody.
Southwest Key has an annual contract of approximately $460 million a year to shelter children, and federal records show the nonprofit has collected more than $1.1 billion since 2014.
Housing children during the migrant crisis has created a major financial strain for HHS, which in May suspended English classes, soccer and legal aid for children until Congress approved a $4.6 billion supplemental funding package that included money for migrant care. But it also has created a boon for those who provide HHS housing, with contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars; BCFS Health and Human Services recently received a $300 million contract to run an emergency shelter in Carrizo Springs, Tex.
Southwest Key is one of several contractors that have come under scrutiny during the migration surge that has led to the U.S. government's crackdown on illegal immigration.
Sanchez's income is detailed in a tax filing by Promesa Public Schools, Inc., a subsidiary of Southwest Key that manages the nonprofit's Texas charter schools in Austin, Brownsville and Corpus Christi. Southwest Key's separate tax returns are due this month and will not show additional income for Sanchez, according to a Southwest Key official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details that have not yet been released.
Sanchez did not respond to a request for comment. A representative for Sanchez declined to comment and referred questions to Southwest Key.
In an interview last year, Sanchez told The Post that his salary increase in 2016 reflected a retirement contribution rather than a pay bump, noting that he for years had worked for a low salary and no benefits. He said Southwest Key's work was critical to providing a safe environment for children.
"We had nothing," he said in June 2018, referring to the early years of Southwest Key. "No benefits, no 401(k), no insurance. We just go out there keeping kids out of prisons and jails."
In 2017, Sanchez received more than $1 million in cash payments - nearly $784,000 in base salary and $238,500 in bonus pay, according to records filed with the Internal Revenue Service and obtained by The Post. Sanchez's largest source of income was $2.5 million paid in a cash-value life insurance and retirement policy.
Joella Brooks, the interim chief executive of Southwest Key, said Sanchez's increase in compensation "had nothing to do with the number of youth in our care." She attributed the increase to the life insurance and retirement policy the Southwest Key board approved for Sanchez, Brooks and a few other organization leaders.
Brooks said the retirement and life insurance policy has since been discontinued and that Sanchez "forfeited hundreds of thousands of unvested dollars from this program as a result of his departure. That money has been returned to Southwest Key."
Other executives who have left Southwest Key have been required to return a significant amount of unvested funds, and Brooks and other leaders agreed to return portions of the life insurance benefits they received, according to Southwest Key.
Sanchez also has a financial stake in a Southwest Key shelter in Conroe, Tex., which the nonprofit said he is trying to sell.
Several of Southwest Key's top executives have resigned in recent months, and Brooks said the nonprofit has hired a new chief financial officer, reexamined pay incentives and that the organization is trying to steer itself in a different direction.
"The new team I'm building in Austin is committed to transparency and doing all we can to continue the good work done in the decades of Southwest Key's existence and address issues related to decisions made in the past," Brooks said. "As the leader of our organization, I am committed to taking corrective action when necessary and restoring the faith and trust in our operations."
Brooks's pay package totaled $488,000 in 2016, the most recent year available for Southwest Key. She was the chief operating officer at the time.
Among the top officials who have departed in recent months are Sanchez's wife, Jennifer, a former Southwest Key vice president who earned more than $510,000 in 2016, according to financial records.
Southwest Key's former chief financial adviser, who earned $1 million in 2016, also stepped down earlier this year after the New York Times detailed allegations of mismanagement and possible wrongdoing at Southwest Key, leading to an internal investigation and a separate Justice Department probe. The vice president for immigrant children's services at Southwest Key earned nearly $1.4 million in 2017, more than double her pay the year before, according to Promesa's 2017 tax filings. That official left Southwest Key on Friday, according to the nonprofit.
The two former officials could not be reached for comment.
Brooks said Southwest Key has been a state-licensed child-care provider for more than 20 years, caring for underage children who arrive at the U.S.-Mexico border without a parent or guardian. Most of the children are from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, and they stay at the shelters for an average of 30 to 40 days.
She said the nonprofit's shelters - including Casa Padre, which houses more than 1,000 minors in a converted Walmart in Brownsville, Tex. - provide classroom education, recreation, arts and crafts, music, entertainment and field trips.
Most shelters are smaller, housing 100 to 150 minors in dormitory-like settings.
"I'm proud of the tens of thousands of lives we've helped change for the better across decades of service," Brooks said. "And we stand ready to help tens of thousands more who want to pursue a better future for themselves."
HHS officials have said they are on track this fiscal year to shelter the largest number of unaccompanied children in their history - more than 63,000 so far, already exceeding last year's total. Under federal law, HHS is required to feed and house the minors until case workers can place them with a parent or another vetted sponsor to await their immigration proceedings in the United States.
Sanchez, 72, who said he holds a doctorate in education from Harvard, was raised on the Mexican border in Brownsville. He founded Southwest Key in 1987 to focus on juvenile justice programs. The organization shifted in the late 1990s to running shelters for migrant children, and as its numbers grew, his pay soared.
He earned $786,222 in 2015, according to forms submitted to the IRS. The next year, his Southwest Key pay package nearly doubled to $1.48 million, according to the IRS forms filed by the charter schools.
U.S. Rep. Sylvia Garcia (D-Tex.) has criticized Southwest Key because of "allegations of self-dealing and abuse reported from their facilities," and she has called on federal agencies to stop working with the organization. When Sanchez resigned, Garcia lauded the move but said it would do little to fix the problems, and she vowed to continue to oppose the organization's work with children: "His resignation will in no way shift our commitment to holding Southwest Key Programs accountable for their negligence and misconduct."

Sólo 3 celdas separan a El Chapo de Epstein, magnate amigo de Trump detenido por sexo con niñas

Texto completo: Un giro inesperado del destino ha convetido al narcotraficante mexicano Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán en vecino del magnate Jeffrey Epstein, ex amigo de Donald Trump y Bill Clinton.
Sólo 3 celdas los separan en el Centro Correccional Metropolitano, en el Bajo Manhattan (150 Park Row). Pero estos famosos presos no pueden verse, porque están aislados.
Epstein se encuentra bajo custodia desde el 6 de julio por cargos de que contrató a niñas de 14 años para masajes desnudos que incluyeron contacto sexual en sus hogares de Nueva York y Palm Beach. Se declaró “no culpable” el lunes y su caso apenas “recomienza” tras un acuerdo de 2008 en Florida; mientras, “El Chapo”, extraditado desde México en 2017, ya fue declarado culpable y está programado para ser sentenciado esta próxima semana.
Epstein está en la celda número 4, tres puertas más abajo de “El Chapo”, preso en la número 1.
“El lugar es tan asqueroso”, dijo a New York Post el abogado del mexicano, Jeffrey Lichtman.
“Si no tienes contacto humano allí arriba, empiezas a perder la razón. Presumiblemente, Epstein tendrá la capacidad de contratar personas para que lo visiten. De lo contrario, se volverá loco “, dijo.
El abogado de Epstein, Marc Fernich, no devolvió un mensaje para comentar las condiciones de la cárcel. Pero la defensa del magnate ha pedido que lo dejen aguardar el juicio en su mansión de siete pisos en el Upper East Side, y se espera que el juez tome una decisión al respecto este lunes.
Mientras, en el explosivo caso un nuevo reporte indicó que Epstein donó importantes sumas de dinero a varias escuelas en EEUU y en el extranjero, incluyendo un exclusivo colegio sólo para niñas cerca de su mansión en de Manhattan.
Según informó The Associated Press, Epstein donó $15 mil dólares a la prestigiosa escuela “Hewitt” en East 75th St en 2016, años después de que se declarara culpable en 2008 de solicitar a una menor para la prostitución.
No está claro por qué Epstein seleccionó a esa escuela para la donación, pero los administradores dijeron que el monto fue devuelto hace varios meses después de que se enteraron de que provenía de Epstein, acusado por pedofilia.
En otras donaciones, el magnate judío donó $35 mi dólares al “Junior Tennis Champions Center” en Maryland, y $25 mil la escuela primaria “Ecole du Bel-Air” en Haití, destruida por el huracán de 2010.
Este escándalo de abuso sexual de menores ya salpicó a la Casa Blanca, donde ayer renunció el Secretario del Trabajo, Alex Acosta, el único latino en el gabinete de Trump, debido a que fue él quien, siendo fiscal en Miami, negoció el acuerdo de culpabilidad de Epstein en 2008.
Ahora Epstein podría ser encarcelado por hasta 45 años , informó The New York Times, destacando su amistad en el pasado con el Príncipe Andrés de Inglaterra, el cineasta Woody Allen y los presidentes Trump y Bill Clinton.
En medio del escándalo, trascendió que NYPD también falló en supervisar la libertad condicional de Epstein.

Texto completo: Ed Mullins, presidente de la Asociación de Sargentos Benevolentes, pidió en una carta a los policías de Nueva York dejar de lado la política y apoyar “hombro con hombro” a los agentes de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE) durante las redadas que se esperan desde mañana en todo el país.
“[ICE] arrestará personas que son criminalmente buscadas por delitos cometidos bajo el Código de Leyes de Estados Unidos”, escribió Mullins en la carta enviada el viernes a los miembros del sindicato, que son sargentos del Departamento de Policía de Nueva York.
“Nosotros, los miembros de las fuerzas del orden público, no escribimos estas leyes, ni nos involucramos en la política ni en las opiniones sobre las leyes”, dijo.
De acuerdo con un informe del diario The New York Times, se espera que las redadas dirigidas contra inmigrantes indocumentados comiencen el domingo, dirigidas a al menos 2 mil extranjeros en todo el país.
Una demanda presentada el jueves por American Civil Liberties Union, junto con otros grupos de defensa, indicó que las redadas tienen como objetivo atacar a los indocumentados que enfrentan la deportación porque no asistieron a las audiencias de la corte, resaltó New York Post.
“ Estimado Compañero Sargento: (…) lo aliento a que NO deje a ningún agente de ICE abandonado si necesita ayuda y que se apoye hombro con hombro con cada uno para que ellos también puedan regresar a casa sanos y salvos con sus familias”, afirma Mullins.
“Son miembros de la policía como usted y nunca debemos participar en la política que se aplica sobre nuestro deber de respetar la ley”.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Hundreds of people gathered Friday night for Washington’s “Lights for Liberty” event and vigil, one of more than 700 that were planned across five continents to raise awareness of conditions in immigrant detention facilities in the southern United States.
A large group from the American Federation of Teachers marched to the event, chanting “classrooms, not cages. ” They were welcomed by the executive director of CASA, Gustavo Torres. CASA is the nation's largest advocacy group for Latino immigrants.
“Si se puede,” Torres said. “Yes, we can!”
Organizers of “Lights for Liberty” said that D. C. was one of the first cities they planned a vigil in, specifically to “demand action from Congress to end concentration camps and impeach the President,” according to the group's website.

Pence lauds border conditions: 'Care every American would be proud of'
At least 30,000 immigrants are detained on any given day in the United States, just in the five states with the highest numbers, according to an organization called Freedom for Immigrants.
Shyamali Hauth, 53, who served in the Air Force for 10 years, attended Friday's event with with a local chapter of the progressive Indivisible movement.
“The way we’re treating people seeking asylum here is absolutely atrocious,” Hauth said. She held a large, neon orange “A,” helping to form the word "immoral" alongside her peers.
“It’s not why I served in the military. It’s not the kind of America we should have. ”
The vigils take place amid growing criticism of the conditions in detention facilities. United Nations’ human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said the family separation and inhumane conditions in the facilities “should never happen anywhere. ”
The New York Times reported massive Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids of undocumented communities could begin as soon as Sunday. Officials said the Trump administration may be executing the raids as a show of force to discourage families from crossing the border, according to the New York Times.
Before the vigil, a series of speakers took the stage, including Rep. Norma Torres, D-Calif. , the only member of Congress born in Central America; Ruby Corado, the founder of LGBTQ+ immigrant support organization Casa Ruby; Hope Frye, an immigration attorney and Torres.
Donald Trump: Immigration raids begin Sunday, will target criminals 'as much as we can'
Torres called on law enforcement officers to stand up for what is right and urged protections for whistleblowers: “We need more of them to come forward and tell us what is really going on. ”
Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Lutheran Immigrant and Refugee Services, shared her story of fleeing the Sri Lankan civil war with her family when she was an infant.
So many immigrants, she said, just want to live safe and normal lives in the U. S.
“We admit them not because they are American,” she said, “but because we are American. ”
After faith leaders spoke to the crowd, they gathered on stage with photos of immigrant children who have died recently.
One by one, speakers read out the names of the children. They rang bells after each child.
Later, organizers led the crowd in singing “This Little Light of Mine,” while people waved their electric candles in the air.

Texto completo: Prototype, the festival of new work whose ambitions are aptly conveyed by its subtitle, Opera/Theater/Now, has in its seven seasons gained a reputation as a star spotter.
It has brought to New York two pieces that went on to win the Pulitzer Prize for Music: Du Yun's "Angel's Bone" and, this year, Ellen Reid's "prism." (Both those works were produced by Beth Morrison Projects, which presents Prototype with HERE, the arts center in SoHo.)
So audiences will be watching carefully to see if awards recognition might be in the future for the six works that will be shown in Prototype's eighth season, which will run Jan. 9-18 at theaters throughout Manhattan and was announced on Wednesday.
The characteristic Prototype work is short in length and grim in subject matter. Last year's festival revolved around presentations "of almost cataclysmic suffering, the kind of pain that lingers without reason or resolution," I wrote in a New York Times review.
The 2020 installment may well follow in that tradition. One featured work, a New York City premiere, is the composer Ricky Ian Gordon and the poet Frank Bidart's one-act "Ellen West," based on accounts of an early psychoanalytic patient. The cast features the soprano Kiera Duffy (the star of "Breaking the Waves," seen at Prototype in 2017) and the baritone Nathan Gunn; Emma Griffin directs, and Lidiya Yankovskaya is the music director.
The other presentations include: "Blood Moon," with a libretto by Ellen McLaughlin and a score, by Garrett Fisher, inspired by the Japanese percussion style taiko; "Magdalene," a setting of Marie Howe poems scored by 13 women; "Iron & Coal," composed by Jeremy Schonfeld and based on his father's Holocaust memoir; "Cion: Requiem of Ravel's 'Boléro,"' organized by the South African choreographer Gregory Vuyani Maqoma; and "REV. 23," with a score by Julian Wachner, the director of music and the arts at Trinity Wall Street, and a libretto by Cerise Lim Jacobs.

Texto completo: Remember when President Trump claimed in April that "corrupt or incompetent" Puerto Rico officials had badly bungled relief efforts following 2017's Hurricane Maria?
Remember how poorly politicos and journalists reacted to the president’s allegation, claiming that he was lying or being plain racist?
Well, it looks like the president was right. Puerto Rican officials were arrested this week on charges that they stole aid money, the Washington Examiner’s Tim Pearce reported:
The FBI has arrested two former Puerto Rico officials for funneling disaster aid payments to politically connected contractors. The Wednesday arrests have prompted concern on Capitol Hill that the island’s corruption will blunt the effectiveness of a recently passed disaster aid bill. Rep. Raúl Grijalva, D-Ariz., has called for Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló's resignation, according to the Washington Post. The FBI indictment charges Puerto Rico's former Education Secretary Julia Keleher, former Health Insurance Agency Chief Ángela Ávila-Marrero, and four others with crimes related to grifting U.S. disaster aid. Keleher and Ávila-Marrero both served in Rosselló's administration before leaving in April and June, respectively. Rosselló himself is not under investigation. Grijalva is the chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, which is overseeing the recovery effort on the island from Hurricane Maria in 2017. [...] The arrests come weeks after Congress passed a $19 billion disaster aid bill to the island that is still struggling after the September 2017 hurricane severely damaged the island's infrastructure and power grid.
Weirdly enough, Trump sort of called this in April when he went on a mini-Twitter rant accusing Democratic lawmakers of playing games with a funding bill.
Puerto Rico "politicians are incompetent or corrupt," he tweeted, adding, "their government can’t do anything right, the place is a mess – nothing works. FEMA & the Military worked emergency miracles, but politicians like the crazed and incompetent Mayor of San Juan have done such a poor job of bringing the Island back to health."
TweetTweetTweetTrump was savaged at the time by politicos, journalists, and commentators for suggesting Puerto Rico suffered in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria from the same sort of government corruption that exacerbated New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina.
“Donald Trump’s lie-filled rage tweets … continue a Trump pattern that mirrors a method that white supremacists have used throughout American history,” the level-headed Charles Blow theorized in his usually clunky and near-incomprehensible prose in the New York Times. “Particularly present since Reconstruction, this method involves proclaiming that minorities lack the character and capacity to create effective government, and therefore minority-led jurisdictions are a hopeless drain on resources.”
Sarah Jones said elsewhere for New York Magazine’s Intelligencer, “Trump’s long-standing antipathy for people of color is germane to his rhetoric on Puerto Rico. When he speaks, you don’t have to strain to hear the undertones for what they are. Stereotypes that depict poor people of color as moochers, takers, and welfare queens have been around a long time, and they’ve informed immigration and welfare reform stances in both major parties at various points in their histories."
“The argument that immigrants are violent job thieves stems from this source and so, too, do Trump’s falsehoods about Puerto Rico,” she added.
The Washington Post’s Philip Bump wrote, "[Trump has] repeatedly complained that the funding going to the island was being wasted or spent to pay down that debt, without evidence."
"Trump always saw Puerto Rico’s government as questionable and wasteful and then apparently seized on that idea to rationalize his arguments that the island was receiving too much money," Bump added.
Surely they will all print follow-ups, acknowledging the oversight, admitting that the president and his allies were correct about Puerto Rican relief efforts being stymied by corrupt local officials.

Jeffrey Epstein lawyers claim he 'scrupulously' followed sex offender requirements

Texto completo: Jeffrey Epstein’s lawyers repeatedly claimed in court filings that the wealthy jet-setter and accused child sex trafficker has been “diligent” and “scrupulous” about complying with the sex offender registration requirements stemming from his 2008 guilty plea.
The Thursday filing contradicts reports that Epstein had habitually ignored the required sex offender check-ins with authorities, saying Epstein had complied with all of his obligations under the non-prosecution agreement, saying he had “perfect compliance with onerous sex offender registration requirements – pinpointing his exact nightly whereabouts – across multiple jurisdictions over a 10-year period.”
The New York Post reported that Epstein, a level 3 sex offender, should have checked in with authorities in person to verify his address more than 34 times since 2011 but had not once done so in eight years, and was not required to do so by the New York Police Department.
“Epstein registered in New York State as required by law in 2010. BEFORE his legally mandated first check-in he changed his residence to the Virgin Islands requiring monitoring to take place in that jurisdiction, NOT in New York,” chief of detectives Dermot Shea tweeted.

But a state judge had said in 2011 that Epstein still had to check in with New York authorities.
"I am sorry he may have to come here every 90 days,” Justice Ruth Pickholz said sarcastically at the time, according to the New York Times. “He can give up the New York home if he does not want to come every 90 days.”
Epstein’s lawyers referred to his “spotless 14-year record of walking the straight and narrow” and a “10-year history of diligent sex offender registration and reporting” in the filings.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Maybe President Trump was right that we needed a “Salute to America” last week, because apparently some Americans have lost sight of the greatness of our country. Case in point: To mark Independence Day, The New York Times posted a video op-ed challenging what it called the “mythology” of American greatness. “America may once have been the greatest,” the Times video declares, “but today, America, we’re just OK.”
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2657222" src="https://i0.wp.com/multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Marc-Thiessen-color-2018.jpg?resize=300%2C235&ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="235" data-recalc-dims="1" />
The video is like a caricature of how conservatives think the left sees America — except it isn’t a caricature; it’s real. It’s a straw man come to life. As evidence we’re just OK, the video cites statistics showing that other developed countries, such as Luxembourg, Sweden and Norway, have lower poverty rates or better education and health care outcomes than America. And as for our “kick-ass democracy,” the Times says, it’s not that big a deal because “a lot of countries have freedoms.”
Put aside for a moment all the misleading data the video uses to show America is not so great. The fact is, all the freedom and progress those other countries enjoy today would not be possible without the United States.
The reason that “a lot of countries have freedoms” today is because our Founding Fathers pioneered the principle of popular sovereignty, where governments answer to the people instead of the other way around. At the time of our founding, the rest of the world was ruled by monarchs. Our founders established the first country in human history that was built on an idea — the idea of human liberty.
For most of our history, American democracy was a global outlier. In 1938, on the eve of World War II, there were just 17 democracies. It was not until 1998 — just two decades ago — that there were more democracies than autocracies.
That dramatic explosion of freedom didn’t just happen. It was the direct result of the rise of the United States as a global superpower. The U.S.-powered victory over Nazi tyranny in World War II and our triumph over Soviet tyranny in the Cold War defeated the hateful ideologies of fascism and communism, and unleashed a wave of freedom that has spread across the world. Today, 4.1 billion people live in democracies. (Of those who do not, four out of five live in China.)

The unprecedented expansion of liberty has produced unprecedented prosperity. Last September, the Brookings Institution reported that “for the first time since agriculture-based civilization began 10,000 years ago, the majority of humankind … some 3.8 billion people, live in households with enough discretionary expenditure to be considered ‘middle class’ or ‘rich.'”
None of that would be possible without the Pax Americana guaranteed by U.S. military. Americans liberated a continent, rebuilt much of it from the rubble of war with the Marshall Plan, and then stood watch on freedom’s frontier and prevented a Soviet tank invasion across the Fulda Gap. And today, the only thing that stops North Korea from invading South Korea or China from invading Taiwan is American military might.
So, let’s be clear: Every country that enjoys democratic governance today owes its birth of freedom to our Founding Fathers, and the continued existence of their democracy to the U.S. military.
Today, for all its flaws, America remains the freest, most innovative, most prosperous country in the history of the world. We invented the lightbulb and the iPhone. We put a man on the moon and a rover on Mars. We are a nation of unparalleled military power and unlimited opportunity. There’s a reason we have a crisis on our southern border; millions want to come here so that they can share in the abundance of American prosperity.
The men and women who flew those fighters and bombers over the Mall last week make it all possible. They provide the critical foundation of peace and security upon which our freedom, and the freedom of all the world’s democracies, is built. Maybe Luxembourg scores better on some measures, but no one is counting on Luxembourg to secure the peace of the world. Trump was right to shine a spotlight on our men and women in uniform and to remind those who have lost sight of it that the United States is not simply the greatest nation on Earth; we are indispensable. Without us, the world would be mired in the darkness of totalitarianism rather than the light of liberty.
That is better than “just OK.”

Epstein decía que no vivía en NY, pero ahora pide cárcel en su “hogar” de Manhattan en caso de sexo con niñas

Texto completo: Cuando en 2011 una jueza ordenó que, como parte del cuestionado acuerdo judicial en Florida, el multimillonario Jeffrey Epstein debía reportarse ante NYPD cada 90 días como “agresor sexual”, la abogada defensora Sandra Musumeci insistió en que no era un “residente de Nueva York” y que su propiedad de siete pisos era una “casa de vacaciones” en la que no tenía planes de quedarse “más de un período de 10 días”.
Pero ahora que fue encarcelado por nuevos cargos de tráfico y abuso de menores, de los que se declaró “no culpable”, Epstein (66) solicitó ayer la opción de esperar el juicio bajo detención domiciliaria en su mansión del Upper East Side.
La medida incluiría cámaras de seguridad, vigilancia con un brazalete en el tobillo, una fianza garantizada por la residencia de $77 millones de dólares y prohibición de vuelo de su jet privado.
La defensa también dijo que se podría nombrar a un “fideicomisario” residente para vigilarlo, y ofreció pagar a guardias armados las 24 horas para evitar que huya , detalla el expediente judicial citado por amNY.
Según la acusación federal, en esa misma casa de siete pisos (9 East 71 St), él abusó de “docenas” de menores de edad en una sala de masajes equipada con juguetes sexuales. También allí, según los documentos judiciales, los agentes encontraron cientos de fotos de chicas desnudas el pasado fin de semana.
Pero los abogados de Epstein, en la nota de fianza presentada el jueves en el tribunal federal de Manhattan, continuaron sosteniendo que los nuevos cargos están prohibidos por un acuerdo de no persecución con las autoridades federales en Florida en 2008, y que la “hipérbole” sensacionalista no debería obstaculizar su derecho a fianza.
“Dejando a un lado la condena popular, las cuestiones legales imperantes se interponen entre el señor Epstein y cualquier posible condena por las acusaciones de conducta de hace 14 a 17 años presentadas en la acusación”, dijeron los abogados Reid Weingarten y Martin Weinberg al juez de distrito de Manhattan, Richard Berman, quien el lunes decidirá si otorga la libertad bajo fianza.
Epstein se encuentra bajo custodia en Manhattan desde el 6 de julio por cargos de que contrató a niñas de 14 años para masajes desnudos que incluyeron contacto sexual en sus hogares de Nueva York y Palm Beach (Florida), entre 2002 y 2005.
Este escándalo por abuso sexual de menores ya salpicó a la Casa Blanca, donde esta mañana renunció el Secretario del Trabajo, Alex Acosta, el único latino en el gabinete de Donald Trump, debido a que fue él quien, siendo fiscal en Miami, negoció el acuerdo con Epstein en 2008.
Ahora Epstein podría ser encarcelado por hasta 45 años , informó The New York Times, destacando su amistad en el pasado con el Príncipe Andrés de Inglaterra, el cineasta Woody Allen y los presidentes Trump y Bill Clinton.

Texto completo: IOWA CITY - Valparaiso graduate transfer Bakari Evelyn has signed with Iowa to bolster the Hawkeyes' perimeter game.
Hawkeyes coach Fran McCaffery announced on Thursday that Evelyn will be the first grad transfer to play for him in Iowa City.
Evelyn spent the past two seasons with the Crusaders after starting his career at Nebraska. The guard led Valpo with 48 three-pointers and ranked second on the team with 68 assists last season.
Evelyn's presence should help the Hawkeyes, especially if Jordan Bohannon is forced to redshirt following offseason hip surgery.
BASEBALL
Ortiz recovering from 3rd surgery
BOSTON - Former Red Sox slugger David Ortiz is recovering from a third surgery after experiencing complications resulting from his gunshot wound.
Ortiz's wife, Tiffany, says in a statement Thursday that he is "recovering well and in good spirits." He had the surgery earlier this week at Massachusetts General Hospital.
Ortiz was shot in the back at a bar in the Dominican Republic last month. Dominican police have said he was mistaken for another man who was sitting near him at the club.
Police say a suspected drug trafficker offered to pay $30,000 for the shooting.
Police say they've arrested 14 people in the case, including the suspected gunman, and are searching for others.
Astros' Marisnick suspended 2 games
ARLINGTON, Texas - Houston Astros outfielder Jake Marisnick has been suspended for two games by Major League Baseball after his violent home plate collision with Los Angeles Angels catcher Jonathan Lucroy.
The suspension was announced Thursday before the AL West-leading Astros played a series opener at Texas in their first game after the All-Star break. Marisnick also was fined.
Cardinals place Molina on IL
ST. LOUIS - The Cardinals placed catcher Yadier Molina on the injured list with a strained right thumb and activated infielder Matt Carpenter as part of a series of roster moves Thursday. St. Louis also brought up left-hander Chasen Shreve from Triple-A Memphis, optioned left-hander Tyler Webb and outfielder Rangel Ravelo to Memphis, and transferred pitcher Jordan Hicks to the 60-day IL update ahead of their series against Arizona beginning Friday night.
Royals adding former first-round pick
KANSAS CITY, Mo. - The Kansas City Royals are bringing Bubba Starling to the majors, culminating a journey that took eight years in the minors for the hometown hero and former first-round draft pick in 2011.
The 26-year-old outfielder, who starred at nearby Gardner-Edgerton High School, has struggled for years to live up to enormous expectations in the minors. But he is hitting .310 with seven homers and 38 RBIs in his first full season at Triple-A Omaha, and recently played in that level's all-star game.
GOLF
Ihm tied for 12th at Korn Ferry event
Peosta, Iowa, native Steven Ihm shot a 3-over-par 75 on Thursday and is tied for 129th place at the TPC Colorado Championship at Heron Lakes. Nelson Ledesma leads the tournament at 7-under par.
FOOTBALL
Ex-Wyoming player to change plea
CASPER, Wyo.- Court documents indicate a former University of Wyoming football star has reached a plea deal with prosecutors in a sexual assault case.
Carl Granderson, 22, had been scheduled to go on trial Monday for third-degree sexual assault after pleading not guilty. But he filed documents Wednesday requesting a hearing to change his plea and be sentenced. The hearing is scheduled for Thursday.
The Casper Star-Tribune reports that prosecutors filed documents modifying the sexual assault charge to one count of unlawful contact. Two female university students say Granderson touched them sexually while they slept at his Laramie apartment in 2018.
Former Jets coach Michaels dies at 89
NEW YORK - Walt Michaels, the former New York Jets coach who retired following the 1982 season after leading the team to the AFC title game, has died. He was 89.
The Jets said Thursday that Michaels died Wednesday. The team did not immediately provide a cause or location. The New York Times said Michaels died at a nursing home in Plains, Pennsylvania. The former Cleveland Browns linebacker was the defensive coordinator of the Jets' Super Bowl-winning team in the 1968 season.

There aren't many 'Stranger Things' than what women put up with in the newsroom

Texto completo: Our daughters wanted to know: “Were newsrooms really like that in the 1980s?”
They had binged on Season 3 of the Netflix hit “Stranger Things,” and they thought one of the strangest things of all was the way the all-male editors treated intern Nancy Wheeler.
As an earnest Wheeler flutters about the newsroom trying to fit in, the editors make sexist jokes, call her Nancy Drew, turn down her obviously good story suggestions and complain when a sandwich she delivers doesn’t have mustard on it.
Yes, women put up with a lot back in the 1980s. They still do.
Over the past two years, we have interviewed nearly 100 women who made it into leadership roles in newspapers, broadcast and digital news outlets since about the 1980s. Their stories are funny and sad and hair-raising — often at the same time.
Marcy McGinnis, who began as a secretary at CBS and rose to the No. 2 job in the news division, remembers a top executive lifting her up in the middle of the newsroom and twirling her around while proclaiming, “I’d like to thank the National Organization for Women for this trophy. ”
Nina Totenberg sat in a part of the NPR newsroom along with several other women that was widely referred to as the “fallopian jungle. ”
Women were told that they couldn’t work nights because it was too dangerous and that they didn’t need a raise because they had husbands who worked. They were denied promotions because male staffers didn’t want to work for women. They were told how to dress and how to speak — and when to keep quiet. And above all, they were told they should never, ever cry in the newsroom.
To get ahead they felt like they had to — if not actually be a guy — act as much like one as possible. As late as 1998, Joyce Purnick, then the metro editor of The New York Times, told students at her alma mater, Barnard College, that she would have never made it to the city desk if she had children.
Today, only five of the 25 largest newspapers have women editors. Earlier this year, CBS named Susan Zirinsky as its top news executive, the first time a woman has ever held that job. News organizations that have never had a woman in charge include ABC News and CNN. The Washington Post has never had a woman as the top editor. The only woman to ever lead The New York Times was ousted publicly and unceremoniously after one of the shortest tenures in the newspaper’s history.
The situation isn’t much different in any traditionally male-dominated industry. Only 33 of the top 500 publicly traded companies are led by a woman.
But the problems extend well beyond who gets the corner office. A newspaper journalists’ union, NewsGuild-CWA, has been analyzing salaries at publications for several years and reports consistently finding disparities in pay between white men compared with women and people of color. A study last year by a union representing newsroom staffers at the Los Angeles Times found that the average male reporter made about $102,000 a year while the average female reporter made about $87,564.
And, of course, the news industry has had more than its share of #MeToo moments, with dozens of powerful men who once called the shots in news being called out for flagrant sexual harassment.
Those of us who entered media organizations in the 1970s and '80s didn’t expect things to be easy. We thought if we worked hard, ignored the slights, laughed off the sexual advances, stuck with it and brought other women up behind us, things would change. They did, but not nearly as much as we thought they would.
Equality now: Melinda Gates — Let's not take 208 years to achieve equality for women
In one poignant scene in “Stranger Things,” Nancy Wheeler has just been fired by those men who laughed at her, and she begins to question her worth. Her mother holds her and says, “It’s not easy out there. People are always saying, ‘You can’t; you shouldn’t; you’re not smart enough; you’re not good enough. ’ This world, it beats you up again and again until most people, they just stop trying. … But you’re not like that. You’re a fighter. ”
We tell our daughters and the many young women we teach that they, too, must be fighters. We tell them that they will face some of the same old battles, but that they belong in newsrooms. There’s a place for them. And maybe, just maybe, they can finish the job we started.

Has the media 'sanitized' the accusations against Jeffrey Epstein?

Texto completo: As Jeffrey Epstein, the registered sex offender and wealthy financier, faced charges of sex trafficking girls as young as 14 in federal court this week, the investigative reporting of Julie K. Brown of the Miami Herald received credit for reigniting the case 11 years after Epstein's plea deal for soliciting minors for prostitution.
But other media outlets have drawn critique from some sexual abuse survivors and advocates who point to language choices they say sanitize the accusations against Epstein, who has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
The media has been blasted for using terms such as "underage women" instead of "children," for saying "sex with minors" instead of "rape," for using the phrase "paid for sex," which they say erases coercion.
Epstein fallout: Trump's Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta resigns
"When journalists use words associated with consensual sex to report on sexual assault, they omit the very elements that make it a headline in the first place … coercion, threats, violence, manipulation … or even the legal charges. Legally, there is no such thing as 'sex with a minor. ' It’s instead recognized as statutory sexual assault, child sexual abuse, rape, or corruption of minors, or any other legal charge … but 'sex' by itself implies consent," said Kristen Houser, chief public affairs officer at the National Sexual Violence Resource Center.
Experts in human trafficking, sexual violence, law and media ethics say the media's language around such cases reflect a combination of factors, including adherence to legal definitions rather than colloquial terms, avoiding words that would compromise the presumption of innocence prior to conviction and reporting limitations, such as having access to court documents but not victims.
But experts also note that word choices carry weight and excessive caution could whitewash the charges.
Epstein's alleged targets: 'The more vulnerable the better'
'Underage women' vs. 'children'
Dozens of news outlets have referred to Epstein's victims as "underage women":
Fox News: "The businessman stands accused of sexually abusing underage women at his residences in Florida and New York. "
New York Magazine: "Jeffrey Epstein, the man now accused of running a sex trafficking ring involving underage women, some of them in their early teens. "
New York Times: "Very embarrassing that [Labor Secretary Alexander] Acosta is one of the people who’s supposed to protect underage women from being sold as sex slaves. "
Donna Hughes, a leading international researcher on human trafficking, said she finds the term "strange. "
"A female under the age of 18 is a girl, while a female over 18 is a woman or young woman," she said. "Using the term 'underage woman' implies that she is a mature woman, but the law has made her 'underage. ' The implication is that the law could be changed to lower the age of consent —- or even eliminate it. . . . Personally, I would not use 'underage woman. '"
Houser said the term is inaccurate.
"It is a word that implies the ability to make adult choices such as engaging in an adult sexual relationship," she said. "But that’s not the case in this story. It would be more appropriate to say 'teenaged girls' or 'girls' or 'children. '"
In a post on the website Fatherly, "Stop Calling Epstein’s Victims Young Women. They're Children," the writer says "in no world is a 14-year-old an underage woman. "
"Proper terminology is important," the post read. "And using the incorrect terms obscures the fact that Epstein, a billionaire adult, is accused of assaulting children and trafficking them for nonconsensual sexual acts. "
'Sex with minors' vs. 'rape'
In referencing Epstein's previous plea deal, Bloomberg wrote that the "agreement allowed the wealthy money manager to dodge federal charges for having sex with minors. "
In a Facebook post that has since gone viral, a childhood rape survivor took issue with the term, saying, "it's rape. Call it rape. "
"When we use our 'polite words,' we create the impression that sexual abusers aren't really THAT bad," Jenna Glatzer wrote.
Experts say one reason why reporters are not using the term "rape" in this week's coverage is because it is not used in the legal definition of sex trafficking.
"The crimes the media is reporting on are federal crimes — there is no federal rape statute per se — they are using the language federal prosecutors are using, which is the language of sex trafficking," said Martina Vandenberg, founder and president of the Human Trafficking Legal Center,
Donna Hughes, a leading international researcher on human trafficking, said rather than “sex with a minor," she would say “victim of child sex trafficking. "
Gene Rossi, who has three decades of criminal and civil litigation experience at the U. S. Department of Justice, says sometimes the media can be overly cautious.
"Generically, there is no legal barrier to a reporter calling it as it is," Rossi said. "The media tend to somewhat sugarcoat the essence of the allegation when it comes to sexual violence. . . . It would be like if someone was accused of murder and the article on the murder said 'the alleged defendant took the life of of another person. '"
'Paid for sex'
A story in the Washington Times this week read, "Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein ran a 'vast network of underage victims' he paid for sex. "
Houser said she takes issue with that term when referring to victims under the age of 18.
"When we say 'paid for sex' it erases the coercion, manipulation, intimidation or even violence inherent in the situation and instead sanitizes it to sound like a business transaction between consenting people," she said.
What the media has done right
Despite some criticism, experts say many news organizations have used proper terminology and given the Epstein case appropriate weight.
"I think the media is doing a good job stressing that it is a big and dramatic event," Rossi said. "That this could be a small part of a bigger puzzle. "
As Vandenberg notes, there might not have been a case if not for Brown's November investigation on Epstein. The Herald identified about 80 victims who alleged they were abused by Epstein from 2001 to 2006.
"This story is a tribute to the power of investigative reporting, because this case would have died long ago," she said. "Those girls, now women, would have been completely forgotten but for this one journalist who would not let it go. "

Texto completo: SEATTLE - The thing about Jim Bouton that always amazed me - and warmed my heart - was the pure joy he derived from his masterpiece, "Ball Four."
"I have lived with the book for so long now, and had so many conversations with people over the years, that the characters, my teammates, have become like members of my family," Bouton told me in 2009 during one of several interviews I was privileged to have with him.
"I honestly have developed very loving feelings about every single one of them."
Because of that book, which was transformational for me as a teenager and for millions of others who were given a shocking/hilarious/ irreverent/authentic glimpse inside Major League Baseball baseball, the Seattle Pilots will live on forever. And so will Bouton, who died Wednesday at the age of 80.
The book ostensibly chronicled Bouton's attempt to resurrect his career with the expansion 1969 Pilots at age 30, a sore-armed former Yankees fireballer who decided a knuckleball was his ticket back to the big-time.
But what made Bouton's book stand out in 1970 when it was published and still resonate today, nearly 50 years later, is the eclectic cast of teammates that he brought to life. It was ribald, it was profane, and it was light years ahead of its time in portraying ballplayers as humans, flaws and all, rather than adhering to the idolatry that had prevailed to that point in sporting literature.
Bouton was correspondingly reviled around baseball for the curtain that he lifted on how ballplayers really acted off the field - pill-popping, skirt-chasing and boozing, for instance.
Particularly galling to many was his warts-and-all portrayal of the sainted Mickey Mantle, his former Yankee teammate. A typical outraged response was that of Pete Rose, who after the book's publication screamed at Bouton from the Reds' dugout using an expletive and calling him "Shakespeare."
Bouton, relating the story at the Society of American Baseball Research (SABR) convention in Seattle in 2006, said gleefully: "Which I thought was great.  I mean, a literary reference from Pete Rose."
Of course, the realism is what made "Ball Four" such a revolutionary book - the only sports book included in the New York Public Library's listing of the 100 most important books of the 20th century.
But it's the hilarity that makes it endure. And Bouton never, ever lost his appreciation for the cast of characters that remain as memorable to baseball fans as the Corleones to Godfather aficionados.
I'm talking about Bouton's chief protagonist, pitcher Fred Talbot, a crank who once leapt into a taxi that Bouton had been waiting for and yelled back as it pulled away, "Take the next cab, you communist."
Bouton, of course, famously got the better of Talbot. He fooled him into thinking that he was going to receive a cash award from a fan who had received a hefty payout in a radio contest for the grand slam Talbot hit.
I'm talking about outfielder Steve Hovley, a high-minded intellectual with a keen sense of the ironic. "My hero - probably the most intellectually courageous person I've ever seen," Bouton would say. "For him to be his independent self in the wake of overwhelming peer pressure was astonishing."
I'm talking about vividly idiosyncratic teammates like Jim Pagliaroni, Merrit Ranew, Gary Bell and countless others. And no one was more memorable than Joe Schultz, the lovable buffoon of a manager who used to implore his players to "pound the Budweiser."
"These guys were characters out of a novel, and I'm so lucky I was on the Pilots, because I could have never written the exact same kind of book, or even close to it, with another type of team," Bouton told me once.
As I said, Bouton loved all the characters in Ball Four. He'd often end up sputtering with laughter over the phone as he related and relived an anecdote from the book. But he really adored Schultz, who understood that the ragtag Pilots were destined for mediocrity and didn't sweat it.
"The great thing about Joe," Bouton said, "is he was the opposite of Vince Lombardi. Joe felt sorry for us. He told us not to feel bad; we just didn't have the talent."
The most memorable interview I had with Bouton occurred in 1998 when he detailed his long-sought reconciliation with the Yankees.
They had essentially disowned him after "Ball Four" was published in 1970, largely because of the Mantle revelations. But when Mantle's son, Billy, died in 1991, Bouton sent him a heartfelt letter of condolence and wrote at the end, "I hope you're feeling OK about 'Ball Four.' I didn't intend to hurt anyone with that book, and I consider those some of the best memories of my life."
Two weeks later, Bouton said, he received a message from Mantle on his answering machine. He recited it verbatim: "Hey, Jim, this is Mick. I'm OK about 'Ball Four' these days. Thanks for the letter. I want you to know I'm not the reason you're not invited back for Old Timer's Day. I never said that to anyone. Take it easy, bud."
Fast forward to 1997, when Bouton's 31-year-old daughter, Laurie, was killed in a car accident. One of Bouton's sons, Michael, wrote a poignant first-person article in the New York Times imploring Yankee owner George Steinbrenner to bring him back. That led to Bouton's return to Yankee Stadium in 1998 for the Old Timer's Game.
"The beauty of that letter, the power of it, the sympathy it invoked, caused them to invite me back," Bouton said in the interview.
Now Bouton is gone, leaving behind a 62-63 career record in 10 seasons with the Yankees, Pilots, Astros and Braves (with two of those wins coming in 57 games for the lone season of the Seattle Pilots in 1969).
But Bouton's legacy is far deeper, richer and more enduring than that perfunctory recitation of statistics.
"Without 'Ball Four,' I'd just be a statistic in 'The Baseball Encyclopedia' that people look up," he said. "The book changed my life.
"I never get tired of 'Ball Four,' " he said another time. "Mainly because I know the book so intimately, just thinking about it makes me smile."
I'm looking at my own dog-eared, original copy of "Ball Four" right now, and though immensely saddened by Bouton's death, I'm smiling, too.

Texto completo: Before Jeffrey Epstein was disgraced — before he was arrested this month and charged with sex trafficking dozens of minors, before he received a slap on the wrist in 2008 for molesting girls at his mansion in Palm Beach, Fla. — he aimed to be a Harvard man.
He contributed millions to the university, reportedly funding the construction of Harvard Hillel's building, and helping to establish the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics. He frequented an office blocks from campus, and flew up in his private plane to host seminars there with some of Harvard's most prominent professors, according to Alan Dershowitz, an emeritus professor of law at Harvard who served as one of Epstein's lawyers. Among Epstein's close associates, according to a 2003 Harvard Crimson article, were former president Lawrence Summers, former dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Henry Rosovsky, and professor emeritus of psychology Stephen Kosslyn.
“He had a close connection to Harvard," said Dershowitz, who helped negotiate the generous plea deal with prosecutors in Florida. Two women have alleged that Epstein directed them to have sex with Dershowitz; he denies ever meeting them.
Epstein savored his university ties. He was photographed wearing a crimson sweatshirt, “Harvard" emblazoned in white letters across his chest. As recently as 2014, Epstein's foundation issued press releases referring to him as a “Harvard mogul," and “renowned science and Harvard investor."
But Epstein was not, exactly, a Harvard mogul. He was not a Harvard alum, a Harvard professor, or a Harvard parent.
Instead, he seems to have simply chosen Harvard to be his, adding it to a collection of prized objects that would reflect glory back upon him, like the photographs of famous people displayed in his New York home, the lavish properties he amassed from Manhattan to the Caribbean, and the young girls he allegedly hunted down. Some have likened him to a sinister Jay Gatsby, whose stories about himself don't always line up with the truth.
Now that Epstein is once again facing criminal charges alleging that he sexually abused a vast network of underage girls, his lengthy relationship with Harvard, and his touting of that relationship, shine a light on the role the university played, however unintentionally, in burnishing Epstein's reputation and status even as he committed serious crimes.
“The Epstein case makes very clear what Harvard and other institutions like it are selling: reflected prestige and reputational glow to people who need it, which is often people who have sinned greatly and violated law or conscience," said Anand Giridharadas, author of the book “Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World."
“If you do something awful, and you need not to make things right, but to make your reputation change, Harvard is like a drive-through providing that service," Giridharadas said.
Epstein was charged by federal prosecutors in New York this week with sexually abusing dozens of girls between 2002 and 2005. He had been accused of similar crimes in Palm Beach, but in that case, prosecutors ended up negotiating a secret deal with Epstein's lawyers that required him to plead guilty to just two prostitution charges in state court. The Miami Herald, in a blockbuster investigation last year, reported that more than 80 women said they were victimized by Epstein.
But at least one thing is clear: For decades, Harvard was a central part of Epstein's story.
Even after he was arrested and served time in the county stockade — a brief 13-month stint, during which he left six days a week to work from an office in West Palm Beach — Epstein continued to shower money on Harvard.
In 2012, he established a private foundation called “Gratitude America Ltd.," which contributed at least $100,000 to the Hasty Pudding Institute of 1770, a Harvard performing arts organization, according to The Daily Beast, and contributed more than $100,000 to a nonprofit run by Harvard professor Elisa New, the wife of former president Summers. Both donations suggested a kind of insider status, the type of gift that would most likely come from an alum with a hearty dose of nostalgia for his college days.
New told WBUR that she was “profoundly troubled" by the latest allegations against Epstein, and that the funds had already been spent. The Hasty Pudding Institute did not respond to requests for comment.
Epstein, who took some classes at Cooper Union and New York University, does not have a college degree, according to a 2002 profile of him in New York magazine. In any case, his major institutional contributions to Harvard may have been largely talk.
The New York Times reported in 1991 that four donors, including Epstein and his close friend Leslie Wexner, pledged to raise $2 million to fund a center for Hillel, the Jewish student organization at Harvard. A plaque inside the center listed Epstein, Wexner, and Wexner's wife as donors of the Rosovsky Naming Gift, the Crimson reported in 2003. Today, the plaque is no longer there, according to a person familiar with Harvard's Hillel; Hillel did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
Another gift of Epstein's to the university remains foggy: He publicly pledged $30 million to establish the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics, run by professor Martin Nowak, in 2003, according to the Crimson. But a Harvard source said that Epstein actually gave just $6.5 million.
But even if the promised money never arrived, Epstein successfully cultivated close relationships with preeminent professors, partly through funding individual research projects. Multiple professors told the Crimson in 2003 that Epstein was funding some of their work.
Epstein also regularly hosted private lunches and seminars in an office at One Brattle Square, where he invited world-renowned faculty members to share their work, said Dershowitz, who sometimes attended, and described the sessions as “very intellectual, very academic."
It is not clear when, or whether, Epstein and his foundation stopped funding individual faculty. A number of scholarly papers published between 2006 and 2008 contain a brief sentence in the acknowledgments section: “The Program for Evolutionary Dynamics (PED) at Harvard University is sponsored by Jeffrey Epstein." And as late as 2012, a Harvard website detailing the schedule for professor George Church's lab lists a 5 p.m. meeting with Epstein in Nowak's office — a year after Epstein was required to register as a high-risk and potentially dangerous sex offender in New York. Neither Church nor Nowak responded to requests for comment.
Rick Friedman, a longtime photojournalist in Boston, attended one session where Harvard's luminaries gathered at the behest of Epstein. In September 2004, Friedman was hired by a German magazine to photograph an end-of-summer event hosted by Epstein, a meeting of minds Friedman called “absolutely surreal."
“I photograph a lot of academics," Friedman said. “Here was an incredible group of noted academics who were all going to be together." The frames from that day show Dershowitz, Epstein, Summers, and others talking and laughing.
“It's just like a bunch of friends having a good time, just all hanging out," Friedman said.
But after Epstein was accused of crimes, most of his academic friends scattered.
“Once the charges were made, certainly my relationship with him became entirely lawyer-client," Dershowitz said. “We never had another seminar again, or never had any connection with the Harvard people."

Texto completo: Our guide to plays and musicals coming to New York stages and a few last-chance picks of shows that are about to close. Our reviews of open shows are at nytimes.com/reviews/theater.
Previews & Openings
'CORIOLANUS' at the Delacorte Theater (previews start on July 16; opens on Aug. 5). A tragedy about the dangers of populism and a leader who colludes with an enemy may not feel like escapist summer fare. Nevertheless, it's Shakespeare in the Park's follow-up to Kenny Leon's spirited "Much Ado About Nothing." Jonathan Cake stars as the Roman general with Kate Burton as his viperous mother.
212-967-7555, publictheater.org
'LITTLE GEM' at the Irish Repertory Theater (previews start on July 17; opens on July 25). In Elaine Murphy's alternating monologues, written in a style a New York Times review of an earlier production called "vivid, natural and particular throughout," a mother, daughter and grandmother survey the rugged terrain of an Irishwoman's life. Marc Atkinson Borrull's revival stars Marsha Mason, Brenda Meaney and Lauren O'Leary.
866-811-4111, irishrep.org
'MEASURE FOR MEASURE' AND 'NATIVE SON' at the Duke on 42nd Street (performances start on July 14).

Texto completo: Louisiana braces for a potential hurricane while immigration advocates ready for ICE roundups across the country. Here's the news you need to know Thursday.
But first, Google's listening: A new investigation found Google workers can eavesdrop on your private conversations via its smart speakers. Don't be evil, huh?
Ford knew these cars were defective. It sold them anyway.
There are at least 1. 5 million Ford cars on the road with flawed transmissions. Ford knew about the defect but sold them anyway. A Detroit Free Press investigation found that Ford Motor knowingly launched two low-priced, fuel-efficient cars – the Focus and Fiesta – with defective transmissions and continued selling the cars despite thousands of complaints and an avalanche of repairs. The troubled cars have randomly lost power on freeways and unexpectedly bolted into intersections. Internal documents show that the automaker pushed past early warnings that the cars weren’t roadworthy. Ford faces thousands of angry customers, hundreds of millions in repair costs and litigation so serious the company warned investors of the financial threat posed by the defects.
ICE roundups could strike this weekend
A massive sweep of arrests could unfold this weekend amid reports of roundups set for at least 10 major cities. ICE officials would neither confirm nor deny a report Thursday in The New York Times, citing unnamed administration officials, that a sweep targeting more than 2,000 immigrants facing deportation orders would begin Sunday. President Donald Trump said last week that an ICE sweep would hit "soon. " Thursday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi derided such raids as actions to “terrorize children and tear families apart. ” Stressing that a deportation order is not a search warrant, she urged immigrants to learn their rights before letting ICE into their homes.

Tropical Storm Barry looks like a monster
It’s official: Tropical Storm Barry formed in the Gulf of Mexico on Thursday, and it’s expected to hit Louisiana on Saturday as a Category 1 hurricane. Forecasters said Louisiana – the bull's-eye of the emerging storm – could see up to 12 inches of rain by Monday, and some isolated areas could receive up to 18 inches. Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency, warning that the "entire coast of Louisiana is at play in this storm. " If the storm becomes a hurricane, it would be the first one of the season, the National Hurricane Center said.
Lawmakers OK subpoenas for 12 people tied to Trump, including his son-in-law
A House panel authorized subpoenas for a dozen Trump aides and associates Thursday, seeking information about everything from Russian interference to hush-money payments leading up to the 2016 election. Who was hit by the “subpoena binge"? Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, former chief of staff John Kelly and National Enquirer executives. Previous efforts by the panel to subpoena information from the Trump administration produced little new information. Trump described the investigation by House Dems after Robert Mueller’s inquiry as presidential harassment and a "witch hunt. "
Teachers to America: Summer break is a total myth
Teachers are told their low pay is offset because they get summers off. The problem? They're actually working all year long. When a USA TODAY analysis found teachers' pay was too low to afford housing, readers responded by saying teachers get the summer "off. " In actuality, educators nationwide often spend the summer months doing anything but lazing around. We talked to nine of them, and they told us the real deal: They work second jobs so they can pay rent, making lesson plans for the year ahead and learning how to be better teachers.

Real 'fake news' is rising anti-Semitism in U.S.

Texto completo: It's that time of year again. The Anti-Defamation League has issued its report for 2018, and the headline is that anti-Semitic assaults in the United States have doubled over the 2017 numbers.
If you dig into the 2017 assault numbers, you realize that they are distorted to the extent of being fake news. In 2017 the ADL listed as an assault "Non-Jewish high school students throwing pennies at observant Jews they see," or "a Jewish family harassed at a local Target."
Sadly, in 2018 we witnessed the killing of 11 Jews in a Pittsburgh synagogue, which is an agonizing reality. The question is: Does Pittsburgh really reflect a rise in anti-Semitism? I think not. I believe that it reflects Trump's endorsement of hate against "the other." As one headline writer exclaimed: "Trump didn't pull the trigger on Jews in Pittsburgh, but he certainly prepped the shooter."
Proof of this was reflected in the recent killing of a congregant in the Chabad synagogue in Poway, California. The gunman also claimed responsibility for a fire in a nearby mosque. In this case, there's no doubt that Trump's anti-Islamic rhetoric spilled over into anti-Semitic hatred.
The white supremacists and other right-wing haters are energized by Trump's demonization of the other; but statistics prove that anti-Semitism is not increasing among mainstream Americans. In 2011, Putnam and Campbell, in American Grace, their acclaimed study of religion in America, found that Jews were among the highest rated, most accepted and respected religious groups, along with Mainstream Protestants and Catholics.
Beyond the fact that we are even beloved in America, the ADL reports have a deleterious effect on society. They reinforce Jewish victim mentality. They allow us to see anti-Semitism where it doesn't exist, and they also allow us to curtail criticism against Israel. Rather than answer arguments, we use the race card - we scream "anti-Semitism."
Example: In a recent column in the Jewish Journal, a local rabbi described the alleged increase in anti-Semitism. He complained that Democratic primary candidates "unashamedly denigrate the current prime minister of Israel...their words are catalysts for an uptick in anti-Semitism. Disagreeing with Likud's philosophy is fine, but diatribes against the duly elected leader of Israel isn't." This is ludicrous. Screaming the race card - "anti-Semitism" - in defense of Netanyahu who has been indicted for bribery.
Example: Under pressure from Israel, Germany recently passed a law designating the BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) movement anti-Semitic, thereby preventing the BDS advocacy group from receiving federal funds and from using public space. One can agree or disagree with BDS, but it's undeniably free speech and is supported by many liberal Jews and non-Jews.
What can explain this German act? My answer is guilt for past sins. That's how the race card works. The Israeli columnist Gideon Levy, in Haaretz, writes: "How sad. So paralyzing are the guilt feelings, so effective the propaganda" of anti-BDS rhetoric. He continues: "Guilt feelings are always a bad counselor."
Example: The international edition of the New York Times published an editorial cartoon portraying a blind Trump, with a kippah atop his head, being led along by Netanyahu, represented as a dog with a star of David collar. Anti-Semitic? I think that it is valid political comment. Trump is blind and Netanyahu is his seeing-eye dog, meaning Netanyahu is the one in command, not Trump.
Of course, the figures are distorted and exaggerated. That's what political cartoons do. Yet it is a reasonable comment. There is no doubt that Israeli pressure (Netanyahu) continues to play a role in Trump's decisions to negate the Iran nuclear deal. But under the influence of the recent ADL statistics, which a Times editorial cites, the Times called the cartoon "appalling," and "obviously bigoted."
Why would the Times go out of its way in an editorial to apologize? Why would it fall for the race card ploy? Guilt. The editorial states: "In the 1930s and 1940s, The Times was largely silent as anti-Semitism rose up and bathed the world in blood. That failure still haunts this newspaper."
Before the editorial, the Times met with a delegation from the New York Board of Rabbis, whose executive vice president reported that the cartoon was not the main discussion of the meeting; rather it was the Times' coverage of Israel, which many of the rabbis believed is negative. This is really using a supposed anti-Semitic cartoon for political purposes.
Guilt, ADL statistics and race card politics mix a toxic brew.

Removing Spanish River High principal one small step for truth

Texto completo: I found myself thinking about what might have happened last year if basketball star Steph Curry’s children had been students at Spanish River High School.
Curry is perhaps the most famous American to voice the belief that NASA never landed men on the moon.
Speaking on a podcast with a few former NBA players, Curry asked them if they believed men had landed on the moon. They said, “No.”
“They’re going to come get us,” Curry said. “I don’t think so, either.”
NASA has since invited Curry to visit the space agency to touch its collection of moon rocks and review the history of the six Apollo flights that landed 12 astronauts on the lunar surface from 1969 to 1972.
Curry now says he was wrong, about as wrong as another NBA star, Kyrie Irving, who stubbornly insisted that the world may be flat.
“Can you openly admit that you know the Earth is constitutionally round?” Irving told a New York Times reporter. “Like, you know that for sure? Like, I don’t know.”
It’s easy to get a laugh at this nuttiness, and whatever “constitutionally round” means. But not when it’s given credence, under the umbrella that if enough people believe something -- no matter how demonstrably false it is -- then that crackpot opinion must be elevated to a kind of truth that puts the actual truth in question.
This is what happened at Spanish River High School in Boca Raton.
The principal there, William Latson, sidestepped a state law that mandated teaching the Holocaust to all students. And when a parent asked why, he claimed that it was because some people believed the Holocaust never happened, so he couldn’t treat it as a “factual, historical event.”
The principal, explaining that this wasn’t his own opinion, elaborated in another email to the parent.
“Not everyone believes the Holocaust happened and you have your thoughts but we are a public school and not all of our parents have the same beliefs so they will react differently,” he wrote.
He’s right. There are some people who keep talking about how the Holocaust is a hoax. They’re really easy to find on Stormfront.org, a white nationalist website based in West Palm Beach.
Lately, Latson’s been their kind of school principal.
“I don’t care about the holocaust. Nobody should. It really makes no difference whether it happened, or not, and there is no evidence to prove that it did,” one Stormfront poster from St. Louis wrote on Sunday. “Big deal. Jews need to stfu (shut the f--- up) and white Americans need to say “so what?” when someone brings it up.”
Another commenter from Oklahoma wrote: “He should of said it was a jewish lie as it really is that.”
This week, the school district reassigned Latson, removing him from his post at the high school. But it took the district more than a year to do it, and only after The Palm Beach Post published a story about his Holocaust comments and it became national news.
And that’s what made me wonder about my theoretical school-parent Curry and his lunar landing doubts.
How would Latson have handled that situation?
If the “not everyone believes it” standard applies, teaching that on July 20th, 50 years ago, NASA astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first men to walk on the moon must certainly be scrubbed from the history curriculum. After all, a lot of people believe the moon landings were a hoax, and it really doesn’t matter if they’re wrong, not in a world where all opinion is awarded a place at the adult’s table.
A Gallup poll taken 30 years after the first moon landing found that 6 percent of respondents called it fake or staged. A poll last year found that 57 percent of Russians believe the lunar landing never occurred.
The book, “We Never Went to the Moon: America’s Thirty Billion Dollar Swindle” by Bill Kaysing, has a 3½ star rating on Amazon with 62 customer reviews.
“Wake up and read this book or keep on dreaming -- the choice is yours,” reads one five-star review.
You can find equally passionate people claiming that the children murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut were really crisis actors perpetuating a hoax, or that the U.S. government and its planted explosives, not hijacked airliners, brought down the World Trade Center in New York.
Millions of people have visited the Creation Museum in Kentucky, which depicts an imaginary history of people and dinosaurs living together on earth just a few thousand years ago.
If I can find a million Floridians who opine that the state capital is Orlando, it doesn’t change the fact that the state capital is Tallahassee. Or that being a reasonable person doesn’t include accommodating falsehoods by “agreeing to disagree” on what the capital of Florida is.
The world is full of people willing to rewrite history by trying to normalize “alternative facts,” as they have been recently branded.
But that doesn’t change the terrible, provable history of the Holocaust. To imagine that a school principal in Boca Raton would find that concept challenging is … well, it’s practically unbelievable.

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump no tardó en intentar deslindarse de su relación con el multimillonario Jeffrey Epstein –acusado de tráfico sexual de menores– pero hay una historia demasiado personal entre ellos difícil de olvidar y que involucra a la primera dama Melania Trump .
Según un informe de The New York Times sobre los lazos comerciales y sociales entre el mandatario y Epstein, apenas el republicano fue electo, el empresario financiero se dedicó a difundir que fue él quien logró conectar al presidente con la entonces modelo y ahora Primera Dama.
Melania solo ha dicho que ella y Trump se conocieron cuando el entonces magnate inmobiliario le pidió su número de teléfono en el Kit Kat Club, en 1998, durante la Semana de la Moda.
Ni el presidente Trump ni su esposa han negado el hecho, además de que el periodo mencionado por Epstein coincide con las fechas en que se conoció la pareja presidencial, ya que la relación de la pareja presidencial comenzó hace 21 años, mientras que el mandatario afirma que dejó de hablarse a su exsocio hace 15 años, después de un pleito.
Una foto del 2000, tomada en Mar-a-Lago , muestra al presidente Trump, su esposa Melania, y a Epstein con la socialité británica Ghislaine Maxwell .

Un reporte de New York Post indica que en 1998, la entonces modelo casi no tenía dinero .
“Se encontró con Donald justo en el momento adecuado. Estaba casi sin dinero, como en la cuerda floja y a punto de regresar a Europa del Este” , afirm una la fuente al Post.
El portal británico Sunday Express indicó que a pesar de sus esfuerzos, la exmodelo nunca logró la fama mundial con su profesión, pero tuvo importantes contratos en los años noventa.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
"A Symbol of Plutocratic Corruption," by Michelle Goldberg (column, July 9):
My home is only a few blocks away from Jeffrey Epstein's huge mansion on East 71st Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues, and as I walked by there on Tuesday morning, the television camera crews were already setting up to shoot Mr. Epstein's home from every angle.
For ages, rich and powerful men like Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and Harvey Weinstein have abused and/or preyed on women, but Jeffrey Epstein is a sexual predator of the worst kind. Mr. Epstein preys on underage girls.
Mr. Epstein, with the aid of a plea agreement given him by Alexander Acosta, then a federal prosecutor and now President Trump's labor secretary, avoided a possible life sentence when brought up on 53 federal counts of assembling a large, cultlike network of underage girls and coercing them to perform multiple sex acts behind the walls of his Florida estate.
This non-prosecution agreement allowed Mr. Epstein to keep his perverted actions secret. The Southern District of New York has now brought an indictment, and Mr. Epstein could face spending the rest of his life in federal prison.
While this will not erase the damage done to countless young girls, it may be a red flag for all men who dare to abuse girls and women in the future.

To the Editor:
Re "Who Protected Jeffrey Epstein?" (editorial, July 9):
I was not particularly surprised that the Jeffrey Epstein case exposes our dual system of justice for rich and poor. What did surprise me was the degree to which Alexander Acosta's prosecutorial team acted in concert with the Epstein defense lawyers. Only public exposure opened this case up again.
Folks, the system is broken!

To the Editor:
Re "Financier's Safe Held Hundreds of Lewd Photos" (front page, July 9):
The true heroes of this story are a reporter, Julie K. Brown, and the newspaper that supported her, The Miami Herald. It's refreshing to know that in 2019, it's still possible for one determined journalist to be the prime mover in bringing someone to justice. Courageous women and men who doggedly pursue the truth are not our enemies but the best friends a democracy could hope for.
We don't have to pine for the good old days with intrepid reporters like Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. When it comes to investigative journalism at its best, those good old days are still with us, thanks to news organizations like The Miami Herald, The Washington Post and The New York Times.
Bruce Weinstein
New York
To the Editor:
The sexual abuse and exploitation of vulnerable women and children have always occurred. The positive aspect of the Jeffrey Epstein story is that we as a society are finally no longer turning a blind eye. This level of power and control to coerce these children and destroy their lives has to be brought to light, and those involved must be exposed.
We work tirelessly at Selah Freedom and the Selah Way Foundation to rescue and restore the lives of precious young people who have been sold and used for sex as much as 15 to 40 times a day. Their cries and pain are finally being heard. Bravo!

Minority women are winning the jobs race

Texto completo: The U.S. economy last week hit a milestone, reaching its longest expansion on record. Just a decade ago, the nation was mired in a severe recession that had erased trillions of dollars in wealth and left millions of people out of work.
While the recovery has delivered uneven gains, Hispanic women have emerged as the biggest job market winners in an economy that has now grown for 121 straight months, assuming data released in coming months confirms continued growth.
Employment rates for Hispanic women between 25 and 54, prime working years, have jumped by 2.2 percentage points since mid-2007, the eve of the Great Recession. That is the most of any prime-age working group. Black women came in second, adding 1.6 percentage points.
While employment rates have risen for minority women, they are far from the expansion's biggest winners by other measures. The richest 1% of earners - who are heavily white and male - have notched outsize earnings throughout the expansion and recovery. The top 1% also received nearly 17% of the total first-year benefit from the Trump administration's $1.5 trillion tax cut, according to the Tax Policy Center.
"We have an issue with wage inequality, income inequality and wealth inequality where most of the growth is going to the top," said Valerie Wilson, director of the Economic Policy Institute's program on race, ethnicity and the economy. "Those people are less likely to be women and much less likely to be women of color."
But the economic and social trends that have long kept minority women from making job and wage gains appear to be shifting. Hispanic women have historically worked less than any other demographic, earned fewer degrees than white and Black women, and had among the highest fertility rates. That is changing: Hispanic women have posted a major fertility decline during the past decade, and they have steadily raised college attainment.
The recent job gains show that prolonged economic growth, combined with those social changes, has the power to lift long-marginalized minorities. The pattern also offers hopeful news for employers: As these women come into more jobs, they are providing a new source of labor in an economy in which workers are increasingly scarce.
The expansion record will not be official until growth data is reported over the coming months, but America has clearly experienced a long period of job market healing. Unemployment is near its lowest level in 50 years, and prime-age employment rates have bounced back after falling off sharply during the 2007-2009 recession and its aftermath.
That progress has allowed the Black workforce to begin recovering from a painful recession. For Hispanic women, the recent gains are part of a more long-running trend toward higher employment but one that has recently accelerated.
Starting around 2012 and picking up around 2014, Hispanic women between 25 and 34 began pouring into jobs, contributing heavily to the group's overall progress. They now work at their highest rates on record. Hispanic women concentrate heavily in service jobs including health care, which have grown throughout the expansion.
"It does seem like there's something structural happening," said Ernie Tedeschi, policy economist at Evercore ISI.
Education is a big part of the story. While the share of whites and Blacks ages 18-24 who were enrolled in college actually dropped slightly between 2010 and 2016, the share of Hispanic women going for a degree jumped to 41% from 36%.
That is an improvement from a low level - 48.9% of white women were enrolled, by way of comparison - but it has major job market implications. Employment rates climb steadily with educational attainment.
Smaller families might be allowing more Hispanic women time to devote to careers. Age-adjusted fertility rates for Hispanic women plunged between 2008 and 2016, based on an analysis by the Institute for Family Studies.
Both changes - education and fertility - bring Hispanic women more in line with other American racial and ethnic groups. The group's millennials are more heavily U.S.-born, so they've been raised within American culture, smoothing the way for that convergence.
But economic opportunity seems to have been the spark that enabled a long-running cultural change to catch fire. While young women had been improving their education rates and delaying motherhood for years, their employment rate picked up in earnest only midway through the expansion, as available jobs outpaced available workers.
Black workers' experience underlines the hot labor market's role. While Black women are also having fewer children, the group's employment has historically moved in lockstep with the economy. That pattern has held in this business cycle: As companies hired steadily, Black workers' labor force participation climbed.
Now, the question is whether those gains will prove sustainable. Policymakers sometimes point out that some minorities suffer from a last-hired, first-fired phenomenon. Black women saw their employment rate drop 9.4 percentage points from its peak to its trough in the last crisis. Hispanic women had a similar but more muted response, losing about 6 percentage points.
Even if that pattern repeats itself come the next downturn, the fact that minority women are finding jobs now could leave them with more experience for their future resumes and more money in the bank.
"Shoring up labor market experience and earnings is a good thing," said Heather Boushey, executive director at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. "I think it is an unambiguous good."
But it is up in the air whether minority workers will see their wages catch up. Hispanic women with bachelor's degrees or higher made $46,237 on average in 2017, compared with $55,450 for non-Hispanic white women and $85,855 for non-Hispanic white men, based on Census Bureau data.
Much of that gap comes from the types of jobs women, and particularly minority women, work in, Boushey said. They skew heavily toward lower-paying service work. Research suggests career breaks and the lower hours that are sometimes associated with child rearing also play a role.
It's also unclear what is happening with Hispanic men and what that might mean for their families and communities. Like white men, Hispanic men are working less across education levels. Before the downturn, the employment rate for 25- to 34-year-old Hispanic men peaked at 91.6%. In May, that rate stood at 85.7%.
The jobs available in to day's economy may favor women over men - health services, food and leisure jobs, and education have all been hiring heavily and are all female-dominated - and women may be working more to patch up household earnings as men struggle to find their footing.
Regardless, the fact that minority women are steadily joining the ranks of the employed could spell good news for talent-hungry companies. Because the unemployment rate is historically low, economists have been concerned that businesses would run cut of applicants, forcing them to abruptly raise wages and prices as they competed for a finite number of would-be employees.
As sidelined groups prove themselves ready to work, they could help to keep widespread labor shortages at bay. "There is still room for employment-population ratios to grow: These are largely untapped segments of the labor force," said Wilson at the Economic Policy Institute. "Since there are more Black and Brown people in the population, in the labor force, it's reasonable to think that these are the groups in which you'll see the growth." - (The New York Times)

Texto completo: “Se dice que a él le gustan las mujeres hermosas tanto como a mí, y muchas de ellas están en el lado más joven”, afirmó Donald Trump en 2002 en declaraciones a la revista New York sobre su amigo multimillonario Jeffrey Epstein, agregando que era un “tipo estupendo”.
Epstein (66) fue arrestado el pasado sábado en Nueva York y ayer en su primera audiencia se declaró “no culpable” por cargos de tráfico sexual, al tiempo que fueron encontradas en su residencia de Manhattan una gran cantidad de fotografías de mujeres desnudas o con poca ropa, incluyendo jóvenes.
Hasta 45 años de cárcel podría enfrentar , destacó The New York Times, destacando su amistad en el pasado con el Príncipe Andrés de Inglaterra, el cineasta Woody Allen y el ex president Bill Clinton , quien ayer emitió un comunicado distanciándose del acusado pedófilo.
“El presidente Clinton no sabe nada de los terribles crímenes [de los que Epstein] se declaró culpable en Florida hace algunos años, o de los que recientemente fue acusado en Nueva York”, dijo el comunicado.
“En 2002 y 2003, el presidente Clinton realizó un total de cuatro viajes en el avión de Jeffrey Epstein (llamado “Lolita Express”): uno a Europa, uno a Asia y dos a África, que incluyeron paradas en relación con el trabajo de la Fundación Clinton”, agrega el comunicado, citado por New York Post.
“El personal, los partidarios de la fundación y su detalle del Servicio Secreto viajaron en cada tramo de cada viaje. Tuvo una reunión con Epstein en su oficina de Harlem en 2002, y casi al mismo tiempo realizó una breve visita al apartamento de Epstein en Nueva York con un miembro del personal y sus detalles de seguridad. No ha hablado con Epstein en más de una década, y nunca ha estado en Little St. James Island, el rancho de Epstein en Nuevo México, o su residencia en Florida”.
Originalmente a Epstein se abrió una investigación en 2005 después de que los padres de una supuesta víctima lo denunciaran a la policía en Florida. Pero en 2008 los fiscales en Miami hicieron un acuerdo secreto con él que le permitió evitar el procesamiento federal. En cambio, pasó cerca de un año en una cárcel de Palm Beach, donde se le permitió salir seis días a la semana para ir a trabajar.
El actual Secretario del Trabajo de Trump, Alexander Acosta, entonces fiscal en el sur de la Florida, supervisó el acuerdo de culpabilidad de 2008 que fue ampliamente criticado por dejar en libertad al multimillonario señalado por sexo con menores de edad.
Ahora fue detenido porque, Geoffrey S. Berman, fiscal federal de Manhattan, dijo que su oficina no estaba obligada a respetar el acuerdo de Florida de 2008.

Texto completo: “Se dice que a él le gustan las mujeres hermosas tanto como a mí, y muchas de ellas están en el lado más joven”, afirmó Donald Trump en 2002 en declaraciones a la revista New York sobre su amigo multimillonario Jeffrey Epstein, agregando que era un “tipo estupendo”.
Epstein (66) fue arrestado el pasado sábado en Nueva York y ayer en su primera audiencia se declaró “no culpable” por cargos de tráfico sexual, al tiempo que fueron encontradas en su residencia de Manhattan una gran cantidad de fotografías de mujeres desnudas o con poca ropa, incluyendo jóvenes.
Hasta 45 años de cárcel podría enfrentar , destacó The New York Times, destacando su amistad en el pasado con el Príncipe Andrés de Inglaterra, el cineasta Woody Allen y el ex president Bill Clinton , quien ayer emitió un comunicado distanciándose del acusado pedófilo.
“El presidente Clinton no sabe nada de los terribles crímenes [de los que Epstein] se declaró culpable en Florida hace algunos años, o de los que recientemente fue acusado en Nueva York”, dijo el comunicado.
“En 2002 y 2003, el presidente Clinton realizó un total de cuatro viajes en el avión de Jeffrey Epstein (llamado “Lolita Express”): uno a Europa, uno a Asia y dos a África, que incluyeron paradas en relación con el trabajo de la Fundación Clinton”, agrega el comunicado, citado por New York Post.
“El personal, los partidarios de la fundación y su detalle del Servicio Secreto viajaron en cada tramo de cada viaje. Tuvo una reunión con Epstein en su oficina de Harlem en 2002, y casi al mismo tiempo realizó una breve visita al apartamento de Epstein en Nueva York con un miembro del personal y sus detalles de seguridad. No ha hablado con Epstein en más de una década, y nunca ha estado en Little St. James Island, el rancho de Epstein en Nuevo México, o su residencia en Florida”.
Originalmente a Epstein se abrió una investigación en 2005 después de que los padres de una supuesta víctima lo denunciaran a la policía en Florida. Pero en 2008 los fiscales en Miami hicieron un acuerdo secreto con él que le permitió evitar el procesamiento federal. En cambio, pasó cerca de un año en una cárcel de Palm Beach, donde se le permitió salir seis días a la semana para ir a trabajar.
El actual Secretario del Trabajo de Trump, Alexander Acosta, entonces fiscal en el sur de la Florida, supervisó el acuerdo de culpabilidad de 2008 que fue ampliamente criticado por dejar en libertad al multimillonario señalado por sexo con menores de edad.
Ahora fue detenido porque, Geoffrey S. Berman, fiscal federal de Manhattan, dijo que su oficina no estaba obligada a respetar el acuerdo de Florida de 2008.

Why the Chore Coat Is an Ideal All-Season Blazer Alternative; Originally designed for French workers, this multi-pocketed, canvas jacket has become a go-to for urban gents everywhere with good reason

Texto completo: FOR OVER 100 years starting around the early 1900s, many workers throughout France toiled away in a veste de travail, a marine-blue cotton work coat with three front pockets to secure their nails, seeds, lures or whatever supplies they needed. The purpose of this jacket—now known in stylish circles as a chore coat—was to last "for 10, 20 years, 30 years if necessary," said Alexandre Milan, the president of Le Mont Saint Michel, a company in the bucolic Brittany region that has produced moleskin versions, originally for local farmers and craftsmen, since 1913.
"It was not a fashion garment back in the day," explained Laurent Bourven, the co-owner of French clothing label Arpenteur, an 8-year-old brand that produces durable versions. But in the 1980s, the chore coat was embraced by intellectuals and creatives. Perhaps charitably, Mr. Milan suggests this could have been a way to show workers solidarity. For Bill Cunningham, the late street-style photographer for the New York Times, the appeal was all functional. Mr. Cunningham began buying the jackets at a Parisian department store for the meager sum of $20. "They were the ones that the street sweepers wore," he said in a 2010 documentary on his life. "The jacket is functional 'cause it has the pockets and you can launder it, and I thought the color was nice."
In the years since that documentary's release, plenty of other non-blue-collar folks have reached similar conclusions. Especially relative to a blazer, the coats have a casualness and a versatility that "speaks to a lot of people," ventured Somsack Sikhounmuong, the co-founder and creative director of Alex Mill, a young New York-based label that produces an archetypal three-pocket chore coat. For the modern man who relies on phones, chargers and other digital doodads to get through the day, what might seem like an excess of pockets soon justifies itself. Aesthetically, the jacket is winningly Frankensteinian—mashing-up the crisp lines of a sport coat with the rough-it-up ruggedness of a flannel shirt. Make a chore coat cubicle-ready by layering it over a pressed shirt and knit tie. On weekends, toss one lazily over a T-shirt to appear marginally more presentable.
Men are not starved for chore coat options. RRL offers a lovingly distressed version, seemingly ripped off the back of a 1920s factory worker. Prada makes one in whisper-quiet navy with tone-on-tone stitching and a non-proletariat $1,220 price tag. And for the eco-conscious guy, Patagonia cuts its from hemp canvas. Still popular are the authentic French iterations by labels like Vetra, Le Mont Saint Michel, Arpenteur and Le Laboureur. Each of these options meets the chore-coat criteria: a traditional three pocket shape; flapped collar; and a straight hem.
Pocket The Difference
Chore jackets now span from the low-key to the luxe, in every color and fabric. Here, a few standouts.
The work jacket offers an interesting design challenge because it's a "blank canvas," explained Marc Asseily, the other co-founder of Arpenteur, which renders chore coats in collaboration with the brand C'H'C'M in irreverent colors like tomato red and sunflower yellow. Other labels similarly deviate from the norm with their colors, fabrications and fits. See: lavender tie-dye (California streetwear label Stussy); a refreshing mint-green with four pockets (New York's Childs); and an airy and understated black linen (Sweden's Our Legacy).
Such tweaks don't compromise the chore coat's enduring appeal as a trusty layer. But you can't go wrong with a classic. Brent MacKinnon, 29, a marketer in Halifax, Nova Scotia, recently purchased a durable Gap chore coat to get him through spring. "Denim jackets and bombers can be a bit boxy if your torso is shorter," said Mr. MacKinnon, "but a chore coat is a couple inches longer, I find, so it's a nice layer." If you deal with more heat, consider Alex Mill's light cotton creation or Our Legacy's linen version. It may be called a chore coat, but it shouldn't be a chore to wear.

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
The New Jersey judge who urged leniency for a teenage boy accused of sexual assault because the boy came from a "good family" has faced death threats in recent days as fierce public backlash mounts.
Officials are calling for his resignation, petitions are circulating that demand he be disbarred, a protest has been scheduled for later this week and threats of violence are pouring in -- including the threat of rape, according to people who have spoken to the judge, James Troiano.
Judge Troiano's comments led to a nationwide outcry and were seen as proof that the legal system had different rules for the privileged. The case has quickly eclipsed the judge's nearly three-decade career on the bench.
The decision concerned a 2017 case in which prosecutors said a visibly intoxicated 16-year-old girl was sexually assaulted by a drunken 16-year-old boy who recorded the act, and sent the video to his friends, along with a text that said, "When your first time is rape."
Judge Troiano, 69, cited the boy's good grades and potential to attend a good college when he denied prosecutors' request that the boy be charged as an adult.
Family Court proceedings are typically closed to the public, but some of Judge Troiano's comments, taken from a 65-page transcript of his sealed decision, were revealed when an appeals court decision was made public.
The appellate court issued a detailed 14-page ruling that warned Judge Troiano against showing bias toward privileged teenagers. In overturning the judge's decision, the appellate court also effectively ruled that the teenager could be tried as an adult; the case, however, would first need to be presented to a grand jury to weigh whether to indict him on the sexual assault accusation.
As the calls to resign have rolled in, Judge Troiano and his family, including his wife of 40 years, Debbie, and his son, Matthew James Troiano, a former prosecutor in Morris County, have received threatening phone calls and emails from strangers.
"The whole country, including your fellow judges and judges superior to you, are telling you that you're a bigot and a detriment to this country," read one email, shared with The New York Times, that included the hope that a family member be raped, "by a man stronger than you."
But in the controversy that has surrounded the decision, some legal analysts say nuance has been lost: In the ruling, Judge Troiano was not necessarily arguing that the 16-year-old be excused, they said. He was making a decision about which court should conduct the trial; Judge Troiano favored prosecuting the teenager as a juvenile in family court, not as an adult, they said.
In New Jersey, when determining the most appropriate court for a sex charge involving someone under 18, personal factors, including whether the juvenile is likely to be a delinquent, are required, by statute, to be considered.
"Family background is directly in issue, as any psychologist will confirm," James H. Maynard, an attorney who specializes in sex offense law, said in an email. "Because the family context, support and participation are relevant, and important, in juvenile sex-offender treatment."
Through his son, Matthew, who is a criminal attorney, Judge Troiano declined to comment. A court spokeswoman declined to comment on whether Judge Troiano was under any sort of review.
The case marked a turn in a long career in public service that included holding elected office and spending 29 years as a family court judge.
The son of a Newark dock worker, Judge Troiano graduated from Rutgers University and earned a law degree from Samford University's Cumberland School of Law in Birmingham, Ala., in 1975.
Judge Troiano started out as a lawyer in private practice in West Orange, N.J.. He became an active member of the Republican Party in Essex County, launching unsuccessful bids in the late 1970s and early 1980s for freeholder and county executive.
He eventually moved with his wife and children to Cedar Grove, N.J., where he found political success. From 1987 to 1992, he served as councilman, deputy mayor and mayor of Cedar Grove.
He was sworn in to the Superior Court bench on Nov. 13, 1992, after being nominated by former Gov. Jim Florio. Shortly after, he told a local newspaper that he came from a "partisan political background" and that one of his basic concerns was the "transition from the role of advocate to that of arbitrator."
"I can no longer take sides," he told the Verona-Cedar Grove Times. "A judge must always be open-minded and fair."
He retired in December 2012, but continued to hear cases, working as a part-time, or "recall" judge, three days a week, filling vacancies on the bench and helping to ease a case backlog.
"He has been around a long time and that situation he is being vilified for, it's not like this is new to him," said Joseph Cicala, a Cedar Grove councilman and lawyer who said he had argued one case in front of Judge Troiano. "He's been around long enough that I'm sure whatever decision he made, he thought through, and in his mind he was doing the right thing."
Still, there are online petitions that label Judge Troiano a "menace" and growing calls for his resignation from elected officials, including Assemblywoman Valerie Vainieri Huttle, a Democrat who represents Bergen County, and Loretta Weinberg, the New Jersey Senate majority leader. On Monday, Stephen M. Sweeney, the Democratic president of the State Senate, joined the chorus and called for his removal based on an "egregious absence of clear judgment."
The judge's decision is emblematic, critics have said, of judicial inequity that time and again treats juveniles from privileged backgrounds, particularly white defendants, with leniency, while coming down hard on poor, minority offenders for similar crimes.
"It is such an elitist, classic outlook on life," Ms. Weinberg said in an interview. "It's amazing to me that somebody could have grown up, gone to law school, become qualified to become a judge and could have possibly uttered something like this."
She added, "What about the victim?"
Elected officials and others are weighing in.
"Not only should this judge no longer serve -- as he is clearly incapable of properly fulfilling his duties -- but across the country, we must call out bad actors in the system, exposing their biases, and show women and survivors that we will doggedly pursue justice on their behalf," Cory Booker, a United States senator from New Jersey who is running in the Democratic presidential primary, said in a statement.
Particularly galling for many -- including, it appears, the judges of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division, who reviewed and rebuked Judge Troiano's decision -- was the assertion that the circumstances of the assault were not "traditional" rape. That, Judge Troiano asserted, is more violent, and he added that the girl's inebriation should be considered when determining the case.
"That the juvenile came from a good family and had good test scores we assume would not condemn the juveniles who do not come from good families and do not have good test scores from withstanding waiver applications," the appeals court decision said.
It is not the first time Judge Troiano has presided over high-profile cases involving minors.
In 2003, in another case that made headlines, Judge Troiano was also asked by prosecutors to try a teenager as an adult -- a 16-year-old who had body slammed his 7-year-old cousin, killing him.
"We have a healthy 16-year-old doing something like this to a 7-year-old," the judge said of his decision to have the teenager, Wesley A. Thomas, tried in adult court.
"The excuse of boys being boys does not hold water in this court. We have a 16-year-old who should have known better."
And in a 2008 case, Judge Troiano ordered three teenagers be tried as adults in the execution-style murders of three young people in a Newark playground.

Texto completo: A young man who had just turned 18 showed up at the Virginia office of Drs. Sterling and Karen Ransone earlier this month and asked for the vaccines for meningitis and human papillomavirus.
It was his first opportunity to be vaccinated. As a minor, he needed permission from his parents, and they wouldn’t grant it because they didn’t think the vaccines were medically necessary. Now, as a legal adult, he could get the shots on his own.
This year there have been at least 1,044 measles cases in 28 states — the largest outbreak since 1992. Public health officials blame parents who have refused to have their kids vaccinated. One way to boost immunization rates is to narrow school vaccination exemptions, which four states have done this year. Another is to take the decision out of parents’ hands and let their kids choose for themselves.
A handful of states already have given teens some vaccination rights. California, Delaware, Minnesota, New York and Washington, D.C., enacted laws years before the current measles outbreak giving minors the right to choose to get vaccinated against sexually transmitted diseases, such as human papillomavirus and hepatitis B.
Alabama, Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and South Carolina have gone further by giving minors the right to make all health care decisions. Some of their laws date to the 1970s, said Ross Silverman, a professor of health policy management at Indiana University Medical School.
The New Jersey General Assembly is debating a bill that would allow 14-year-olds to get vaccinated without their parents’ permission. City leaders in D.C. are considering a measure that would allow adolescents to be vaccinated without permission, as long as a doctor determines they are mature enough to make the decision. A similar bill died in the New York legislature, although its sponsor said she is considering bringing it up again next year.
More states may follow suit if this year’s outbreak is repeated and vaccination rates continue to decline.
“From a public health standpoint, I think all the states are going to have to look at [adolescent] consent for vaccination,” said Sterling Ransone, who practices family medicine alongside his pediatrician wife in a rural area near the Chesapeake Bay.
But David DeLugas, executive director of the National Association of Parents, which promotes the idea that parents should be able to raise their children as they see fit, said empowering children to make health care decisions over the parents’ objections may “introduce discord” into families.
“If we’re going to empower a child of 12 or 14 or 16 to decide something this significant, why wouldn’t they say, ‘If I can make that decision then why can’t I also make any other decision that affects my life?’” he said.
DeLugas is not a vaccine skeptic, and he doesn’t object to some state vaccination requirements, but he doesn’t think states should disrupt the parent-child relationship by taking power from one and bestowing it on the other.
States with minor-consent laws either set a minimum age, which varies from 12 to 16, or leave it up to a physician to determine if the child has the intellectual capacity to understand the risks and benefits relayed by the doctor. Either way, kids whose parents object to vaccinations can’t get them when they are babies or toddlers, which is when some vaccines, such as the one for measles, are most effective.
Democratic Assemblywoman Patricia Fahy, sponsor of the failed bill in New York, said that while she is leery of doing anything to diminish the authority of parents, the ongoing measles outbreak — nearly 20 years after the United States declared itself measles-free — convinced her that she had to act.
“I respect parental rights and am sensitive to this issue,” she said, “but you have to make public health your first and foremost priority.”
She said the bruising fight in the New York legislature this spring to eliminate religious exemptions left lawmakers with little appetite to take on her measure this year. New York has the highest number of measles cases in the current outbreak. The measure had the support of the New York chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.

Tetanus in a 6-year-old
Parents have broad discretion when it comes to the health care of their children — but there are limits.
“Obviously, in most circumstances parents are the right ones to make decisions that are in the best interests of children,” said Kathleen Bachynski, a postdoctoral fellow in the division of ethics at New York University’s School of Medicine, “but it isn’t an absolute right. Where the child is at risk, the state steps in to limit absolute parent decision-making.”
But states don’t always have the authority to intervene. In 2017, a 6-year-old boy in Oregon whose parents didn’t believe in vaccinations nearly died from tetanus, an almost unheard of disease in the United States thanks to immunizations, after he cut his forehead while playing on a farm.
He spent 57 days in agony in a hospital room and racked up medical bills exceeding $800,000.
He recovered, but his parents still refused to have him immunized for tetanus or anything else, The New York Times reported. There appears to be nothing authorities can do, because Oregon’s law applies only to teenagers 15 and up.
Ohio teen Ethan Lindenberger shined a spotlight on the issue in March when he testified before a U.S. Senate committee. Lindenberger was vaccinated when he turned 18 last year, but he would have done it sooner if his “anti-vaxxer” mother hadn’t forbidden it.
“I went my entire life without vaccinations against diseases such as measles, chicken pox or even polio,” he told the Senate committee.
He didn’t blame his mother but rather the misinformation she encountered online.
“The information leading people to fear for their children, for themselves and for their families is causing outbreaks of preventable diseases,” he concluded.
------------
Private discussions
Sterling Ransone, the Virginia doctor, said that after his young patients reach a certain age, he excuses parents from the examination room to give the child a chance to talk to him privately. He encourages minors to involve their parents in health care decisions, but there are exceptions.
“We feel strongly that folks in the adolescent range, from 12 to 15, should be able to speak to physicians about concerns of theirs,” he said.
Frequently, those conversations pertain to sexual activity, mental illness and substance abuse, and they are strictly confidential. Kids may not seek the care they need — for STDs, for example — if they know their parents will find out about it.
After a child reaches around 12 years old, the doctor said he doesn’t even permit parents to have access to the electronic health records of their child without the child’s permission. But because minors are on their parents’ health plans, it’s often impossible for their children to keep sensitive information from their parents.
To some degree, all states recognize that older children should have some autonomy in making health care decisions.
Silverman, who co-authored an article in the June issue of the New England Journal of Medicine on adolescent rights in health care, said all states permit minors to make some health care decisions, especially in “sensitive or stigmatized” areas such as sexual health and drug addiction.
Kids also can consent to emergency care when their parents aren’t present.
The measure under consideration in D.C. would allow minors to consent to all vaccinations the city requires to attend school.
Mary Cheh, the Democratic author of the measure, said she wanted to act before a measles outbreak came to the capital. She said she was mindful of not only unvaccinated children contracting the disease, but the danger posed to Washington residents by exposure to tourists who haven’t been immunized.
“We have the additional problem of all these millions of people who come to the District of Columbia and interact with our people,” she said. “We want to get ahead of the situation.”

Texto completo: Investigations surrounding Deutsche Bank's more than decade-long relationship with President Donald Trump and his business have created a crisis for the German financial giant.
It's caught in a legal tug of war between Trump and House Democrats for the president's financial records and calls for broad investigations of its anti-money laundering practices.
But for the 150-year old bank, Trump is just the beginning of its problems.
Once a global powerhouse, catering to the U.S. elite from a tower on Wall Street, Deutsche Bank's fortunes have waned. Sunday, it announced a sweeping restructuring, including gutting its stock and bonds trading business and reducing other investment bank operations.
The overhaul will mean as many as 18,000 jobs cut by 2022 out of its 90,000 workers. The news followed an announcement Friday that Deutsche Bank's investment banking chief, Garth Ritchie, was stepping down by mutual agreement.
The restructuring is "the most fundamental transformation of Deutsche Bank in decades, Christian Sewing, the bank's chief executive, said in a statement. "This is a restart for Deutsche Bank - for the long-term benefit of our clients, employees, investors and society.
Shareholders are growing increasingly frustrated by the bank's lackluster profits and growing legal bills. The bank's stock dipped to record lows in recent months, though it has rebounded some recently.
At its annual meeting in Frankfurt, shareholders quizzed company executives for more than nine hours over a series of missteps that have kept the bank under pressure.
"I'm leading a bank that is undoubtedly going through a challenging period, said Sewing, who has been at the bank for more than 20 years and became chief executive in 2018. "I want to bring back the pride people feel in working for Deutsche Bank. This is crucial for motivation. Deutsche was prepared to make "tough cutbacks, he told shareholders.
The bank reported a profit for the first time since 2014 last year, but shareholders are still not satisfied.
"We don't envy CEO Sewing who has inherited the toughest job in European Banking, Kian Abouhossein, a JPMorgan Chase analyst, said in a research note last month.
Deutsche "used to be the biggest lender in Germany, said Firdaus Ibrahim, a CFRA equity analyst. Its "relevance has been declining over the years.
The various investigations into Deutsche and its relationship with Trump have made the bank's efforts to bounce back more complex, analysts say.
It is currently caught in a legal battle over a subpoena from House Democrats for years of the president's financial records. A Manhattan federal judge has rejected a request by Trump and his family to block Deutsche and Capital One from complying with the congressional subpoenas. The case is on hold while Trump appeals the decision and the banks have agreed not to turn over any information until the case is resolved.
Seven Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee have also asked the Federal Reserve to probe whistleblower allegations, first reported by the New York Times last month, that Deutsche Bank buried suspicious activity from accounts associated with Trump and his son-in-law and senior White House adviser Jared Kushner.
New York Attorney General Leticia James has also subpoenaed records from Deutsche Bank related to three large loans the bank extended to Trump's company in recent years.
The "Democrats' maneuvers will be a cloud over Deutsche for the foreseeable future, said Ian Katz, a policy analyst at Capital Alpha Partners.
The bank has said it will cooperate with all of the investigations and has begun discussing the best way to turn over the documents covered by the subpoena with members of the House committee staff, according to a person familiar with the discussions. Bank executives have indicated they are wary of appearing to resist any of the U.S. investigations, said the person, who sought anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.
All of the investigations are a "negative, said Ibrahim of CFRA, adding that it "reaffirms what the market has been concerned about the bank's legal risk.
It comes at a time when Deutsche is also struggling to put years of legal troubles behind it. In 2016, it agreed to a $7.2 billion settlement for a mortgage-abuse case with the U.S. Justice Department and in 2018 agreed to pay $240 million to settle accusations it conspired with other banks to manipulate a key interest rate.
But the pressure has intensified. Recently the bank acknowledged that it used faulty software to detect suspicious customer transactions and in November, more than 100 German officers raided its Frankfurt headquarters as part of a money-laundering investigation. The search "hit TV screen across the world and ... severely damaged us, said Sewing, the chief executive.
It is also at the center of one of the largest money-laundering cases in history involving Danske, Denmark's largest bank. Authorities are investigating $233 billion in suspicious transactions moving through the bank's tiny branch in Estonia - nearly 10 times larger than that country's gross domestic product. Deutsche Bank helped transfer funds on behalf of Danske, which has said it has improved its internal systems to fight financial crime.
Deutsche Bank has said it is cooperating with all investigations and has not been told it violated any laws with its relationship with Danske.
"We believe it is time for shareholders to hold (Deutsche) accountable for the many years of substantial monetary and reputational costs to the bank borne by shareholders, Institutional Shareholder Services, a proxy advisory firm, said in a note recommending that shareholders issue a vote of no confidence to the bank's board. The board ultimately survived the vote.
Most pressing to many shareholders is the bank's continuing struggle to rebound from the financial crisis. The European economy recovered more slowly than the United States after the financial crisis and so did its banks. But Deutsche's recovery has been particularly slow, analysts say.
It reported a profit of $341 million last year compared with a loss of $735 million in 2017, but that still disappointed investors. On Sunday, the bank announced it would report a more than $3 billion loss for its second quarter, in part to pay for the restructuring. The bank considered a merger with its German rival Commerzbank earlier this year, but was plunged into more uncertainty after that deal fell through.
Deutsche's "indecisiveness has been one of the main reasons why the market has been so skeptical of its turnaround plan, said Ibrahim of CFRA. " Since the financial crisis, the bank has seen numerous changes of management and strategy, none of which have been successfully executed.
In the United States, where Deutsche has about 10 percent of its 91,000 employees, the bank is also facing a challenges with its U.S. regulators. It has repeatedly failed an annual stress test proving that its U.S. operations could sustain itself during another global financial crisis without wreaking havoc on the economy.
"The crisis heightened the realization than non-U.S. large financial intuitions like Deutsche were even more fragile, had even less capital than was true of major U.S. banks, said Larry White, a professor at NYU Stern School of Business. "Deutsche may well be too big to fail, too big to manage effectively.

Sid Ramin, whose Roxbury friendship with Leonard Bernstein scaled music's heights, dies at 100

Texto completo: Sid Ramin was attending elementary school in Roxbury when he met Leonard Bernstein one day at the home of a mutual friend. Bernstein was trying, with little success, to teach their friend to play a song on the piano.
“Mind if I try?" Sid Ramin asked. Bernstein watched him play the song with ease and remarked: “Well, you're the fellow I should be teaching," according Humphrey Burton's biography “Leonard Bernstein."
That boyhood encounter turned into a lifelong friendship between Bernstein and Mr. Ramin, who as an orchestrator, arranger, and composer would go on to win an Oscar and a Grammy for his work on the film of “West Side Story," for which Bernstein composed the music.
Mr. Ramin, whose work ranged from revered Broadway musicals to perfume commercials, died July 1 in his Manhattan, N.Y., home. He was 100.
He was one of two orchestrators — or three, if you count the contributions of Bernstein — on the original Broadway production of “West Side Story," which opened in 1957. According to “The Sound of Broadway Music" (2009), by Steven Suskin, Mr. Ramin worked on the haunting ballad “Somewhere," the evocative “Something's Coming," the sweetly comic “I Feel Pretty," the bravado-of-youth anthem “Here Come the Jets," and the irreverent “Gee, Officer Krupke."
Sid Ramin could easily have put the letters EGOT after his name, as one of the small group of artists who have won Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony awards. But the Tonys did not formally honor orchestration until 1997, four years after his last Broadway show (“The Red Shoes"). His 1983 Emmy was not usually the first award he talked about; it was for his work on the daytime drama “All My Children."
If EGOC had existed instead, Mr. Ramin would have easily qualified: He won 12 Clio Awards, the advertising industry's highest honor.
“Music to Watch Girls By," a peppy, Latin-accented instrumental he wrote for a Diet Pepsi commercial in the mid-1960s, became something of a phenomenon. It was recorded by a diverse group of musicians, including Al Hirt, Chet Atkins, the Bob Crewe Generation, and (with lyrics added) Andy Williams. Both the Crewe and Williams versions were Top 40 hits.
The consumer products for which he wrote or arranged lively jingle music included a Revlon fragrance (“Kind of free/Kind of wow/Charlie!"), a laundry liquid (“You'll look better/In the clothes you trust/To Woolite"), and a toothpaste (“How's your love life?/How's your love life?/Use Ultra Brite" — sung to the tune of “The Hallelujah Chorus").
But Broadway was his major platform. Shows whose orchestrations he worked on, in addition to “West Side Story," included “Gypsy" (1959), “I Can Get It for You Wholesale" (1962), “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum" (1962), Bette Midler's “Clams on the Half Shell Revue" (1975), “Jerome Robbins' Broadway" (1989), and “Crazy for You" (1992).
His overture for “Gypsy" was particularly lauded. The British actor John Gielgud once said it was the only recording he would need with him if he were stranded on a desert island. Mr. Ramin made the decision not to include song excerpts in chronological order, as most Broadway overtures do, but to begin with the opening notes (“I had a dream") from “Everything's Coming Up Roses," originally sung by Ethel Merman in the role of Gypsy Rose Lee's mother.
Mr. Ramin's work seemed omnipresent in 1960s popular culture. He wrote the music for the “Patty Duke Show" theme (“They're cousins/Identical cousins . . ." and he was also the show's conductor and music supervisor) and for another popular series, “Candid Camera."
Although he was the arranger and conductor for “Stiletto," a 1969 crime drama, and for a 1973 television movie remake of “Miracle on 34th Street," the movie business was never a major part of Mr. Ramin's career.
In a 2011 interview sponsored by the New York Philharmonic, Mr. Ramin recalled going to the West Coast to work on the film of “West Side Story" (1961) and deciding that he and his collaborator, Irwin Kostal, should do as the Romans do.
“Let's set up a bridge table at the pool and work poolside," Mr. Ramin recalled suggesting. When the two men, who had also worked together on the Broadway production, decided to take a break and a swim, all their pages flew into the pool beside them – and they had been working in ink. The moral: “We decided we should not go Hollywood."
Sidney Nathan Ramin was born in Boston on Jan. 22, 1919, the older of two sons of Ezra Ramin, a Russian-born visual merchandiser (the job was called window dresser at the time) for Jordan Marsh, and Beatrice (Salamoff) Ramin. He grew up in Roxbury and was 12 when he and Bernstein became best friends.
“We created little songs together," Mr. Ramin recalled decades later in a Film Music Foundation video interview, and they exchanged constructive criticism. Bernstein assumed the role of teacher early on.
When Bernstein enrolled at Harvard, Mr. Ramin arranged for them to continue studying together. “I'll pay you a dollar a lesson and a candy bar," he told Bernstein.
“I'm glad to see that you've decided to study with me. I think you'll get a lot out of it," Bernstein wrote to Mr. Ramin in a March 1937 letter, adding that “I can give you a comprehensive outlook on harmony. . . with an eye ever cast in the direction of jazz."
Mr. Ramin always contended that aside from his early colloquy with Bernstein, he had no training in orchestration – and that he never learned to play a musical instrument. Before joining the Army, though, he did attend the New England Conservatory of Music, as well as Boston University.
On the cover of Mr. Ramin's album “Love is a Swinging Word, Bernstein wrote: “I have known Sid Ramin since we were both 13. I was impressed with his great musicality then, and I have continued to be more and more impressed ever since. His work with me (and Irv Kostal) on 'West Side Story' was invaluable – sensitive, strong, and facile."
Mr. Ramin spent five years in the Army, much of it in France, where he created original productions for the Army band. In 1946 he moved to New York City, where he attended Columbia University with the help of the GI Bill.
By the 1950s he was the musical arranger for “The Milton Berle Show" (originally “Texaco Star Theater"), NBC's hit hour-long variety-comedy series. He was also making albums for RCA Victor as the leader of Sid Ramin and His Orchestra. Then Bernstein called about the “West Side Story" job.
Mr. Ramin married Gloria Breit in 1949. In addition to his wife, he leaves a son, Ron, and two grandsons.
“As you may know, Lenny, I'm always on cloud nine when I'm in the same room with you," Mr. Ramin wrote to Bernstein in a 1976 letter.
Bernstein died in 1990, but Mr. Ramin continued to be interviewed about their work together. “He loved to talk, and I loved to listen to him. I guess it's about as close to idolizing someone as you can get," Mr. Ramin told The New York Times in 2003. “My analyst used to say it was a little much."

Texto completo: New York City will tighten rules for the purchase and refinancing of taxi medallions following a 45-day review ordered by Mayor Bill de Blasio.
The review, conducted by several city agencies and released Monday, found that brokers who facilitate the purchase, sale and refinancing of medallions often fail to disclose interests in the transactions or to adequately explain terms to borrowers.
Taxi driver advocates said the recommendations don't go far enough. The New York Taxi Workers Alliance on Monday renewed calls for the city to repay the debt for thousands of drivers whose loans are underwater. Mr. de Blasio, speaking at an unrelated press conference, said the city couldn't afford to bail out drivers, but would help in any other ways it could.
Medallions are the metal shields pinned to a taxi's hood that grant drivers the right to pick up passengers on the street. Of New York's 13,500 medallions, about 3,500 are owned by people who also drive the taxi themselves, according to the city. Most of the remaining medallions are owned by garages that operate a fleet of cars.
Many owner-drivers were plunged into financial distress when the value of a medallion plummeted several years ago to less than $200,000 from a high of more than $1 million just a few years previously. The drivers' situation has been exacerbated by the influx into the city of about 80,000 ride-hailing vehicles operating for companies such as Uber Technologies Inc. Their arrival has driven down earnings for all for-hire and taxi drivers.
The city's review was prompted by an investigation earlier this year by the New York Times, which found that taxi industry leaders sought to inflate the value of medallions and that brokers used predatory-lending practices to enrich themselves.
About one-third of New York's 20 licensed brokers couldn't provide all of the necessary documentation for transactions they facilitated over the past three years, according to the city's review. Those cases with missing documentation have been passed to a city unit that could issue fines.
The review also found that drivers were poorly advised about the loans they took out and refinanced and that it was often unclear to borrowers whether brokers charged additional fees or had financial ties to lenders and insurance brokerages.
More than 300 owner-drivers responded to a survey conducted by the review team. About 80% said they had borrowed against their medallion to finance homes, vehicle purchases or college. In many cases, drivers weren't aware of the terms of the deals.
The survey found that drivers paid a median purchase price of $340,000 for their medallions, but had a median debt outstanding of almost $500,000. About half said they struggled to pay their monthly bills and one quarter said they were considering bankruptcy.
The review found that many drivers had medallion loan payments of between $2,500 to $4,000 a month.
The review team, which included officials from the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission, said the regulator should amend its rules forcing brokers to clearly lay out the terms of loans and to translate them for drivers, most of whom are immigrants. The city will also set up a unit to monitor and review brokers and a center to provide financial advice to drivers.

Texto completo: For Bloomberg
When I heard last week that Lee Iacocca had passed away, I was momentarily taken aback. Not so much because he had died — he was, after all, 94 — but because, for someone who had been such a larger-than-life figure for so much of his career, he had been out of the limelight for so long.
Iacocca burst into the public consciousness in 1963, when he made the covers of both Time and Newsweek in the same week, standing in front of the brand new Ford Mustang, which he had (allegedly) masterminded as a top Ford executive. His last public act took place in 1995, when he and the financier Kirk Kerkorian made a foolhardy attempt to take over Chrysler. Although he later formed an investment company, and dabbled in this and that, this once unforgettable figure spent the last two decades of his life, well, forgotten.
In the headline of its obituary, The New York Times described Iacocca as a “Visionary Automaker Who Led Both Ford and Chrysler.” And that’s true, so far as it goes. Having accrued most of the credit for the Mustang, he was promoted to Ford’s president by the time he was 46. But in 1978, even though Ford was going great guns, Henry Ford II fired him. Supposedly, Ford said he was canning Iacocca because he didn’t like him.
Then came his tenure at Chrysler, which was on the brink of collapse when he took it over. He persuaded the federal government to give the company $1.5 billion in loan guarantees, and used that money to orchestrate a brilliant turnaround, spearheaded by the Chrysler minivan — a car that, in addition to making the company gobs of money, had a profound impact on American society. (Just ask any parent.)
All well and good.
But Iacocca influenced the culture in another way as well. The celebrification of chief executives can be traced directly to him. Yes, there had been other famous corporate chieftains before Iacocca — John D. Rockefeller and Walt Disney come to mind — but they were the exceptions to the rule that CEOs should be low-key, boring even. Iacocca made it OK for a chief executive not just to gain fame, but to desire it.
When had a chief executive made himself the centerpiece of his company’s ad campaign before Iacocca did it at Chrysler? When had one made himself a selling point in asking Congress for help? Or taken a public victory lap the way Iacocca did after the Chrysler turnaround, posing for magazine covers from Life to the Saturday Evening Post? Or publicly muse about running for president? Oh, and when had a chief executive written an autobiography that became one of the best-selling books of all time? Not business books, mind you. Books. Published in 1984, there were more than 7 million copies sold by the end of the following year.
After Iacocca did it, other CEOs put themselves in their companies’ ad campaign: Dave Thomas, founder of the Wendy’s Co., and Victor Kiam, who owned Remington Products Co., maker of electric shavers. (His tag line: “I liked it so much, I bought the company.”) CEOs became less bashful about granting interviews and posing for magazine covers. (By 2002, Bill Gates had posed for Fortune’s cover 25 times.) Or bragging about their accomplishments to anyone who would listen. (I’m talking to you, Jack Welch.)
And then there were the ghost-written CEO autobiographies, which poured forth into bookstores after the success of Iacocca: An Autobiography. Pizza Tiger, by Tom Monaghan, founder of Domino’s Pizza Inc. Work in Progress, by Michael Eisner, former chief executive of The Walt Disney Co. Straight From the Gut, by Welch, CEO of General Electric Co. Sam Walton: Made in America, by Walmart Inc. founder Sam Walton. Father, Son & Co.: My Life at IBM, by Thomas Watson Jr. And lest we forget: The Art of the Deal, by Donald Trump. That came out three years after Iacocca’s book.
I never covered Iacocca myself, but I’ve long realized that much of my career has been spent taking advantage of the trail he blazed. My very first business story, in 1982, was about T. Boone Pickens’ first hostile takeover attempt, which I wrote for Texas Monthly. When Pickens decided to write his autobiography a few years later, he hired me as his ghostwriter. (It ended badly for me, but that’s a story for another day.)
During my decade at Fortune, getting to know CEOs, interviewing them, writing stories about them — and getting them to pose for the cover — was at the heart of the enterprise. I did a short documentary about Warren Buffett. At The New York Times, my readership always spiked when I wrote a column about Steve Jobs and Apple. Now at Bloomberg, I still find myself drawn to columns about CEOs. Readers care about the comings and goings of chief executives in a way they never did before Lee Iacocca.
So I guess what I should say as I bid adieu to Iacocca is simply this: Thank you. Maybe that’s what we should all say.

Texto completo: Investigations surrounding Deutsche Bank's more than decade-long relationship with President Trump and his business have created a crisis for the German financial giant.
It's caught in a legal tug of war between Trump and House Democrats for the president's financial records and calls for broad investigations of its anti-money-laundering practices.
But for the 150-year-old bank, Trump is just the beginning of its problems.
Once a global powerhouse, catering to the U.S. elite from a tower on Wall Street, Deutsche Bank's fortunes have waned. Sunday, it announced a sweeping restructuring, including gutting its stock and bond trading business and reducing other investment bank operations.
The overhaul will mean as many as 18,000 job cuts by 2022 out of its 90,000 workers. The news followed an announcement Friday that Deutsche Bank's investment banking chief, Garth Ritchie, was stepping down by mutual agreement.
The restructuring is "the most fundamental transformation of Deutsche Bank in decades," Christian Sewing, the bank's chief executive, said in a statement. "This is a restart for Deutsche Bank - for the long-term benefit of our clients, employees, investors and society."
Shareholders are growing increasingly frustrated by the bank's lackluster profits and growing legal bills. The bank's stock dipped to record lows in recent months, though it has rebounded some recently.
At its annual meeting in Frankfurt, shareholders quizzed company executives for more than nine hours over missteps that have kept the bank under pressure.
"I'm leading a bank that is undoubtedly going through a challenging period," said Sewing, who has been at the bank for more than 20 years and became chief executive in 2018. "I want to bring back the pride people feel in working for Deutsche Bank. This is crucial for motivation." Deutsche was prepared to make "tough cutbacks," he told shareholders.
The bank reported a profit for the first time since 2014 last year, but shareholders are still not satisfied.
"We don't envy CEO Sewing, who has inherited the toughest job in European Banking," Kian Abouhossein, a JPMorgan Chase analyst, said in a research note last month.
Deutsche "used to be the biggest lender in Germany," said Firdaus Ibrahim, a CFRA equity analyst. Its "relevance has been declining over the years."
The various investigations into Deutsche and its relationship with Trump have made the bank's efforts to bounce back more complex, analysts say.
It is caught in a legal battle over a subpoena from House Democrats for years of the president's financial records. A Manhattan federal judge has rejected a request by Trump and his family to block Deutsche and Capital One from complying with the congressional subpoenas. The case is on hold while Trump appeals the decision, and the banks have agreed not to turn over any information until the case is resolved.
Seven Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee have also asked the Federal Reserve to probe whistleblower allegations, first reported by the New York Times last month, that Deutsche Bank buried suspicious activity from accounts associated with Trump and his son-in-law and senior White House adviser, Jared Kushner.
New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) has also subpoenaed records from Deutsche Bank related to three large loans the bank extended to Trump's company in recent years.
The "Democrats' maneuvers will be a cloud over Deutsche for the foreseeable future," said Ian Katz, a policy analyst at Capital Alpha Partners.
The bank has said it will cooperate with all of the investigations and has begun discussing the best way to turn over documents covered by the subpoena with members of the House committee staff, according to a person familiar with the discussions. Bank executives have indicated they are wary of appearing to resist any of the U.S. investigations, said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.
All of the investigations are a "negative," said Ibrahim, of CFRA, adding that it reaffirms why "the market has been concerned about the bank's legal risk."
It comes at a time when Deutsche is also struggling to put years of legal troubles behind it. In 2016, it agreed to a $7.2 billion settlement for a mortgage-abuse case with the U.S. Justice Department and in 2018 agreed to pay $240 million to settle accusations it conspired with other banks to manipulate a key interest rate.
But the pressure has intensified. Recently, the bank acknowledged that it used faulty software to detect suspicious customer transactions, and in November, more than 100 German officers raided its Frankfurt headquarters as part of a money-laundering investigation. The search "hit TV screens across the world and . . . severely damaged us," said Sewing, the chief executive.
The bank is also at the center of one of the largest money-laundering cases in history, involving Danske, Denmark's largest bank. Authorities are investigating $233 billion in suspicious transactions moving through the bank's tiny branch in Estonia - nearly 10 times larger than that country's gross domestic product. Deutsche Bank helped transfer funds on behalf of Danske, which has said it has improved its internal systems to fight financial crime.
Deutsche Bank has said it is cooperating with all investigations and has not been told it violated any laws in its relationship with Danske.
"We believe it is time for shareholders to hold [Deutsche] accountable for the many years of substantial monetary and reputational costs to the bank borne by shareholders," Institutional Shareholder Services, a proxy advisory firm, said in a note recommending that shareholders issue a vote of no confidence to the bank's board. The board ultimately survived the vote.
Most pressing to many shareholders is the bank's continuing struggle to rebound from the financial crisis. The European economy recovered more slowly than that of the United States after, and so did its banks. But Deutsche's recovery has been particularly slow, analysts say.
It reported a profit of $341 million last year compared with a loss of $735 million in 2017, but that still disappointed investors. On Sunday, the bank announced it would report a more than $3 billion loss for its second quarter, in part, to pay for the restructuring. The bank considered a merger with its German rival Commerzbank earlier this year but was plunged into more uncertainty after that deal fell through.
Deutsche's "indecisiveness has been one of the main reasons why the market has been so skeptical of its turnaround plan," Ibrahim said. "Since the financial crisis, the bank has seen numerous changes of management and strategy, none of which have been successfully executed."
In the United States, where Deutsche has about 10 percent of its employees, the bank is also facing challenges with its U.S. regulators. It has repeatedly failed an annual stress test proving that its U.S. operation could sustain itself during another global financial crisis without wreaking havoc on the economy.
"The crisis heightened the realization than non-U. S. large financial intuitions like Deutsche were even more fragile, had even less capital than was true of major U.S. banks," said Larry White, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business. "Deutsche may well be too big to fail, too big to manage effectively."

For Cleon Jones, his roots began in Africatown

Texto completo: MOBILE, Ala. - "Hey Cleon! Thanks for the roof!"
Cleon Jones leans out the window of his van and frowns at the woman who has called to him from her porch. "If Jesse weren't sitting there" - Jones points at her white-haired husband - "I'd throw a brick at y'all. You weren't even at our community meeting today."
The woman holds her arms up, mock surrender, and smiles. "Sorry!"
Jones laughs. "All right, girl, all right. We ain't going to mess with you."
We bounce down the road deeper into Africatown, Mobile's ancient Black quarter, where Jones came of age in the cane-brakes and alligator reeds that run to the Mobile River, where he learned baseball well enough to star with the New York Mets and where he and his wife, Angela, built a handsome brick home next to the shotgun shack where he grew up without running water or electricity.
He is a de facto mayor, neighbors turning to him to find loans to repair roofs, build a community garden or care for a son struck by lightning. Jones, his mustache snow-white in his eighth decade, peers from under a blue-and-orange Mets cap. His words amble out in a moonflower-soft Alabama accent.
"Growing up in the Jim Crow south, I learned my lane," he says. "Hell yes, I stayed in that lane. Now every lane is ours, and we have changes to make."
Jones. Tommie Agee. Ed "The Glider" Charles and Donn Clendenon. They were 1969 Mets stalwarts, stars after whom my friends and I modeled our boyhood swings and our strolls to the plate. These African-American players were far more than that and in ways we only dimly divined.
They were the generational sons of baseball pioneers Jackie Robinson and Larry Doby, navigating the Jim Crow South with its poisonous laws and unspoken trespasses.
Donn Clendenon, the loose-limbed first baseman with the BarcaLoung-er power swing, was a student at Morehouse, which assigned him a mentor known as a "big brother": Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. In 1968, Clendenon, then on the Pittsburgh Pirates, organized Black players and threatened a boycott unless games were postponed on the day of King's burial; the owners grudgingly relented.
Ed Charles hailed from the segregated harshness of Daytona, Florida. Agee was Cleon's best friend and a fellow son of Mobile. All of this is laid out beautifully in Wayne Coffey's book about that team, "They Said It Couldn't Be Done."
Mobile was a cistern overflowing with African-American baseball talent. A graceful Spanish-moss draped city of 190,000 people, Mobile produced five Hall of Fame baseball players, and all were Black: Hank Aaron, Willie McCovey, sweet-swinging Billy Williams, Ozzie Smith and Satchel Paige. Jones recalls being a young boy watching Paige pitch an exhibition: "He ordered his players, 'sit down'. And they sat on that field, and he struck out the side."
In Jones' telling, his boyhood was bucolic after a complicated fashion. He struck up friendships with white boys from Chickasaw and Prichard, and they played football and baseball. Sometimes they ate at his grandmother's table in Africatown, and sometimes he ate at their tables. He never had the luxury of forgetting where he was. When dusk tiptoed in he excused himself and took his miles-long walk home.
"I made sure I was home by nightfall, yes I did," he said.
When he was an infant, his mother and father stood on a bus line in Mobile. A white man demanded they get to the back of the line. "My mother wore her hair long, and he snatched her hair and pulled her back" and called her a racial epithet, Jones said.
"They got into a ruckus, and my daddy got the best of him," Jones said. "Word came the police were looking for him, and that night my daddy jumped a freight train to New Orleans and Chicago."
A few days later his mother fled to Philadelphia. When he turned 12, he heard his grandmother crying on the porch, and he slipped out of bed and walked to her side and asked what was the matter.
Word had come that Jones' mother had died. "I never saw my mother except in photographs."
After high school, Jones began an arduous back-road trip through the minor leagues and Southern towns, where men and women narrowed eyes and screamed racial invective. More than a few Black players shook their heads and departed for home.
Not Jones. "I'd hear that and dig in so deep at home plate that I was looking up at the pitcher. Then that pitch came and - bang!"
Here and there he saw glimmers of light. His team arrived in Jacksonville, Florida, one night, and Jones and some Black teammates piled into a fish joint. They sat 45 minutes without seeing a waitress.
The manager apologized and called the waitress over. She used a racial expletive in making clear she would not serve Jones and his party. The manager called over another waitress and fired the one who would not serve them.
The following day the players returned to that restaurant, and the same waitress who had refused to serve them walked over. "She told us, 'You know, I was brought up a certain way, but I have to know I'm an adult and make my own decisions,'" he said. "I begged for my job back, and now I'm begging you guys to forgive me.'"
The men talked to her, and she served dinner.
They played that night, and Jones looked into the stands and saw that same waitress cheering for them. "Every time we went to Jacksonville we always recognized her and she waved to us. And we had made a genuine friend.
"Most folks want to be cordial. You just have to leave the door open."
Jones is no starry-eyed idealist, and his eyes can flash steel when challenged. Even on the Mets, which he considered family, there were a few white racial incorrigibles. He would pad out of the shower and hear stuff he would rather not.
"After playing with those guys for a while, they turned out to be my friends," Jones said, breaking into a chuckle. "Or they pretended so well that I couldn't tell."
Jones hit .340 in 1969, and with his speed and power, he was the batting leader of the team.
His end with the Mets six years later was desultory. His favorite manager and general manager, Gil Hodges and Johnny Murphy, had long since died of heart attacks.
He had injured his knee and had fallen to quarreling with manager Yogi Berra.
Then, while he was in Florida rehabilitating, the police found Jones fully clothed and asleep in his van with a white woman. He had been driving her home when the van ran out of gas. The Mets chairman, M. Donald Grant, an imperious stockbroker, forced Jones to bring his wife to a news conference and apologize, a moment skin-crawling in its grotesquerie and racial overtones. Jones was released from the team not longer after, and he retired the next year.
He has long ago made his peace with the club.
He will in a few days journey to New York to take part in the 50th anniversary celebration of that long ago championship.
"I have already lived a dream where I had to keep pinching myself and asking if this is real," he said. "I have a chance to rebuild Africatown, the most historic Black settlement in Alabama. We've had times of despair but life, it's good. We move in all lanes now."

Texto completo: BLOOMINGTON  Daniel Henry Teas II, 90, died peacefully June 28, 2019, at Martin Health Center, Bloomington.
He was born March 23, 1929, in Wisconsin Rapids, Wis., to Dwight and Dorothy Normington Teas. He married Patricia Maguire on June 4, 1955, in Sea Cliff, N.Y. She preceded him in death, as did his parents and sister, Sally Teas Sorenson.
Dan is survived by his children, David (Laura) Teas, Charleston, S.C.; Molly Teas, Washington, D.C.; Virginia (John) Gill, Bloomington; and Christopher (Jennifer) Teas, Charlotte, N.C.; and seven grandchildren, Matthew and William Gill; Sam and Sophie Boorstin; and CJ, Max and Madeleine Teas. Three nieces and a nephew also survive, Kären Sorenson, Jennifer Sorenson, Sarah Urycki and Robert Sorenson.
Dan was a 1951 graduate of Lawrence University, where he was a member of Phi Delta Theta and Mace. He served in the U.S. Air Force as a navigator-bombardier in Korea and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross in 1953. While in Korea, he also organized an English language school. Dan then joined his father as a partner in the insurance business he founded in 1922, The Teas Company. Dan became a leader in the life insurance industry, earning CLU and ChFC designations and a master's degree in financial services. He was a lifetime member of the Million Dollar Round Table and the author of numerous industry articles on life insurance and estate planning.
In Wisconsin Rapids, Dan served as president of the South Wood County Economic Development Corporation, which created the industrial park. In Colorado Springs, where he and Pat moved in 1981, Dan founded the Colorado Springs Telecommunication Study Group. He was a member of Downtown Rotary and the Broadmoor Golf Club.
Dan's love of the outdoors was nurtured during summers as a camper and counselor at Tesomas, Manito-wish and Cheley camps. He shared this love with his family on the lakes, streams and slopes of Wisconsin and Colorado. His intellectual curiosity led him to embrace new ideas and new technologies, and his clever wit brought smiles to people's faces. He believed in the transformative power of travel. Traveling with Pat was his favorite activity, and he encouraged everyone to explore the wider world. He loved airplanes, The New York Times, Paris and hot fudge sundaes.
The family wishes to thank Westminster Village, Dan's home since 2009, especially the staff at Martin Health Center, for providing skillful and loving care. In lieu of flowers, memorials may be made to the Teas Family Library Fund, Lawrence University, 711 E. Boldt Way, Appleton, WI 54911.
Services will be held Oct. 19 at Grace Episcopal Church, Colorado Springs, Colo.

Texto completo: You can count on Sir Richard Branson to market his new cruise ship, the Scarlet Lady, in an utterly unique fashion — and that's exactly what he has done. Springing the funds for a costly, full-page New York Times ad, he has used that extravagant space to appeal to residents of South Dakota, of all places, because, he claims, South Dakota is the only state in America that has not yet supplied a passenger for the first sailing of his Virgin Voyages, onboard the Scarlet Lady. He has claimed that people in South Dakota take fewer vacation trips than anyone else in America and will thus be missing the best experience of their lives.
So, what will the Scarlet Lady look like? How will it differ from other cruise ships? Those questions have not been answered by the Branson organization at this time, except in vague promises by Branson and his staff that it will be outstanding and entirely different, a fit vessel for ultra-modern, smart adults (children are banned from it).
Although the exact qualities of the Scarlet Lady are unspecified, some small facts about it can be gleaned from the line's website.
First, when will it begin sailing? The first of four eventual ships in the Virgin Voyages fleet will be completed this coming February, and it will undergo all sorts of ceremonies in England at that time. Later, the Scarlet Lady (designed to carry about 2,500 passengers) will embark on its first Caribbean passenger sailing in early April: A five-night voyage, round-trip from Miami to either the Dominican Republic or Costa Maya, Mexico, then to Bimini in the Bahamas. The stay in Bimini will be at a private beachside club.
To the extent possible, sailings will be all-inclusive in nature, with cruise fares covering several services for which most other cruise lines charge extra. There will be a ban on tipping, for instance. Wi-fi will be free, and group exercises in the several spas will also be free of charge.
The ship will have 20 dining rooms, eliminating the need to occupy a massive central one, as on some other ships. Theatrical entertainment? "Other lines present watered-down versions of Broadway musicals. We wouldn't dream of that," says a Branson spokesperson, without specifying what the Scarlet Lady's more sophisticated evening entertainment will resemble. Except for some other wordy descriptions of cabins furnished by noted designers, no other details are given.
The adult public considering a Virgin Voyages cruise will simply have to rely on Branson's reputation for ultra-sophisticated effects, like purple light in a Virgin airplane operated earlier by the dashing British entrepreneur. Only time will tell whether a similar approach will spell success for an ocean cruise ship.

Texto completo: Classical Music: A Monumental Exploration of Birdsong
July 13 and 14, caramoor.org
Back in the early 1970s, the young Pierre-Laurent Aimard studied with the great French pianist Yvonne Loriod, who was also the wife of Olivier Messiaen. Aimard soon became Messiaen's protégé too, following the couple on tours and absorbing the otherworldly music of the mystical modernist composer. As Aimard went on to become a reigning interpreter of the 20th-century avant-garde, he has remained a champion of Messiaen's music, with exactingly definitive renditions including a 2018 recording of Messiaen's grand, two-and-a-half-hour "Catalogue d'Oiseaux," inspired by the composer's lifelong immersion in birdsong. With its fistfuls of incandescent chords, strange earworms, and enigmatic rhythms, the "Catalogue" summons an ornithology like none other, which Aimard will tackle at the Caramoor music festival in Katonah, N.Y., over three performances this weekend. Ancillary events will explore the aesthetics of birdsong. WILLIAM ROBIN
Theater: Terror and Humor in Winter Miller's New Play
July 8-27, nooneisforgotten.com
Two women, held prisoner in a windowless cell made of concrete and dirt. Where they are and what they're charged with we don't know -- or maybe they're just captives, not accused of anything. In Winter Miller's new play "No One Is Forgotten," Lali and Beng are each other's only solace. Safeguarding their sanity, they banish thoughts of the people back home, who may be desperate to learn whether they're still alive.
Ms. Miller, a former journalist who was the opinion columnist Nicholas Kristof's assistant at The New York Times, is best known for her play "In Darfur." Like that drama, "No One Is Forgotten" has politics on its mind. Yet despite its grim circumstances, there's abundant humor, too -- laughter being one way that people, forced into a nightmare, do their tenacious best to survive. Directed by Ms. Miller, the world-premiere production starts performances on Monday, July 8, at Rattlestick Playwrights Theater in Greenwich Village. LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES
Art: The Hard-Edge Geometries of City Hall
Through Nov. 8; publicartfund.org
What makes Carmen Herrera's hard-edge geometric paintings so interesting is their bold asymmetries. Using planes of bright, not-quite-expected color, Ms. Herrera will creep almost to the edge of a canvas and then stop, leaving viewers with a sense of precarious -- but mystically eternal -- balance. Born in Havana in 1915, where she trained as an architect, Ms. Herrera started her art career in Paris after World War II and then moved to New York, where she's been living since 1954. Though it's taken half a century, the 104-year-old artist is finally enjoying her measure of fame. The five large painted aluminum sculptures of the Public Art Fund's "Carmen Herrera: Estructuras Monumentales" vividly translate her simple but sophisticated shapes into three dimensions. Opening Thursday, July 11, in City Hall Park, the installation will constitute her second solo institutional show in New York City. WILL HEINRICH
Pop: Belle & Sebastian at Brooklyn Steel
July 10; axs.com
Belle & Sebastian are no longer bent on trying to impress people -- or so Stuart Murdoch, the primary singer and songwriter of the seminal indie rock band, told Vulture last year. The Glaswegians responsible for some of the most tender and quietly intelligent records of the 1990s, including "Tigermilk" and "If You're Feeling Sinister," have become one of the genre's most dynamic groups, with a crew of songwriters and vocalists expanding the project that once was the exclusive province of their frontman. After releasing their ninth album a couple years back, they retreated to Glasgow and relaxed their recording strategy in an effort to liberate themselves from perceived expectations. The results of their footloose, largely self-produced sessions are on a series of three EPs, titled "How to Solve Our Human Problems." Expect to hear selections from that trilogy, as well as old favorites like "My Wandering Days Are Over," during their Wednesday appearance at Brooklyn Steel. OLIVIA HORN

Film: A Tortured Muse in 'Marianne & Leonard: Words of Love'
July 5
In 1960 Leonard Cohen traveled from Montreal to the Greek island of Hydra, where he met Marianne Ihlen, a Norwegian with a young son. Refugees from traditional society, they found each other. "I was his Greek muse, who sat at his feet," she recalled of their sun-drenched days, filled with writing and lovemaking.
In "Marianne & Leonard: Words of Love," opening on July 5, the filmmaker Nick Broomfield -- who, as a 20-year-old visiting the island, grew intoxicated by Ihlen and her romance with Cohen -- chronicles the couple's relationship during the height of unfettered bohemia.
Ihlen supported Cohen as he wrote his novel "Beautiful Losers." But unable to make a living, he turned to music -- though he initially refused to sing. Then Judy Collins brought him onstage in New York in 1967 and opened up a world of temptation, prompting Ihlen to tell Collins that she had ruined her life.
Ihlen, who inspired hits like "So Long, Marianne," died in July 2016, but not before Cohen had written her one last letter. "I'm just a little behind you, close enough to take your hand," he said. He died three months later. KATHRYN SHATTUCK
Dance: Choreography for the Screen
July 12-15; dancefilms.org
As the subject of the 2017 documentary "Bobbi Jene," the celebrated dancer Bobbi Jene Smith opened her life's most vulnerable moments to the camera. So she was no stranger to being filmed when she landed the lead in "Mari," an independent feature by the British director Georgia Parris.
She was, however, new to acting. In "Mari," which will have its United States premiere at Lincoln Center during the 47th Dance on Camera Festival, Smith stretches herself in new creative directions, playing a dancer torn between her family and career -- her first onscreen role in which she doesn't play herself.
The film closes out a bountiful Dance on Camera lineup, presented by Film at Lincoln Center and the Dance Films Association. Other highlights include "With Merce" -- a compilation of Merce Cunningham's collaborations with the video artist Charles Atlas -- and Susanna Barranco's documentary "From Knee to Heart," about the Spanish dancer and choreographer Sol Picó.

TV: Cunning and Comedy in 'The Heist at Hatton Garden'
July 9; britbox.com
Ocean's 11 they were not. But the men behind the 2015 burglary of Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd. in London's jewelry district -- considered the greatest heist in Britain's history, with loot totaling at least 14 million pounds -- were every bit as amusing. The bumbling of these aging, bickering thieves (who have an array of medical conditions) earned them nicknames like Bad Grandpas and Diamond Wheezers.
"The Heist at Hatton Garden" -- a four-part limited series debuting July 9 on BritBox -- follows the men as they shimmy down an elevator shaft, drill through a concrete wall then squeeze into the hole to plunder the vault. Timothy Spall ("Mr. Turner," "Harry Potter") headlines as Terry Perkins, a violent career criminal whose diabetes gets the best of him while he's stockpiling the gold bullion and glittering gems. Enter the Flying Squad -- a branch of the Metropolitan Police Service's Serious and Organized Crime Command -- whose mission it is to search for the pesky giveaway that these masterminds who seemingly thought of everything had carelessly overlooked.

(Hollywood) 'They Set Us Up to Fail'

Texto completo: For the first time in a long time, things seemed to be changing in Hollywood. Black filmmakers were making inroads where their white counterparts had long been parked, bringing with them an array of perspectives and experiences seldom recognized by mainstream American production companies. The bad old days -- of blackface and white saviors, of "colorblind" studio executives and all-white Oscar nominees -- grew, for a while, hazy and remote, suddenly incongruous with the diverse new landscape.
"Just about every studio in town has a project in development with a black director ... or wants to," read an article in this newspaper, headlined "In Hollywood, Black Is In."
It wasn't 2019, but 1990, more than two decades before #OscarsSoWhite and the industry's continuing reckoning over the representation of African-Americans in front of and behind the camera. Then as now, a string of hit movies by black directors -- Spike Lee's "Do the Right Thing," the Hudlin brothers' "House Party," John Singleton's "Boyz N the Hood" and Mario Van Peebles's "New Jack City" -- inspired optimism that Hollywood, despite overwhelmingly white executive leadership, had awakened to the moral and financial benefits of empowering minority artists.
Speaking for a 1991 story titled "They've Gotta Have Us" -- from a New York Times Magazine issue that featured the aforementioned black filmmakers on its cover -- the director Charles Lane was one of many who foresaw permanent change: "The Berlin Wall, having been pulled down, will not be re-erected."
But as the decade wore on, a wall was re-erected, black filmmakers now say, and many of the same people who had been held up as the faces of a changing industry watched as their careers ground slowly to a halt.
"I was told that I was in director's jail," said Matty Rich, whose emotionally incendiary 1991 debut film, "Straight Out of Brooklyn," won a special jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival that year. Major film studios hailed him as a prodigy. But he's made only one other film since -- in 1994.
Darnell Martin, whose vibrant 1994 romantic comedy "I Like It Like That" was the first studio-produced film to be directed by an African-American woman (it won the New York Film Critics Circle award for best first feature), said she was later blacklisted in the industry for speaking out against racism and misogyny.
"You think, 'It's O.K. -- you're like every other filmmaker,' but then you realize, 'No,"' she said. "It's like they set us up to fail -- all they wanted was to be able to pat themselves on the back like they did something."
The New York Times recently convened a discussion with six directors who were part of a wave of young black talent that surged 30 years ago this month -- beginning with the success of "Do the Right Thing" in July 1989 -- only to come crashing down, as Hollywood in the 1990s and 2000s reconstituted itself around films with white directors and white casts.
Along with Rich and Martin, taking part in the teleconference were Julie Dash, director of "Daughters of the Dust" (1991); Leslie Harris, director of "Just Another Girl on the I.R.T." (1993); Ernest Dickerson, director of "Juice" (1992); and Theodore Witcher, director of "Love Jones" (1997).
Many of the participants had never before talked to one another, reflecting a commonly reported feeling of isolation. But the experiences they shared -- of barely disguised prejudice, of being marginalized by executives who feigned interest in their work, of lacking a safety net that seemed to buoy their white peers -- fit into a kind of mosaic. It depicts a system that failed to sustain a generation of its minority talent, and stands as a challenge to those who would seek reform.
These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Sentenced to 'Director's Jail'
When did you first feel alienated in Hollywood?
LESLIE HARRIS ("Just Another Girl on the I.R.T.") Right after [my debut], I had a script about a female record executive. What I heard was that it was just hard to get a black actress in a movie, with me being a black woman director, producer and writer.
What would they say to you?
HARRIS Just that. "We can't get financing." This is from my agent.
JULIE DASH ("Daughters of the Dust") I was told that, too. Also, when I would indicate that I'm here as a director to make films about black women, executives would say to me, "Why are you limiting yourself?" [Her film, the story of three generations of Gullah women facing the Great Migration, made Dash the first African-American woman to direct a movie in wide release.] I was like, "I'm not. I want to see our stories on the screen that haven't been shown before. I'm bringing forth something new. Take a look at it."
DARNELL MARTIN ("I Like It Like That") As an African-American woman who speaks up and fights against things that are racist or misogynistic, I felt a very big backlash. If I had a penny for every time I was blacklisted and somebody told me, "You will never work again," I'd be super, super wealthy. [Though Martin has worked regularly in television, she has made only one theatrical film since her 1994 debut, "Cadillac Records" in 2008.]
The thing they kept saying to me was, "Aren't you grateful? How come you're not grateful?" I'm like, "Do you ask your white filmmakers that? I wrote this film, and there was a bidding war, and I gave it to you, and you keep telling me I need to be grateful?"
What other kinds of things did you hear?
HARRIS I went to an interview and someone said to me: "You don't look like a filmmaker. What are you doing here?"
MATTY RICH ("Straight Out of Brooklyn") Wow.
ERNEST DICKERSON ("Juice") What does a filmmaker look like?
DASH After "Daughters," I tried to get representation at the Gersh Agency in New York. They told me I didn't have a future. They saw no future for me as a black woman director. What were they going to do with me?
DICKERSON There used to be a time where you go after an agency, and they would always tell the story, "We already got our black filmmakers."
MARTIN And you had to do what they wanted you to do, too, because you were their black filmmaker. It was like, "This is the film, you've got to do it." It was like, "I'm not feeling it." but you had to do it.
When did you sense that the well was drying up?
RICH I was told that I was in director's jail. Director's jail is if your film doesn't make X amount of money, then it's going to be hard for you to get another movie financed. [Rich's 1994 follow-up, "The Inkwell," earned just under its reported budget of $ 8 million theatrically.]
DICKERSON I've been there.
RICH They told me the only way out of director's jail is that you have to write your way out of it. So I wrote a Tupac Shakur project for HBO, and I came onboard to write "Subway Scholar" at Showtime for Whitney Houston. But I got frustrated because I had a lot of things stuck in development. I met the C.E.O. of Ubisoft, a gaming company in Paris, and they needed some help on a game ["187: Ride or Die"] that they were about to release. I wound up living there for two years as the creative director and art director. That was kind of my new outlet for storytelling without Hollywood. It felt like everyone had wanted me to make another urban drama, instead of a family-oriented, lighthearted story like "The Inkwell."
DICKERSON I made a movie called "Bulletproof," with Damon Wayans and Adam Sandler. Working on that film was the only time I ever got mad enough to punch a hole in the editing room wall. It was supposed to be a raunchy, R-rated comedy slanted more for an adult audience. But I could see we had trouble when they were giving out tickets to 15- to 16-year-old kids at the first preview. Afterward, I had to really sanitize the relationships. It meant savaging the movie.
It still opened at No. 1, but I got the worst reviews of my career. I was criticized for not having everything I was told to take out. I had several projects lined up -- I had been developing "Blade," with Wesley Snipes. The whole idea of where "Blade" went was mine. But the producers looked to "Bulletproof" and thought I had completely lost my street cred. After that, nobody would touch me. I think I'm still in jail, in a way, because I'm doing television. [Dickerson -- like many of his peers, including Martin and Dash -- has found work on the small screen, with credits on "The Wire" and "The Walking Dead."] I consider myself a filmmaker who's working in television.
'If You're In, Eventually You'll Be Out'
There are filmmakers of all races and backgrounds who have a spark early on, or cause a sensation at Sundance, and then have difficulty following it up. If that phenomenon is especially common with black filmmakers, what do you think causes the disparity?
DASH Access and opportunity.
MARTIN I think also that if it's your second film, you tend to want to push more. My second film was "Prison Song." I wanted to make a film about how kids of color were marginalized and pushed directly into the prison system. And I wanted it to be a hip-hop opera. That was really kind of wild at that period. But you think, "It's O.K. -- you're like every other filmmaker."' But then you realize, no. If you stretch and have the art film, they're not going to catch you and support that.
After " Boyz N the Hood ," which was released the same year as "Jungle Fever" and "New Jack City," people were talking about this black wave, or this "class of '91." But it was almost talked about as a fad, or as if "black" was a hot genre that the studios could cash in on.
MARTIN One hundred percent. With my first film, there was a bidding war with people who hadn't even read the script -- studios -- just because they heard I was the female Spike Lee. [Martin began her career as a camera operator on Lee's "Do the Right Thing," working under Dickerson.] But they weren't looking at the work. They didn't believe that we had anything of merit for ourselves. It's just that we were the flavor, that's it.
DICKERSON That's the thing we've got to make sure of, that we're not going to be the flavor.
DASH We're the main ingredient.
MARTIN I love that. You've got to write a book. "The Main Ingredient."
DASH If you're in, eventually you'll be out, and someone else will be in. It shouldn't be binary like that. We are, we exist.
Ted, "Love Jones" came along a little bit later, in 1997. Shortly afterward, black romantic comedies -- "The Best Man," "Brown Sugar" -- became kind of a subcategory. Did you feel the shift coming?
WITCHER I was optimistic, because we had done well at Sundance, and I had tried to make the film accessible to as much of a mass audience as it was going to be. But we never quite cracked the marketing of it, and it didn't really perform at the box office, even though the soundtrack was a hit.
Then I made maybe a mistake, because instead of retrenching and trying to do something similar, I tried to push further. I walk into a room -- I don't feel any sort of inferiority whatsoever. But they look at the numbers and go, "Who is this guy with this attitude with these numbers? Your movie made $ 12 million. Why are you even in my office today?"
When you say "attitude," what do you mean?
WITCHER I conducted myself like a Hollywood movie director, which is what I was at that point. But I didn't understand that it wasn't necessarily about the creative achievement of the film, or even whether you win any trophies for it. It's about numbers.
MARTIN But how many white directors have those numbers and get more and more movies thrown at them? I mean, that happens all the time. We don't get that.
WITCHER White people get more bites of the apple. That's just true. You can fail three, four times and still have a career. But if you're black, you really can only fail once.
'This Feels Different'
If you look at some young black directors today, Barry Jenkins or Terence Nance , for example, some had careers that started out similarly to those of a lot of people on this call. But eventually, "Moonlight" happened for Jenkins, and Nance is directing the "Space Jam" sequel. What's different now for the black directors who are breaking through?
DASH Social media is a game changer. People can know what you're doing in real time, without hiring a publicist. Back then, we couldn't afford a publicist -- we had a family. [Dash and the visual artist Arthur Jafa, who was the cinematographer on "Daughters of the Dust," have a daughter, N'Zinga Dash.]
WITCHER The internet and massive streaming companies. I'm not really optimistic about the movie business in general, but, as black filmmakers, I'm much more optimistic about the disruption that's been brought to the industry by these massive technology companies.
HARRIS I think it's also a cultural shift. The culture is changing. The racist statues are coming down. Black Lives Matter. Even #MeToo has changed things a bit. ["Just Another Girl" was distributed by Miramax, co-founded by Harvey Weinstein.] We don't know if that's going to last, but I think that's influenced Hollywood. It's going to be forced to change by the culture, by young people. Now social media can amplify some of the injustices that are going on.
Will what happened in the '90s -- a boom followed by a bust -- happen again?
DICKERSON This feels a little different to me. Feels bigger.
DASH It's different.
Why?
WITCHER It feels a little more permanent to me. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'll look back on this and eat my words. But it might stick.
DICKERSON We've had some black films that have made quite a lot of money. And there was even a breakthrough at Cannes this year.
RICH I would also add that there are a lot of African-Americans who are in power positions right now, even on the financing level. That didn't really exist in the '90s. People like Byron Allen -- an African-American who is the head of a film distributor and a financier.
DASH I also think what's different is that filmmakers like Barry Jenkins, Terence Nance and Ava DuVernay -- they're not only wildly creative, they're courageous. They are not afraid to cross boundaries to say what they want to say. That's important.
HARRIS I mean look at Ava, the amount of women of color she's hiring. That is very important and that's game changing.
How could things improve?
HARRIS More producers and executives of color. Look at the statistics -- we need more.

Texto completo: Usually I go car-free on vacation. This time, I went car-free to vacation.
My wish was to go to San Diego for a long weekend to see my team, the St. Louis Cardinals, play the Padres. And rather than drive to San Diego, I decided to take the train.
The last time I went to San Diego, in 2015, I drove to Encinitas, parked long-term and took the Coaster train to San Diego for the experience, but also to save on hotel parking. Coaster is Metrolink under a different name.
That was a pleasant 50-minute ride. But it made me want to do something more ambitious.
This time I decided to take Amtrak from L.A. Union Station. And to get to Union Station, I took Metrolink.
In other words, I took the train to the train.
This involved a small amount of planning, as I had to find good Amtrak times with a Metrolink train in proximity. Then I booked a modestly priced Gaslamp Quarter hotel — one that wasn’t quite so modest after nearly 20% in taxes — near a trolley stop.
That Friday morning, I drove a few blocks to the Metrolink station in Claremont. But that was the extent of my driving.
As longtime readers know, I’m a fan of public transit and of Metrolink. I enjoy the mild challenge of working out the connections while doing my bit for the environment. Taking transit makes me feel more urban. Plus, riding provides time to read, always a plus.
I got to Union Station more than an hour before my Amtrak train would leave, but that seemed right as I didn’t know about check-in procedures.
With the Pacific Surfliner, it turns out, all you do is board, the same as Metrolink. So I relaxed in a leather chair in the Union Station waiting room until about 20 minutes before departure.
The train was filling up when I did board, and I had lost the chance for a window seat on the second deck. Rookie mistake. Still, the rows are only two seats, so I had a good view regardless.
And the comfort! Compared to airlines, the coach seats are about five inches wider and have about eight inches more legroom.
Which brings up another point: You board without going through a luggage scanner, emptying your pockets, removing your belt and shoes, or submitting to a patdown or nude photo via the body scanner.
You can leave your tray table down the whole trip and use the restroom whenever you like. Now this is a civilized way to travel.
At the first stop, in Fullerton, the passenger at the window seat next to me disembarked. What a break. I scooted over and had a westside window seat the rest of the trip.
After the industrial and business zones came a few patches of agriculture, with pickers working the fields, and the rustic charm of San Juan Capistrano’s Los Rios Street.
South of there, at Capistrano Beach, the surf was perhaps 100 feet away. People could be seen on that shallow stretch of sand walking or sunbathing with books.
After the San Clemente Pier, the train was farther inland, paralleling the 5 Freeway, until the ocean became visible and near again at Solano Beach down a small bluff.
Three hours after leaving Union Station, the Surfliner arrived at the last stop, San Diego’s Santa Fe Depot.
Built in 1915 in the Spanish Colonial Revival style, the depot has twin domes, lots of arches and a waiting room with wooden benches and a soaring ceiling. It’s not too different from Santa Fe’s 1918 depot in San Bernardino.
From the depot, a $5 daily transit pass got me around, as did hoofing it. I saw the Cardinals-Padres game that first night with a San Diego pal. The Cards lost 3-1.
I’m thankful I skipped the next night, when they lost 12-2. A simple loss can be borne stoically, but a humiliation is too much.
Saturday, my friend picked me up to go bowling. He dropped me off, at my request, at Liberty Public Market, a food hall at Point Loma. I cobbled together lunch from multiple vendors and then wondered how I might find my way back to San Diego proper.
But Google Maps did the trick: A short walk took me to a bus stop, and I made that and two further connections seamlessly, arriving in the Hillcrest neighborhood in 40 minutes.
From there it was one block to my destination, Bluestocking Books, a very good used bookstore. I picked up a collection of Red Smith sports columns, unable to resist the blurb on the back from the New York Times: “Red Smith was to sports what Homer was to war.”
Two blocks away was Record City, an equally good record store, from which I bought a Firesign Theatre boxed set.
Three blocks back and I was soon on a bus that dropped me near my hotel.
Incidentally, I had considered my $71 Amtrak round-trip something of a splurge, especially when Metrolink tickets brought the total to $89. But in San Diego, hotels like mine were charging $45 a night for parking. I was there two nights.
Did I come out a buck ahead?
The next morning, I returned to the Santa Fe Depot and took a seat on one of the worn benches. As I did when I boarded in Los Angeles, I kind of wished I’d dressed in a suit, tie and fedora, and maybe had my shoes polished at a shoeshine stand, all for the vintage effect.
An Amish family was among the waiting passengers. The two men wore beards, hats and slacks, the older man in a vest, and the women were in dresses and bonnets. Now that’s a vintage effect.
Learning from my rookie mistake, I stood in line on the shaded platform to get a window seat. That worked out pretty well.
Except a college-age kid soon took the seat in front of me, and reclined it as far as it would go. By this point, all the other window seats were taken.
Even with his lean, I had plenty of room. I read from “Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance” while enjoying free wi-fi, free electricity for my phone and the same scenes as before, only in reverse.
At Union Station, with an hour and 15 minutes before my Metrolink train home, I rolled my baggage down Alameda Street for lunch at Philippe, founded in 1908. It was an old-time way to end an old-time trip.

Clippers' deal with Kawhi Leonard, acquisition of Paul George sends shock waves through NBA

Texto completo: It was true during the NBA playoffs and again in a stunning free-agent twist that played out early Saturday morning: Kawhi Leonard does things his own way — and at his own pace.
After a week of deliberations that generated much curiosity but also impatience around the league, Leonard decided to leave the Toronto Raptors, not even a month after leading them to the championship, and to commit the next four years of his career to the Los Angeles Clippers.
Leonard did so only after the Clippers managed to swing an equally stunning trade to acquire Paul George from the Oklahoma City Thunder, ensuring that Leonard would be joined by another elite player on his new team.
Leonard was pursued aggressively by the Clippers, the Los Angeles Lakers and the Raptors. Toronto could offer a five-year deal worth $190 million, while the Lakers pitched the opportunity to form the league’s starriest trio alongside LeBron James and Anthony Davis.
By persuading Leonard to accept their four-year, $142 million offer, Clippers officials upstaged their competition after being dismissed by many league observers over the past week. Outdueling the more celebrated Lakers, in particular, gave the Clippers bonus satisfaction reminiscent of the Brooklyn Nets’ recent coup in beating out the Knicks to reach agreements with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving.
This caps a particularly tumultuous free-agency period with upward of 50 players shifting in deals amounting to more than $3 billion.
When the Fourth of July holiday passed without a decision from Leonard, after pitch meetings from his three primary suitors, numerous league observers openly wondered what was taking so long. It turns out that Leonard was using the extra time to recruit George to join him with the Clippers, who have labored in the Lakers’ shadow in Los Angeles for nearly four decades.
Leonard successfully persuaded George to request a trade away from mercurial point guard Russell Westbrook and the Thunder, according to two people close to the negotiations who were not authorized to discuss them publicly. The Clippers then presented Oklahoma City with a substantial trade offer that the Thunder could not refuse, especially when the alternative was keeping Westbrook and George with little financial flexibility to improve the team around them — and with George recovering from surgeries on both of his shoulders.
The trade, which was formally completed after the league’s moratorium on free-agency contracts ended Saturday, calls for the Clippers to send Oklahoma City three unprotected first-round picks (in 2022, 2024 and 2026) and two first-round draft choices that will be conveyed to the Thunder by the Miami Heat (unprotected in 2021 and protected from 1 to 14 in 2023), according to one person with knowledge of the trade terms. The Thunder also will have the right to swap first-round picks with the Clippers in 2023 and 2025, according to the person.
Oklahoma City will likewise acquire Shai Gilgeous- Alexander, a promising guard, and Danilo Gallinari, a veteran forward, in the trade, according to the person. It’s more than any team has ever surrendered for a superstar player, but the Clippers clearly felt that they had to part with all of those draft assets, as well as two quality players, to ensure that Leonard chose them ahead of the Lakers and the Raptors.
As the New York Times first reported, Leonard made it clear to the Clippers that he would not sign with them unless he would be joined by a proven All-Star sidekick. The cost was high, but the Clippers found a way to unite them, both Southern California natives. Leonard is from the Riverside area east of Los Angeles, and played at San Diego State; George grew up in Palmdale, north of Los Angeles, in the Antelope Valley.
Leonard’s choice was a stinging outcome for at least three other franchises, starting with the Raptors. Never before has an NBA Finals MVP chosen to immediately leave the newly crowned champions.
But Toronto knew there was no guarantee Leonard would stay when they acquired him last season, trading All-Star guard DeMar DeRozan and a former top-10 draft pick, Jakob Poeltl, to the San Antonio Spurs. It proved to be a magical deal, with Leonard, 28, cementing his status as the league’s foremost two-way force.
After eliminating the Philadelphia 76ers in the second round of the playoffs with an unforgettable Game 7 buzzer-beater, Leonard won Finals MVP honors with his second team after leading the Raptors to a six-game triumph over the two-time reigning champion Golden State Warriors. Only James and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar have won Finals MVP for at least two different teams.
A 6-foot-7 forward, Leonard averaged 26.6 points and 7.3 rebounds in 60 regular-season games in Toronto while shooting 49.6% from the field.
He was even more dominant in the playoffs, averaging 30.5 points and 9.1 rebounds for Toronto, the league’s first champions based outside the United States. The Raptors attracted a crowd of millions at their championship parade, but the over-the-top adoration Leonard received from an entire country was not enough to sway him to stay in Canada.
The Thunder were reluctant participants in the Clippers’ maneuvering, according to one person familiar with the team’s thinking who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. George averaged 28.0 points and 8.2 rebounds in 77 games last season despite injuries.
Oklahoma City ultimately decided that passing up the Clippers’ offer was impossible — but the near-instant reaction to the trade from rival teams was that a presumably disappointed Westbrook could now try to force his way to a team closer to title contention.
Yet it was the Lakers, above all, who met with their worst fears.
The league’s glamour franchise paid a heavy premium to get the New Orleans Pelicans to trade Davis last month and strongly believed in recent days that, through the recruiting efforts of James, Davis and Magic Johnson, it had overcome months of organizational dysfunction to move to the top of Leonard’s list.
Once Leonard opted for the unfashionable Clippers, as Durant and Irving had done with the Nets, Lakers officials quickly agreed to terms with veteran swingman Danny Green, who was one of Leonard’s most trusted teammates in San Antonio and Toronto.
Next season, then, Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles will house dueling superstar tandems instead of the solitary superteam many expected. It should be a matchup of Wimbledon-worthy doubles: James and Davis against Leonard and George.

Activists Hail City's Climate Crisis Declaration

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
New York City, the world capital of ambition, has never been shy about grandiose declarations. The City Council has passed or proposed resolutions demanding world peace, banning a racist slur and condemning all manner of federal policies where city government has no actual say.
But for a growing global network of activists seeking to change the way the world talks about climate, the city's sweeping resolution in late June declaring a "climate emergency" is a major victory.
Saying that the heating climate is a crisis of imminent danger, they argue that getting people and governments to describe it in far more urgent language is the only way to produce the level of global mobilization required to stop it.
New York is now the largest city on earth to pass such a measure, calling last week for "an immediate emergency mobilization to restore a safe climate." It joined London, Sydney and a total of 722 localities in 15 countries, according to the Climate Mobilization, a Brooklyn-based nonprofit group pushing the declarations.
And on Wednesday, Los Angeles's City Council went further. It passed a measure that will formalize its own emergency declaration, calling climate change one of the most important issues facing the city. It also established a Climate Emergency Mobilization Department and laid out steps to make city agencies and the public take newly vigorous and coordinated action against planet-warming emissions.
Margaret Klein Salamon, a founder of the Climate Mobilization, an environmental advocacy group, said emergency declarations build political pressure to take stronger actions, like New York's recent sweeping state and city laws to curb emissions.
"Because what are elected leaders supposed to do if not protect us from emergencies?" she said.
Do these words even mean anything?
By themselves, emergency declarations have no more force than other political proclamations. And just as no individual country can stop climate change within its borders, cities and states' toolboxes are limited without the support of federal law and international agreements.
That hasn't stopped states and smaller jurisdictions. New York City recently mandated that the owners of its largest buildings slash their emissions impact, and new legislation requires New York State to eliminate nearly all greenhouse gas output by 2050.
But questions remain about whether even these measures -- with far more teeth than a council declaration -- will achieve their goals.
Government agencies need to "start making things happen -- and fast," including acting against the interests of real estate, energy and other lobbies that traditionally wield political clout, said Pete Sikora, climate justice director for New York Communities for Change. His group supported the state and city laws but contends they do not go far enough.
Declarations have increased as public alarm has grown
The first local climate emergency was declared in Darebin, Australia, in 2016. The following year, Hoboken, N.J., became the first American city to follow suit. Groups like the Sunrise Movement and Extinction Rebellion, which calls for nonviolent civil disobedience to spur climate action, have made the declarations a centerpiece of their campaigns.
The movement has grown with extreme climate events that have been impossible to ignore: wildfires, storms and droughts, plus heat waves that set record temperatures in Europe last week and made June the world's hottest month on record.
Last fall, the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projected that keeping global warming at the minimum level to avert catastrophe would, as New York's resolution put it, "require an unprecedented transformation of every sector of the global economy over the next 12 years."
Six in ten Americans are either "alarmed" or "concerned" about global warming, according to a recent study by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, and the share of those choosing "alarmed" more than doubled from 2013 to 2018.
Young advocates drive the push to use words like 'crisis'
"Climate change sounds gradual," said Olivia Sommers, 19, one of dozens of climate activists in an overflow crowd at a City Council hearing on the measure, part of the public pressure that swayed the body to approve the resolution sooner than planned. "But to me it doesn't feel like 'change'. It feels like a crisis."
Jilly Edgar, 20, a New York University student and member of the Sunrise Movement, which advocates for Green New Deal policies, said she struggled to think of the future. That should be a time, she said, when "the world is becoming my own, and moving forward in it" toward "marriage, graduate degrees, children."
"But actually," she said, "the world is dying. There's just, like, a cutoff point. That does a lot to destroy the idealism of young people that usually pushes them to act."
The 'fear of fear' is an obstacle to action, activists say
"The idea that 'you can't scare people, fear paralyzes people,' has been a guiding principle of the gradualist climate movement for decades, and it's horribly wrong and misguided," said Ms. Klein Salamon, 33, who trained as a clinical psychologist.
"The basic tenet of therapy is that facing hard truths is how you create transformative change," she said. "You cannot skip the step of facing reality. It's only when we have a national consensus that we are all personally in danger, when we feel enough fear, that we are willing to make drastic changes. Fear is literally how we translate perception of danger into action."
The mobilization to fight World War II, she said, is the closest parallel in recent history to the scale and urgency of effort needed, she said: "Pull every lever, have all hands on deck, spend without limit to save as much life as possible."
The young activists at City Hall said they had all been through a phase of "climate despair," but that what gave them hope was, as Ms. Edgar put it, "deciding to push for change, and urge people with power to make that same decision."
News media, too, are being pushed to use urgent language
Ms. Sommers, a Middlebury College student, was one of 70 people arrested outside The New York Times last month in a protest calling for the newspaper to use the phrases "climate emergency" or "climate crisis" rather than "climate change."
The Guardian recently announced that it would adopt those terms. A Times spokeswoman said the paper devotes more resources to covering climate than any national publication.
"We should call it an emergency because that's what it is," Ms. Sommers said. "Tell the truth."

Texto completo: Since Jeannette Rankin became the first woman elected to Congress in 1916, the numbers game for women in elected office has been marked by largely glacial progress. But a new report lays out the extent to which women and people of color have gained ground in elections around the country over the last two years.
The report, prepared by the Reflective Democracy Campaign, which studies demographics in American politics, examined data from nearly 45,000 elected officeholders nationwide, and the findings were telling. (The RDC is a project of the Women Donors Network, which organizes liberal women donors.)
The research found that in large part, women and people of color in 2018 were as likely to win their elections as white men, once they were on the ballot.
"After a record-breaking election for women and people of color, the numbers are clear," said Brenda Choresi Carter, director of the Reflective Democracy Campaign. "White men's electability advantage is a myth. When reflective candidates are on the ballot, they win as often as white men."
White men still dominate the political arena disproportionately to their population, often by a lot. Republican women still struggle more than Democratic women in primaries. Black men are not gaining ground as fast as Black women.
On the flip side, there were numerous examples in 2018 of Democratic candidates of color, like Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Antonio Delgado of New York, who were elected to Congress by winning majority-white districts.
The RDC researchers aggregated data for candidates and elected officials over the past five years using information where a candidate or official had self-identified by race or gender, as well as email and phone surveys, voter file matching, and race and gender modeling.
Here are some of the major findings from the report.
No question, 2018 was a banner year for women
While the share of elected seats in local, state and federal office held by women barely increased between 2015 and 2017, those rates soared in 2018, the report found.
The increase was especially stark at the congressional level. The number of women in Congress - currently 127 - grew 21% between 2017 and 2019.
Many women were inspired to run in response to the election of President Donald Trump, and many women voted for them for the same reason. As a result, the greatest increase was in representation by Democratic women. Republican women actually lost ground in the 2018 midterms.
Women candidates benefited from getting in early, having dynamic fundraising, and in many cases taking advantage of digital campaigns and social media to engage new voters.
Women of color are slowly gaining ground
Although they make up 20% of the population, women of color still hold a meager 4% of all elected offices. But since 2015, the researchers found, women of color have increased their ranks by 41% in Congress and 38% in state legislatures.
The Democratic electorate is getting younger, more liberal and more diverse, and the Democratic candidates who are winning are reflecting both those demographic shifts and an increase in recruitment of such candidates. Indeed, for the first time since the group began tracking data in 2012, the majority of Democratic candidates in 2018 were not white men.
Among female Democrats who ran last year, 9% were women of color; among Republicans, a mere 1% were. Female Democrats, especially women of color, often find their easiest path to election is taking on a male incumbent from their own party in a primary, which political gatekeepers greatly discourage.
State legislatures are ground zero for women gaining seats
Before the 2018 election, only two states - Colorado and Vermont - had 40% or more female lawmakers. There are now three more states that can claim that distinction: Oregon, Washington and Nevada, which boasts the nation's only majority-female legislature.
In four states, the number of women legislators increased by 50% or more: Oklahoma, Wyoming, Michigan and Nebraska. Women make up almost 29% of state legislators overall, outpacing their ranks in Congress. White men's share of state legislative seats dropped by 6% from 2017 to 2019.
State legislatures are often a petri dish for prescriptive policy, as they can be for changes to demography.
White men still control cities and the vast majority of governors' mansions
Although white men are only 20% of the population of major cities, they make up over 60% of the mayors of those cities. In 2015, there were 44 male governors, and now there are 41, demonstrating that winning statewide is still a big challenge for women.
However, cities are proving to be a growth center for women and people of color: 51 of the United States' 200 most populous cities are led by mayors of color, with 13 African American women running the show, including in Chicago; Charlotte, North Carolina; San Francisco and Washington, D.C.
The bottom line: Women are still not well-represented
For all the crowing about women in Congress this year, they still make up less than one-quarter of that legislative body. Republican women are struggling the most; unlike Democrats, they often lose in primaries and are working to regroup on that front for 2020.
As the report notes, millions of Americans live in states where men hold over three-quarters of legislative seats, and the percentage of white men holding elected office is still double their share of the population.
It will be interesting to see if in 2020, among both Republicans and Democrats, more women decide to step up without being asked to run - historically, one of the impediments to women running is their own will to do so - and are able to raise money in primary fights against men.

Serena Williams advances at Wimbledon

Texto completo: WIMBLEDON, England - Finding her range and fending off a spirited challenge from yet another little-known opponent, Serena Williams came back to beat Slovenian qualifier Kaja Juvan, 2-6, 6-2, 6-4, in the late afternoon shadows at Wimbledon on Thursday.
On paper, Williams and Juvan are a universe apart. Williams, 37, holds seven Wimbledon singles titles and 23 Grand Slam singles championships overall. Juvan, an 18-year-old ranked 133rd, played her first match at a major tournament this summer, at the French Open, where she lost in the first round.
But aided by a raft of errors from her deeply seasoned opponent, Juvan won the first set with little trouble. Facing the possibility of what would have been an upset for the ages, Williams, the 11th seed, bounced back and began finding her range and aggression. She clinched the second set with a deep, curling forehand approach shot that drew an error. She then raced in front at the beginning of the third set and closed the match with a powerful service game.
Williams avoided the fate of the woman who defeated her in last year's Wimbledon final: fifth-seeded Angelique Kerber, who lost to American lucky loser Lauren Davis, 2-6, 6-2, 6-1.
After returning to the tour from maternity leave in March 2018, Williams has yet to return to her championship form. Stirring runs to the finals at last year's Wimbledon and U.S. Open ended in dispiriting defeats. This year she has played an abbreviated schedule while' battling ankle and knee injuries, and she was upset in the third round of the French Open. This week, in the opening round at the All England Club, she struggled to find consistency against qualifier Giulia Gatto-Monticone.
In third round, Williams will face 18th-seeded Julia Gorges, whom Williams defeated in the Wimbledon semifinals last year.
No. 1 Ashleigh Barty, No. 4 Kiki Bertens, No. 6 Petra Kvitova and No. 9 Sloane Stephens also advanced to third round.
In the men's draw, eight-time champion Roger Federer defeated British wild-card entry Jay Clarke, 6-1, 7-6 (3), 6-2.
John Isner, a semifinalist last year, was knocked out in the second round, losing a five-setter to Mikhail Kukushkin of Kazakhstan. Isner, seeded ninth, was playing his first tournament since suffering a foot injury at the Miami Open in April. - (The New York Times)

HORSE RACING DEATHS IN CALIFORNIA DEMAND TOUGH INDUSTRY REFORMS

Texto completo: The message to the horse racing industry in California must be clear: Implement tough safety standards at your tracks or risk the state closing them down altogether.
Gov. Gavin Newsom last week signed legislation giving the California Horse Racing Board greater authority to close tracks that aren't adequately protecting the health and safety of horses and jockeys. That's a good first step. But much more is needed.
This is a national sport and a national problem. The horse racing industry should step up to set and enforce tough safety standards across the country before Congress or states like California do it for them.
The alarmingly high number of equine deaths at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, Golden Gate Fields in Albany and other tracks around the country is unacceptable. The industry should require more transparency about horse injuries and deaths, and substantially increase penalties for owners and trainers who fail to put the safety of horses before profits.
The death toll since Dec. 30 at Santa Anita grew to 30 horses before its season ended on June 23. The Bay Area News Group's Cat Ferguson and Elliott Almond reported Sunday that 18 horses had died at Golden Gate Fields during its winter season. From July 2008 to June 2018, 330 horses died at Golden Gate Fields while racing or training.
The New York Times reported in April that, according to the Jockey Club's Equine Injury Database, an average of nearly 10 horses a week died at American racetracks in 2018. That's about 500 horses a year. It's an appalling number. The racehorse fatality rate in the United States is at least double that of racing tracks around the world.
The problem stems in part from the fact that there is no national organization that governs horse racing. Instead, each state has its own set of regulations, which leads to injury reporting abuses and inconsistent rules governing drugging of horses and when they should be stopped from racing because of injuries or overuse.
The industry should establish a national body with the clout to enforce tougher rules across the nation. It should begin by mandating reporting of all injuries into an electronic database and setting a strict set of horse-safety guidelines.
Following public outcry about deaths at Santa Anita, the owners of the track, TheStronach Group, tightened rules governing drugging of horses and banned several trainers from their facilities. That included Bay Area Hall of Fame trainer Jerry Hollendorfer, whose horse American Currency died during a training exercise June 22.
The ban stands as a significant blow to his legacy, but it's unclear the extent to which other California racetracks or tracks in other states will adhere to TheStronach Group approach. The New York Racing Association and the Los Alamitos track in Southern California have said that Hollendorfer would be allowed to train and run his horses at their facilities.
Owners and trainers need a clear set of national, standardized rules with stiff, consistent penalties for those who abuse them. If the folks who run horse racing can't demonstrate that they are making horse safety their highest priority, the likely alternative is growing support for the call to shut down the tracks.

The real reason why the left was against Donald Trump's July 4 speech

Texto completo: Now we know why the Democrats were so upset about President Trump speaking on the Fourth of July.
It was not because it was political or partisan. It was patriotic and that is what annoys the left the most.
Several days before the speech, we heard that Trump was hijacking Independence Day and turning it into a campaign rally. But Trump never mentioned the 2020 campaign in his speech.
We heard that Trump’s desire to have tanks on the National Mall was an out-and-out authoritarian performance art. But that wasn’t really the issue. Neither was the fake outrage over the cost.
There was no mention of political opponents and no mention of the fake news media. And this wasn’t Trump co-opting the nation’s birthday to celebrate himself. In fact, for a man who loves to talk about his accomplishments, he never mentioned himself.
No, Trump did something far more dangerous to the left. He gave America a strong dose of patriotism. He gave Americans a history lesson on the great people, heroes and their great accomplishments over the last 243 years.
Earlier in the week, The New York Times ran a video arguing America isn't the greatest nation on Earth, "the U. S. is really just O. K. "
Without mentioning The Times or the video, Trump proceeded to tell us about America’s greatness for nearly an hour interrupted only by applause, flyovers and military songs. At one point, I thought “who is this guy and what have they done with President Trump?”
“Today, we come together as One Nation with this very special Salute To America,” said Trump. “We celebrate our history, our people and the heroes who proudly defend our flag — the brave men and women of the United States Military!”
More from Gary Varvel: Face facts, America, Donald Trump is a success. Let's count the ways.
Donald Trump is the president I didn’t want, but now I know we need
And boy, did he. Starting with the story of America’s war for independence, Trump quoted the words and deeds of Americans that have long been forgotten but need to be remembered.
Trump told the story of Gen. George Washington as he readied his troops to fight the British invasion. Trump said, “Washington’s message to his troops laid bare the stakes, He wrote, ‘The fate of unborn millions will now depend under God on the courage and conduct of this army, we have therefore to resolve to conquer or die. ’”
We are the millions who benefited from their sacrifice.
In reminding America of the great acts of past generation, Trump brought it to the present by honoring our first responders and all of the men and women of law enforcement. Trump also honored the Gold Star families who made the ultimate sacrifice.
Legends and icons
He introduced NASA legend Gene Kranz and told him, we’re going back to the moon and we’re going to plant our flag on Mars.
He also introduced and thanked civil rights icon, Clarence Henderson who was 18-years-old in 1960 when he took part in a sit-in at a Woolworth’s lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina.
“Almost six decades later, he sits tonight in a seat of honor,” Trump said. “Clarence thanks for making this a much better place for all Americans. ”
I found it very unifying but there were some triggers for the Left.
Trump said “This country the most exceptional nation in the history of the world and it’s at its strongest now. ” American exceptionalism annoys the left.
“We are one people, chasing one dream and one magnificent destiny,” Trump said. “We all share the same heroes, the same home and the same heart and we are all made by the same almighty God. ” Mentioning God annoys the left.
I think this should become a tradition for every president from now on. With all of the partisan political fights, it was nice to be reminded of American’s amazing heritage. It was inspiring and that’s what we need.
For one day, Trump put partisan politics aside and focused the eyes of America on our past, present and to our future.
Thanks, Mr. President.

Texto completo: Dear Democrats:
Well, this is certainly an exciting time for America, isn't it? There was so much to celebrate on the Fourth of July. "Stranger Things" is streaming all-new episodes, the U.S. women's soccer team is in the World Cup final, and Häagen-Dazs recently launched a new line of booze-flavored ice cream.
However, a few things could be better. Starting with the belligerent, impulsive and vulgar bully who's sitting in the Oval Office. And the Democratic plans to evict him come November 2020.
On the Democratic debate stage last week, a number of candidates, including many of the front-runners, came out of the gate promising to abolish private health insurance, pursue immigration policies that sounded, as New York Times columnist David Brooks put it, like "operationally open borders" and . . . maybe bring back busing for school desegregation?
I admire their zeal, but to me this sounds less like a winning campaign platform than an electoral suicide pact.
There are certainly reasonable policy arguments for a government-run health-care system and reasonable moral arguments for open borders. Both, however, are unpopular with voters. What I heard from that stage can't be easily resculpted into some moderate-friendly sound bite, and it is unlikely to be forgotten by anxious moderates. Yes, candidates customarily run toward the base in the primary, then tack back to the center for the general election. But the leading candidates have wandered so far out into left field that they'll need a high-speed, solar-powered monorail to make it back in time for 2020.
I'm not the first person to make these points; Brooks and his conservative Times colleague Bret Stephens have already made them more pungently, and at greater length. Both of them are begging Democrats to put up a candidate they can vote for, and it's safe to say that they speak for most of what remains of the #NeverTrump conservatives.
Their message was not well received by many Democrats, who engaged in what appeared to be an extended exercise in what the libertarian writer Julian Sanchez has dubbed "epistemic closure": the systematic banishment of any source of information outside your ideological bubble.
This reaction is understandable, to an extent. In our partisan era, it's hard to believe that anyone from the other team could have your best interests at heart. And how can the #Resistance take seriously anyone who has lived through the early years of the Trump administration without already being committed to support whomever the Democrats put up? If you #NeverTrump folks want us to listen, they seemed to be saying, then first you'll need to show us that you're serious by promising to stay on our side.
To which I reply, "We have a deal." Oh, I can imagine circumstances under which I could not support the Democratic candidate - say, if Bernie Sanders started promising a robust program of nationalizing private industry. Short of that, as long as the alternative is Donald Trump, I will be rooting for any Democrat to win, including Sanders.
In return, I implore Democrats to listen to Brooks and Stephens. They may not be "the average American," but on health care and immigration, they are where the bulk of the voters are, and the current crop of Democratic candidates is not.
It may seem to you, dearest Democrats, that Trump is so awful, his poll numbers so abysmal, that all it will take to beat him is a candidate who can breathe and read from a teleprompter. If you'll recall, it also seemed that way in 2016.
So while I can understand why many believe this is the perfect moment to forget about moderate voters and really go for the progressive gusto, please reconsider. I'm not saying you have to do this to get my support, because you've already got it. You had me at "Not Donald Trump."
Now, let's talk about the tens of millions of other voters we're going to need to win.
For all the talk about Trump's extremism, he picked up voters in swing states by bringing the party back toward the center on economic policy. Believe it or not, that's still where American national elections are won. Trump has, of course, failed to deliver on much in the way of centrist policy, giving us another Republican tax cut instead. Good news! That leaves open the most fertile ground in American politics.
If you think that Trump is a grave danger to our country - and I do - then it's imperative that we figure out how to recapture that territory, and the voters who live there, rather than posing for each other on the moral high ground.
Yours in solidarity,
Megan

Texto completo: New York Times best-selling novelist Michael Koryta wasn't sure New Mexico could pass for Montana -- until he visited the state in June, when a film crew was shooting Those Who Wish Me Dead, a movie based on one of his books.
The production -- directed and adapted by actor and screenwriter Taylor Sheridan and shot in and around Bernalillo, Torrance, Sandoval and Rio Arriba counties, as well as Santa Clara Pueblo -- recently finished filming in New Mexico, though the action is set in Montana. The movie stars Angelina Jolie, Nicholas Hoult, Jon Bernthal, Tyler Perry and Aidan Gillen.
The New Mexico Film Office said 675 New Mexico residents worked on the production during a six-week shoot in the state.
Koryta, who lives in Maine, was present for some scenes filmed in the Sandia Mountains.
Yes, he was enchanted.
"My first thought is that you couldn't find an area that would be able to duplicate Montana," he said by phone. "But to actually get out there and see the elevation, see how rugged it is, see those burnt-out areas where previous fires had occurred, made me think New Mexico did a much more convincing job standing in for Montana than I could have initially guessed."
Koryta's 2014 book follows a teen boy who is placed in a witness protection-type program within a wildlife survival camp in Montana to keep him safe from a pair of killers who know he saw a murder. Soon, the boy and the adults caring for him find themselves using their survival skills to outpace the killers in a mountainous forest where the potential for fire is high.
Koryta said he worked on a film adaptation of the book, as did screenwriter Charles Leavitt, before Sheridan -- known for his contemporary neo-Western films Hell or High Water and Wind River, in which the challenging environment plays a role -- took over the project.
"If I could have handpicked a writer and director to tell this story, it would have been Taylor Sheridan," Koryta said. "He gets the idea of wilderness and character, and that is the essence of the story to me."
Koryta said he came up with the idea for Those Who Wish Me Dead while taking part in a wilderness survival training program in Montana. He was inspired to consider writing a novel set in New Mexico after visiting some of the forested mountains in the state.
"I have a few ideas I'm kicking around for another book so I can come back," he said.
New Mexico's film industry appears to be enjoying a boom.
Last month, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller announced a new NBCUniversal television and film venture that could inject $1 billion into the state's economy. And according to a report in the Albuquerque Journal, political controversy over restrictive abortion laws in Georgia and Louisiana was prompting producers working in those states to consider New Mexico as an alternative location for filming.
New Mexico's financial incentives for movie companies shooting in the state have grown since former Gov. Gary Johnson, then a Republican, signed a movie incentive program into law in the 1990s. Lujan Grisham signed legislation earlier this year that raises the cap on what can be paid out to film and television productions to $110 million from $50 million in a year, effective this week.
The bill included an additional 5 percent tax credit for companies that shoot in rural areas and money to pay off $250 million of a roughly $380 million backlog in rebates the state still owed to production companies.
Currently, eligible film productions can get a 25 percent rebate on certain expenses in the state, while television series that anchor in New Mexico for longer-term projects can get a refund on up to 30 percent of expenses. Advocates for the film industry say it pays off for the state financially -- with the industry bringing about $464 million to New Mexico in fiscal year 2017.
Critics, however, say the incentives amount to a giveaway that brings little, if any, profit to the state.
Paul Gessing, president of the nonprofit Rio Grande Foundation, wrote in a recent opinion piece published in The New Mexican, "Both economically and morally, it is one thing to exempt a business from taxes that would otherwise be paid (think Industrial Revenue Bonds and their long-term property tax exemptions), it is another thing entirely for government to cut checks (using our tax dollars) to fund the ongoing operations of chosen businesses."
Such criticisms are unlikely to stop Hollywood from coming to New Mexico.
New Mexico Film Office Director Todd Christensen said Tuesday, "If all goes well, we will have productions that run into the autumn, into the winter, into the spring and into next summer."
Besides the financial benefits to the state, Christensen said, the film industry boosts tourism and showcases New Mexico "on screens all over the world or through streaming services. It's all a plus."
Koryta said his visit to the set made him feel "everyone was a pro." More importantly, it made him want to return to New Mexico as a visitor.
"I want to come back in the very near future to do some backpacking and fishing," he said. "That is a beautiful part of the world."

The fever of resistance to Trump becomes threatening

Texto completo: The toxicity of the resistance to President Donald Trump has risen in recent days.
A justification for denying public accommodation came from The Washington Post in an op-ed by Stephanie Wilkinson, the owner of a farm-to-table restaurant in Lexington, Virginia. Wilkinson became famous last year when she refused to serve White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders and told Sanders and her family to leave the restaurant.
Wilkinson later told the press she ejected Sanders because the Trump administration is "inhumane and unethical" and because the Red Hen "has certain standards that I feel it has to uphold, such as honesty, and compassion and cooperation."
In her column, Wilkinson discussed the case of The Aviary, a trendy bar in Chicago where a waitress recently spat on Eric Trump, the president’s son. Wilkinson wrote that the incident, along with her own decision to oust Sanders, shows that in the age of Trump, "new rules apply" in public accommodations: Americans who work for the administration or support the president should stay away.
"If you’re directly complicit in spreading hate or perpetuating suffering, maybe you should consider dining at home," Wilkinson wrote.
Wilkinson noted that "no one in the industry condones the physical assault of a patron," but at the same time declared that Americans should understand that a "frustrated person" -- for example, a restaurant employee -- will "lash out at the representatives of an administration that has made its name trashing norms and breaking backs." Americans should accept that such things will happen.
An apology for doxxing came from The New York Times in a piece by Kate Cronin-Furman, an assistant professor of human rights at University College London. The article focused on the treatment of illegal immigrant children in detention centers near the U.S.-Mexico border.
Cronin-Furman discussed the detentions, as well as actions by employees of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, in terms of the Holocaust and genocides in Cambodia and Rwanda, contexts which most Americans would likely dismiss as preposterous.
Her idea is that opponents of the administration should publicly identify and shame low- and mid-level Customs and Border Protection employees who care for migrant children.
Such workers would be dismayed at being publicly shamed because they are "sensitive to social pressure," Cronin-Furman wrote, "which has been shown to have played a huge role in atrocity commission and resistance in the Holocaust, Rwanda and elsewhere. The campaign to stop the abuses at the border should exploit this sensitivity."
"This is not an argument for doxxing," Cronin-Furman continued. "It’s about exposure of their participation in atrocities to audiences whose opinion they care about. The knowledge, for instance, that when you go to church on Sunday, your entire congregation will have seen you on TV ripping a child out of her father’s arms is a serious social cost to bear."
Needless to say, that was a clear argument for doxxing.
Finally, there was Antifa’s recent attack on Andy Ngo, a freelance journalist often associated with the pro-free thought cultural publication Quillette. At a demonstration in Portland, Oregon, Antifa fighters beat up and milkshaked Ngo, apparently because he was there and he was not on their side.
The president is not always at the center of such demonstrations, but Antifa has become an angry and violent fringe force in the Resistance. It has played an ugly role in a number of events, most notably Charlottesville.
Shunning, shaming, doxxing, attacking. As the 2020 campaign reaches full speed, would it surprise anyone to see all of it increase? And all from people who congratulate themselves for standing against hate. Perhaps our politics will cool down at some point in the future. But not now.

“No tengas miedo”, el clamor de nuevos ciudadanos a inmigrantes

Texto completo: NUEVA YORK – Arellano, Boena, Jawad, Kim, Kupriynenko, Lu, Mallol, Meléndez, Sosa, Stan, Tucker, Varela y Velázquez muestran la diversidad en los Estados Unidos. Los apellidos son parte de los 52 inmigrantes que se convirtieron en nuevos ciudadanos de los Estados Unidos en el Museo del 9/11. “No tengas miedo” , fue la frase en la que coincidieron algunos de ellos cuando fueron entrevistados, un mensaje que envían a los inmigrantes en Estados Unidos.
“Apoyaré y defenderé la Constitución y leyes de los Estados Unidos de América contra todos los enemigos, extranjeros y locales” , juraron al unísono jóvenes, adultos en plenitud y adultos mayores, guiados por Ken Cuccinelli , el director interino de Servicios de Ciudadanía e Inmigración ( USCIS ), nombrado por el presidente Donald Trump y conocido por sus duras posturas migratorias, pero que durante la ceremonia realizada el martes pasado destacó el valor de los extranjeros que asumieron a este país como su nuevo hogar.
El evento tuvo varios significados, primero porque los participantes fueron oficialmente ciudadanos naturalizados, además de formar parte de las celebraciones por el 4 de Julio que realiza esta dependencia del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS), pero quizá el más emotivo fue honrar la memoria de aquellos inmigrantes que murieron víctimas de los ataques a las Torres Gemelas en 2001, ya sea porque trabajaron en alguno de los edificios del World Trade Center o porque ayudaron después del atentado y su esfuerzo derivó en consecuencias fatales.
“El 9/11 no solo es un evento que ha quedado en el pasado, sus efectos continúan hasta nuestros días… murieron alrededor de 3,000 personas, gente originaria de 90 naciones” , narró Alice M. Greenwald , directora del Museo del 9/11, quien no pudo contener sus lágrimas cuando habló de los inmigrantes que murieron en el mayor ataque terrorista que ha vivido el país y destacó el caso de aquellos a quienes USCIS ayudó a identificar, incluido el dominicano Gregorio Manuel Chávez , quien se naturalizó en 1999 y tras un reportaje de The New York Times, el Gobierno colaboró para ubicar a sus familiares, quienes aportaron una imagen que se exhibe en el museo. Hubo otros cuatro casos similares. En la ceremonia de este martes, la hija de Gregorio tomó juramento como ciudadana en la misma zona donde murió su padre.
Hay historias familiares que pueden resultar complejas, difíciles de creer y, sobre todo, demostrar a las autoridades migratorias que son legítimas, ya que están atentas a casos donde cualquier indicio pudiera tratarse de un fraude: un matrimonio falso o familiares que no lo son.
Así lo vivió Adrián Varela , un mexicano que lleva seis años viviendo en los Estados Unidos, a donde llegó con la Residencia Permanente , un proceso que no fue fácil, ya que sus padres se mudaron a este país cuando él era pequeño, por lo que sus abuelos lo registraron a él y a su hermana como sus hijos. Eso les funcionó bien para tener tutores, pero complicó su proceso migratorio.
Varela reconoce que el personal de USCIS alzó una “bandera roja” a su caso, ya que no creía que sus padres eran sus padres, a pesar de que en México hubo un juicio que permitió a los abuelos devolver la patria potestad a sus progenitores.
“Metieron el caso a prevención de fraude, llamaron a varias entrevistas, a mi papá, a mi mamá, no quedaron conformes con todo eso, se entregaron muchas pruebas de relación, fotografías” , cuenta.
La única forma de confirmar que él era hijo de sus padres era con pruebas de ADN, un examen que USCIS puede solicitar en ciertos casos.
“Al final hicieron pruebas de ADN, porque sintieron que lo entregado no era suficiente”, dijo Adrián, quien es licenciado en Administración de la Hospitalidad y trabaja en hotelería. “Ya no quedó duda. Ellos son mis padres”.
Recibió su “green card” en Nueva York, a donde llegó con una visa provisional, por cuatro semanas, en lo que recibía su documento final. A los cinco años obligatorios aplicó por la ciudadanía y a los seis meses levantó la mano derecha para jurar lealtad al país.
“Tomo esta obligación libremente sin ninguna reserva”, expresó al lado de otros 51 nuevos estadounidenses.

Texto completo: NUEVA YORK – Arellano, Boena, Jawad, Kim, Kupriynenko, Lu, Mallol, Meléndez, Sosa, Stan, Tucker, Varela y Velázquez muestran la diversidad en los Estados Unidos. Los apellidos son parte de los 52 inmigrantes que se convirtieron en nuevos ciudadanos de los Estados Unidos en el Museo del 9/11. “No tengas miedo” , fue la frase en la que coincidieron algunos de ellos cuando fueron entrevistados, un mensaje que envían a los inmigrantes en Estados Unidos.
“Apoyaré y defenderé la Constitución y leyes de los Estados Unidos de América contra todos los enemigos, extranjeros y locales” , juraron al unísono jóvenes, adultos en plenitud y adultos mayores, guiados por Ken Cuccinelli , el director interino de Servicios de Ciudadanía e Inmigración ( USCIS ), nombrado por el presidente Donald Trump y conocido por sus duras posturas migratorias, pero que durante la ceremonia realizada el martes pasado destacó el valor de los extranjeros que asumieron a este país como su nuevo hogar.
El evento tuvo varios significados, primero porque los participantes fueron oficialmente ciudadanos naturalizados, además de formar parte de las celebraciones por el 4 de Julio que realiza esta dependencia del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS), pero quizá el más emotivo fue honrar la memoria de aquellos inmigrantes que murieron víctimas de los ataques a las Torres Gemelas en 2001, ya sea porque trabajaron en alguno de los edificios del World Trade Center o porque ayudaron después del atentado y su esfuerzo derivó en consecuencias fatales.
“El 9/11 no solo es un evento que ha quedado en el pasado, sus efectos continúan hasta nuestros días… murieron alrededor de 3,000 personas, gente originaria de 90 naciones” , narró Alice M. Greenwald , directora del Museo del 9/11, quien no pudo contener sus lágrimas cuando habló de los inmigrantes que murieron en el mayor ataque terrorista que ha vivido el país y destacó el caso de aquellos a quienes USCIS ayudó a identificar, incluido el dominicano Gregorio Manuel Chávez , quien se naturalizó en 1999 y tras un reportaje de The New York Times, el Gobierno colaboró para ubicar a sus familiares, quienes aportaron una imagen que se exhibe en el museo. Hubo otros cuatro casos similares. En la ceremonia de este martes, la hija de Gregorio tomó juramento como ciudadana en la misma zona donde murió su padre.
Hay historias familiares que pueden resultar complejas, difíciles de creer y, sobre todo, demostrar a las autoridades migratorias que son legítimas, ya que están atentas a casos donde cualquier indicio pudiera tratarse de un fraude: un matrimonio falso o familiares que no lo son.
Así lo vivió Adrián Varela , un mexicano que lleva seis años viviendo en los Estados Unidos, a donde llegó con la Residencia Permanente , un proceso que no fue fácil, ya que sus padres se mudaron a este país cuando él era pequeño, por lo que sus abuelos lo registraron a él y a su hermana como sus hijos. Eso les funcionó bien para tener tutores, pero complicó su proceso migratorio.
Varela reconoce que el personal de USCIS alzó una “bandera roja” a su caso, ya que no creía que sus padres eran sus padres, a pesar de que en México hubo un juicio que permitió a los abuelos devolver la patria potestad a sus progenitores.
“Metieron el caso a prevención de fraude, llamaron a varias entrevistas, a mi papá, a mi mamá, no quedaron conformes con todo eso, se entregaron muchas pruebas de relación, fotografías” , cuenta.
La única forma de confirmar que él era hijo de sus padres era con pruebas de ADN, un examen que USCIS puede solicitar en ciertos casos.
“Al final hicieron pruebas de ADN, porque sintieron que lo entregado no era suficiente”, dijo Adrián, quien es licenciado en Administración de la Hospitalidad y trabaja en hotelería. “Ya no quedó duda. Ellos son mis padres”.
Recibió su “green card” en Nueva York, a donde llegó con una visa provisional, por cuatro semanas, en lo que recibía su documento final. A los cinco años obligatorios aplicó por la ciudadanía y a los seis meses levantó la mano derecha para jurar lealtad al país.
“Tomo esta obligación libremente sin ninguna reserva”, expresó al lado de otros 51 nuevos estadounidenses.

Translating The Times Into Spanish

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
One of the most frequently asked questions we get at The New York Times en Español is how we choose the articles that we translate. This has been a constant query -- both from readers and from people at The Times -- since the project began in February 2016. It's a polite discussion editors of the Español site hold daily -- one that is inextricably linked to a more heated, less polite discussion: How do we translate it?
From Los Angeles to Buenos Aires and from the Galápagos to Barcelona, the Spanish our readers speak varies widely. Latin Americans alone have more than 15 different words for popcorn, at least 13 terms for drinking straws and 10 ways of naming a humble ladybug -- as many as there are for soccer cleats. Soccer, in fact, may or may not carry an accent mark (fútbol or futbol) depending on where you live. There are different names for the same fruits, cuts of meat and the universal heartache. The exact word (however colloquial) that Venezuelans use to describe their anger is, in Peru, an expression of a prurient desire. And of course, all readers are adamant that their way of using the language is the right one.
The team of editors at The Times en Español are all native speakers of Spanish (from Mexico, Argentina and Venezuela), and some of us have studied or worked in Peru, Spain, Paraguay and the United States.
Every week, we publish 40 to 50 translations on top of opinion pieces and features originally produced in Spanish. With every piece that crosses over from English to Spanish, we are also translating a journalistic tradition of accuracy, quality and objectivity to new readers.
Being the Spanish voice of The Times meant we had to create a new standard for the use of the language. We quickly realized that translating to a neutral Spanish -- a language absolutely no one speaks -- was not an option. We had to find ways to reflect the richness and diversity of our native tongue and still be entirely readable.
Most of the articles we decide to publish in Spanish (if they are not breaking news) are sent to a translation agency that has worked for us since the beginning of the project. They have tailored their work to our style. English words that end in -ing, for example, tend not to sound natural if literally translated to Spanish as gerunds, and they can cause sentences to be confusing or unnecessarily intricate. As a general rule, once an article has been translated, it goes through two layers of editing. In an ideal situation, the two Spanish editors must have different language backgrounds.
One recurring question in our Mexico City office is: "Would readers in Peru (or Argentina or Mexico or Venezuela) understand this?"
Many times, solving our differences and answering these questions -- there is a private Slack channel for that: #nerdómetro -- means we have to do some research or go to academic books or ask specialized institutions. Two of our most trusted sources are the Real Academia Española, the most recognized governing institution for the language, or the newer Fundéu, which is particularly interested in raising the standard for good Spanish in the news media. Our guru (and sometimes sherpa) in style and language is Paulina Chavira, our editor specializing in rules and usage.
Paulina's authority reaches far: In time for the men's World Cup last summer, she lobbied the Mexican soccer team to change its official jerseys to carry accent marks, thus solving a historical omission that amounted to a spelling mistake.
Sometimes, we have created specific rules or even words to better convey The Times's spirit or coverage or treatment of an issue. Such as when we decided to use elle, a gender-neutral adaptation to the Spanish gendered pronouns of él and ella to better translate a Lens article about gender-fluid/nonbinary identities. Or when we chose to allow for flexibility on whether to use an accent mark on words like cartel or futbol, depending on what the usage is in the country or region we are writing about. (Which explains why articles about Pablo Escobar refer to his organization as "el Cartel de Medellín" and those about El Chapo use "el Cártel de Sinaloa").
Some of these discussions (and the resulting agreements) have become sources for content, either as a regular section of our newsletter El Times (you might want to subscribe here) or on our site, where we share with our readers some of our style guidelines and Paulina answers questions about Spanish rules and language updates.
There are no foolproof algorithms or dictionaries or artificial intelligence tools to solve our day-to-day translation efforts. That means we rely on listening to each other -- and to our readers: acknowledging and valuing our different accents and backgrounds and the plurality of the language that we share.
The bridge we've built to reach our audience (the bridge we cross when we choose what to translate and how to better translate it) rests on four key pillars: We do not underestimate the interests or the curiosity of our readers; we offer a global journalism to better understand local realities; we protect the richness of language and its nuances; and we trust our own instincts as readers.

Texto completo: The child separation policy for immigrants at the southern border is surely Trump's most inhumane tactic, from which the children will suffer lifelong trauma.
For us citizens, staying current with the news and trying to decide what action to take is complicated.
The New York Times editorial of June 25 offers good advice. Besides writing our representatives, it mentions the Raices Foundation. This is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit founded in 1986 in south Texas. It stands for Refugees and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services.
Their lawyers understand the array of legislation and know how to aid immigrants in court who face detention, which is one reason the children are separated.
Likewise, our local Champaign County Bailout Coalition aids immigrant adults who also face incarceration, which leads to family disruption.
The pattern of U.S. policies that condone child separation goes back to slavery and the forced child removal of Native Americans and "re-education schools" in force after the Civil War.
During both those eras, Americans acquiesced to the cruelty. Today, we have a similar choice, to be silent or resist Trump's acts against the most vulnerable of our southern neighbors.

TRUMP ABANDONS CITIZENSHIP QUESTION

Texto completo: The 2020 census forms are off to the presses without a controversial citizenship question that California and Bay Area officials feared could trigger a massive undercount of residents, costing the region and state hundred of millions in federal funding and congressional clout.
The Trump administration abandoned its long effort to include the citizenship question on Tuesday without explanation, acting a day after the U.S. Department of Commerce's self-imposed July 1 deadline to start printing the census form.
"This is a victory for Californians and for our democracy and a defeat for the Trump administration's relentless attack on our immigrant communities," Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement.
The decision also comes five days after the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the Commerce Department's justification for needing the question to better enforce the Voting Rights Act was insufficient. President Donald Trump lambasted that ruling and said on Twitter that he had asked lawyers if the census could be delayed until the issue was resolved.
In a statement, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross acknowledged dropping the question but said he strongly disagreed with the Supreme Court's decision.
"The Census Bureau has started the process of printing the decennial questionnaires without the question," Ross said. "My focus and that of the Bureau and the entire Department is to conduct a complete and accurate census."
Researchers warned that the inclusion of the question could result in California losing at least one, and possibly more, seats in Congress, reasoning that undocumented immigrants would avoid filling out the form for fear of identifying themselves to authorities. The loss of clout is less likely now, although an undercount in the state is still a distinct possibility.
Bay Area officials welcomed the decision, which was first reported by The New York Times and confirmed to this news organization by a U.S. Department of Justice official.
"We're grateful to the attorneys and advocates who tirelessly fought this Administration's attempt to stoke fear in our immigrant community, and depress participation in the 2020 Census," San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said in a statement.
Alameda County Supervisor Wilma Chan said she was thrilled.
"An undercount would've sent a message that immigrants and minorities don't deserve to be counted," she said, adding that a 2% undercount would have cost Alameda County $1 billion over 10 years.
In a statement, East Bay Rep. Barbara Lee echoed those sentiments.
"This misguided question should never have been proposed in the first place and the fear and anxiety it caused the immigrant community was completely unnecessary," Lee said.
Even without thequestion, an undercount in California and the Bay Area is still likely. The state is home to more immigrants than any other, as well as many renters, low-income residents and those not fluent in English, all of which researchers and state officials point to as some of the hardest-to-count communities.
Those populations are particularly large in West Oakland, Antioch, East San Jose and San Francisco's Mission and Chinatown neighborhoods, according to California Complete Count, the office tasked with the state's outreach and census coordination efforts.
Nick Kuwada, manager of Santa Clara County's Office of the Census, said that "a lot of the damage has been done." Many immigrant communities are already afraid of the census and how their answers could be used, he said.
"We need to start working today to make sure that they are counted in 2020," Kuwada said. "As much as I'd like to be ecstatic about the moment, there's still a lot of work to be done."
That work isvitally important for the state and local finances. California's population could be undercounted by 596,200 people, according to an analysis from The Urban Institute, a nonprofit research group in Washington, D.C. That includes 462,300 Hispanic and 96,700 black residents.
Every person not counted costs California roughly $2,000 in early education funding, food assistance and housing vouchers, according to George Washington University. That means the Urban Institutes anticipated undercount could cost California $1.16 billion in federal funding.
California is hoping to minimize those losses with a robust outreach and marketing effort to the tune of $100.4 million to count a projected 40.56 million residents, more per person than any other state. Alameda County is allocating $1.5 million to the effort, Chan said.
California's investment is in part to counteract an 11% decrease in how much the Census Bureau is spending on the census compared to 2010. Some of the savings came from making many respondents fill out the census questionnaire online. Chan urged the Trump administration to up the agency's funding.
"We'd like them to restore some of the money they took out from the Census Bureau last year," she said.

What Tiffany Cabán inherits in Queens

Texto completo: Tiffany Cabán, the apparent victor in the Democratic primary for Queens district attorney, ran on a campaign promising to upend the criminal justice status quo in New York City.
Cabán will replace Richard Brown, who died in office after serving as Queens DA for 28 years. Listening to those who ran against Brown's legacy, one could be forgiven for believing that the past decades in New York City have seen little but state-sponsored oppression and systemic police racism.
The New York Times editorial board endorsed Cabán while criticizing "aggressive prosecutions that filled prisons and devastated generations of black and Hispanic families. Communities ravaged by mass incarceration are still trying to recover from this approach."
How odd. New York City has achieved tremendous accomplishments preventing violence, improving policing, decreasing jail populations and more. These achievements came from the hard work and dedication and experience of some of the very people now being dismissed as part of some neo-liberal cabal.
Ordinary citizens may be unaware of these gains. The next Queens district attorney should not only be aware of them, but also build on their success. To uproot the current system risks doing, well, exactly that.
Mass incarceration is indeed a national problem. No country has ever locked up so many of its people. But New York has run counter to the national trend for a while now, decreasing incarceration, and rather substantially.
New York City has been sending fewer criminals to prisons ever since 1992. And New York State's prison population has been in decline since 2000. Currently the state's rate of incarceration is far less than the national average and the decline continues. How can we talk of over-filled prisons at the same time prisons are closing for want of prisoners?
At the city level, in the early 1990s more than 20,000 prisoners were held on Rikers Island. Currently the population is about 7,500, about 800 of whom are not pre-trial but serving post-conviction sentences.
The city has a plan - first released in 2017 - to close the jails on Rikers Island. But this progressive vision has always been contingent on two main accomplishments: 1) reduce the city's incarceration number even further, to 5,000, and 2) build new and better borough-based jails close to the courts.
The progressive mantra of "no new jails" not only won't end incarceration, but it will likely keep Rikers open and consign prisoners to abhorrent existing jails.
Policing in New York City has also improved, and dramatically so. Internationally, the NYPD is seen as a leader in many fields.
Police receive too little credit for NYC's great crime drop. Murders dropped from more than 2,000 in 1991 to under 300 in 2018. Other serious and quality-of-life crimes dropped just as dramatically. All this disproportionately benefits poor and minority communities. And it happened with smart leadership and collaboration with district attorneys who were willing to prosecute.
The NYPD - whether by design, lawsuit or district attorney fiat - has reduced arrests 40% since 2010. There were fewer arrests in 2018 than every year since 1983, when the city's population was just above 7 million.
Police-involved shootings have also plummeted. In 1971, NYPD officers shot 314 people. In 1991, the number was 108. In 2017, it was 19. Currently the NYPD uses lethal force at a rate one-third the national average.
At some point, in a city of 8.6 million, how much better can these numbers be? Is there ever a point where we'd admit the NYPD is doing a good job, or at least a decent job in tough circumstances, and turn our focus and efforts to more pressing problems?
One would think New York City's achievements would be celebrated by elected officials, perhaps held as an example of "best practices." Yet locally, to hear some tell it, police violence, arrests, and mass incarceration are worsening problems.
Crime is down. Arrests are down. Incarceration is down. Police use of force is down. What exactly are we hoping to reverse?

Texto completo: A Staten Island man who police say has made a living by shaking down struggling New York City taxi medallion owners on behalf of predatory lenders is in custody, charged with impersonating an officer.
The city's Sheriff's Department has charged Anthony Medina with four counts of impersonating a New York City marshal. The department confirmed three instances over the past three years in which Medina, who does not work for the city, claimed to be a city marshal while harassing cab drivers.
"This arrest provides some long-awaited justice for medallion owners who were made victim of predatory practices for far too long," said Mayor de Blasio. "Hardworking taxi drivers represent the best of this city, and my administration won't stand by while innocent New Yorkers are exploited."
In July 2016, Medina attempted to intimidate a taxi medallion owner at this home into giving up his cab, taxi medallion and rate card, according to the Sheriff's Department. Medina allegedly convinced the cabbie to hand over the keys to his taxi.
Officials said Medina shook down another medallion owner who was parked in the West Village in November 2017. He allegedly also got the driver to cough up his keys, and made off with his cab.
Medina is also charged with breaking into a taxi in Queens last May, making off with its medallion, rate card and meter and leaving a false notice of seizure. When the medallion owner paid Medina off, he was instructed to not tell the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission about the kerfuffle.
A City Hall spokesman said Medina worked on behalf of lenders looking to be paid for predatory loans that funded taxi medallion purchases. There is an investigation into which lenders hired Medina.
The New York Times detailed some of Medina's alleged nefarious acts in a lengthy report published last month about the taxi medallion crisis. Cab drivers told the Times that Medina had used a gun to intimidate them.

Texto completo: Corrections and clarifications: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated the year military equipment was displayed under the Obama administration. The correct year was 2009.
WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump is implementing a lot of changes to the Fourth of July Celebration on the National Mall, which in recent decades has mostly consisted of some fireworks and some music, by adding a presidential address and some military pomp to the mix.
Trump said as part of his planned display of military might, "We're gonna have some tanks stationed outside" during his "Salute to America. " That addition has generated some strong reaction from critics, including from the D. C. City Council, which reacted to the idea by saying, "Tanks, but no tanks. "
Here is what we know about the planned "static display":
What kind of tanks will be displayed?
No official announcement has been made about how many tanks there will be or what kind of tanks will be on display.
But news photographers captured images of at least two M1A1 Abrams tanks and two Bradley Fighting Vehicles on flatcars under military guard in a rail yard at the southeastern edge of Washington. The images showed what appears to be a Humvee and an M88 Hercules Recovery Vehicle, but a Defense Department official told USA TODAY those vehicles were sent in support and were not going to be part of the display.
An unnamed official told The Associated Press that the military vehicles to be used in the celebration were stored at the rail yard.

What about the 'brand new Shermans'
Trump told reporters on Monday that "some brand new Sherman tanks" would join the "brand new Abrams tanks. " But the M4 Sherman is no longer being produced having been taken out of service in 1957, according to the Military Times.
It has not been reported that any antique Sherman tanks or other older military equipment will be on display.
How much will it cost?
A preliminary estimate of the cost for transporting and displaying the tanks is about $870,000, according to a congressional aide who was not authorized to speak publicly about the plan.
Will they be part of a parade?
As noted above, the tanks will be on "static display. "
"You’ve got to be pretty careful with the tanks because the roads have a tendency not to like to carry heavy tanks," Trump explained on Monday. "So we have to put them in certain areas. "
In their tweet objecting to the tanks, the D. C. City Council included an image of a March 2018 letter from the Department of Defense that said "no tanks" could be used in a military parade because "consideration must be given to minimize damage to local infrastructure. "
The Washington Post reported that engineers are studying whether the 60-ton tanks could damage the underground rooms that are part of the Lincoln Memorial, even if they remain stationary.
What about damage to bridges?
Some people on social media expressed concern that bridges, particularly the Memorial Bridge leading to Arlington National Cemetery could be damaged by the tanks in response to an article from The New York Times. But the tanks were transported by rail and there do not appear to be any plans for them to travel over any local bridges or to Arlington.
What has the reaction been?
Several pundits and politicians and celebrities objected to the additions of the tanks.
"When I was a child, we saw pictures of military parades in the Soviet Union," tweeted Democratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson. "We were told we don’t do that, that we’re proud of the fact that we don’t do that because we don’t wish to be a militarized society. Celebrating July 4 with army tanks on the National Mall is repugnant. "
"Trump says there will be military tanks at Fourth of July celebration, tweeted NBC News' Andrea Mitchell. "This is so beyond the spirit of the holiday. "
"Autocrats show off their military weapons to compensate for their inferiority," said Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif. "Above all else, this is a waste of $$$. "
Former Rep. Joe Walsh, R-Ill. , said Trump was displaying the tanks to "feed his big fat ego. "
But others supported the idea.
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. , told the Times that he liked the idea.
"Other than the fact they have to pay to fix the streets, who cares?" Gingrich said.
Is it unprecedented?
There have been other displays of military equipment on the Mall, including much larger ones than what Trump has planned.
Public Service Recognition Week, which has been commemorated on the first week of May since 1985, often includes military displays, including tanks, on the National Mall. For example in 2009, during the Obama administration, the Army displayed an M1A2 Abrams Main Battle Tank and an M2A3 Bradley Fighting Vehicle as part of the event.
After the U. S. successfully drove Iraqi forces under Saddam Hussein from Kuwait in 1991, President George H. W. Bush celebrated the success of Operation Desert Storm with a massive victory parade that drew 800,000 people to the National Mall. Abrams tanks, along with a wide array of other military vehicles, rolled down Pennsylvania Avenue in the "National Victory Celebration. "

Sports figures vs. reporters: Top confrontations, from Billy Martin to Russell Westbrook

Resumen: The Mets' Mickey Callaway and Jason Vargas are the latest sports figures to take their anger out on reporters. We look back at other top feuds.

Texto completo: The media and professional athletes have always had a tenuous relationship. Occasionally when things aren't going well for a player or a team, the media can be a convenient outlet for anger and frustration.
As the saying goes, "familiarity breeds contempt. "
That's one explanation for the recent confrontation New York Mets manager Mickey Callaway and pitcher Jason Vargas had with Newsday beat reporter Tim Healey.
Callaway eventually apologized for his expletive-filled tirade. He and Vargas, who threatened to "knock out" Healey and had to be held back by teammates, have also been fined.
But in the annals of athlete-manager-reporter confrontations, this one was tame compared to some other memorable ones.
Billy Martin punches reporter, 1978
Martin, the legendary New York Yankees manager, could be just as combative off the field as on it. One November night in Reno, Nevada, Martin -- who had been fired earlier that season by owner George Steinbrenner -- punched a local reporter in the face.
According to The New York Times, Martin said he did it because Ray Hagar of the Reno Evening Gazette "challenged me to fight” during an interview.
Not surprisingly, Hagar remembered things differently: “He said that writers always twist things he said. He saw me writing things down and he wanted to see my notes,” Hagar said. The reporter suffered a gash above his eye and at least three chipped teeth.
“He hit me before I knew it," Hagar said. "I didn't even get a punch in. ”
Oddly, Callaway used Martin as an example to explain his own behavior.
Will McDonough slugs Pats DB, 1979
McDonough, the former Boston Globe writer, had a history of being tough with his words. He backed it up by his actions in the New England Patriots' locker room after a game against the New York Jets.
Defensive back Raymond Clayborn was in no mood to celebrate the 56-3 win, purposely bumping into reporters who came near him. According to Bruce Allen of Boston Sports Media Watch, McDonough took the future Pro Bowler to task, saying, "Hey Ray, there's no need to do that. "
Clayborn stuck a finger in the reporter's face and poked him in the eye. So McDonough stepped back and unloaded a three-punch combination that, according to some, knocked Clayborn to the ground.
Hal McRae throws desk phone, 1993
The former Kansas City Royals star returned to manage his old team in 1991, but his tenure ended four short years later with the team never finishing higher than third place. Early in his third season, the Royals had just suffered a disappointing loss to the Detroit Tigers, dropping their record to 7-12.
After the game, one of the reporters assembled in McRae's office asked whether he had considered using George Brett -- who was 40 at the time and in the final season of his career -- as a pinch-hitter in a bases-loaded situation in the seventh inning.
That sent McRae on an epic tirade. It began with him calling it a "stupid (expletive) question" and led to him throwing several objects from his desk -- including a corded phone.
One of the objects McRae threw -- believed to be a tape recorder -- struck reporter Alan Eskew of the Topeka Capital-Journal on the side of his face. There was even some blood.
After kicking everyone out of his office, McRae came back out with a few more choice words, including his memorable parting shot: "Put that in your (expletive) pipe and smoke it!"
Jim Everett sacks Jim Rome, 1994
This one was pretty simple -- and likely planned to some degree in advance.
Sportscaster and talk-show host Jim Rome was just starting to build a name for himself nationally when he invited then-New Orleans Saints quarterback Jim Everett on his ESPN2 show, "Talk 2. "
Rome had been critical of Everett's injuries, often questioning his toughness by calling him "Chris" -- a reference to tennis star Chris Evert. The quarterback didn't appreciate the insinuation, which seems even more juvenile 25 years later.
When the two sat down to do the live interview, Everett warned Rome not to say it to his face. Rome did . . . so Everett flipped over a table between them and tackled the host.
Everett later explained in a teleconference: "I really don't condone my actions, but I was put in a position that I thought was going to be in a journalistic-type interview, and instead, I was put into what I felt was a taunting attack. I don't regret what I did. "
Ryan Leaf melts down, 1998
After a particularly bad game -- even by his standards -- San Diego Chargers quarterback Ryan Leaf just couldn't contain his emotions. The rookie had completed just one of 14 passes for four yards with two interceptions and three lost fumbles. He yelled at a TV cameraman after the game, but that was only the beginning.
The next day in the Chargers' locker room, he singled out reporter Jay Posner of the San Diego Union-Tribune, apparently for writing about the confrontation with the cameraman.
"Don't talk to me, all right? Knock it off!" Leaf screamed before he was restrained by Chargers linebacker Junior Seau.
That incident got Leaf even more negative publicity when it was caught on video and shown on national television.
He later issued a televised apology, after which he crumpled up the paper he was reading and threw it in his locker.
Russell Westbrook's boycott, 2015-
Generally, an athlete-reporter beef stems from a particular incident and is only temporary before one or the other moves on -- either emotionally or physically.
However, the Oklahoma City Thunder guard has held a grudge against columnist Berry Tramel of The Oklahoman for years, refusing to answer his questions or, at most, giving short, one-sentence answers.
Why?
"I just don't like you," Westbrook said after a game in early 2015.
That's about as much insight as Westbrook has shed on the situation -- although Tramel told the Hoops Hype podcast in April he didn't take the insult personally; he felt Westbrook was addressing the media in general.
Nevertheless, the relationship between the two has only gotten worse. Westbrook frequently says, "Next question" whenever Tramel asks him anything in a news conference.
Yet Tramel keeps asking, as he wrote in a recent column, "because the media shouldn’t give in to Westbrook’s desire to control everything. "
Unlike other high-profile confrontations, there's been nothing physical between these two . . . but then again, this feud has lasted far longer.

Once again, Mass. is one of the last states not to have a budget

Texto completo: There is no shortage of vexing problems facing Massachusetts government these days: The MBTA is in constant crisis. Housing is increasingly unaffordable in Boston and beyond. And the state is being sued for failing to provide minority children with a decent education.
But don't look to the Legislature for any kind of immediate action. Its leaders are not planning to tackle most of these key policy debates until later in the year — at the earliest — and they've also just blown through their July 1 deadline to finish their most fundamental task: crafting a budget.
For the ninth year in a row, the Legislature had to pass a stopgap spending measure to keep state government running. And it's not as if budget writers have to slog through tough debates about where to cut spending: Tax revenues are pouring in far in excess of estimates.
Other states manage to do more — in some cases, much more. Forty-two states have enacted budgets for fiscal 2020 already, according to the National Association of State Budget Officers. In fact, Massachusetts is one of just two states with a fiscal year starting July 1 where the Legislature has not passed an annual spending plan yet. (The other is Ohio.)
Beacon Hill leadership says behind-the-scenes work is happening on several fronts, including an overhaul of the state's troubled education funding formula and proposals to pump more money into the beleaguered public transportation system. House Speaker Robert A. DeLeo recently described the latter as a “crisis" after Governor Charlie Baker announced his request for $50 million in additional revenue to speed up fixes to the MBTA.
“So far this session, the House has passed major pieces of legislation to fund state services, keep our roads safe, raise revenue, invest in our roads and bridges, support farmers, put in place consumer protections and create safeguards for workers, among other items," DeLeo said in a statement.
“The Senate has been working diligently since January, and will continue its collaborative process to craft bold, actionable solutions to the challenges facing the Commonwealth," said state Senate President Karen Spilka.
In several cases, bills that have passed one chamber are awaiting further action elsewhere on Beacon Hill. The Legislature has sent only a handful of meaningful measures to Baker's desk so far this year, according to a Globe review.
He's taken action on 30 bills, but only two of these qualify as meaty policy matters — a ban on so-called gay conversion therapy for minors, and the repeal of a policy precluding families receiving welfare benefits from getting additional assistance when another child is born. Lawmakers passed the latter over Baker's veto.
Lawmakers and other Beacon Hill defenders argue bills sent to Baker's desk are not the only yardstick by which to gauge the Legislature's productivity. The start of the two-year legislative session is typically dominated by hearings, of which more than 100 have happened to date.
For comparison, in their six-month legislative session that ended earlier this month, New York legislators not only completed a $175.5 billion budget, they hammered out deals on more than a dozen consequential policy issues. Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, approved stronger rental laws and protections for undocumented immigrants, moved to eliminate almost all greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and overhauled the state's voting laws and the Legislature's own ethics rules, among other measures.
“A sense of jealousy and a sense of serious anger," is how former state representative Jay R. Kaufman said he felt reading a recent New York Times editorial praising all the New York Assembly accomplished this year. “A comparable editorial cannot be written about the Massachusetts Legislature," said Kaufman, who left Beacon Hill after 24 years to start a nonprofit focused on leadership training for the public sector.
Some items are nearing the finish line on Beacon Hill. Both chambers have passed legislation this year banning the use of mobile devices while driving. The House and Senate also each passed bills to bolster organized labor. In both cases, lawmakers still must work out differences in conference committee.
They also recently approved a constitutional amendment to raise income taxes on millionaires — the first procedural step to putting the proposal on the ballot, something that would happen, at the earliest, in 2022.
In Beacon Hill's biennial rhythm, the season for hard-nosed negotiation and horse trading on the big, complicated matters typically comes in the second year — with the hard deadline at the session's end.
At the close of the previous two-year session, lawmakers struck a so-called grand bargain that combined a $15 minimum wage and a paid family and medical leave program with a permanent sales tax holiday and overtime changes. (Legislative action only came, though, after progressive activists and business interests had secured separate ballot measures on their respective priorities.)
Lawmakers and others point to the complexity of the state's almost $43 billion budget and stress the importance of getting it done right, not fast — especially since the stopgap spending measure means there's no practical consequences to a delay of a few weeks' time.
On Monday, Baker told reporters he is unbothered by the Legislature's repeated budget tardiness. Passing a temporary budget to let lawmakers have more time “usually ends up producing a better product then simply getting there by June 30," he said.
And several outside advocates said they're optimistic Beacon Hill will prove able to finish legislation on key policy fronts during the session, which ends next year.
“I actually give high marks to the Legislature this session because there's been a clear acknowledgment of the need to act decisively on our transportation crisis, and it is a crisis," said former state transportation secretary James Aloisi. While they may not have the details worked out, both DeLeo and Spilka have indicated “action is not just warranted but necessary. That alone gives me a lot of hope that the Legislature intends to step up and do something significant" this session, he said.
DeLeo has said the House plans to take up a tax package this fall to help fund transportation. House and Senate education chairs are meeting regularly to hash out a consensus on revamping the state's antiquated education funding formula, which they hope to unveil before lawmakers scatter for August vacations.
The timeline for other high-profile initiatives remains murky — including legislation pushed by Baker that would make it easier for cities and towns to change zoning to allow new housing. Another Patriots season is set to start without Massachusetts allowing legal wagers, a year after the Supreme Court cleared the way for states to have sports betting — while a dozen other states, including Rhode Island, have charged ahead.
Even mundane matters can move at a sluggish pace. Lawmakers did not finish a $200 million borrowing bill for municipal road repairs until June, taking five weeks longer to pass the annual measure than they did last year, according to State House News Service, even though the borrowing level has remained essentially unchanged since 2012.
“It's not like we're reinventing the wheel. . . . This is the same thing over and over again," said Franklin's director of public works, Robert Cantoreggi.
Passing the annual road repair bill after March makes it harder for many cities and towns to plan their construction projects and can drive up costs, because so many municipalities are trying to hire a limited pool of contractors in a compressed amount of time, he said. The House transportation committee chairman, William Straus, said he disagrees that the timing of the bill had a negative impact on any cities and towns.
But Cantoreggi said the process for authorizing these funds “could be a lot more efficient, but that's Beacon Hill."

Texto completo: Niyah Peterkin is a planner.
She needs to be. She's up at 6:30 and back home around 10:30 p.m. By day, she's an honor roll student at York Suburban Middle School. At night, she transforms into a ballerina with the Central Pennsylvania Youth Ballet.
"I like being on the stage," Niyah said.
This has been a lifetime of work for Niyah, a dancer since she was 2, a serious dancer since 7, when her parents discovered CPYB and the discipline of a dance troupe that boasts alumni like Anna Gerberich, a Dillsburg native who joined the Joffrey Ballet in 2015, and Aran Bell, from Bethesda, Md., who is now with the American Ballet Theatre.
This isn't an extra-curricular activity, her mother said.
"The school makes it pretty clear that the goal for the students that study there is to become professional," Shaneika Peterkin said.
Like the parents of an Olympian, their commitment is nearly as taxing as hers. Vincent Peterkin picks up his daughter at the middle school at 3 p.m. for the hour-long drive to Carlisle, where he works at Geodis Logistic running production control. He works long shifts a couple of days a week, building his entire schedule around her school.
"He has been incredibly flexible to have jobs that allow him to take her to ballet," Shaneika Peterkin said.
Niyah has a planner to keep herself organized. "I just try to write down everything I can," she said. She practices dance 29 hours a week over six days, but not at home. She just runs through her dances in her head.
Because of that commitment to dance, Niyah will move into cyber school for her next academic year.
The dance school A Carlisle 19-year-old, Marcia Dale Weary, opened the Central Penn Youth Ballet in 1955. She wanted ballet to be accessible to all children.
Weary just died this year at age 82.
In a New York Times story after her death, it said this about the school she built: "Graduates are on the rosters of nearly every important American company, including New York City Ballet, American Ballet Theater, San Francisco Ballet, Pacific Northwest Ballet and Miami City Ballet."
Nicholas Ade, CPYB's executive director, said that he and Weary had spent a year working on the transition that would leave the school as she hoped. Among her goals was to keep CPYB accessible to all potential students.
"The only requirement to be admitted to our school is you have to be willing to do the work," Ade said. There are no auditions. The school has 300 students in an academic year and raises more than $300,000 in scholarships for the girls and boys who attend.
With those scholarships in place, classes average about $4 per session. At the top academic level, a school-year commitment to CPYB costs a family about $4,000, Ade said. At most of the schools in the United States at CPYB's level, tuition is about $10,000 a year, Ade said.
Students come from all over the country. The students at CPYB currently represent 23 states.
To help raise money for scholarships, CPYB offers sessions like Spring Into Summer, which will be held June 8 at the school in Carlisle. Niyah and her fellow students will perform, and the school will open its doors for a cocktail party to accompany the show. Tickets are $50.
For Niyah's family, the scholarships have made all the difference.
"The school has been incredibly gracious," Shaneika Peterkin said. The pointe shoes that she wears cost $100 a pair, which she needs to replace about every two to three months because of the wear on the shoe. At higher levels with more demand on the shoes, the older students can go through about a pair every week, she said.
Life changing Niyah barely remembers the life she and her family left behind in the city of Baltimore to move to Springettsbury Township six years ago.
She remembers wearing a uniform for the private Christian school she attended. At the time, the Peterkins were beginning to grow out of the small house they bought before they had children, Niyah and brother Mekhi, now 9.
They needed a new home, somewhere safe and affordable, and two kids in private school wouldn't be affordable. They landed in York County, surrounded in a neighborhood by a number of people just like them: Maryland transplants.
"We're in a town that's very welcoming," Shaneika Peterkin said.
She drives an hour to work each day, as a teacher with the Baltimore schools. Her husband goes in the other direction an hour.
"We're constantly evaluating that this is something she wants to do," Shaneika Peterkin said, making sure it's not overwhelming for their daughter, and that she sees her place in it. "I make a point that she goes to other shows where she can see other brown dancers. It's important that she sees she's not the only one."
Ballet has had difficulty diversifying its ranks because there's a common misconception that ballet is very expensive and elitist, Ade said.
"That's just not the case," Ade said. "That's the vision of Marica Dale Weary, to say that this type of training and the life skills that you learn from this ... should be accessible to everyone."
The pointed shoes Niyah Peterkin wears cost about $100 a pair. At this point, she needs a new pair ever two or three months, but she may eventually need a new pair each week.

Buttigieg's remarks don't satisfy: Residents

Texto completo: Headnote 2020 ELECTION
SOUTH BEND, Ind. - It was more than an hour into Thursday's Democratic debate before the community activists watching back home finally heard Mayor Pete Buttigieg face the tough questions they were waiting for.
Why was the South Bend Police Department just 6% Black in a city that is 26% African American? How had a white officer fatally shot a Black man in a routine encounter 11 days earlier?
And why, after years of policing traumas like the one in Ferguson, Missouri, was it taking so long to bring accountability to South Bend?
Buttigieg admitted to falling short. "I couldn't get it done," he said about failing to increase diversity on the police force. He expressed anguish for the family of the dead man, Eric Logan.
In an apartment on South Bend's largely Black Northwest Side, the reviews were mostly negative.
"He skipped over all the stuff that's happened," said Tiana Batiste-Waddell, referring to a history of police misconduct, some of which led to officers being fired or found guilty of rights violations.
"It's not in his best interest to go into all of it because he knows he didn't do anything," said Jordan Geiger, who works for a nonprofit group.
"But he needs to speak to those," Batiste-Waddell said. "That's how I believe our department got to the point of killing a Black man. Because none of the other racial things that have happened have been addressed."
In the end, the shooting that has consumed Buttigieg's campaign for more than a week, threatening to halt his magical rise in the 2020 field and to undermine his hopes of winning Black voters nationally, was not a major narrative of the debate.
The 37-year-old mayor, who was third out of 10 candidates in the length of time he spoke, capably handled multiple issues, including immigration, the role that Midwest farmers could play in slowing climate change and China's threat to dominate artificial intelligence.
Even on race, he was not the big story, as Sen. Kamala Harris of California confronted former Vice President Joe Biden over his past support of school busing and recent praise of segregationists.
In the coming days, the police shooting is unlikely to fade for Buttigieg, who supports a Department of Justice investigation.
How it affects his campaign, which expects to announce strong fundraising results through June, remains unclear. Some critics have been quick to pronounce the end of a candidacy initially lofted up by white liberal support.
There has been little polling since the issue came to dominate Buttigieg's candidacy. His damage control, in the form of readily voiced contrition and community meetings that were raw and chaotic, may be more convincing to voters nationally than locally.
As Batiste-Waddell, 40, watched, she and some of the other activists expressed frustration with a debate-night discourse that seemed far removed from their lived experience in South Bend, where they are part of a minority community with high poverty and violence, which has not been lifted by the economic development that Buttigieg boasts of bringing to the city.
"To me it's all been a big dumpster fire," Geiger, 28, said of the mayor's response to the shooting. "I hate to be so negative; I'm sure he has his good points. But I'm speaking from a Northwest Side point of view."
Another activist, E-Lexus Thornton, 23, a graduate student in industrial management, said there was a sharp divide in the perspectives of Black and white residents in the city, just as there was economic segregation by neighborhood. "I go to the middle-class neighborhoods; I see people saying he's done good things," he said of the mayor. "But when I come back to where I live, in the Northwest, it's the same old thing: broken-down housing, no businesses, shootings."
Minority residents of South Bend are not monolithic. In Buttigieg's 2015 reelection, he faced a primary challenge from a Black member of the City Council, and the mayor won decisively, winning even the councilman's district.
The NAACP president has been a Buttigieg supporter in the wake of the police shooting. So was the host of the debate-watch gathering, Vernado Malone Sr., who had been a close friend of Logan, the man who was shot by a white officer responding to a call of someone breaking into cars. Police said Logan, who left behind five children, had raised a knife, but the officer failed to turn on his body camera. Activists want a special prosecutor to investigate.
Malone provided takeout fried chicken to his guests, four of them Black and one white, as well as a contrasting view of Buttigieg, whom he supports.
On Friday, Malone, 47, organized a march against police violence attended by Buttigieg and the police chief. He criticized some community members who showed up two days later at a raucous town hall, where they blasted the mayor, but then failed to attend a City Council meeting the next day to follow up on police issues.
"You can't yell at somebody when you're not putting in the work yourself," Malone said.
Geiger told him that entering the County-City Building downtown for official meetings was intimidating for some minority residents, "especially people who have criminal backgrounds or they're behind on their child support."
Malone, who runs a livery business that drives people to visit family members in prison, said that was no excuse. "I've been locked up five times; I'm in the system," he told Geiger. "The County-City Building shouldn't be a threat to nobody. They don't ask you your name or for your ID."
Early next week, the activists expected Buttigieg back in South Bend, where they said he had promised to meet with them.
Batiste-Waddell expects to tell the mayor about a questionnaire that can measure police officers' ability to adapt to people of different cultures.
"This isn't about whether I like Mayor Pete or not," she said. "I just want to solve the problem."

Kevin Durant reportedly will join Nets, not Clippers, who will wait to hear from Kawhi Leonard

Texto completo: The Clippers will have to woo Kawhi Leonard without offering him an opportunity to play with Kevin Durant, according to reports Sunday afternoon by a variety of NBA insiders indicating he will be signing with the Brooklyn Nets, where he will team up with fellow free agent Kyrie Irving.
Durant, who suffered a torn Achilles tendon during the NBA Finals, reportedly will sign with the Nets on a four-year $164 million deal while Irving will sign a four-year $141 million max deal, per multiple reports. Durant is scheduled to make an announcement via the Instagram of his sports-owned business channel The Boardroom.
NBA free agency is scheduled to open officially today at 3 p.m., PT.
A pair of players with Clippers connections – veteran center DeAndre Jordan, a pillar of the Lob City era, and guard Garrett Temple, who joined the team last season after the trade deadline – also reportedly are set to sign with the Nets.
The Clippers will wait to learn the truth of reports that Leonard was going to leave the Toronto Raptors only if he could be assured he’d be playing with a “top-flight free agent.”
The Clippers reportedly had their sights on Durant, for months. In Brian Windhorst’s report for ESPN in December, he broached the possibility of the duo teaming up and noted that the Clippers would be able to create two max slots to allow it to happen this summer.
Of course, even with the cap space, Windhorst equated pulling off the feat to “pulling the sword from the stone.”
Durant, a 30-year-old forward who won two titles with Golden State, went on the record earlier this month to make it clear that he would make his decision independent of any of his peers intentions: “I can’t be recruited.”
Not that the New York Knicks, Warriors and Clippers wouldn’t join the Nets in making their best cases.
Reports were that the Warriors were set to offer Kevin Durant a five-year, $221 max contract, $57 million more than any of his other suitors, and Stephen Curry was going to help deliver the pitch.
The Clippers’ pitch also will include people that Durant is known to admire, including Jerry West, whose 2016 call to Durant is said to have helped persuade him to join the Warriors, and owner Steve Ballmer, who appeared on the second episode of “The Boardroom with Kevin Durant,” an ESPN series that debuted in February.
Furthermore, Durant’s familiarity with the Clippers organization extends to general manager Michael Winger and assistant coach Rex Kalamian, whose tenures in Oklahoma City overlapped with Durant’s.
And Durant, remember, raved about several members of the Clippers this past season, including their then-rookie backcourt of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Landry Shamet.
But, according to reports, the Nets’ offer and the chance for Durant to play alongside his friend Irving proved most enticing.
On Saturday, the New York Times reported Leonard – who also is a target of the Lakers, who cleared cap space this week in order to offer him a chance to play beside LeBron James and Anthony Davis – wants to play with a “top-flight free agent” if he chooses to leave the Toronto Raptors.
The Clippers also are rumored to be among the teams vying for the 76ers’ Jimmy Butler — who also has been linked to the Houston Rockets and reportedly is most interested in playing for the Miami Heat. The 29-year-old wing was mentioned in various reports as another potential option. An excellent two-way player with a drive to win, on paper he seems like a fit for both Leonard and the Clippers.

Lyft, Uber and Unions Talk About Exempting Drivers

Texto completo: California's labor movement recently seemed on the verge of a new era for worker rights. A state court ruled that workers in the gig economy should have many of the protections of employment, like a minimum wage and overtime pay. And the State Assembly passed a bill codifying that ruling and adding more protections.
But any celebration was premature. Behind the scenes, a few large unions had been meeting with the giants of the ride-hailing industry, Uber and Lyft, to discuss a way to exempt drivers from full employment protections, according to union and industry officials. The talks have created deep rancor within the labor ranks and set unions against one another.
Exempting Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as employees would provide huge savings in labor costs and allow the companies to avert what could be an existential threat to their business.
In return, Uber and Lyft -- which currently classify drivers as contractors -- have publicly proposed to recognize a labor organization that would represent drivers' interests on certain issues. The companies have also discussed providing drivers with benefits like retirement saving and paid time off and setting certain pay standards.
At a meeting of union officials within the last two weeks, the executive director of the California council of the Service Employees International Union, one of the unions in discussions with Uber and Lyft, put forth a proposal along these lines, according to two people who attended the meeting.
But on a conference call on Friday with the executive director, Alma Hernández, and several S.E.I.U. officials in California, one of the union's national leaders, Heather Conroy, appeared to reject the idea, according to a person on the call. Ms. Conroy said the union supported full employee status, including the California bill that would enshrine it.
The change in the S.E.I.U.'s apparent openness to exploring less than full employment status comes amid considerable opposition to the idea both inside and outside the union. One local in California, the United Healthcare Workers West, has threatened to oppose such a proposal publicly, according to the union's president, Dave Regan.
In mid-June, Héctor Figueroa, the head of a large S.E.I.U. local in New York, wrote of a similar proposal, "Collective bargaining without a minimum wage, which is what this would be, means that we are forced to bargain for what should already be rightfully ours." Mr. Figueroa also criticized the companies' attempt at negotiating a "back-room deal" in California.
David Huerta, the president of the United Service Workers West, an S.E.I.U. local in California, said in a statement, "Neither Alma nor S.E.I.U. have ever pushed forward anything that would take away employee status for gig workers or advocate for independent contractor status for any gig worker." Mr. Huerta said he has attended internal and external meetings about gig workers with Ms. Hernández.
Uber and Lyft have made clear in their conversations with labor leaders that full employment status is a nonstarter, according to an industry official.
An Uber spokesman cited a line from a recent op-ed article by the chief executives of Uber and Lyft that said, "Our companies are ready to provide additional protections that workers need and deserve today." A Lyft spokesman declined to comment.
There is precedent for Uber negotiating a deal with a union that stops short of granting drivers employee status. In 2016, Uber announced an agreement with a regional branch of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers to create an organization for drivers in the New York City area.
That deal has drawn criticism within organized labor, but machinists' leaders argued that the agreement was the best they could achieve. Without the organization, for example, the union would have no way to contact all of Uber's New York City drivers, making it difficult to organize them. Dues are voluntary, but drivers who pay them have more say in the organization's decisions.
But in California, labor groups and ride-hailing drivers, who number more than 100,000, find themselves with considerably more leverage thanks to the state Supreme Court ruling.
"We won a court case that gave workers rights," said Cesar Diaz, the political and legislative director for the State Building and Construction Trades Council. "To cut some kind of deal that takes away rights, that is not what labor unions are about." Mr. Diaz said that any move to include exemptions in the legislation could open the door to denying full employment protections to workers in other sectors.
In its 2018 decision, the state Supreme Court ruled that workers should be considered employees if they perform a task that's part of the "usual course" of a company's business. Most legal experts concluded that driving was central to Uber's business and that drivers must be considered employees under the ruling, said Veena Dubal, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law.
This May, the state's Assembly passed a bill that would extend the ruling in certain respects and limit it in others. The court ruling applied mainly to minimum wage and overtime laws, while the legislation, Assembly Bill 5, would apply to all aspects of employment, including unemployment insurance, workers' compensation and paid sick days. At the same time, the bill exempted certain high-paying professions from the Supreme Court ruling, such as doctors and real estate agents.
Over all, millions of workers in the state could be affected by the legislation, including construction workers, janitors, house cleaners, cable installers, truckers and delivery drivers.
In July, the State Senate will hold hearings on the measure. Legislators working with Uber and Lyft could attach an exemption for drivers or write separate legislation to do so.
Despite the S.E.I.U.'s insistence that it supports the bill and full employment status for drivers, the union appears willing to continue negotiating with Uber and Lyft. It has created what it calls a "national bargaining committee to provide national leadership on the negotiations" with the companies, according to an email dated June 21 from Ms. Conroy, an executive vice president of the union, that was reviewed by The New York Times.
At stake are billions of dollars in potential costs for the two companies. Industry officials have estimated that relying on employees is about 20 to 30 percent more expensive for gig-economy companies than relying on contractors. In its filing for an initial public offering earlier this year, Uber told investors that having to classify drivers as employees would "require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequently have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition." Lyft's filing included a similar warning.
This spring, the companies won a victory when the general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board, an appointee of President Trump, concluded that drivers are contractors, meaning they effectively lack the protections of federal labor law. The Trump Labor Department issued a similar verdict, through a so-called "opinion letter," a few weeks earlier. But California law would supersede those decisions in most respects.
To fight their legislative battle in California, Uber and Lyft have resorted to a longstanding tactic: trying to mobilize drivers. Uber sent one message to drivers through its app saying that "unless the California Legislature takes action to modernize the law, you could lose your ability to work with multiple apps and control when and where you choose to drive with Uber," then urged drivers to sign a petition. Uber said tens of thousands of drivers signed.
But it's not clear how effective the tactic will be in an era of rising driver frustration over pay and arbitrary treatment, as well as regular driver protests.
Some labor groups are calling for hundreds of workers to descend on Sacramento on July 10 to demonstrate support for their employment rights as the State Senate considers the legislation.
Nicole Moore, a member of the organizing committee for Rideshare Drivers United, a driver group, said many drivers were upset by the efforts of Uber and Lyft to enlist them in fighting against employment status.
"I have never seen so many angry messages about 'How dare they say I should advocate against my own rights?"' Ms. Moore said.
Ms. Moore also expressed frustration that drivers had not had a direct role in the negotiations between the unions and Uber and Lyft. "Rideshare Drivers United has 5,000 members now," she said. "Were we contacted by them? No."

Saturday

6:28 p. m. ET: With Kyrie Irving potentially on his way to the Nets, D'Angelo Russell's time in Brooklyn seems to be over. An unlikely reunion could be on the horizon. ESPN reported that the Lakers – who traded the former No. 2 overall pick two summers ago – had reached out to Russell's representation to set up a meeting with the free agent.
6 p. m. ET: Kyrie Irving to the Brooklyn Nets? Maybe. ESPN is reporting the two parties will talk Sunday, looking toward a four-year, $141 million deal. But the Nets also want Kevin Durant. How will a potential deal with Irving affect their chances of signing the two-time NBA Finals MVP?

11:37 a. m. : Could Kawhi Leonard and Kevin Durant team up? ESPN reports that the two superstars "have been discussing free agent scenarios. "
Friday
9:45 p. m. ET: Kevin Durant appears to have narrowed his list of suitors to four, with ESPN reporting that he plans to engage with the Golden State Warriors, Brooklyn Nets, Los Angeles Clippers and New York Knicks once free agency opens.
6:15 p. m. ET: D'Angelo Russell will be a restricted free agent. The Brooklyn Nets have produced a qualifying offer, according to The Athletic.

First responder who fought on Capitol Hill for 9/11 victim fund dies

Texto completo: Luis Alvarez, 53, developed cancer after working at Ground Zero
Earlier this month, former New York police detective Luis Alvarez delivered a heartbreaking plea to Congress to extend the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, which provides financial assistance to first responders who had developed illnesses after responding to the 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center.
On Saturday, his family confirmed that the NYPD veteran had died at 53, having succumbed to the cancer he developed years after working at Ground Zero.
Family spokesman Matt McCauley confirmed to The Washington Post that Alvarez had died in the early hours of Saturday morning due to "9/11-related cancer." Alvarez had developed colorectal and liver cancer in 2016.
"It is with peace and comfort, that the Alvarez family announce that Luis (Lou) Alvarez, our warrior, has gone home to our Good Lord in heaven today," the family said in a statement. "Please remember his words, 'Please take care of yourselves and each other.' We told him at the end that he had won this battle by the many lives he had touched by sharing his three year battle. He was at peace with that, surrounded by family."
He is survived by his wife, Alaine Parker Alvarez, and his three children: David, Tyler and Benjamin. He is also survived by his parents, Felipe and Aida Alvarez; his sister, Aida Lugo; and brothers Fernando and Philip Alvarez.
Alvarez's legacy is cemented in his advocacy for his fellow first responders to 9/11, and in the legislation he helped push through the House Judiciary Committee. The bill reauthorizes money for the compensation fund until 2089, ensuring decades of support for the emergency responders and their families who continue to suffer nearly 18 years later.
The existing $7.5 billion fund is in danger of running out of money before its current 2020 expiration date. It has already paid about $5 billion to 21,000 claimants, but as of February, 19,000 unpaid claims remain. Officials said they would have to pay reduced claims starting Feb. 1, a situation that Rupa Bhattacharyya, the special master overseeing the funds, called "horribly unfair."
As Alvarez's death has reminded lawmakers, time is running out for many of these people. Congress "cannot allow Lou Alvarez to have died in vain," bill co-sponsor Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.), wrote in a tribute on Twitter.
"His legacy lives on in all of us in this fight," tweeted Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.), who introduced the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund renewal legislation.
Maloney told The Post earlier this month that she hopes the bill will pass the House in July. On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the Senate hoped to pass the bill by August after he faced direct criticism from former "Daily Show" host Jon Stewart over his handling of the renewal.
Sitting beside Stewart at a June 11 hearing on the eve of a scheduled 69th round of chemotherapy, Alvarez implored members of Congress to replenish the fund as thousands of responders and their families wait for assistance.
"I should not be here with you, but you made me come," he said. "You made me come because I will not stand by and watch as my friends with cancer from 9/11 like me are valued less than anyone else because of when they get sick, they die."
"It is my goal and it is my legacy to see that you do the right thing for all 9/11 responders," he said. The next day, Alvarez felt too disoriented to continue treatment and was placed in hospice care shortly after, the New York Times reported.
"You all said you would never forget," Alvarez said at the hearing. "Well I'm here to make sure that you don't."

Report: Vucevic will get 4-year,; $90 million offer; 7-foot center helped team reach playoffs for 1st time since 2012; Magic

Texto completo: The Orlando Magic reportedly are poised to offer center Nikola Vucevic a four-year, $90 million deal with the hope of locking him in at the start of free agency Sunday afternoon.
Mark Stein of the New York Times was the first to report the framework and timeline for a deal on Friday.
The 28-year-old Vucevic earned his first NBA All-Star selection this past season as he averaged a career-best 20.8 points and 12.0 rebounds per game. He is the longest-tenured Magic player at seven seasons.
Vucevic has talked often about his desire to play a role in turning around the franchise. He certainly did that last season in helping the Magic reach the playoffs for the first time since 2012.
He has shown offensive prowess during his career, but he took it to a new level during the 2018-19 season. The 7-footer set career highs in scoring and assists per game as he played a primary role within coach Steve Clifford's system. The Magic ran a lot of their offense through Vucevic, be it pick-and-rolls or post-up plays, and his improved passing helped the team's perimeter game.
And then there was Vucevic's own shooting. His percentage on two-point attempts (54.9%) was the highest of his career, and overall he shot 51.8% from the field and 36.4% from long range as he made a career-best 84 3-pointers.
Whether the reported contract offer is enough to bring back Vucevic remains to be seen.
The Magic can offer Vucevic as much as a five-year, $189.7 million contract. He is eligible for a four-year, $140.6 million deal with another franchise. The Mavericks have been linked frequently to Vucevic, though reports are his asking price may be too steep for them.
Recent reports have connected Vucevic with the Celtics and Lakers, although the Celtics have been viewed as bigger player for free-agent guard Kemba Walker. If successful, that pursuit would tie up more cap space and likely take the Celtics out of contention for Vucevic.
The Lakers have a geographic connection with Vucevic, who played his college basketball at USC. Los Angeles reportedly views him as a complementary piece to recently acquired All-Star Anthony Davis.
Jeff Weltman, president of basketball operations for the Magic, repeatedly has said the team wants to bring back Vucevic, who reciprocated the desire for a reunion.
During exit interviews in April, Weltman said re-signing Vucevic was "a priority."
Last week, Weltman reiterated the desire to bring back not only Vucevic but also fellow free agents Terrence Ross and Khem Birch.
The Magic extended a qualifying offer to Birch on Tuesday, making him a restricted free agent when free agency starts Sunday. By extending an offer before June 29, the Magic can match any offer sheet Birch signs with another team.
Ross is an unrestricted free agent.
"I know that they're hopeful we can get something done, and we're hopeful that we can get something done. Now we just have to wait and see if we can get that done," Weltman said. "That's what next month is about, and we'll be aggressive and do the best that we can do."
Free agency begins at 6 p.m. Sunday, when teams can begin to negotiate with players. Contracts cannot be signed until noon July 6.

Texto completo: Here is how the candidates' remarks stacked up against the truth.
KAMALA HARRIS
and JOE BIDEN
HARRIS : "Vice President Biden, do you agree today that you were wrong to oppose busing in America, then?"
BIDEN : "I did not oppose busing in America. What I opposed is busing ordered by the Department of Education. That's what I opposed."
That's hairsplitting by Biden
Biden is claiming that he only opposed the US Education Department's push for busing to desegregate schools because he didn't want federal mandates forced on local school boards. But in the early and mid-1970s, those were the fault lines in almost every US community, from New Orleans to Boston, where there was stiff opposition to busing. If you were a politician opposing federally enforced busing, you were enabling any local school board or city government that was fighting against it. As a senator in the late 1970s, Biden supported several measures, including one signed by President Jimmy Carter, that restricted the federal government's role in forced busing.
BERNIE SANDERS
"Eighty-three percent of your tax benefits go to the top 1 percent"
That statistic is not close to true now.
The Vermont senator is referring to 2027, not the present day. He didn't include that critical context in his statement. His figures come from an analysis by the Tax Policy Center . That analysis found that in 2027 the top 1 percent of earners would get 83percent of the savings from the tax overhaul signed into law by President Donald Trump. Why is that? Simple: Most of the tax cuts for individuals are set to expire after 2025, so the benefits for everyone else simply go away. The 2017 tax overhaul does disproportionately favor the wealthy and corporations, but just 20.5 percent of the benefits went to the top 1percent last year.
MICHAEL BENNET
“Bernie mentioned the taxes that we would have to pay. Because of those taxes, Vermont rejected Medicare for all."
Mostly true.
Vermont enacted a law in 2011 to establish something close to a single-payer health care system. The plan was not rejected by voters or the legislature, but it was abandoned in 2014 by then-governor Peter Shumlin, a Democrat. He blamed the “enormous" new taxes the plan would have required, including an 11.5 percent payroll tax on all Vermont businesses and a sliding-scale income tax of up to 9.5 percent. In all, he said, the plan would require about $2.5 billion in taxes annually, in a state that raises only about $2.7 billion in taxes annually.
ANDREW YANG
“We automated away 4 million manufacturing jobs due to automation."
This is disputed.
Yang's figure likely comes from a 2015 study from Ball State University. It estimated that the United States lost 5.6 million manufacturing jobs from 2000 to 2010, about 4.9 million of which were due to increases in productivity. Other research, however, shows other factors were in play. The left-leaning Economic Policy Institute has contended that trade is the main culprit. A 2018 Bureau of Labor Statistics brief cited competition with China, a skills mismatch between employers and workers, and a decline in cross-regional migration.

Texto completo: Anna Marie Ramírez gritó: “¡Amanda, me apuñalaste!” antes de morir desangrada la madrugada del sábado en una pelea en su hogar de Nueva Jersey.
Así lo afirmó ayer el juez de la Corte Superior del Condado Camden, Edward McBride, citando la declaración de un testigo a la policía.
El testigo no identificado también escuchó a Amanda Ramírez amenazar a su gemela Anna Marie poco antes de la tragedia familiar en los apartamentos de vivienda popular “Centennial Village” en Camden, alrededor de las 5:40 a.m. del sábado, dijo McBride en la corte.
“¡Mira lo que haré!”, dijo Amanda supuestamente antes de entrar al edificio para agarrar un cuchillo de cocina grande.
El testigo, que vive en un piso superior en el mismo edificio que la familia Ramírez, escuchó la amenaza mientras observaba desde una ventana y bajó las escaleras, llegando afuera justo después de que apuñalaran a Anna Marie, señaló el juez McBride.
La poderosa evidencia fue revelada durante una audiencia en la que a Amanda le fue negada la libertad bajo fianza. Desde el sábado ha estado detenida y acusada de homicidio agravado en el asesinato de su gemela.
El fiscal Peter Gallagher también entregó ayer una foto del cuchillo que Amanda supuestamente hundió en el lado izquierdo del pecho de Anna Marie.
Amanda se echó a llorar cuando entró en la sala del tribunal y vio a casi 20 amigos y familiares, incluida su madre, sentada en la galería. La joven no habló en el tribunal y pasó la mayor parte de la sesión sollozando en la mesa de la defensa con el rostro hundido en el hombro izquierdo.
Un “triángulo amoroso” está siendo observado como el motivo de la pelea entre las hermanas, dijo su tía Blanca Class al New York Times. “Fueron a una fiesta, volvieron a casa, estaban bebiendo, discutían sobre un novio”, afirmó.
Cuando llegaron al edificio había un hombre con ellos, informó New York Post, citando una vecina menor de edad.
La acusada tiene un antecedente judicial por un caso sellado cuyos detalles no han sido difundidos. Según la policía, ha dado versiones contradictorias sobre lo sucedido el sábado, incluyendo que actuó en defensa propia porque era su hermana quien la quería apuñalar.

Marsha P. Johnson: Transgender hero of Stonewall riots finally gets her due

Autor: Brown, Dalvin.

Resumen: Marsha P. Johnson was an outspoken advocate for gay rights during the 1960s. She was also a prominent figure in the Stonewall uprising.

Texto completo: Marsha P. Johnson was not well known during her life. But in death, her legacy is stamped indelibly onto the rainbow pride flag.
The transgender activist was among a group of blacks who in the 1960s stood on the front lines of the LGBT liberation movement and is now receiving overdue credit for her trailblazing role.
Johnson, who founded one of the first organizations to protect transgender youth, was an outspoken figure in New York’s Greenwich Village.
“For so long, the role that people like Marsha played was dismissed,” says Marisa Richmond, a trans scholar who teaches history at Middle Tennessee State University. “The world is more open, welcoming and inclusive than it was 50 years ago. Her efforts helped make that happen. ”
Johnson was part of the “vanguard” that resisted police during the Stonewall riots — demonstrations that followed a raid on the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in the Village, on June 28, 1969, according to the 2010 book "Stonewall", written by LGBT historian David Carter.

At the time, New York refused to grant licenses to bars that served gays, which allowed police to enter Stonewall with a warrant. They arrested 13 people.
“The majority of people at Stonewall were either drag queens or gay men of color,” Titus Montalvo, a hairdresser and makeup artist who was 16 at the time, told USA TODAY.
The incident became a rallying cry for the nascent gay rights movement.
Many in the LGBT community credit Johnson for throwing the first brick or shot glass that sparked the riots. Johnson said she didn’t arrive at the bar until rioting was underway. Nevertheless, her role is hailed.
“There are lots of different accounts of what she did during the riots,” says Michael Boucai, associate professor of law at the University at Buffalo School of Law who studies LGBTQ rights and history. “The consensus is that she did climb a lamppost and throw a very heavy object that was in a bag and shattered a police (car) window. ”
The following year, Johnson and a close friend, Sylvia Rivera, founded the trans-youth organization STAR — Street Transvestite (now Transgender) Action Revolutionaries — that housed and fed homeless youths.
Donald Bell of Chicago, a former dean of students at several colleges, says Stonewall called attention to a group of people who lacked basic civil rights. “That’s why Marsha’s visibility and advocacy remain important,” he says. “She and a number of others who lived at the intersection between racism and homophobia were political agitators that helped advance the mindset of society. ”
Marsha P. Johnson was born Malcolm Michaels in Elizabeth, N. J. , in 1945. She said the “P” in her name stood for “Pay-it-no-mind. ”
Often draped in shimmering robes, red plastic high heels and floral headdresses, she was a muse of pop artist Andy Warhol and has been the subject of several films, including a 2017 Netflix documentary, "The Death and Life of Marsha P. Johnson. "
“When he got off the bus, everyone would notice,” says Al Michaels, Johnson’s nephew, who grew up calling Johnson “Uncle Mikey. ”
“We’d be playing football in the streets as kids,” Michaels recalls. “Soon as he turned the corner, he’d have on fruit, a big hat with flowers. ”
After Stonewall, Johnson joined the gay liberation front. In the 1980s, she became an outspoken activist with the AIDS charity ACT UP.
She died in 1992 at age 46. Her body was found in the Hudson River six days after she was reported missing. Police ruled Johnson’s death a suicide, which members of the local gay community disputed. In 2012, authorities reopened the investigation into her death, which remains unsolved, according to her nephew.
Johnson’s death attracted scant media attention at the time, but her life and contributions have been celebrated in recent years. In 2018, The New York Times published a full obituary on her significance in the LGBT liberation movement.
“The 50th anniversary of Stonewall is coming up this June. I’m hoping that this time, trans people and people of color are front and center in the local pride celebrations,” Richmond says. “After all, we were there from the very beginning. ”

Reactions to the second Democratic debate

Texto completo: The second debate for the Democratic presidential candidate has ended and many candidates had big moments throughout the night. Here's some highlights and how people reacted.
New York Times columnist Frank Bruni said that Joe Biden failed to stand out while Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg talked circles around him. He also suggested that Harris and Buttigieg might want to run together.

- "Imagine a Harris-Buttigieg ticket, and not only what a wealth of poise but what a double scoop of precedents that would be. Plenty of people on Twitter on Thursday night were doing precisely that."

Buttigieg had a number of moments that stood out to viewers. Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin congratulated Buttigieg for recognizing China as a threat to the U.S.

- https://twitter.com/joshrogin/status/1144436909306982400

Michael Knowles wrote on Fox News that Democrats so far have no real stance or leg to stand on when it comes to criticizing the Trump administration.

- "Eleven debates remain before Democrats choose their nominee. Then comes the more difficult task as they face an incumbent in a time of prosperity: finding a legitimate gripe."


Many of the candidates called for a variety of government-sponsored programs. When they were asked how they would pay for this, Harris' answer caught some people's attention.

- https://twitter.com/adamcbest/status/1144412737906327552

In one of the most tense moments during the debate, Harris brought up Biden's past of fighting busing through her own personal experience. MSNBC's Chris Matthews said it was very effective.

- https://twitter.com/MSNBC/status/1144659994815737861

One of the more chaotic moments of the debate saw nearly every candidate shouting over one another. The Daily Beast's Jackie Kucinich succinctly explained how the shouting match ended.

- https://twitter.com/JFKucinich/status/1144416112756625408

Robert Reich noted that last night's debate might be the beginning of the end of Biden's lead in the polls.

- https://twitter.com/RBReich/status/1144655996133888000

CNN contributor Scott Jennings wrote that the candidates provided ammunition to the Trump campaign.

- "Harris and the rest of her cohorts gave passionate defenses of a massive expansion of the federal government, even covering people who aren’t citizens. This sentiment will make up the core of the Republican attack over the next year and a half — they will raise your taxes to pay for stuff for other people. Period."

Texto completo: Maybe we've got weddings on our mind because it's June, but it almost feels as if L.A.'s theaters planned this week to offer something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue. Shakespeare lovers can catch "Twelfth Night" in Griffith Park. Those seeking provocative new voices and uncomfortable truths might check out "Scraps" at the Matrix. Celebration scales down "The Producers" for its intimate house, and Loft Ensemble revives the perennial chill ride "Wait Until Dark." Here's more on our selections for our weekly look at the Southern California theater scene.

'Twelfth Night' in Griffith Park

The essentials: If Shakespeare isn't being performed in a park, is it really summer? Angelenos don't have to wonder: Independent Shakespeare Co. kicks off its annual Griffith Park Free Shakespeare Festival this week with "Twelfth Night." ("Pericles" will join it in rotation starting at the end of July.)
Why this? Few pastimes are more summery than gathering on Griffith Park's Old Zoo grounds to picnic, loll on blankets and rediscover the magic of straight-up theater. Just a sunset, a stage, a really good story and a troupe of irresistibly unselfconscious extroverts to tell it. Best of all: It's free! ISC's artistic directors, David Melville and Melissa Chalsma, have added to "Twelfth Night" touches of 1930s Hollywood glamour -- "like the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers films," Melville said. Because why not?
The details: Old Zoo at Griffith Park, 4730 Crystal Springs Drive, L.A. Previews begin June 29, opening night is July 6. Performances 7 p.m. Wednesdays-Sundays through Sept. 1 (see website for exceptions). Free. (818) 710-6306, iscla.org

A Celebration of 'The Producers'
The essentials: Big Broadway musicals belong in big Broadway-style theaters, and that's just the Great White Way. Except guess what: Last year, L.A.'s itsy-bitsy Celebration Theatre subverted all expectations with its sold-out revival of "Cabaret." Now it's cramming "The Producers" onto its tiny stage, and Mel Brooks himself would be smart to buy stock.
Why this? The stage adaptation by Brooks and Thomas Meehan of the former's 1967 movie stormed Broadway in 2001. "Sublimely ridiculous," raved Ben Brantley. Few would even think of staging something so ambitious in a 99-seat house, but this creative team -- director Michael Matthews, choreographer Janet Roston and set designer Stephen Gifford among them -- dominated the L.A. Drama Critics Circle Awards last spring with their "Cabaret." Get your tickets early!
The details: "The Producers," Celebration at the Lex, 6760 Lexington Ave., L.A. Opens Saturday. Performances 8 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays, 2 p.m. Sundays, through Aug. 12. $30-$50. (323) 957-1884, celebrationtheatre.com
--
'Wait Until Dark' revived
The essentials: Lee Remick originated the role of a blind woman menaced by thugs in Frederick Knott's frequently revived 1966 thriller.
Why this? Almost 50 years old, "Wait Until Dark" has surely lost its power to terrify. Steven King himself once described the 1967 film version with Audrey Hepburn as "the scariest movie of all time," but he's a notorious fraidy cat. Sophisticates such as you and I could eat a slow-burn suspense story of this vintage for breakfast. So there's no reason not to see this revival. Unless, of course, you're too scared?
The details: "Wait Until Dark," Loft Ensemble, 11031 Camarillo St., North Hollywood. 8 p.m. Saturdays, 7 p.m. Sundays, through July 28. $20. (818) 452-3153, loftensemble.org
--
'Scraps' at Matrix Theatre
The essentials: In a review of "Scraps," the New York Times called Geraldine Inoa (also a writer for AMC's "The Walking Dead") a "playwright to watch." Set in Brooklyn after a young black man has been fatally shot by a white cop, "Scraps" explores the grief of his loved ones in a "provocative mashup of poetry, realism and expressionism."
Why this? "At first glance, the story sounds very familiar," says Matrix Theatre Company artistic director Joseph Stern, "but I've never seen anything like it."
Openly addressing racism in our culture -- the explicit focus of programming at the Matrix since 2009 -- can make people uncomfortable, but as Inoa points out: "If we continue to only engage in surface-level conversations about race that prevent us from feeling uncomfortable, we are only asking for things to stay the same."
The details: Matrix Theatre, 7657 Melrose Ave., L.A. Opens July 6. Performances 8 p.m. Saturdays, 3 p.m. Sundays, 8 p.m. Mondays, through Sept. 15. $35; Mondays are pay what you want. (323) 960-or matrixtheatre.com

Acclaimed filmmaker Suzan Pitt dies

Texto completo: Acclaimed filmmaker Suzan Pitt died June 17 at her home in Taos, according to her daughter-in-law Laura Kraning, The New York Times reported Friday (June 21). She was 75. Her cause of death was stated to be pancreatic cancer.
In a story published in November 2018, Tempo writer Dena Miller said Pitt was caught by surprise when named the AnimaFest Lifetime Achievement Award winner of the 29th World Festival of Animated Film on October 29.
"I didn't know I was under consideration, and first heard of my receiving the award when it was announced. But of course I'm thrilled to receive the honor," Pitt said.
AnimaFest, the second oldest film festival devoted exclusively to the art of animation, selected Pitt by unanimous decision and said of her in their announcement, "By collaging narratives from smaller segments, she creates dramaturgic suspense, at the same time questioning the possibilities of cinematic structure, penetration into the work, the spectator position."
"In a diverse group of experimental short films like 'Asparagus,' 'Joy Street' and 'El Doctor,' Ms. Pitt pursued an idiosyncratic vision influenced by Surrealist artists like Leonora Carrington, the pioneering animator Max Fleischer's cartoons (notably with Betty Boop), underground comics and, most of all, her interior world," The Times stated.
"She put her undiluted, unadulterated, uncensored dreams on the screen," John Canemaker, an Academy Award-winning animator, said in a phone interview for The Times story.
Notably, Pitt's animation was done without computer. Each frame was hand-painted and drawn, and 12 different images were required for every second of film. Each project required years of planning, storyboarding and experimentation, helped by a team of artists paid through grants. Pitt never had the backing of a major studio.
"She entered the animation world through painting, combining painting techniques, her love of flora and fauna with hallucinatory pop-worlds and Mexico as the eternal source of inspiration, reflecting on the social issues she encounters," a statement on the Animafest website ( suzanpitt.com/news-main/animafest-zagreb-lifetime-achievement-award ) stated. "By collaging narratives from smaller segments, she creates dramaturgic suspense, at the same time questioning the possibilities of cinematic structure, penetration into the work, the spectator position. She has skillfully tried her hand at very different media, crossing thresholds, boundaries and walls between mural painting, fashion design, animation, video set design for operas and gallery spaces."
Pitt graduated in 1965 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from Michigan's Cranbrook Academy of Arts, renowned as the cradle of American modernism. She majored in painting and held a minor in printmaking. "It wasn't until 1968 that I even imagined a vocation in experimental animation," she told Tempo.
"It wasn't anything I set out to study. I was never a student of film and was just beginning to appreciate [the genre's] inherent movement," which made her look at her canvases with a different eye. "What if I moved the subject this way or that? Then, I've created action and the passage of time." By the early 1970s she was experimenting with 8mm and, subsequently, 35mm film.
Her proficiency in traditional, nondigitalized processes and an unerring selection of materials with which to create her imagery is what has elevated Pitt in the field. Vibrant, saturated acrylic paints play with ink, chalk, sand and a myriad of techniques to create a world that is founded in what she called her "interior imagining."
"Pitt was also known for the fashionable hand-painted coats she created (and sold), using images from her films and popular culture," The Times wrote. "And her animation film work was used in the set designs of two operas, Mozart's 'The Magic Flute' and Berlioz's 'The Damnation of Faust,' both staged in West Germany in the 1980s."
She also received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2000, and taught animation at Harvard and the California Institute of the Arts in Santa Clarita.
In 2017, the Museum of Modern Art in New York presented five of her restored films, continuing a relationship with her that began in 1979 with a showing of "Asparagus." Josh Siegel, a film curator at MoMA, said in a Times phone interview that Pitt had thrived as an independent filmmaker "entirely because of her singular vision, her sense of humor and her wicked, subversive aesthetic."
Pitt is survived by her son Blue Kraning, her sister, Melinda Carlton, and her brother, John. Her marriage to Alan Kraning ended in divorce. For more information about this artist, visit suzanpitt.com .

Sports figures vs. reporters: Top confrontations, from Billy Martin to Russell Westbrook

Resumen: The Mets' Mickey Callaway and Jason Vargas are the latest sports figures to take their anger out on reporters. We look back at other top feuds.

Texto completo: The media and professional athletes have always had a tenuous relationship. Occasionally when things aren't going well for a player or a team, the media can be a convenient outlet for anger and frustration.
As the saying goes, "familiarity breeds contempt. "
That's one explanation for the recent confrontation New York Mets manager Mickey Callaway and pitcher Jason Vargas had with Newsday beat reporter Tim Healey.
Callaway eventually apologized for his expletive-filled tirade. He and Vargas, who threatened to "knock out" Healey and had to be held back by teammates, have also been fined.
But in the annals of athlete-manager-reporter confrontations, this one was tame compared to some other memorable ones.
Billy Martin punches reporter, 1978
Martin, the legendary New York Yankees manager, could be just as combative off the field as on it. One November night in Reno, Nevada, Martin -- who had been fired earlier that season by owner George Steinbrenner -- punched a local reporter in the face.
According to The New York Times, Martin said he did it because Ray Hagar of the Reno Evening Gazette "challenged me to fight” during an interview.
Not surprisingly, Hagar remembered things differently: “He said that writers always twist things he said. He saw me writing things down and he wanted to see my notes,” Hagar said. The reporter suffered a gash above his eye and at least three chipped teeth.
“He hit me before I knew it," Hagar said. "I didn't even get a punch in. ”
Oddly, Callaway used Martin as an example to explain his own behavior.
Will McDonough slugs Pats DB, 1979
McDonough, the former Boston Globe writer, had a history of being tough with his words. He backed it up by his actions in the New England Patriots' locker room after a game against the New York Jets.
Defensive back Raymond Clayborn was in no mood to celebrate the 56-3 win, purposely bumping into reporters who came near him. According to Bruce Allen of Boston Sports Media Watch, McDonough took the future Pro Bowler to task, saying, "Hey Ray, there's no need to do that. "
Clayborn stuck a finger in the reporter's face and poked him in the eye. So McDonough stepped back and unloaded a three-punch combination that, according to some, knocked Clayborn to the ground.
Hal McRae throws desk phone, 1993
The former Kansas City Royals star returned to manage his old team in 1991, but his tenure ended four short years later with the team never finishing higher than third place. Early in his third season, the Royals had just suffered a disappointing loss to the Detroit Tigers, dropping their record to 7-12.
After the game, one of the reporters assembled in McRae's office asked whether he had considered using George Brett -- who was 40 at the time and in the final season of his career -- as a pinch-hitter in a bases-loaded situation in the seventh inning.
That sent McRae on an epic tirade. It began with him calling it a "stupid (expletive) question" and led to him throwing several objects from his desk -- including a corded phone.
One of the objects McRae threw -- believed to be a tape recorder -- struck reporter Alan Eskew of the Topeka Capital-Journal on the side of his face. There was even some blood.
After kicking everyone out of his office, McRae came back out with a few more choice words, including his memorable parting shot: "Put that in your (expletive) pipe and smoke it!"
Jim Everett sacks Jim Rome, 1994
This one was pretty simple -- and likely planned to some degree in advance.
Sportscaster and talk-show host Jim Rome was just starting to build a name for himself nationally when he invited then-New Orleans Saints quarterback Jim Everett on his ESPN2 show, "Talk 2. "
Rome had been critical of Everett's injuries, often questioning his toughness by calling him "Chris" -- a reference to tennis star Chris Evert. The quarterback didn't appreciate the insinuation, which seems even more juvenile 25 years later.
When the two sat down to do the live interview, Everett warned Rome not to say it to his face. Rome did . . . so Everett flipped over a table between them and tackled the host.
Everett later explained in a teleconference: "I really don't condone my actions, but I was put in a position that I thought was going to be in a journalistic-type interview, and instead, I was put into what I felt was a taunting attack. I don't regret what I did. "
Ryan Leaf melts down, 1998
After a particularly bad game -- even by his standards -- San Diego Chargers quarterback Ryan Leaf just couldn't contain his emotions. The rookie had completed just one of 14 passes for four yards with two interceptions and three lost fumbles. He yelled at a TV cameraman after the game, but that was only the beginning.
The next day in the Chargers' locker room, he singled out reporter Jay Posner of the San Diego Union-Tribune, apparently for writing about the confrontation with the cameraman.
"Don't talk to me, all right? Knock it off!" Leaf screamed before he was restrained by Chargers linebacker Junior Seau.
That incident got Leaf even more negative publicity when it was caught on video and shown on national television.
He later issued a televised apology, after which he crumpled up the paper he was reading and threw it in his locker.
Russell Westbrook's boycott, 2015-
Generally, an athlete-reporter beef stems from a particular incident and is only temporary before one or the other moves on -- either emotionally or physically.
However, the Oklahoma City Thunder guard has held a grudge against columnist Berry Tramel of The Oklahoman for years, refusing to answer his questions or, at most, giving short, one-sentence answers.
Why?
"I just don't like you," Westbrook said after a game in early 2015.
That's about as much insight as Westbrook has shed on the situation -- although Tramel told the Hoops Hype podcast in April he didn't take the insult personally; he felt Westbrook was addressing the media in general.
Nevertheless, the relationship between the two has only gotten worse. Westbrook frequently says, "Next question" whenever Tramel asks him anything in a news conference.
Yet Tramel keeps asking, as he wrote in a recent column, "because the media shouldn’t give in to Westbrook’s desire to control everything. "
Unlike other high-profile confrontations, there's been nothing physical between these two . . . but then again, this feud has lasted far longer.

No more ‘poverty naps’ on campus

Texto completo: When college students return to their campuses in the fall, many will face a growing problem that threatens to undermine their chances for success. Hunger. Recent surveys agree that more than one-third of all college students suffer at times from bouts of food insecurity. The rate is far higher for students with an extra risk factor: belonging to a racial minority, having a single parent or being the first in their family to attend college, for example.
A New York Times report on local campuses told these stories: "A senior at Lehman College in the Bronx dreams of starting her day with breakfast. An undergraduate at New York University said he has been so delirious from hunger he’s caught himself walking down the street not realizing where he’s going. A health sciences student at Stony Brook University on Long Island describes ‘poverty naps,’ where she decides to go to sleep rather than deal with her hunger pangs."
In one sense, the problem reflects good news: the growing diversity of student bodies, from both racial and socioeconomic perspectives. A recent study by the Government Accountability Office says only 29% of those now in college are "traditional students," who enroll right out of high school and depend on their parents for support. The rest, especially in community colleges, can be older, and financially fragile — often with children of their own. But federal aid programs have not kept up with this changing profile and rising need. Forty years ago, Pell grants, the main source of public support for needy students, covered half the average cost at two-year colleges and 39% at public four-year colleges. Today, according to statistics from the Department of Education, those rates have dropped to 37% at community schools and 19% at bigger universities.
The result could be called the "hunger gap," which Steve sees firsthand at George Washington University, where he has taught for almost 30 years. The way the federal government calculates a student’s annual need is woefully inadequate, and even students with "full rides" can have trouble affording full meals.
One answer is a rapid expansion of campus-based food banks. Many campuses have tried other innovations. Programs called Share Meals and Swipe Out Hunger enable students to donate their unused dining hall credits to hungry classmates. There are more. One critical change would involve SNAP, the federal nutrition program once known as food stamps. Its rules regarding student eligibility remain highly restrictive and confusing, and the GAO reports that about 2 million students who could have qualified for aid in 2017 did not receive it.
Simplifying the rules and extending eligibility to more students makes total sense. But the Trump administration is actually trying to reduce the program and eliminate recipients, even as the need continues to grow. That’s both profoundly immoral and utterly counterproductive. Programs to combat hunger easily pay for themselves: Students who don’t have to worry about food do better in school, graduate at higher rates and are more likely to become productive, taxpaying citizens.
The public policy goal should be completely clear and compelling: No more growling stomachs in classrooms. No more "poverty naps" instead of lunch.

Texto completo: When college students return to their campuses in the fall, many will face a growing problem that threatens to undermine their chances for success. Hunger. Recent surveys agree that more than one-third of all college students suffer at times from bouts of food insecurity. The rate is far higher for students with an extra risk factor: belonging to a racial minority, having a single parent or being the first in their family to attend college, for example.
A New York Times report on local campuses told these stories: "A senior at Lehman College in the Bronx dreams of starting her day with breakfast. An undergraduate at New York University said he has been so delirious from hunger he’s caught himself walking down the street not realizing where he’s going. A health sciences student at Stony Brook University on Long Island describes ‘poverty naps,’ where she decides to go to sleep rather than deal with her hunger pangs."
In one sense, the problem reflects good news: the growing diversity of student bodies, from both racial and socioeconomic perspectives. A recent study by the Government Accountability Office says only 29% of those now in college are "traditional students," who enroll right out of high school and depend on their parents for support. The rest, especially in community colleges, can be older, and financially fragile — often with children of their own. But federal aid programs have not kept up with this changing profile and rising need. Forty years ago, Pell grants, the main source of public support for needy students, covered half the average cost at two-year colleges and 39% at public four-year colleges. Today, according to statistics from the Department of Education, those rates have dropped to 37% at community schools and 19% at bigger universities.
The result could be called the "hunger gap," which Steve sees firsthand at George Washington University, where he has taught for almost 30 years. The way the federal government calculates a student’s annual need is woefully inadequate, and even students with "full rides" can have trouble affording full meals.
One answer is a rapid expansion of campus-based food banks. Many campuses have tried other innovations. Programs called Share Meals and Swipe Out Hunger enable students to donate their unused dining hall credits to hungry classmates. There are more. One critical change would involve SNAP, the federal nutrition program once known as food stamps. Its rules regarding student eligibility remain highly restrictive and confusing, and the GAO reports that about 2 million students who could have qualified for aid in 2017 did not receive it.
Simplifying the rules and extending eligibility to more students makes total sense. But the Trump administration is actually trying to reduce the program and eliminate recipients, even as the need continues to grow. That’s both profoundly immoral and utterly counterproductive. Programs to combat hunger easily pay for themselves: Students who don’t have to worry about food do better in school, graduate at higher rates and are more likely to become productive, taxpaying citizens.
The public policy goal should be completely clear and compelling: No more growling stomachs in classrooms. No more "poverty naps" instead of lunch.

Texto completo: 'Fleishman Is in Trouble'
By Taffy Brodesser-Akner, Random House, 384 pages, $27
Believe the hype. "Fleishman Is in Trouble" is even better than we were promised. Taffy Brodesser-Akner, a New York Times Magazine writer, brings to her first novel the currency of a hot dating app and the wisdom of a Greek tragedy. The result is a feminist jeremiad nested inside a brilliant comic novel -- a book that makes you laugh so hard you don't notice till later that your eyebrows have been singed off.
As the story opens, life sounds like an erotic carnival for Toby Fleishman. A New York doctor newly separated from his wife, Toby has arrived at the age of 41 to discover a city suddenly flush with women who want him. Now. "His phone was aglow from sunup to sundown," the narrator writes, with texts that contained "underboob and sideboob and just straight up boob and all the parts of a woman he never dared dream he would encounter."
Brodesser-Akner demonstrates an anthropologist's thoroughness in her study of contemporary adult dating and its catalog of sexual practices, but her prose, ringing with manic energy, is obscenely funny.
Poor Toby is thrust into a state of constant arousal, punctuated by moments of deep confusion about his impending divorce from a successful talent agent. What should he reveal to his colleagues about the dissolution of his marriage? And most baffling, what should he tell his son and daughter, who find themselves suspended between two homes?
Perhaps every engaged couple should read this book before they tie the knot. With merciless precision, Brodesser-Akner traces the arcing trajectory of doomed affections: the glorious takeoff, the deluded calm, the shrieking descent.
Much of the first section of the novel follows Toby's frantic efforts to sleep with as many women as he can, while locking down a big promotion at the hospital and taking care of his children. You see, Fleishman is in trouble. His estranged wife, Rachel, has stopped returning his calls. She's no longer picking up the kids. Toby doesn't even know where she is. It's just her latest infuriatingly selfish stunt -- or at least Toby would have us believe as he recalls one example after another of her lack of affection, her disregard for how much he does to keep their family humming.
So far, so John Updike. But there's something wonderfully contrary going on here.
This entire story is told by Toby's old friend, Libby Epstein. So expansive and intimate is her knowledge of Toby's experience that it's easy to imagine we're hearing the voice of an omniscient narrator. It turns out that, like Brodesser-Akner herself, Libby used to be a writer for a men's magazine, and she's most comfortable expressing herself in expansive profiles of other people. The further we read into this tale of Toby's marital discord, the more we realize that Libby is trying to work out something about her own existential plight.
That becomes more explicit in the novel's final section. Libby's sympathies -- and ours -- are suddenly unmoored in the conflicting currents of love and resentment. Perhaps Toby is not the long-suffering saint he imagines himself to be. When Libby finally comes out from the margins of this story, she uses Rachel to offer a sustained reflection on the impossible pressures that talented women endure.
I haven't felt this much energy sparking off a novel since Claire Messud's "The Woman Upstairs." Here, in one gut-punching paragraph after another, is the articulate fury of someone who once dared to imagine that her ambition could be expressed and appreciated. Only too late does Rachel realize that "her success made her poison." She's ripped apart by the demands of full-time motherhood and the new requirements of full-time work.
But Brodesser-Akner swings the sword full circle, slicing through the demeaning rules of the patriarchy just as effectively as she slays the fatuous optimism of that "girl-power" propaganda fed to modern girls.
Conveying the full tragedy of that predicament in a story that's often blisteringly funny is the real triumph of this book. Few novels express so clearly that we're all in trouble.

Not everybody supporting US women's team

Texto completo: With Spain in the rearview mirror and France on the horizon, most American sports fans and others who are paying attention are all on board as the U.S. women's national soccer team continues its quest to win its fourth World Cup.
Most, but not all. There's one fellow in particular who is sounding rather grumpy about the red, white and blue.
Oddly, it's the U.S. president.
Donald Trump unleashed a rambling tweetstorm against co-captain Megan Rapinoe Wednesday morning just two days after he was asked in an interview with The Hill political website if her choice to stand at attention with her hands clasped behind her and not sing the national anthem during the World Cup is appropriate.
Trump's reply: "No. I don't think so."
Wait. What? That's not appropriate anymore? I was always taught that was a perfect way to honor the flag, the anthem and the country. I wasn't a good singer, but I certainly knew how to stand ramrod straight and be silent. Apparently, we have all new rules now, people.
Rapinoe, who knelt during the national anthem nearly three years ago as a gesture of solidarity with Colin Kaepernick, and who has spoken eloquently about the serious issues facing this country, is not kneeling now. Her choice to stand silently during the playing of "The Star-Spangled Banner" means that she is far more respectful of the anthem and the flag than the thousands of people at sporting events every year who walk the concourse or talk while in line for beers or otherwise don't stand still or have any notion about what's going on.
When the reporter asked Trump about Rapinoe, he could have brushed off the question. He did not. No, he willingly inserted himself into the conversation about this World Cup. He probably couldn't stand that the openly gay Rapinoe, like millions of other Americans, has been critical of him, calling herself a "walking protest" of Trump's policies. So he just had to say something negative about the woman who scored both goals on penalty kicks in the tense 2-1 U.S. victory over Spain Monday, the woman who is the toast of the town, and the nation.
Trump also was asked about the U.S. team's gender discrimination lawsuit against its national governing body, U.S. Soccer, but suggested he didn't have enough knowledge about the issue to take a position.
"I love watching women's soccer," he said. "They're really talented. I think a lot of it also has to do with the economics. I mean who draws more, where is the money coming in. I know that when you have the great stars like (Portugal's Cristiano) Ronaldo and some of these stars … that get paid a lot of money, but they draw hundreds of thousands of people. But I haven't taken a position on that at all. I'd have to look at it."
Of all the names Trump could have pulled out of the air to illustrate a point that gets harder to make every day with the financial success of the U.S. women's team, he chose a Portuguese man, not an American -- and a man who is facing an allegation of sexual assault and a federal lawsuit stemming from a 2009 incident in Las Vegas. How big of a deal is this allegation? The New York Times reported that Juventus, the Italian soccer league team for whom Ronaldo plays, wouldn't participate in a tournament in the United States this summer to avoid the risk that Ronaldo would be detained by authorities as part of the rape investigation.
Wouldn't you know that it would be his name that Trump would mention for a comparison with the most beloved U.S. national team, male or female, in any sport over the past 20 years? In a week when the nation is cheering on Rapinoe and her teammates, he's name-dropping Ronaldo. Somehow, that makes perfect sense.

Texto completo: What to Look For on the Candidates at Tonight's Debate
By Vanessa Friedman
______
As 20 of the Democrats vying for the party's presidential nomination take to the stage for the first debates of the primary season on Wednesday and Thursday, it is critical, sayeth the pundits, that each one maximizes his or her impact and stands out from the crowd.
But how much standing out can occur when the rules dictate 60 seconds of response time per candidate and 30 seconds of follow-up, meaning each will have, at most, six to 10 minutes, total, to make a case? It's hard to imagine.
Until you consider that each candidate will be onstage for another 110 minutes -- albeit silently. And in that silence lies a whole other communication opportunity.
"When I do media training, I always tell my clients 10 percent of how you are received is what you actually said," said Hilary Rosen, a Democratic strategist and media consultant with SKDKnickerbocker. "Fifteen percent is how you said what you said, and 75 percent is how you appear."
Or rather: how you can influence opinion through image making. These are televised debates, after all, and there's a reason we in the audience are called "viewers."
"If you are a strategist for one of the top-tier or second-tier candidates, you are thinking through every element of presentation, whether it's tie color, lapel pin or expression," said Jen Psaki, a White House communications director in the Obama administration. "And you are doing it with the knowledge that a big part of the way voters make decisions is based on the visual representation the candidate projects."
Thanks to both the Trump-driven mediagenics of this particular political moment, when going viral is as crucial as going door to door, and the crowded field, the need to make yourself memorable, and imprint your likeness on the retinas of the electorate, has become a campaign imperative. No matter what gender the candidate.
"Men have just as much of a challenge as women," Ms. Rosen said, pointing out that President Trump understands this implicitly. "He got the last laugh with his hair. And his long tie. He crafted a look, and it helped him stand out."
To compete, his rivals will have to engage in the same way. "In the back of everyone's mind will be, 'How will that person look on a debate stage with Donald Trump?"' Ms. Rosen said.
A few of those running seem to have grasped this reality more firmly than others. Indeed, a handful of the candidates have been relentlessly consistent in defining their own image.
Some of that can be attributed to what Ms. Rosen calls the "Steve Jobs rationale" -- reducing both packing and the daily decision-making process of getting dressed frees up brain space for other issues -- and some to the desire for keeping clothes from being a subject of conversation. (If you wear the same thing all the time, you don't leave people much to say.)
But it also has the subconscious effect of essentially creating an emoji for the self, a visual shorthand for values and platforms in a time when -- bemoan it or not -- we increasingly communicate in pictogram shorthand.
There's no question that on the debate stage decorum dictates that most participants will play it safe in the classic suit and tie (if relevant). But details matter, and certain precedents have been set.
So, which candidates speak the most clearly when they are not saying anything at all?
______
Pete Buttigieg
The 37-year-old mayor from South Bend, Ind., has been a savant at using his costume to frame his communications. Relentless in his allegiance to a pristine white shirt, pressed navy dress slacks and a narrow marine blue tie, almost always sans suit jacket, he manages to look Just Like Us (or at least just like the guy from the J. Crew catalog everyone gets).
At the same time, however, he also looks like a one-off in his focus and decision-making capability. (How many of us have the discipline to wear the same thing every single day?)
It is notable that unlike many of his generation, who eschew the tie when attempting to differentiate themselves from their forebears, he has chosen to drop the jacket. That, along with the tie width, give him new-gen cred to go with his new-gen pitch.
But the fact that he still wears a tie, plus at least half of a suit, suggests respect for the establishment's traditions, and reassures more conservative voters that the first major gay presidential candidate is not so different from them after all. The color scheme implies blue sky thinking, and the net effect is Boy Scout next door, which, if you are trying to convince older voters of your seriousness of purpose, is badge worthy.
"It's about consistency," said Lyn Paolo, a costume designer who worked on "Scandal" and "The West Wing." If you are consistent, people get an image of you in their heads, and you have carved out a specific space."
"I use the Halloween rule: Could someone be dressed for Halloween as this candidate and be immediately recognizable?" she said. For Mr. Buttigieg, the answer is yes.
______
Elizabeth Warren
Along with Mayor Pete, Senator Warren is the candidate with the most clarity in her wardrobe. She has a plan for it! Well, duh.
Her uniform is black pants -- "You get the sense she probably has 20 of the same pair of black pants," Ms. Paolo said -- and a black shell with any one of a number of jewel-tone jackets with three-quarter-length sleeves and small lapels. Stud earrings are her only adornment.
Off the stump she often swaps a cardigan for the jacket, but the sleeves are pushed up, in the equivalent of the rolling-up-one's-sleeves-and-getting-to-work visual favored by many male candidates, and the silhouette is broadly the same.
It is a highly economic way of dressing: streamlined but easily noticeable; unostentatious but animated; thoroughly parsed. Sound familiar?
______
Joe Biden
With his gleaming white teeth and gleaming slicked-back white hair, his many striped shirts and ties and his aviator shades, the former vice president has a D.C. Top Gun-meets-power-casual-club cool that suggests exactly his selling point: He's the one who can compete with the guy in office.
Mr. Biden is one of the few candidates who still hews to the flag-pin-on-his-lapel, once considered a de rigueur accessory to demonstrate patriotism but now perhaps a relic of an older generation. (If you're too cool for a jacket, after all, you can't wear a lapel pin.)
It's a choice that can work both for and against him. It signals his experience (plus!) but also his long time in Washington (er ...), which also suggests his long record of photo ops, which mimics his long record of evolved thinking on various issues.
And speaking of those photo ops, they have given rise to some speculation over the years about certain evolutions in his appearance: that his hair looks fuller, his teeth straighter, his forehead less lined. Maybe it's the lighting, maybe not, but this could take the conversation in a distracting direction.
______
Beto O'Rourke
A former congressman from Texas, Mr. O'Rourke is one of the rare candidates to have undergone something of a style about-face since announcing his candidacy.
The Beto of the early days, which was the Beto of the now notorious Vanity Fair cover, the Beto of the dusty road; the questing, existential Beto; the Beto of the people, who was willing to sweat for it and loved jumping on a table -- that Beto is gone, victim of the "I was made for this" backlash.
Instead we now have besuited Beto, serious Beto, ready-to-lead Beto and buttoned-up Beto, the better to go with the policy-issuing Beto.
"I guess someone sat him down and told him to get serious," Ms. Paolo said. "But he owned a look, and it's like he let someone talk him out of it." This is the kind of style flip-flop that once got Hillary Clinton in trouble, and Mr. O'Rourke's renunciation of his former dude-next-door affectation risks making him seem less authentic and trustworthy; less like an outsider than someone who once pretended to be an outsider.
"You have to be careful not to take away the magic that brought him onto the national scene in the first place," Ms. Psaki said.
______
Kamala Harris
The only woman in the field to adopt a signature accessory, the senator from California wears a strand of pearls (sometimes a double strand) at practically every appearance. She has them in white and black and pairs them with matching studs, along with a scoop-neck white or black shell, a long black jacket and a matching skirt or trousers.
The pearls soften what could be seen be an intimidating image honed over her years as a prosecutor and embodied by the no-nonsense suiting, and they connect Senator Harris to a long history of women in the White House.
That those women, from Martha Washington to Barbara Bush to Michelle Obama, happen to have been first ladies rather than presidents can be seen as a subtle reminder of how far we've come -- the way the arc of history could bend toward progress -- or a miscue.
"Maybe they're her lucky pearls," Ms. Psaki said. "The one thing about accessories like that is that there are always stories to them." Perhaps this is one worth telling.
______
Bernie Sanders
Less rumpled than he was in his 2016 bid for executive office, when his trademark messy look became a symbol of his passionate focus on upending the status quo, Senator Sanders is nevertheless still notably more mussed up than the rest of the field.
Whether it's a tie knot pulled slightly askew, a collar that somehow looks less buttoned down than bunched up, or various strands of hair that cannot be contained, he is the only candidate who dresses as though he hasn't thought at all about what he is wearing -- because, natch, he is too busy thinking about universal Medicare. Which is itself a carefully thought-through meme.
"It works for him," said Kemal Harris, a former costume designer for Robin Wright in "House of Cards." "There's a fine balance between looking your best and being believable." Sometimes the first has to be sacrificed to the latter.
______
Kirsten Gillibrand
The senator from New York tends toward dark colors (black, navy, the occasional royal blue) and short-sleeve sheath dresses as seen when she announced her candidacy on "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert," when she appeared on "The Daily Show With Trevor Noah," when she was on "The View" -- and, well, most any time she is making a statement.
Though Senator Gillibrand made pink the highlight color for her campaign to underscore her position as a champion of women's issues, she has avoided incorporating it into her wardrobe. Instead her dresses support her platform with a tailored militant femininity (and the occasional kick pleat), to go with her ramrod-straight bob.
"It's very on-brand," Ms. Harris said.
______
Cory Booker
Though the New Jersey senator famously underwent something of a makeover when he became mayor of Newark, excising pleated pants and working on his tie knots, he is thus far the only candidate who has committed a real fashion faux pas, pairing a red fleece vest with a short-sleeve shirt and oversize jeans a few years ago and still getting roundly roasted for it on Twitter.
But given his high-gloss persona, helped by his relationship with the movie star Rosario Dawson, and his high-gloss head, it served to humanize him (especially when he joined the chorus and poked fun at himself).
Senator Booker has been the most relaxed and communicative of the group about his clothing, much as he was one of the first to embrace the selfie trend, the better to model that elusive quality he is sometimes accused of lacking: "authenticity."
The question now is whether he can distinguish himself further -- also an issue for Amy Klobuchar, whose "senator next door" (to quote her book title) ethos, as expressed in her boxy, bright jackets and patterned scarves, skews more than any other candidate toward the Hillary Clinton continuum.
THEY MIGHT TAKE a cue from Andrew Yang, who has been a dedicated model of tech entrepreneur-meets-business-casual style -- open-collar shirt, jacket, his own campaign pin on his lapel -- an implicit reminder of his outsider status and past start-up success. Ditto the stars-and-stripes scarf he likes to wear. (Don't just adopt the old lapel pin. Reinvent it!) Just as he wants to reinvent financial security with his "freedom dividend" $ 1,000-a-month check to every American.
As for those farther on the edges of the debate stage, a few are edging toward establishing their own points of difference, though they haven't entirely followed through on the commitment.
There is John Hickenlooper, the former Colorado governor, with his Western hip folksiness and affinity for Mr. Rogers-esque V-neck sweaters; Jay Inslee, the governor of Washington, who can often be seen in that rarity, a green tie, presumably to go with his green agenda; and Julián Castro, the former secretary of Housing and Urban Development, playing it very traditional in red ties and navy suitThen there are Marianne Williamson (the self-help guru), Eric Swalwell (California congressman), Michael Bennet (Colorado senator), Tulsi Gabbard (congresswoman from Hawaii), Tim Ryan (congressman from Ohio) and John Delaney (former Maryland congressman), all of whom have yet to really employ the tools of visual argument to advance their respective cases.
Not to mention the New York mayor, Bill de Blasio, though he has one singular advantage, according to Ms. Rosen. He sticks out simply because he's very tall.

Texto completo: DAKAR, Senegal -- Gambia's attorney general on Wednesday called a onetime beauty queen "brave" for coming forward with accusations that the country's former president raped her, and asked others to speak out if they had similar accusations about events that occurred during his 22-year regime.
Fatou Jallow, who won the national beauty pageant in 2014, said President Yahya Jammeh raped her after she turned down his marriage proposal. She spoke about the assault for the first time to The New York Times in an article published Tuesday.
The accusations by Ms. Jallow, known as Toufah, jolted the country of two million and were widely shared on social media by Gambians and those in the diaspora. Mr. Jammeh could not be reached for comment through intermediaries known to be in touch with him and has issued no official response.
"The attorney general salutes the courage of Ms. Jallow for speaking up and sharing her story with the world," Abubacarr M. Tambadou, Gambia's attorney general and minister of justice, said in a news release, "and for exposing yet another serious allegation of reprehensible conduct by former President Jammeh, who abused his position as head of state to the detriment of many Gambians."
Mr. Jammeh lost a 2016 election but refused to step down for weeks until regional leaders negotiated his safe flight to exile in Equatorial Guinea, where he remains. He has yet to face consequences for widespread accusations of murders, beatings, unjustified imprisonments, threats to behead homosexuals and literal witch hunts.
On Wednesday, Mr. Tambadou cited the report in The Times and said Ms. Jallow, who was 18 at the time of the alleged rape, was "a young and brave girl." He called on other women to come forward about experiences with Mr. Jammeh "in any manner they see fit," including in testimony before the nation's Truth and Reconciliation and Reparations Commission set up to air crimes under the former regime.
"It is only through speaking up and exposing such despicable acts, especially by those in positions of power, can we effectively combat the scourge and menace of sexual violence against women and girls in our society," Mr. Tambadou said.
Gambia's truth commission will hear testimony later this year from women who say they were sexually abused after being arrested or who faced economic hardship while their husbands were imprisoned or when they disappeared after being arrested. Ms. Jallow, who received asylum in Canada in 2015, is scheduled to testify.
The commission will hear testimony for another 18 months before deciding whether to refer cases for prosecution.
Its hearings have offered gripping viewing for a nation bent on reconciling with its past. Hearings are live-streamed on the internet, and tens of thousands of Gambians tune in.
On Wednesday, Yankuba Touray, a former military officer who helped bring Mr. Jammeh to power during a 1994 coup, showed up at a hearing but refused to testify, citing "constitutional immunity" and causing a ruckus in the commission's hearing room.
Mr. Touray, who has been accused of rape, torture and murder, was immediately arrested. He had been out on bail since an earlier arrest in March, when he was accused of interfering with witnesses who were scheduled to testify before the commission.
A group of lawyers from Human Rights Watch and Trial International are pushing for Mr. Jammeh to face criminal charges in court, a move complicated by the fact that he is being sheltered by the authoritarian regime in Equatorial Guinea, home to Africa's longest-serving president. Its leaders have been accused of misusing the country's oil revenue for their own gain and have a reputation for emerging unscathed from various legal actions taken against them.
For instance, Teodorin Nguema Obiang, vice president of Equatorial Guinea and son of the president, was convicted of embezzlement in absentia in a Paris court two years ago. He resolved United States Justice Department charges for using public funds for private gain by selling his Ferrari, a mansion in Malibu and Michael Jackson memorabilia.
Last year, Brazil seized $ 16 million in cash and watches from his delegation when he arrived at an airport there.
Yet Mr. Obiang's Instagram account is filled with images of him aboard luxury yachts, on a safari, riding a beach cruiser down a coastal bike path, and being entertained by hip-hop stars at lavish parties. Some show Mr. Jammeh as among the guests.
Seeing those images has been galling, Ms. Jallow said in an interview.
"I know what I had to go through -- the shame, the healing, the trauma," she said.
At the same time, she said, the images helped her gather courage to go public with her claims. "I want him to hear the story from me," she said.

A graphic photo gives the press pause

Texto completo: Mainstream news organizations are reluctant to show images of the dead. Whether it's the victims of accidents, mass shootings, natural disasters, terrorism or military conflict, photos and videos of lifeless bodies rarely are published. Rarer still are those involving children.
On Tuesday, there was a striking exception.
Media outlets around the world published a now-iconic photo of the bodies of Óscar Alberto Martínez Ramírez and his 23-month-old daughter, Valeria, washed up in the shallows of the Rio Grande near Matamoros, Mexico. The Salvadoran man and his daughter drowned Sunday in an attempt to migrate to the United States.
The searing image seemed to capture the heartbreak, desperation and danger of immigrants fleeing their countries. In the photo, Valeria's tiny arm is flung across her father's neck in a haunting embrace, her body tucked inside his T-shirt. Both are face down in the muddy brown river water.
The photo was taken by Julia Le Duc, a journalist with the Mexican newspaper La Jornada, which published it Monday morning. It gained international attention on Tuesday after it was distributed by the Associated Press, which provides news and photos to thousands of newspapers, broadcast stations and online publications.
The image quickly began appearing - to a shocked reaction - online and on some TV networks and stations. On CNN on Wednesday, anchor Brianna Keilar broke briefly into tears as she narrated the story behind the photo.
Many compared it to the 2015 news photo of Alan Kurdi, a 3-year-old Syrian boy whose body washed up on a beach in Turkey after he and his family attempted to migrate to Europe, or the photo of a dazed and bleeding Syrian child, Omran Daqneesh, who was pulled from the rubble in Aleppo in 2016 after an airstrike by the Syrian regime. Both captured the world's attention, with the former sparking talks that led to more funds for the resettlement of Syrian refugees.
The decision to distribute the photo of the father and daughter came after discussions among AP editors in New York and Mexico City, said John Daniszewski, the news service's vice president for standards. "Normally, we don't show scenes of death," he said in an interview. "But in this case, we felt it was a respectful and poignant photo that conveyed an important moment and a lot of factual information about what's going on along the border."
Given the graphic nature of the photo, AP's editors decided to package it with a staff-written news story explaining who the victims were and how they died, including an eyewitness account by Ramírez's wife, who spoke to Mexican police. They also moved a related blog post by Daniszewski that carried the headline, "Why we published a border deaths photo."
"The AP does not transmit highly graphic or disturbing photographs for their own sake," he wrote. "We also avoid images that are gratuitously violent. But we have through our history made the decision at times to show disturbing images that are important and that can convey the human cost of war, civil unrest or other tragic events in a way that words alone cannot."
Other news outlets issued warnings, such as the one on MSNBC.com: "The photo you are about to see is very graphic and some might find it disturbing. In a stark reminder of the perils at the border, the Associated Press today published images of a man and his 23 month old daughter from El Salvador who drowned in the Rio Grande river on Sunday."
While the photo gained wide and nearly instant circulation via digital sources, most U.S. daily newspapers did not publish it on their front pages, including The Washington Post.
A major exception was the New York Times, which featured it as the "display" photo, the leading image on its front page. The photo ran across four columns with a two-line caption that included a referral to a news story inside the paper.
Like the AP, the Times's editors spent some time Tuesday afternoon discussing the pros and cons of publishing the photo, said Beth Flynn, the newspaper's deputy photo editor. With deadline approaching, one editor called editors at the AP to get more information about the photo and the photographer. A group of top editors, including Executive Editor Dean Baquet, then discussed what to do.
"Most of us, the majority, felt very strongly that we should run it" on the front page, Flynn said. The accompanying news story "tried to tell about who these people were so that they weren't just anonymous people coming to our country," she said.
Few readers criticized the Times's decision, judging from comments posted online. One reader even thanked Flynn and assistant editor Carolyn Ryan in an email, writing, "I can't imagine the heart-wrenching, soul-searching process you must go through each and every day. You are telling the stories that need to be told. . . . It is important and brave."
For The Post, the decision not to publish the photo in its print edition was largely a logistical one, according to Emilio Garcia-Ruiz, managing editor for digital. "We were unable to get a Washington Post-level story written in time to meet print deadlines [Tuesday night] so we didn't consider it" for display on the front page, he said. The Post, however, published the photo and AP story online on Tuesday and wrote several follow-up stories on Wednesday.
Le Duc, a crime reporter, told the Guardian, "I've seen a lot of bodies - and a lot of drownings. . . . You get numb to it, but when you see something like this, it resensitizes you.
"Will it change anything?" she asked. "It should. These families have nothing, and they are risking everything for a better life. If scenes like this don't make us think again - if they don't move our decision-makers - then our society is in a bad way."

More visitors from away? Maine is great for UFO spotting

Ahead of World UFO Day, a Salt Lake City-based company has declared Maine one of the best states to see a UFO.
Dead last? The Lone Star State.
“If you’re scrambling to avoid an alien abduction, the safest place for you to live is Texas,” according to the report.
SatelliteInternet.com married statistics from the National UFO Reporting Center and U.S. Census to find Maine has had 70.23 sightings per 100,000 people.
The top five is heavy on states in the northern part of the country: Washington, Montana, Vermont, Alaska, Maine. And the bottom five is heavy on the South: Texas, Louisiana, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama.
“I was coming up dry on theories,” Media Relations Specialist Cosette Jarrett said Wednesday. “I guess that there are two things here: You’re more likely to spot a UFO in the North than the South or people have a stronger belief in the North than they do in the South and they’re more likely to report something funny that they see up in the sky.”
Jarrett said her company felt like it would be a fun time to crunch the numbers with UFO interest after the New York Times’ story of Navy pilots coming forward to report strange objects in the sky.
Attitudes toward UFOs have been changing in the U.S.
In Chapman University’s 2018 Survey of American Fears, 41% of people believe aliens had visited Earth in the recent past and 35% believe they’ve come in modern times, compared to 35% and 26.2%, respectively, the year before.
For anyone keeping a paranormal scorecard, more people believed in ghosts (57.7%) and fewer in Bigfoot (20.7%).
The National UFO Reporting Center has accounts of 957 UFO reports in Maine, 17 more than when SatelliteInternet.com ran its numbers, that date back to July 1, 1946, in South Portland: “motionless, dark oblong, noon sky over ocean, felt Energy-Pull of Observing craft; when spotted, accelerated straight upwards fast.”
Some are anonymous, at least one in Auburn a potential hoax and some have been deemed likely satellites or things that should be up there, like Venus.
World UFO Day, should you want to look up, is July 2.

E. Jean Carroll: She said, he said, and how media weighs balance

Resumen: Why didn't The New York Times and other media outlets give E. Jean Carroll sexual assault charges against Trump bigger play?

Enlaces: https://upfinder.upf.edu/openurl/34CSUC_UPF/34CSUC_UPF:VU1?genre=article&amp;atitle=E.+Jean+Carroll%3A+She+said%2C+he+said%2C+and+how+media+weighs+balance&amp;author=Bruinius%2C+Harry&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;date=2019-06-26&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=The+Christian+Science+Monitor&amp;issn=0882-7729&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Ahispanicnews_

Texto completo: Last Friday, when the writer and advice columnist E. Jean Carroll accused President Donald Trump of sexually assaulting her in a dressing room at the Bergdorf Goodman department store in Manhattan 23 years ago, few of the nation’s major media outlets treated it as bombshell news.
Just a few days later, however, many journalists and critics have begun to wonder why. The president immediately denied what would  have been an explosive, news-dominating allegation, and he quickly attacked the well-known author’s credibility, suggesting her possible ulterior motives.
Ms. Carroll leveled her accusations, after all, in an excerpt taken from her fifth book, and published Friday in New York Magazine – a little more than a week before her book’s scheduled release. “Shame on those who make up false stories of assault to get publicity for themselves, or sell a book, or carry out a political agenda,” President Trump said. 
The columnist’s accusation and the president’s denial were all but absent in this weekend’s headlines and Sunday morning roundtables, and many media watchers decried the fact that this latest allegation barely caused a stir.
Yet when it comes to discerning the credibility of those who allege sexual assault, many media ethicists and journalists say, it is actually essential that news outlets react in a sober-minded and particularly careful way.  
“I do think that in the MeToo era, news outlets have had to be extremely cautious and extremely meticulous about what they publish,” says Lauren Wright, lecturer in politics and public affairs at Princeton University in New Jersey, and a frequent political analyst on Fox News, CNN, and other news outlets. “They do check it out, they do figure it out, and they do have that due diligence process, and that sometimes takes a few days.”
The reporting of The New York Times and other outlets, in fact, helped give voice to the many women who were sexually harassed and assaulted by Hollywood moguls like Harvey Weinstein as well as Fox News titans Bill O’Reilly and Roger Ailes.
Still, critics singled out the particular dearth of coverage in this weekend’s editions of the Times, which won a Pulitzer Prize for its investigations of what became the #MeToo movement. On Monday, the publication’s executive editor, Dean Baquet, admitted that “we were overly cautious” in their handling of Ms. Carroll’s allegations against the president. 
But Mr. Baquet also provided insight into the guidelines the paper employs when trying to assess the credibility of an accuser. These include locating sources other than those mentioned by the accusers who are willing to corroborate their allegations on the record. In this story, Mr. Baquet said, The Times could not find any independent sources beyond the two friends Ms. Carroll cited in her book, or any other additional corroborating evidence. 
Nevertheless, given that a respected public figure like Ms. Carroll, whose advice column “Ask E. Jean” has appeared in Elle magazine since 1993, was making a public allegation against a sitting president “should’ve compelled us to play it bigger,” he said.
“But the history of coverage of sexual assault in America’s media has always been one of extreme caution, and that is driven by a sense of fairness,” says Ken Paulson, former editor-in-chief of USA TODAY and now the director of the Free Speech Center at Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro. “It’s an allegation that, once unveiled, never gets put away.”
And all things being equal, Mr. Paulson suggests, President Trump’s questions about the credibility of his accuser and her possible motives are usually valid concerns. 
“If you take the same fact situation, and someone in your community accuses a small-town mayor of rape from 23 years earlier, and there’s no other indications of such behavior,” he says, “you would look at that with considerable caution. You would ask understandable questions: Why is the allegation being made today?” 
But as he and other observers point out, all things are far from equal when it comes to President Trump. Ms. Carroll is the 22nd woman to accuse Trump on the record of sexual assault or misconduct, and hers is in many ways the most serious, as she alleges an attack that included forced penetration. 
Add to these accusations, too, the fact that the president described sexually assaulting women in the infamous Access Hollywood video and audiotapes.
“The credibility regarding charges of sexual assault should be the same as in any other matter: What are the facts, and who and how many people can testify to those facts?” says Paul Levinson, professor of media studies at Fordham University in New York. “People should make decisions about whom to believe with the utmost gravity. The credibility of the accused and the accuser should both be taken into account.”
Even though Dr. Wright at Princeton University agrees that the news media has generally handled the recent allegations of rape against the president in an even-handed and proper way, she points out that it is far more complicated when it comes to assessing the credibility of women accusing powerful men of sexual assault. 
“The first thing we always do is question their credibility and ask questions about them,” she says. “And their claims are always scrutinized ad nauseam.”
“And the baseline, I would say, is not that we believe women, the baseline is that we do not believe women,” continues Dr. Wright, author of “Star Power: American Democracy in the Age of the Celebrity Candidate.” “And that has been the case going back to the beginning of time, as long as humans have existed – women have not been believed.”
False accusations are rare when it comes to sexual assault, according to an in-depth survey of existing research on the subject by the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, a nonprofit in Pennsylvania. Only 2% to 7% of accusations in various parts of the counter were found to be fabricated or false.
“Nobody wants to become famous from their story of sexual assault,” Dr. Wright says. “I mean, this idea has been proven again and again, that women face many more consequences when they come out with their story, and the rewards, really, are nonexistent. Society actually punishes you.”  
Some observers also saw an “outrage fatigue” at work in the news media’s cautious response to Ms. Carroll’s accusations, especially on the heels of the divisive confirmation hearings of Justice Brett Kavanaugh last year.  Others pointed out, too, that the most recent allegations against President Trump were part of a busy weekend in the news, including the humanitarian crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border and the administration’s mulling military action against Iran.
“But there is a dynamic to President Trump that we have never seen before,” says Mr. Paulson, the former editor-in-chief of USA TODAY. “He does things, he says things, and he is accused of things that would have destroyed less confident candidates or public officials. And that, in some way, can affect editors who sort of go, here we go again.”
“But I guess the long and short of it is that I think that the press overall has acted responsibly, even though there are factors in this case that would lead you not to strip it across the top of your front page in a headline,” he continues. “These should give anyone caution, but it also doesn’t mean you shouldn’t cover the accusations, and that you should actually dig deeper.”

Texto completo: Two U. S. service members were killed in Afghanistan on Wednesday, the American-led NATO mission in Afghanistan said in a statement.
The identities of the soldiers were being withheld pending notification of next of kin. The statement did not offer any details surrounding the circumstances of their deaths.
A spokesman for the Taliban, Zabihullah Mujahid, said the two service members were killed in an ambush in eastern Wardak Province, the New York Times reported.
The deaths occurred one day after an unannounced visit to Kabul, the Afghan capital, by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
Meanwhile, the U. S. is holding direct talks with the Taliban in Doha, the Qatari capital. The seventh round of the talks are scheduled to begin on Saturday.
"We've made clear to the Taliban that we're prepared to remove our forces. I want to be clear, we've not yet agreed on a timeline to do so," Pompeo told reporters during an unannounced stop in Afghanistan on Tuesday. The presence of troops in Afghanistan is "conditions-based, he said.
The Taliban refuse to talk directly with the Afghan government, which it considers a puppet of the U. S.
More than 2,400 U. S. service personnel have died in Afghanistan since the U. S. -led coalition invaded the country after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the U. S. The coalition sought to crush the Taliban and hunt down al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden.
The U. S. makes up the overwhelming majority of 14,000 coalition troops in Afghanistan. About 100,000 troops were stationed there at the height of the war.

Sports figures vs. reporters: Top confrontations, from Billy Martin to Russell Westbrook

Resumen: The Mets' Mickey Callaway and Jason Vargas are the latest sports figures to take their anger out on reporters. We look back at other top feuds.

Texto completo: The media and professional athletes have always had a tenuous relationship. Occasionally when things aren't going well for a player or a team, the media can be a convenient outlet for anger and frustration.
As the saying goes, "familiarity breeds contempt. "
That's one explanation for the recent confrontation New York Mets manager Mickey Callaway and pitcher Jason Vargas had with Newsday beat reporter Tim Healey.
Callaway eventually apologized for his expletive-filled tirade. He and Vargas, who threatened to "knock out" Healey and had to be held back by teammates, have also been fined.
But in the annals of athlete-manager-reporter confrontations, this one was tame compared to some other memorable ones.
Billy Martin punches reporter, 1978
Martin, the legendary New York Yankees manager, could be just as combative off the field as on it. One November night in Reno, Nevada, Martin -- who had been fired earlier that season by owner George Steinbrenner -- punched a local reporter in the face.
According to The New York Times, Martin said he did it because Ray Hagar of the Reno Evening Gazette "challenged me to fight” during an interview.
Not surprisingly, Hagar remembered things differently: “He said that writers always twist things he said. He saw me writing things down and he wanted to see my notes,” Hagar said. The reporter suffered a gash above his eye and at least three chipped teeth.
“He hit me before I knew it," Hagar said. "I didn't even get a punch in. ”
Oddly, Callaway used Martin as an example to explain his own behavior.
Will McDonough slugs Pats DB, 1979
McDonough, the former Boston Globe writer, had a history of being tough with his words. He backed it up by his actions in the New England Patriots' locker room after a game against the New York Jets.
Defensive back Raymond Clayborn was in no mood to celebrate the 56-3 win, purposely bumping into reporters who came near him. According to Bruce Allen of Boston Sports Media Watch, McDonough took the future Pro Bowler to task, saying, "Hey Ray, there's no need to do that. "
Clayborn stuck a finger in the reporter's face and poked him in the eye. So McDonough stepped back and unloaded a three-punch combination that, according to some, knocked Clayborn to the ground.
Hal McRae throws desk phone, 1993
The former Kansas City Royals star returned to manage his old team in 1991, but his tenure ended four short years later with the team never finishing higher than third place. Early in his third season, the Royals had just suffered a disappointing loss to the Detroit Tigers, dropping their record to 7-12.
After the game, one of the reporters assembled in McRae's office asked whether he had considered using George Brett -- who was 40 at the time and in the final season of his career -- as a pinch-hitter in a bases-loaded situation in the seventh inning.
That sent McRae on an epic tirade. It began with him calling it a "stupid (expletive) question" and led to him throwing several objects from his desk -- including a corded phone.
One of the objects McRae threw -- believed to be a tape recorder -- struck reporter Alan Eskew of the Topeka Capital-Journal on the side of his face. There was even some blood.
After kicking everyone out of his office, McRae came back out with a few more choice words, including his memorable parting shot: "Put that in your (expletive) pipe and smoke it!"
Jim Everett sacks Jim Rome, 1994
This one was pretty simple -- and likely planned to some degree in advance.
Sportscaster and talk-show host Jim Rome was just starting to build a name for himself nationally when he invited then-New Orleans Saints quarterback Jim Everett on his ESPN2 show, "Talk 2. "
Rome had been critical of Everett's injuries, often questioning his toughness by calling him "Chris" -- a reference to tennis star Chris Evert. The quarterback didn't appreciate the insinuation, which seems even more juvenile 25 years later.
When the two sat down to do the live interview, Everett warned Rome not to say it to his face. Rome did . . . so Everett flipped over a table between them and tackled the host.
Everett later explained in a teleconference: "I really don't condone my actions, but I was put in a position that I thought was going to be in a journalistic-type interview, and instead, I was put into what I felt was a taunting attack. I don't regret what I did. "
Ryan Leaf melts down, 1998
After a particularly bad game -- even by his standards -- San Diego Chargers quarterback Ryan Leaf just couldn't contain his emotions. The rookie had completed just one of 14 passes for four yards with two interceptions and three lost fumbles. He yelled at a TV cameraman after the game, but that was only the beginning.
The next day in the Chargers' locker room, he singled out reporter Jay Posner of the San Diego Union-Tribune, apparently for writing about the confrontation with the cameraman.
"Don't talk to me, all right? Knock it off!" Leaf screamed before he was restrained by Chargers linebacker Junior Seau.
That incident got Leaf even more negative publicity when it was caught on video and shown on national television.
He later issued a televised apology, after which he crumpled up the paper he was reading and threw it in his locker.
Russell Westbrook's boycott, 2015-
Generally, an athlete-reporter beef stems from a particular incident and is only temporary before one or the other moves on -- either emotionally or physically.
However, the Oklahoma City Thunder guard has held a grudge against columnist Berry Tramel of The Oklahoman for years, refusing to answer his questions or, at most, giving short, one-sentence answers.
Why?
"I just don't like you," Westbrook said after a game in early 2015.
That's about as much insight as Westbrook has shed on the situation -- although Tramel told the Hoops Hype podcast in April he didn't take the insult personally; he felt Westbrook was addressing the media in general.
Nevertheless, the relationship between the two has only gotten worse. Westbrook frequently says, "Next question" whenever Tramel asks him anything in a news conference.
Yet Tramel keeps asking, as he wrote in a recent column, "because the media shouldn’t give in to Westbrook’s desire to control everything. "
Unlike other high-profile confrontations, there's been nothing physical between these two . . . but then again, this feud has lasted far longer.

Bohls: Sage advice from Kornheiser — keep on reading

Texto completo: 1. Had a rare treat listening to some of the greats in our profession talk about how they got their starts in the business and who helped them along the way. The four new inductees into the National Sports Media Association Hall of Fame who were honored Monday at a banquet of 400 on the Wake Forest campus at Winston-Salem, N.C., were Tony Kornheiser, Peter King, Bob Ley and Doc Emrick. Kornheiser, who has always been one of my favorite people, said, “I’m old and I want to pee, but I’m wearing a tan suit and I don’t want to do it here.” He began reading the New York Post and Daily News when he was 7 or 8. Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee gave him a column but said he couldn’t carry Red Smith’s typewriter, but Tony said he actually did. Literally. He said his first byline was
on a New York Times story about boxer Jimmy Elder. He bought an early copy of the first edition, read it on the train, saw a guy reading it and accosted him for not reading the jump. “How do you not go inside (to the jump)?" Tony asked the man. “It’s good stuff. When he asked how I knew, I said because I wrote it.” Tony clipped that story out of the paper and put it in a folder, the same as he did for all his stories for 40 years. That’s a collection I’d love to own. ... King is a prolific writer and reporter and has 1,100 NFL contacts in his phone, but his presenter said the one man who won’t return Peter’s phone calls is Bill Belichick. King said he knew what he wanted to do when he was in the fifth grade when he wrote up a neighborhood newsletter that his mom typed up. ... Syracuse’s Drew Carter, who won the Jim Nantz Award, thanked his parents but said his dad wasn’t perfect. “If you had been LeBron James, that would have been great.”
2. Adrian Wojnarowski, honored as the National Sportswriter of the Year, said the achievement hasn’t come without some regrets. “There have been too many days I was too versed in trade talks or stuff. There were too many vacations where I asked my son Ben to Google the spelling of an East European forward, too many times I played catch with my son Andy and was texting in between throws. There’s nothing normal about being me as a husband or a father. My wife Ann told me she has mobile alerts on her phone because it’s proof of life when I’m not around.” ... Doris Burke, the National Sportscaster of the Year, was pure class as usual and teared up when she cited her children’s sacrifice in having “a mother who’s not at home every night.” ... Ran into Houston’s Kelvin Sampson, who received the Clarence “Big House” Gaines Division I award for his American Athletic Conference championship team that went 33-4 and reached the Sweet 16. He reminded me he played for his father at Pembroke High in North Carolina, but I never knew the former Oklahoma coach also played quarterback and catcher in high school. He thanked his beautiful wife Karen, “my high school sweetheart,” though she told me they actually met in kindergarten.
3. Love that major league baseball teams are extending the protective netting to the ends of the dugouts and, in growing numbers, from foul pole to foul pole. There are just too many dangerous instances of fans getting seriously hurt by foul balls to ignore this issue. ... Was great seeing the legendary Albert Pujols get such long standing ovations from Cardinals fans with his first game in St. Louis since 2011 and have a tearful hug with catcher Yadier Molina. Cardinals fans are some of the classiest in sports and were truly conflicted. I honestly think most of them wanted Pujols to hit a grand slam when he came up with the bases loaded before he flied out. What a great baseball town. He may be a top 10 player of all time.
4. Did you catch the brawl at the Little League game where parents — yes, parents — got into an all-out brawl over “a bad call” by a 13-year-old umpire over a player who batted out of order? Shameful behavior. It made national news. Dave Vilhauer, author of a new book called “The Parent Trapped Within,” said at a book seminar that “parents need to remember about their kids. It’s their journey, not yours.”
5. OK, Dallas Cowboys, you’re No. 1 at something. Emory University Goizueta School of Business professor Mike Lewis used his own statistical analysis to determine the NFL’s “best” fans. The study ranked the Cowboys' the best. The rest of the top teams are the Patriots, Eagles, Giants, Steelers and Packers. The Los Angeles Rams were dead last at 32nd, barely edging out the Chiefs, whose presence near the bottom stuns me. Lewis told Yahoo.com that he relied on three criteria: How well fans back up their words with dollars, a team’s social media reach and how well a team draws on the road, adjusting for team performance. The Texans came in a lowly 21st.
6. Daron Roberts, executive director of the Texas’ Center for Sports Leadership & Innovation, told me last week that of all the regrets he hears from former Longhorns athletes is the fact that most failed to meet regular students and form lasting relationships outside of their athletic spheres, which is a shame. That’s a big reason why his classes include both athletes and non-athletes. They need to come out from under the sports umbrella. Coaches should insist on this if they really want a well-rounded, educational experience for their athletes. I remember when Texas played Penn State at the Meadowlands in 1985, a trip I’m sure the football staff sold to recruits. When I asked a player if he got to see any of New York, he said he saw the Statue of Liberty from his bus to the stadium.
7. First pick of the draft Zion Williamson showed he’s a real pro. He said he changed his number recently. Jaguars cornerback Jalen Ramsey is also growing up. He said he’s no longer criticizing NFL quarterbacks. Baker Mayfield, are you listening?
8 . Scattershooting while wondering whatever happened to former Longhorns linebacker Doug Shankle, one of the toughest players to come through Texas.
9. In honor of the late great Bill Witliff, I recently watched the entire "Lonesome Dove" series, the best television mini-series ever in my opinion. Playing Gus was Robert Duvall’s best character ever. Gave it 10 ducks.
Crazy prediction: Yordan Alvarez will become the Astros’ third rookie of the year.

Texto completo: That the Democrats' two evenings of dueling oratory snippets this week are called "debates" validates Finley Peter Dunne's prediction that "when we Americans are through with the English language, it will look as if it had been run over by a musical comedy." Already a linguistic casualty of the campaign is the noun "socialism." So, quickly, before Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign sinks, like darling Clementine, beneath the foaming brine, consider his struggle to convince Americans that socialism deserves to be the wave of their future.
One European explanation of America's puzzling (to many European intellectuals) resistance to socialism was given in 1906 by the German economist Werner Sombart: "All the socialist utopias came to nothing on roast beef and apple pie." Recently, however, Sanders delivered a Washington speech explaining, in effect, that socialism is as American as a piece of frozen apple pie with a slice of processed cheese. Doing so, however, he demonstrated that socialism is a classification that no longer classifies.
Sanders' socialism turns out to be a tweaked New Deal. He began, of course, by saying that the nation is in "a defining and pivotal moment." Speechwriters actually get paid for such bromides; capitalist America remains a land of opportunity even for the untalented. What Sanders then offered as forward-looking socialism was a warmed-over version of what President Franklin Roosevelt advocated 75 years ago.
In his 1944 State of the Union address, FDR called for "rights" to "useful" jobs, "good" education, "adequate" food and clothing and recreation, a "decent" living for farmers, a "decent" home, "adequate" medical care, "adequate" protection in old age. Details, such as how to define the adjectives and how to pay for what the nouns denote, were for another day. Sanders' agenda for "completion" of FDR's New Deal is a right to a "decent" job, "quality" health care, "complete" education, "affordable" housing, a "clean" environment, a "secure" retirement. Details later.
Sanders says "what I mean by democratic socialism" is "economic rights are human rights." Really. That's it. FDR said "necessitous men are not free men," implying that government can and should remove necessity from the human story. Sanders, FDR's unimaginative echo, presumably agrees.
Sanders loathes billionaires and loves Sweden, which has more billionaires per capita than America has. Economist Deirdre McCloskey, writing in National Review, notes that "none of Sweden's manufacturing or extractive industries has even been socialized." And "when Saab Autos began its descent into bankruptcy," the government let it go, unlike the U.S government bailing out GM and Chrysler (for a second time) after 2008. McCloskey quotes a Swedish diplomat: "In many fields, we have more private ownership compared to other European countries, and to America. About 80% of all new schools are privately run, as are the railroads and the subway system."
The morning after Sanders' speech, The New York Times reported something momentous: "Democratic socialism has become a major force in American political life." This is amazing, considering that it was never more than a negligible force when capitalism seemed to be in a perhaps terminal crisis: In 1932, three years into the Depression, with the unemployment rate at 23.6% and the GDP 25.7% smaller than in 1929, as this column previously noted, the Socialist Party's presidential candidate, Norman Thomas, received fewer votes (884,885) than its 1920 candidate Eugene Debs received (913,693) while he was imprisoned by President Woodrow Wilson's administration.
A young adult — a member of the demographic supposedly most sympathetic to socialism — who attended Sanders' exegesis of socialism told the Times: "In America we embrace a lot of socialist policies already, like public education and parks." This understanding of socialism as any government provision of public goods puts Horace Mann (1796-1859), an advocate of public education, and Frederick Law Olmsted (1822-1903), designer of New York City's Central Park, in the socialist pantheon with their contemporaries Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Many young people who supposedly are making socialism a "major force" think it is sociability: everyone being nice to everyone.
Sen. Elizabeth ("I have a plan for that") Warren, D-Mass., who describes herself as a "capitalist to my bones," is a more authentic socialist than Sanders because she has more granular plans for government power (aka politics) to supplant market forces in the allocation of wealth and opportunity. So she, even more than the other participants in this week's Democrats' presidential scrums, would as president give the nation a helpful, if inadvertent, tutorial about this axiom: If you want to make God laugh, tell him your plans.

Texto completo: The magazine giant Condé Nast said on Tuesday that it had found a buyer for the bimonthly fashion title W, one of three publications the company put up for sale last year in the face of significant financial losses that forced it to adopt a series of cost-cutting measures.
The company acquiring W, Future Media, said Sara Moonves, currently the magazine's style director, would become the next editor in chief. She succeeds Stefano Tonchi, who has held the title for nine years and is leaving W and Condé Nast.
The sale price was not disclosed.
Future Media said in a statement that W's staff would continue to operate from Condé Nast's offices at 1 World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan for a transitional period and then would be combined with the staffs of two other titles the company owns, Surface and Watch Journal, "to work collaboratively across all departments."
"We know that W will serve as a perfect complement to the publications already in our portfolio," Marc Lotenberg, Future Media's chief executive, said. Ms. Moonves, he added, "has enormous credibility in the fashion community, not to mention a forward-thinking sensibility that will bring W beyond its core print distribution into various offline, online and augmented formats."
Ms. Moonves joined W as style director in 2017 after jobs at Vogue and The New York Times's T magazine. She is the daughter of Leslie Moonves, the former CBS chief executive who was forced out last year over what the company characterized as his obstruction of an investigation into multiple allegations of sexual misconduct against him.
For Condé Nast, W is the last of the three titles the company moved to shed nearly a year ago as it navigates a changing magazine industry and move past $ 120 million in losses in 2017. The other magazines, Brides and Golf Digest, were sold to Barry Diller's Dotdash and Discovery Inc.
Mr. Tonchi confirmed his departure in a statement. "My top priority in the last year has been to ensure that W finds a new home and carries its legacy into the future, and that every effort is made to protect my staff's job security," he said. He also noted that W, which Condé Nast bought from the Walt Disney Company 20 years ago, had been restored to profitability during his tenure.

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
Galloo Island, in Lake Ontario, seemed to be a prime spot for a wind farm. It is mostly deserted and sits about six miles offshore in northern New York, so few people were likely to be bothered by the looming turbines and their relentless whoosh.
Then a hunter spotted an eagle's nest.
The discovery kicked off a fight over the safety of birds and accusations of a cover-up that have stalled the project. A judge has questioned the integrity of one of the country's largest wind farm developers, and a pair of eagles seems to have disappeared.
The case demonstrates the challenges facing Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's clean energy goals, which last week were enshrined in an ambitious new law requiring 70 percent of the state's electricity to come from renewable sources, such as wind, solar and hydropower, by 2030. The state has particularly high hopes for wind power.
But currently, only a bit more than 3 percent of the state's electricity comes from large-scale wind projects. That number has hardly budged over the last five years despite billions of dollars in available subsidies and plenty of willing developers.
Developers and other energy groups blame the state's cumbersome approval process -- the result of a 2011 law -- and reluctance to overrule local opposition and zoning ordinances.
"There needs to be a greater sense of urgency to get these projects built," said Anne Reynolds, the executive director of the Alliance for Clean Energy New York, whose membership includes clean energy developers and environmental groups.
But Galloo Island shows that expanding renewable energy -- with massive infrastructure that affects communities and wildlife -- involves more than overcoming bureaucratic hurdles.
The project was supposed to be a relatively easy one to get approved. The island's main inhabitants are a retired couple who act as caretakers for the wealthy family that owns most of it. There was little local opposition when Apex Clean Energy, one of the country's largest wind power companies, started planning in late 2015 to put up at least two dozen turbines, each almost 600 feet tall.
Then a bald eagle's nest appeared, sitting high in a linden tree.
In spring 2017, Apex learned about the nest from the island's caretaker, according to documents Apex filed later with the state.
The presence of eagles would not necessarily have doomed the project. The population, while still protected, has rebounded nationally, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has encouraged wind developers to avoid prosecution for killing eagles by applying for licenses to cover the number of birds who might be struck by wind turbines.
But the nest, which eagles use almost exclusively for raising their young, promised new hurdles. At a minimum, the discovery could lead to additional studies and plans for monitoring the nest and the flight paths of any eaglets. Environmental regulators tend to be more protective of nesting bald eagles because they reproduce slowly.
A consulting firm for Apex dispatched a biologist to the island in April 2017. The biologist found the nest with an adult eagle atop it, according to a document reviewed by The New York Times. Later that month, Apex commissioned a helicopter to inspect the nest, which appeared empty, Apex later said.
But when Apex submitted its application to the state in late 2017 to build the wind farm, it said there were no known bald eagle nests on the island, according to public documents reviewed by The Times.
With their soaring majesty and fierce visages, bald eagles are not easily kept secret, even on a remote island. In 2017, a hunter had spotted the nest. He took photos, which eventually reached Clif Schneider, a retired biologist.
Mr. Schneider, 76, had spent much of his professional life studying and safeguarding the area's fish population for the state Department of Environmental Conservation. He had been worrying about global warming for decades and believed drastic action across the globe was needed. He did not believe a few wind turbines would solve the problem.
Like many upstate residents, he was troubled that New York City gobbled up fossil fuels but did not have to deal with the blight of giant machinery on the landscape.
Mostly, though, he was worried about the turbines killing birds. Just off Galloo Island is Little Galloo, a small, denuded island that is home to tens of thousands of nesting birds.
Mr. Schneider did not expect to stop the project, but he thought he could push for some constraints on the turbines, such as limits during migrations. Because state law requires energy developers to provide money to affected local communities, Mr. Schneider was able to hire avian experts to help challenge the project. He accused the company of lying about the eagle's nest.
"It is really disconcerting," Mr. Schneider said. "It just destroys trust. They should have reported it immediately. They should have been truthful in their application."
Steve Bowers, a spokesman for Apex, acknowledged the company should have been open about the existence of the nest, but said it did not have enough evidence at the time to establish the nest was being used.
"We should have simply disclosed all relevant information," Mr. Bowers said.
One judge reviewing Apex's application said the episode raised "serious questions about the applicant's character and fitness." State energy regulators said in December 2018 that "significant consequences appear to be warranted."
Apex withdrew its application for the project in February, saying it may consider restarting it in the future. Apex says it has spent more than $ 20 million trying to develop three wind projects in New York, including Galloo, and that two of them are stalled.
There are about two dozen large-scale wind farms in New York. More wind capacity was built between 2005 and 2010 than in the years since, and no new wind farms are under construction, Ms. Reynolds, of the Alliance for Clean Energy, said. Some are in the pipeline, and the state is weighing proposals for major wind farms miles off the Long Island shore.
Doreen Harris, a senior official at the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, which provides state subsidies to renewable energy projects, said she believed the application process was improving. There is wind farm construction scheduled for next year, she added.
"I feel really confident and optimistic about reaching our goals," Ms. Harris said.
Concern over the eagles has continued. A couple of months ago, in April, Mr. Schneider and his partner checked on the nest. Through binoculars, they spotted two eagles there, they said. They grew excited about the possibilities of eaglets.
Apex, hoping to revive the project, had also been monitoring the nest and the local eagle population. The company planned several helicopter flyovers; state officials told Apex not to get within 500 feet of the nest.
Low-altitude flights can spook animals. In North Dakota, a family said that one Apex flight looking for eagles' nests there in March stirred panic among livestock that killed two calves, according to Tri-State Livestock News.
Not long after Apex conducted one of its latest flights over Galloo Island, Mr. Schneider returned with his boat for a visit. The eagles were not there, he said. Several more visits have failed to turn up any sign.
Gerald Smith, an ornithologist who aided Mr. Schneider's efforts to challenge the project, believes the helicopter scared the eagles away for good. "They destroyed an active eagle's nest," Mr. Smith said.
Mr. Smith said he wondered if Apex intended to drive off the eagles, clearing the way for another attempt to build.
Mr. Bowers, the Apex spokesman, said that was not the case. The flyover was conducted "to further clarify the potential environmental impact of the project," he said.
For the moment, there are neither wind turbines nor bald eagles on Galloo Island.

Pence to launch 'Latinos for Trump' as new polling shows most Hispanics want a Democrat to be president

Texto completo: Vice President Mike Pence traveled to Florida on Tuesday to launch a national "Latinos for Trump" initiative in a bid to bolster support for the Republican ticket at time when polling shows large majorities of Hispanics favoring the election of a Democratic president next year.
During an event staged in Miami, the city hosting the first of the Democratic presidential debates this week, Pence called President Trump "a great champion of Latino and Hispanic Americans" and said the new group is "one of the most important coalitions of the 2020 campaign."
Florida, home to more than 2 million Hispanic registered voters, is a key state for Trump's reelection fortunes. His immigration policies and rhetoric on the subject have drawn pointed criticism from many Latinos.
Pence largely sought to make the case for voting Republican next year on economic issues, pointing to a decline in the Hispanic unemployment rate since Trump took office.
Later in his remarks, Pence touched on Trump's efforts to "secure the border," prompting chants of "build the wall" — a reference to the president's long-promised barrier along the Mexico border.
Miami was among the cities that Trump targeted for sweeping raids when he announced a plan last week to remove "the millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States." Although he subsequently postponed the raids, the threat was among the latest of his policies to alienate many in the Latino community.
The administration's practice of separating migrant families has also been highly unpopular. And Trump sparred with officials in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in 2017 about a federal response that many on the island and elsewhere viewed as less robust than those in hurricane-damaged states on the mainland.
Polling released this week by Telemundo showed Trump facing head winds among Hispanic voters in several states.
In Florida, only 34 percent of Hispanic voters would like to see Trump reelected, while 56 percent would prefer to replace him with a Democrat, said the survey conducted by Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy.
The numbers were even less favorable to Trump elsewhere.
In California, 26 percent of Hispanic voters would like to see Trump reelected, while 66 percent would prefer a Democrat. In Texas, 25 percent would like to see him returned to office, while 69 percent want a Democrat.
Republicans involved in the "Latinos for Trump" initiative express hope that he can build on his performance among Hispanics in 2016. Trump won 28 percent of the Latino vote nationally then, according to exit polling, while Democrat Hillary Clinton won 66 percent.
Washington Post
In reversal, McConnell vows a vote on 9/11 fund
WASHINGTON — Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has agreed to call a vote on a bill ensuring that a victims' compensation fund for the Sept. 11 attacks never runs out of money.
McConnell made the commitment after meeting Tuesday with a group of first responders. "We want to try to deal with (the legislation) before the August recess," the Kentucky Republican told ABC News.
The meeting came two weeks after comedian Jon Stewart, a longtime advocate for 9/11 responders, offered withering criticism of Congress at a public hearing at the Capitol that was attended by uniformed firefighters and police officers but few lawmakers.
McConnell now has "a sense of urgency" about the bill, said John Feal, a recovery worker at the World Trade Center site and a longtime activist.
Associated Press
In new plan, Warren seeks to safeguard federal elections
WASHINGTON — Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts on Tuesday released a far-reaching plan that would create new standards for how federal elections are carried out across the country, part of an effort to protect voting rights and make it easier for Americans to vote.
Warren unveiled her plan hours before holding a campaign event in South Florida, a place that has had ample experience with election controversy.
As part of her proposal, intended to expand voting access and strengthen election security, Warren would create a federal agency, the Secure Democracy Administration. She would replace every voting machine across the country with modern equipment and would require the use of a uniform federal ballot. All states would be required to have automatic voter registration and same-day registration, early voting, and voting by mail.
Elections in the United States are run in a decentralized manner, with rules and procedures that vary on the state and local level. Warren is calling for the federal government to play a much larger role, creating standards for federal elections that states would need to follow.
Under her plan, Warren would make Election Day a holiday, and she would restore voting rights for formerly incarcerated people nationwide.
The senator would also seek to end partisan gerrymandering by requiring states to use independent panels to draw congressional district lines, and she would restrict states from removing voters from election rolls.
Warren said she would allocate roughly $20 billion over 10 years to pay for her plan. She said that cost could be covered with proceeds from her proposed “Ultramillionaire Tax," which would impose an annual tax on a household's assets above $50 million.

Texto completo: A string of outlandish television interviews are eroding the credibility of E. Jean Carroll, who has claimed that President Trump sexually assaulted her in a New York department store in the mid-1990s.
After New York Magazine released an excerpt of Carroll's upcoming book, which featured a harrowing story claiming that Trump sexually assaulted her in a dressing room in the lingerie department of Bergdorf Goodman in 1995 or 1996, I argued that the allegation should be taken seriously and examined carefully, but not reflexively believed. Carroll does deserve a fair hearing, but her recent media appearances are not doing her any favors.
In an interview with Anderson Cooper on Monday night, Carroll was discussing how she did not want to feel like a victim, so she likes to describe the encounter she claims to have had with Trump as a "fight." To this point, it was understandable.
She then said there is so much sexual violence in the world, and in her case the incident only lasted a few minutes. That's where things really went off the rails.
"I was not thrown on the ground and ravaged," Carroll said. "The word rape carries so many sexual connotations. This was not sexual. It just hurt."
When Cooper said people tend to think of rape as a violent assault, she said, "I think most people think of rape as being sexy." As Cooper awkwardly tried to cut in to head to commercial break, she added, "Think of the fantasies."
This is the latest in a string of odd statements in interviews. In a Friday interview with MSNBC, she said she didn't want to pursue charges against Trump because, "I would find it disrespectful to the women who are down on the border who are being raped around the clock down there without any protection." The bizarre implication of that would be that women should hold off on reporting rape until the situation at the border improves.
Carroll has also, at times, tried to downplay the anecdote that Trump attacked her in a dressing room in Bergdorf Goodman in 1995 or 1996, saying Monday on CNN's New Day, he was "only one of 21 hideous men" she describes in her new book. She's acted surprised by the attention the story has received, even though Trump is president and this was obviously going to blow up as soon as it became public. If anything, the surprise has been that it hasn't received more attention.
"Well, what is the title of this book? 'What Do We Need Men For?'" Carroll said in the New Day interview. "Does it say Donald Trump attacked me? I never mentioned Donald Trump in the description of the book. On Amazon, you don't see it. It was not about selling a book about Donald Trump."
But New York Magazine ran an excerpt of her book focused on the Trump story with a cover which featured a posed photo of her in a black coatdress with a headline that reads, "This is what I was wearing 23 years ago when Donald Trump attacked me in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room."
As I noted on Monday, though it's completely understandable why women who have been sexually assaulted would find it difficult to come forward, it obviously makes things significantly harder to investigate crimes that aren't described until decades later.
Carroll said that she told two friends about the attack at the time. Both New York Magazine and the New York Times have reported that they spoke with the two friends, who confirmed this account, but those friends choose not to go on the record.
The number of accusations that have accumulated against Trump, the ease which with he generally lies, and his pasts boasts about groping women all may be reasons to discount his denials. But they also don't mean that he's guilty of this particular crime, either.
So for the time being, unless or until we hear from her friends, all we have to go on is Carroll herself. Being a bit of an eccentric in television interviews, of course, does not mean that she made up the story. But it certainly raises more questions about her reliability as a narrator as we try to evaluate her serious accusation as fairly as possible given the passage of time.

How not to introduce a rape allegation

Texto completo: The New York Times has issued a mea culpa for their "overly cautious" coverage of E. Jean Carroll's recently published rape allegation against President Trump. Because the allegations were sourced from another outlet, executive editor Dean Baquet explained, the New York Times didn't feel they needed to immediately cover the widely publicized story so long as they couldn't obtain new, original reporting.
But the New York Times had it right the first time. On the other hand, New York Magazine, which first published the story, messed it up badly. It couldn't have made it any more dangerous for the New York Times to cover the story as news.
Carroll's allegation is serious — a forceful charge of violent rape against the then-real estate mogul from a quarter century ago. New York Magazine says it independently verified that two friends of Carroll's contemporaneously corroborated her account. That was about the only responsible aspect of their journalism with this story.
Rather than assign a news reporter to introduce this story to the world in an objective report, detailing how exactly the two witnesses described what Carroll said at the time, New York Magazine threw Carroll on the front cover in a defiant and staged shot and gave her a few thousand unfettered words to level allegations not just against Trump, but also against multiple other men. As an excerpt of a memoir, it's a gutting and infuriating account. But a memoir is about the people writing it. Public accusations of this nature are, by necessity, about the accused.
That's why serious reporting is required for such an explosive accusation. It's all well and good for Carroll to vent in her memoir, but journalists owe it to their readers to report on this sort of thing responsibly and soberly. By allowing Carroll to wax poetic for thousands of words, accuse multiple men of different crimes, and advertise her book all while trying to publicly impugn the president, New York Magazine only undermined her credibility and its own.
The New York Times was correct to proceed with caution, at least as a matter for its news team. The commentariat rightly observed that a rape allegation with two contemporaneously corroborating witnesses ought to be investigated seriously, and news reporters tried to do their own independent reporting before publishing news stories. The New York Times did the right thing, and in apologizing after the fact seems to be setting the wrong precedent for the future.

Sports figures vs. reporters: Top confrontations, from Billy Martin to Russell Westbrook

Resumen: The Mets' Mickey Callaway and Jason Vargas are the latest sports figures to take their anger out on reporters. We look back at other top feuds.

Texto completo: The media and professional athletes have always had a tenuous relationship. Occasionally when things aren't going well for a player or a team, the media can be a convenient outlet for anger and frustration.
As the saying goes, "familiarity breeds contempt. "
That's one explanation for the recent confrontation New York Mets manager Mickey Callaway and pitcher Jason Vargas had with Newsday beat reporter Tim Healey.
Callaway eventually apologized for his expletive-filled tirade. He and Vargas, who threatened to "knock out" Healey and had to be held back by teammates, have also been fined.
But in the annals of athlete-manager-reporter confrontations, this one was tame compared to some other memorable ones.
Billy Martin punches reporter, 1978
Martin, the legendary New York Yankees manager, could be just as combative off the field as on it. One November night in Reno, Nevada, Martin -- who had been fired earlier that season by owner George Steinbrenner -- punched a local reporter in the face.
According to The New York Times, Martin said he did it because Ray Hagar of the Reno Evening Gazette "challenged me to fight” during an interview.
Not surprisingly, Hagar remembered things differently: “He said that writers always twist things he said. He saw me writing things down and he wanted to see my notes,” Hagar said. The reporter suffered a gash above his eye and at least three chipped teeth.
“He hit me before I knew it," Hagar said. "I didn't even get a punch in. ”
Oddly, Callaway used Martin as an example to explain his own behavior.
Will McDonough slugs Pats DB, 1979
McDonough, the former Boston Globe writer, had a history of being tough with his words. He backed it up by his actions in the New England Patriots' locker room after a game against the New York Jets.
Defensive back Raymond Clayborn was in no mood to celebrate the 56-3 win, purposely bumping into reporters who came near him. According to Bruce Allen of Boston Sports Media Watch, McDonough took the future Pro Bowler to task, saying, "Hey Ray, there's no need to do that. "
Clayborn stuck a finger in the reporter's face and poked him in the eye. So McDonough stepped back and unloaded a three-punch combination that, according to some, knocked Clayborn to the ground.
Hal McRae throws desk phone, 1993
The former Kansas City Royals star returned to manage his old team in 1991, but his tenure ended four short years later with the team never finishing higher than third place. Early in his third season, the Royals had just suffered a disappointing loss to the Detroit Tigers, dropping their record to 7-12.
After the game, one of the reporters assembled in McRae's office asked whether he had considered using George Brett -- who was 40 at the time and in the final season of his career -- as a pinch-hitter in a bases-loaded situation in the seventh inning.
That sent McRae on an epic tirade. It began with him calling it a "stupid (expletive) question" and led to him throwing several objects from his desk -- including a corded phone.
One of the objects McRae threw -- believed to be a tape recorder -- struck reporter Alan Eskew of the Topeka Capital-Journal on the side of his face. There was even some blood.
After kicking everyone out of his office, McRae came back out with a few more choice words, including his memorable parting shot: "Put that in your (expletive) pipe and smoke it!"
Jim Everett sacks Jim Rome, 1994
This one was pretty simple -- and likely planned to some degree in advance.
Sportscaster and talk-show host Jim Rome was just starting to build a name for himself nationally when he invited then-New Orleans Saints quarterback Jim Everett on his ESPN2 show, "Talk 2. "
Rome had been critical of Everett's injuries, often questioning his toughness by calling him "Chris" -- a reference to tennis star Chris Evert. The quarterback didn't appreciate the insinuation, which seems even more juvenile 25 years later.
When the two sat down to do the live interview, Everett warned Rome not to say it to his face. Rome did . . . so Everett flipped over a table between them and tackled the host.
Everett later explained in a teleconference: "I really don't condone my actions, but I was put in a position that I thought was going to be in a journalistic-type interview, and instead, I was put into what I felt was a taunting attack. I don't regret what I did. "
Ryan Leaf melts down, 1998
After a particularly bad game -- even by his standards -- San Diego Chargers quarterback Ryan Leaf just couldn't contain his emotions. The rookie had completed just one of 14 passes for four yards with two interceptions and three lost fumbles. He yelled at a TV cameraman after the game, but that was only the beginning.
The next day in the Chargers' locker room, he singled out reporter Jay Posner of the San Diego Union-Tribune, apparently for writing about the confrontation with the cameraman.
"Don't talk to me, all right? Knock it off!" Leaf screamed before he was restrained by Chargers linebacker Junior Seau.
That incident got Leaf even more negative publicity when it was caught on video and shown on national television.
He later issued a televised apology, after which he crumpled up the paper he was reading and threw it in his locker.
Russell Westbrook's boycott, 2015-
Generally, an athlete-reporter beef stems from a particular incident and is only temporary before one or the other moves on -- either emotionally or physically.
However, the Oklahoma City Thunder guard has held a grudge against columnist Berry Tramel of The Oklahoman for years, refusing to answer his questions or, at most, giving short, one-sentence answers.
Why?
"I just don't like you," Westbrook said after a game in early 2015.
That's about as much insight as Westbrook has shed on the situation -- although Tramel told the Hoops Hype podcast in April he didn't take the insult personally; he felt Westbrook was addressing the media in general.
Nevertheless, the relationship between the two has only gotten worse. Westbrook frequently says, "Next question" whenever Tramel asks him anything in a news conference.
Yet Tramel keeps asking, as he wrote in a recent column, "because the media shouldn’t give in to Westbrook’s desire to control everything. "
Unlike other high-profile confrontations, there's been nothing physical between these two . . . but then again, this feud has lasted far longer.

Texto completo: Alla Ausheva, la madre asesinada en Nueva York junto a sus dos bebés, crimen presuntamente causado por su pareja y colega militar, había recibido su nacionalidad estadounidense durante una ceremonia en la Casa Blanca el 4 de julio de 2012, junto al entonces presidente Barack Obama.
Ausheva (37) y sus hijos Iván (2) y Elia Walker (3) fueron encontrados muertos el sábado en su casa de Staten Island.
La mujer había obtenido una orden de protección contra el padre de los niños, Shane Walker (36), pero ya no estaba vigente, informó The New York Times.
Según una denuncia penal presentada en el Tribunal Penal de Staten Island, Walker inició un incendio en la casa de la pareja en Palisade Street alrededor de las 3 p.m. del viernes cuando “sabía” que Ausheva y los niños estaban dentro.
Aparentemente Ausheva murió apuñalada en el cuello y los niños fueron ahogados.
Ausheva se mudó de San Petersburgo (Rusia) a Queens (NYC) en 2011 y pronto se unió a la Guardia Nacional del Ejército de Nueva York. En 2014 se trasladó a la Guardia Nacional Aérea. Actualmente estaba sirviendo a tiempo completo en una fuerza de seguridad nacional con base en Fort Hamilton, Brooklyn, según una portavoz militar citada por Pix11.
Su pareja, detenido por el crimen, también estaba activo en la Guardia Nacional Aérea. Esta mañana fue formalmente acusado de asesinato, homicidio involuntario, incendio premeditado y posesión criminal de un arma.
“Todos ustedes hicieron algo profundo: eligieron servir”, dijo entonces el presidente Barack Obama a los 25 militares durante la ceremonia de naturalización en 2012. “Te pones el uniforme de un país que aún no es completamente tuyo. Usted mostraron los valores que celebramos cada 4 de julio: deber, responsabilidad y patriotismo”.
Ausheva también era una cantante aficionada, en inglés y ruso.

Texto completo: Alla Ausheva, la madre asesinada en Nueva York junto a sus dos bebés, crimen presuntamente causado por su pareja y colega militar, había recibido su nacionalidad estadounidense durante una ceremonia en la Casa Blanca el 4 de julio de 2012, junto al entonces presidente Barack Obama.
Ausheva (37) y sus hijos Iván (2) y Elia Walker (3) fueron encontrados muertos el sábado en su casa de Staten Island.
La mujer había obtenido una orden de protección contra el padre de los niños, Shane Walker (36), pero ya no estaba vigente, informó The New York Times.
Según una denuncia penal presentada en el Tribunal Penal de Staten Island, Walker inició un incendio en la casa de la pareja en Palisade Street alrededor de las 3 p.m. del viernes cuando “sabía” que Ausheva y los niños estaban dentro.
Aparentemente Ausheva murió apuñalada en el cuello y los niños fueron ahogados.
Ausheva se mudó de San Petersburgo (Rusia) a Queens (NYC) en 2011 y pronto se unió a la Guardia Nacional del Ejército de Nueva York. En 2014 se trasladó a la Guardia Nacional Aérea. Actualmente estaba sirviendo a tiempo completo en una fuerza de seguridad nacional con base en Fort Hamilton, Brooklyn, según una portavoz militar citada por Pix11.
Su pareja, detenido por el crimen, también estaba activo en la Guardia Nacional Aérea. Esta mañana fue formalmente acusado de asesinato, homicidio involuntario, incendio premeditado y posesión criminal de un arma.
“Todos ustedes hicieron algo profundo: eligieron servir”, dijo entonces el presidente Barack Obama a los 25 militares durante la ceremonia de naturalización en 2012. “Te pones el uniforme de un país que aún no es completamente tuyo. Usted mostraron los valores que celebramos cada 4 de julio: deber, responsabilidad y patriotismo”.
Ausheva también era una cantante aficionada, en inglés y ruso.

Texto completo: Corrections and clarifications: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated where the alleged assault occurred. The excerpt said it happened in a dressing room.
WASHINGTON – The accusations poured in one after another.
One woman described Donald Trump forcibly kissing her when she tried to get a job at the Trump Organization. Another said he put his hands under her skirt in a Manhattan nightclub. Others said he groped their breasts, attacked them or watched them change in a dressing room. At least 15 shared similar stories, claiming sexual misconduct by the former real estate tycoon.
Trump denied and fended off the accusations, which came in the aftermath of an "Access Hollywood" tape recorded in 2005 on which he made vulgar comments about groping women.
That tape was released in October 2016, one month before he won the presidency.
After 2½ years in the White House, Trump is fighting a new allegation, lodged by longtime advice columnist E. Jean Carroll. She wrote in a forthcoming book, "What Do We Need Men For? A Modest Proposal," that Trump forced himself on her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room more than 20 years ago. An excerpt from the book was published by New York Magazine and included a photo of Carroll wearing the coat she said she wore the day of the attack.

After 'Access Hollywood' tape: Reports: Multiple women say Trump grabbed them inappropriately
As Democratic challengers to his presidency campaign for the 2020 election, Trump portrayed Carroll as someone whose only motivation is to sell books.
"I have no idea who this woman is," Trump said as he left the White House on Saturday for Camp David. "It is a totally false accusation. " The president alleged Carroll made a habit of accusing men of misdeeds and said "people have to be careful" because "it's happening more and more. "
He downplayed a photo included in the New York Magazine story of Carroll with Trump, saying his back was to the camera and he was with his wife. "Give me a break," he said, repeating that he did not know Carroll. Carroll wrote in the excerpt that she ran into Trump while shopping at the elegant New York City department store in the mid-1990s. She said she greeted him as "that real-estate tycoon," and he greeted her as "that advice lady. " He was looking to buy a present for a "girl" and asked for Carroll's help, she wrote. She pointed out handbags and hats, but Trump pointed out lingerie and asked Carroll to try on a piece, she said. Once inside the dressing room, Carroll claimed, Trump forced himself on her. "The moment the dressing-room door is closed, he lunges at me, pushes me against the wall, hitting my head quite badly, and puts his mouth against my lips," Carroll wrote. "He holds me against the wall with his shoulder and jams his hand under my coat dress and pulls down my tights. " Carroll claimed Trump "opens the overcoat, unzips his pants, and, forcing his fingers around my private area, thrusts his penis halfway – or completely, I’m not certain – inside me. " The episode lasted no longer than three minutes, Carroll said. It was the last time she had sex, she wrote. The incident was not reported to the police, and Carroll said she told only two close friends, whose names were not made public in the story. One told her to go to the police. The other told her to forget about it, she wrote. "She is trying to sell a new book – that should indicate her motivation. It should be sold in the fiction section," Trump said in a statement Friday. "Shame on those who make up false stories of assault to try to get publicity for themselves, or sell a book, or carry out a political agenda. " He pointed out that the department store had no footage of the incident or the pair in the store together and said there was no proof of an assault. New York Magazine, along with other outlets, including The New York Times, talked with the two friends, who verified that Carroll told them her account. Both said they did not want their names publicized for fear of threats. Carroll could not be reached by USA TODAY on Saturday.

Texto completo: The Hard Rock Hotel and Casino is removing liquor dispensers from its Dominican Republic guest rooms as travelers question tourist deaths in the country, and specifically at the Punta Cana report, according to Penelope Polanco, a customer care assistance manager at Hard Rock Punta Cana.
"In the next day, we will proceed with taking the liquor dispensers away from the rooms, because of a final decision from our main offices," Polanco told USA TODAY. She says that the move is being made "for the tranquility of our guests" in the Punta Cana hotel and in three additional Hard Rock hotels in Mexico.
The change in hotel service comes after at least eight Americans have died in the Dominican Republic this year, though officials of the Caribbean vacation destination say that number is not abnormal.
"The Dominican Republic is a safe country," Francisco Javier Garcia, the minister of tourism in the Dominican Republic, told reporters Friday.
The deaths have happened at various locations, and in most of the cases, full toxicology reports are pending.
“There is no such thing as mysterious deaths in the Dominican Republic," Garcia said. "There is not an avalanche of deaths. ”
Last July, David Harrison of Maryland died at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Punta Cana, according to The New York Times and CNN. In April, Robert Wallace, 67, of California, died at the same resort, where he reportedly drank from the room’s minibar.
Polanco insists that the Hard Rock's "quality department investigated and didn't find anything out of our standards" in the liquor dispensers, which will still be made available to guests who order room service. The mini bar, which contains soft drinks and beer, will stay in the Hard Rock rooms.
The FBI is assisting local investigators with toxicological tests in some of the cases, according to the outlets.
A group of 40 graduating seniors and their parents from Deer Creek High School in Edmond, Oklahoma, were staying at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino when at least five members became ill, according to local TV stations KOTV and KOCO.
One of the parents, Liz McLaughlin, told KOTV that her daughter was one of the students to get sick on June 11 after eating at a Japanese restaurant at the hotel.
"We just don’t know what is happening," she said. "Is it the water? Is it the ice? Is it the food? Is it the food handling? Is it the pesticides? We have no idea what’s going on. "
Garcia said the confirmed deaths this year are not out of the ordinary and that the number is lower than in some previous years. Garcia said in both 2011 and 2015 through June, 15 tourists died in the Dominican Republic.
Latest death: Another American has died in the Dominican Republic
The deaths and violence in question
Three Americans have died in the Dominican Republic in June.
Vittorio Caruso, 56, of Long Island died June 17. His sister-in-law, Lisa Maria Caruso, told News 12 Long Island that his family got a phone call telling them he was sick, only to find out minutes later that he died.
Two other people were found dead in their hotel rooms in the Caribbean vacation destination: Joseph Allen, 55, of Woodbridge, New Jersey, and Leyla Cox, 53, of Staten Island, New York.
Cox died on June 10, the State Department confirmed to USA TODAY.
Allen's sister, Jamie Reed, told WABC-TV that his body was discovered the morning of June 13 in his hotel room at Terra Linda Resort in Sosua, located on the country's northern coast. The previous night, he had complained to friends that he felt feverish and went to bed early.
That same week, Dominican native David Ortiz, one of the most popular players in Boston Red Sox history, was shot in his homeland. The country's chief prosecutor said Ortiz was not the intended target of the June 9 shooting that put his life in peril, but was merely the victim of a hit gone wrong.
In May, Maryland couple Edward Nathaniel Holmes, 63, and Cynthia Ann Day, 49, were found dead in their room at Bahía Príncipe hotel at the resort Playa Nueva Romana. Within a week, a woman from Pennsylvania, Miranda Schaup-Werner, 41, died at the same hotel chain.
The Maryland couple who died each had internal bleeding, preliminary autopsy results showed, according to CNN. Holmes was found to have an enlarged heart and cirrhosis of the liver, while Day had fluid in her brain.
Schaup-Werner reportedly died after drinking from her hotel's minibar.
One hotel is disputing the timeline of an alleged attack of a Delaware woman that also made news the week of June 6.
And in April, the brother of "Shark Tank" star Barbara Corcoran, New Jersey-native John Corcoran, also died in the Dominican Republic. But Corcoran said her brother's death was of natural causes related to an existing heart condition.
A man who the State Department has not identified by name also became ill and later died on April 14.
Illness also called into question
Similar to the high-schoolers who fell ill at the Hard Rock Hotel in Punta Cana, a group of Jimmy Buffett fans, members of the Central Oklahoma Parrothead Association, told Oklahoma TV station KFOR and NBC News that they became seriously ill while staying at the Hotel Riu Palace Macao in Punta Cana in April.
More than 40 travelers in the group of 114 experienced similar symptoms, including fever, dizziness and diarrhea.

MEDIA STIR GUN SALES; Coverage after killings tied to buyers' fear of new regs

Texto completo: Media coverage of gun control helps drive up firearms sales after mass shootings, an unintended consequence that's particularly pronounced in states with lax firearms regulations, a New York University study showed Monday.
Published in the journal Nature, researchers using a mathematical model analyzed the links at both national and state levels between January 1999 and December 2017.
"The study found people will tend to buy a gun because they fear their right will be restricted," lead study author Maurizio Porfiri of NYU's Tandon School of Engineering told the Daily News. "It's an important message from our analysis. We cannot exclude they did not [purchase a gun] out of fear, but we didn't find that."
He called the analysis, which was conducted over a year and a half, the first to empirically examine-and confirm-the mathematical link between news stories specifically about gun control policy and an uptick in firearm sales.
The study was led by NYU researchers in collaboration with faculty at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health and Northeastern University.
Porfiri wrote of his interest in the subject in a blog post.
"In 2007, I had just left Virginia Tech when it experienced one of the most gruesome acts of mass violence, one that took the lives of 32 people, including a member of my doctoral committee and a role model for my academic career, Prof. Liviu Librescu," he wrote. "Since then, I always kept in the back of my mind the wish to contribute methodological tools that could help us understand and prevent mass violence."
On Monday, Porfiri told The News that he was "happy" with the results of the study, noting that although there's a correlation between increased gun sales and mass shootings, the researchers found "this correlation is mediated by a third variable, and provides more than a correlation - it provides an explanation and perhaps a possible predictor of gun sales."
The study analyzed three variables: mass shootings, media coverage of gun control policy and regulations, and firearm acquisition. It honed in on 69 mass shootings during the 18-year time frame, scouring coverage in The New York Times and The Washington Post.
The researchers combed through 9,700 documents. They found the most pronounced jumps in firearm background checks in states with the least restrictive gun control policies, including Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Ohio and Oregon.
There were less dramatic rises in states with stronger restrictions on gun ownership, the study found.
"Our study suggests the need for dialogue around how mass shooting events are discussed by the press, in order to find ways to mitigate unintended consequences," James Macinko, a study co-author from the Fielding School, said in NYU's announcement of the study results.

Soros, other ultrarich urge wealth tax on the top 0.1%

Texto completo: A letter signed by nearly 20 of the "richest 1/10 of the richest 1% of Americans" calls for 2020 presidential candidates to create a wealth tax on them and others in their tax bracket.
The 18 names on the letter published Monday include investor George Soros, filmmaker Abigail Disney, Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, philanthropist Agnes Gund and real estate developer Robert Bowditch, among other members of the ultra-wealthy. A 19th simply signed as "Anonymous."
"America has a moral, ethical and economic responsibility to tax our wealth more," they wrote in the letter, which was first reported by The New York Times. "A wealth tax could help address the climate crisis, improve the economy, improve health outcomes, fairly create opportunity, and strengthen our democratic freedoms."
The letter describes itself as "nonpartisan" and not "an endorsement of any presidential candidate," though it lists Democrats Elizabeth Warren, Beto O'Rourke and Pete Buttigieg as candidates who have supported a wealth tax. The letter cites Warren's proposed policy – which would tax 75,000 of the wealthiest families in the country at a 2% rate – as a model for a policy that the writers endorse.
"That a moderate tax on a minuscule number of Americans could raise so much revenue simply reflects historic levels of wealth among America's richest," they said.
Bernie Sanders, another Democratic candidate who has advocated for higher taxes on the wealthy, announced a student loan debt proposal he said would eradicate $1.6 trillion in debt from 45 million Americans.

Texto completo: Author E. Jean Carroll's allegation that she was raped by President Trump 23 years ago is having trouble making its way to the top of the news food chain.
In a forthcoming memoir by Carroll, she describes an encounter with Trump in 1996 -- when he was still a high-profile New York real estate mogul -- at the Bergdorf Goodman department store in Manhattan. Carroll wrote that she was assaulted by Trump in a store dressing room after a friendly encounter.
Carroll is among more than a dozen women who've accused Trump of sexual assault or making unwanted advances. Trump has denied the claims.

But Carroll's story, which first appeared in a New York Magazine excerpt released Friday night, got little traction on a busy weekend for political news -- which included Trump's response to Iran shooting down a U.S. military drone and Democratic presidential candidate South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg dealing with a police shooting crisis in his city.
As of Monday, Carroll had done interviews on two MSNBC programs and on the CNN morning program "New Day." Carroll also gave an interview to "NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt," and her story was reported on "CBS Evening News."
Carroll's appearances were not enough for a number of media critics who started weighing in on Monday that the story had gotten short shrift -- most notably by not getting discussed on the influential Sunday morning public affairs programs.
"Carroll's story got about as much coverage as the average Trump tweet," Ryan Cooper wrote in The Week.
CBS, ABC and NBC declined to comment.
"I can't say I know what the correct amount of press coverage for this story should be," added Jonathan Bernstein in Bloomberg Opinion. "I can say that if the president is a rapist, it should have scream-from-the-mountaintops importance."
Major newspapers were cautious as well. The story did not appear on the Saturday print front pages of the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal or the Los Angeles Times, which picked up a New York Daily News report on the allegation.
After hearing complaints from readers, New York Times editor in chief Dean Baquet issued a note Monday saying Carroll's story "should have been presented more prominently, with a headline on the Times' home page."
Baquet said the Times was not able to find independent sources corroborating Carroll's story beyond the two friends she cited in her book. But Carroll being a well-known figure making a public allegation against a sitting president "should've compelled us to play it bigger."
But after three years, there is also a sense that accusations or reports on Trump's behavior no longer capture the attention of the public. Trump was elected in 2016 despite the leak of an "Access Hollywood" tape on which he bragged about sexually assaulting women.
"It could be a case of fatigue," the Columbia Journalism Review wrote in its missive complaining that Carroll's story was being ignored. "We are hit so often with claims of Trump's misconduct -- and liberals, at least, have such low expectations of him -- that horrifying allegations lose their shock value and slide off."
It's possible the story could get new life after Trump's Monday interview with The Hill in which he denied the incident with Carroll. "I'll say it with great respect: Number one, she's not my type," the president said. "Number two, it never happened. It never happened, OK?"

Texto completo: The Boston Globe on Monday announced that Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Mike Stanton and Christine Haughney Dare-Bryan, the creative force behind the Netflix investigative series “Rotten," have been selected as the news organization's new Spotlight Fellows.
The Spotlight Fellowship, now in its fourth year, is funded by Participant Media, co-producer of “Spotlight," the Academy Award-winning movie about the famous Boston Globe Spotlight Team. The movie tells the story of the team's best-known investigation, exposing the coverup of the sexual molestation of thousands of children by generations of bishops and cardinals in the Catholic Archdiocese of Boston.
Spotlight Fellows have the opportunity to work directly with journalists at the Globe on an investigation of their choosing.
“Mike and Christine really stood out in an exceptionally talented field," said Scott Allen, the Globe's assistant managing editor for investigations. “Eighty-five journalists from all over the country applied for the fellowship, including authors of books and winners of major awards."
“We are so proud to support this year's Spotlight Fellows," said David Linde, CEO of Participant Media. “The journalists selected are proven defenders of the First Amendment who hold institutions accountable for their actions and behaviors. Their contribution to protecting democracy and everyday Americans is more vital than ever today."
Stanton, a journalism professor at the University of Connecticut, was a longtime investigative reporter and team leader at the Providence Journal, where he shared the 1994 Pulitzer Prize for exposing corruption on the Rhode Island Supreme Court. He also wrote the New York Times best-selling book, “The Prince of Providence," about Buddy Cianci, which is being adapted to the stage by Trinity Repertory Company in Providence this fall. His second book, “Unbeaten: Rocky Marciano's Fight for Perfection In A Crooked World," was named one of the best books of 2018 by the Telegraph in London, the Boston Globe, and others.
Haughney Dare-Bryan is a former New York Times reporter who conceived, developed, and produced the web series that became Netflix's “Rotten," about our badly flawed food supply system. She has been intimately involved in developing the series, which one reviewer said “manages to use the immediacy of the dinner table as a way to reshape the conversation about what we put in our bodies." She has worked as a reporter for Politico, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post.
Past Spotlight Fellowships have produced award-winning work, including “Secrets in the sky" by Jaimi Dowdell and Kelly Carr, and “Quiet skies" by Jana Winter. For more information about the fellowship program, go to www.spotlightfellowship.com.

'A song is never just a song'

Texto completo: She was one of the most popular performers of her era – a patriotic woman who sang in a rich contralto and was, for a time, one of the most ubiquitous singers on radio.
More than three decades after her death, she became a controversial figure in the world of sports, almost overnight.
Kate Smith and her popular rendition of "God Bless America" were cast aside by the New York Yankees and Philadelphia Flyers in April after the organizations discovered she had performed songs with racist lyrics in the early 1930s. The Flyers removed a statue of Smith that had been erected in front of their arena to honor her role as an unofficial good luck charm for the team.
Smith's closest living relatives – niece Suzy Andron and her husband, Bob – told USA TODAY Sports they were "heartbroken" by the developments. Defenders such as the Kate Smith Commemorative Society said the Flyers and Yankees were wrong to judge the singer's actions in the 1930s by the standards of today.
Others pointed to the titles and lyrics of two songs she performed – "That's Why Darkies Were Born" and "Pickaninnies' Heaven" – as evidence of overt racism, for which they said Smith should be held accountable.
Music historians told USA TODAY Sports they believe the conversation lacks context, from the sports owner who helped steer her career to disturbing musical tendencies at the time.
History, they said, offers a possible explanation for Smith's song selection – but it also illustrates the deep roots of racism in American music.
A manager's influence
Smith grew up in the Washington area and was 19 years old when she got her start on Broadway, in a musical comedy called "Honeymoon Lane." Critics generally loved her performance, according to reviews of the show, but they also mocked her because she was overweight – a trait with which she struggled throughout her career.
It took four years for the singer to find someone who she believed would take her seriously: an executive at Columbia Records named Ted Collins.
Collins became Smith's manager in 1930 after seeing her perform on Broadway, and he helped shape her career for more than three decades thereafter. He also became the sole or co-owner of several sports teams, according to The New York Times – including the New York Celtics, a long-defunct basketball team, and the Boston Yanks, an NFL team that folded in 1952.
Michael Pitts, the author of "Kate Smith: A Bio-Bibliography," said Smith and Collins were extremely close. They never had a written contract and split Smith's earnings down the middle until Collins' death in 1964.
Smith wrote in her 1960 autobiography, "Upon My Lips a Song," that she came to trust her manager so completely that she "often didn't know what shows he had signed up for until we went into rehearsal."
"He has picked all my songs, and never picked one which wasn't successful," Smith wrote. "He is able to listen to a song when a composer brings it to him and say immediately whether it will go over with the public or not."
Smith was less than two years into her partnership with Collins when she recorded "That's Why Darkies Were Born" in 1931, when she was 24. Todd Decker, a professor of musicology and American culture studies at Washington University in St. Louis, said the song was first written for Broadway and sung by Everett Marshall, a white baritone who performed it in blackface. It became a "minor hit" for Smith in the early 1930s, Decker said.
"I think often singers in this period were looking for popular songs that let them sort of reveal the power and size of their voice," Decker explained. "I think the choice of the song was probably driven more by 'this fits your voice' than it was by 'this fits your racist ideology.' But of course, she sang the song."
"Pickaninnies' Heaven" was written by Sam Coslow, a white man, for Smith's 1933 movie "Hello Everybody!" She performs the song in the film for a group of African American children at an orphanage, telling them about a mythical place with "great big watermelons" and "pork chop bushes growin' right outside your doorway."
'Deep racism in pop culture'
Historians said such songs were hardly outliers in the 1930s.
As African Americans migrated in large numbers from the South to Northern cities such as New York, Decker said, white songwriters took to writing lyrics from a black perspective that expressed a sort of manufactured nostalgia for the South – songs with fatalistic and often spiteful messages of African Americans being "fated to work the land, fated to be where they are, to never change."
"That was part of the popular music repertoire," said Naomi Andr , an associate professor of Afro-American and African Studies and Women's Studies at the University of Michigan.
Yet even among other racist popular songs in the time period, Decker said, "That's Why Darkies Were Born" stood out because it put the racism unambiguously front and center – as opposed to songs such as "Ol' Man River" and "When It's Sleepy Time Down South," which expressed the same general theme in a less obvious way.
Make no mistake, Decker said: "That's Why Darkies Were Born" isn't just racist in retrospect. It was openly criticized as racist by African American audiences in the early 1930s, too.
Singer Mildred Bailey received a wave of letters urging her to stop performing the song in 1931, according to Variety magazine, and African Americans called for radio stations to take it off the air. When a white actor hired by New Jersey's governor tried to perform the song for an African American company of the New Jersey State Militia in 1935 – entertainment that was intended to boost morale – the soldiers booed and walked out, according to The Philadelphia Tribune.
"There are other pop songs and other popular songs that a lot of revered performers have sung that express exactly the same set of ideas. They just don't do it quite so blatantly," Decker said. "A song like 'That's Why Darkies Were Born' really reveals the deep racism in pop culture from this period that still is part of the landscape."
Sports connection
For some music historians, the most surprising thing about the Smith controversy is that she somehow became a figure in the world of sports.
The Flyers first played Smith's version of "God Bless America" before a game in 1969. As the team kept playing her recording of the song, and kept winning, the singer came to be revered as a lucky mascot of sorts. She even performed it live before playoff games. The Yankees started playing Smith's version of "God Bless America" during the seventh-inning stretch after Sept.11, 2001, as a display of patriotism.
New York said in a statement in April that "no final conclusions have been made" about whether it will play the song at Yankee Stadium again. The team has not replied to emails seeking an update in the months since.
"A song is never just a song," Redmond wrote in an email. "I commend both (the Flyers and Yankees) for taking the music seriously. Their actions reflect the fact that music makes meaning, and what those songs mean is antithetical to societal demands for equality and justice."
It is unclear whether Smith ever expressed regret about her performance of those two racist songs – or about her decisions to perform in blackface during a 1929 musical and lend her likeness to an ad for a "mammy doll" in 1939. Her niece, Suzy Andron, said the two never spoke about those songs, but Smith "didn't see a person's color."
Ultimately, Andr said, the Smith controversy points to the broader history of racism in American music – which stretches far beyond one singer.
"History is really the story we tell," Andr said. "And if we erase all these things, we can pretend, fool ourselves that they were the good old days, and history was a comfort thing. But there was a lot of difficulty in the past, and a lot of voices that were threatened.
"So I think anything that talks about Kate Smith, it's important to mention that larger context – not to portray her as good or bad but to say that this is a complicated history we've inherited."

Texto completo: What's on TV
THE HILLS: NEW BEGINNINGS 10 p.m. on MTV. More than 10 years have passed since "The Hills," a "Laguna Beach" spinoff, helped make Lauren Conrad, Heidi Montag, Whitney Port, Audrina Patridge and Spencer Pratt household names. The reality show followed the gang around Los Angeles where they "learned to live on camera" and eventually "became 'brands,"' Irina Aleksander wrote in The New York Times Magazine. "The show itself marked the dawn of the sort of glossy programming that would later subsume networks like E! and Bravo." Now, much of the original cast is reuniting for "New Beginnings," including Brody Jenner, a satellite member of the Kardashian clan, as well as newcomers Brandon Thomas Lee, the eldest son of Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee, and Mischa Barton, a star of the scripted series "The O.C." Much like MTV's "Jersey Shore" reboot, the show focuses on how its cast members are navigating marriage, sobriety and fame.
YEARS AND YEARS 9 p.m. on HBO; Stream on HBO platforms. This limited series stars Emma Thompson as a Trumpian political figure, whose polarizing opinions (like requiring an I.Q. test to vote) leave Britain divided in an alternate 2019. Across six episodes, the series follows one Manchester family over the subsequent 15 years, exploring how they react to the political turmoil, new technological advancements and economic changes. Created by Russell T Davies, the writer behind "Queer as Folk," "A Very English Scandal" and the David Tennant "Doctor Who" years, the series might conjure comparisons to "This Is Us," mixed with dystopian elements of "Black Mirror."
What's Streaming
DARK Stream on Netflix. The first season of this German psychological thriller opens as a murder mystery and evolves into a full-blown time-travel epic. When a high schooler discovers that a young boy hasn't just gone missing, but has actually traveled back in time, he uncovers a mystery that reaches back generations, and ultimately affects the fate of everyone in his small town. The series sends its characters traveling between three different coordinates in time -- where they meet their ancestors as well as stumble across their future selves -- and poses mind-bending theories of how one small act can change the course of human history. The second season picks up sometime in the future, after what appears to be an accident at the town's nuclear power plant. It's a perfect show for fans of "Stranger Things," "Chernobyl" and European crime thrillers like "Broadchurch."
JULIET, NAKED (2018) Stream on Amazon and Hulu; Purchase on Amazon, Google Play and YouTube. This romantic comedy, based on a Nick Hornby novel, centers on an incredible love triangle: a music superfan, his girlfriend and his idol. Chris O'Dowd plays the oblivious boyfriend to Annie (Rose Byrne), and runs an obsessive fan site for the '90s rocker Tucker Crowe (Ethan Hawke). When Annie posts a negative review of a bootleg Crowe CD online, the musician emerges from obscurity to respond. The two strike up an intercontinental email correspondence that leads to an in-person flirtation when the musician winds up in the couple's coastal English town.

Texto completo: A team of veteran reporters from the USA TODAY NETWORK's Northeast Metro Group teamed up to investigate who is getting the billions of dollars set aside to clean up the nation's closed and decommissioned nuclear plants and how that process is being handled.
Our reporters who tackled the project:
Tom Zambito has been an investigative reporter with The Journal News/lohud and the USA TODAY NETWORK since August 2015.
In a 33-year career, Zambito has had stints at The Record, the New York Daily News, Newsday and the Star-Ledger (nj.com). His current focus is transportation and energy.
Zambito's work has been recognized with more than three dozen writing awards, among them honors from press associations in three states as well as Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE), The Associated Press, the Deadline Club, the American Bar Association, the National Press Club, the New York City Police Department Emerald Society and the Society of the Silurians.
Amanda Oglesby is an Ocean County, New Jersey, native who covers the environment for the Asbury Park Press and the USA TODAY NETWORK New Jersey. She has covered the Oyster Creek nuclear power plant, the Pine Barrens and other news for the Press since 2008. She is a Rutgers University graduate who studied journalism and environmental policy before starting her reporting career.

Texto completo: In “The Thirteenth Child,” prepare for an edge-of-your-seat thriller. In 2016, Danish composer Poul Ruders read a cryptic short story by the Brothers Grimm and turned it into a fairy tale opera.
“It was the once-upon-a-time elements that drew me to one of the lesser-known Brothers Grimm stories, ‘The Twelve Brothers',” Ruders said.
The opera is not based on the original story, but suggested by it, Ruders said.
The first act spans 18 years from the birth of the main character Princess Lyra, the 13th child in the title. The libretto takes Lyra through the deaths of both her father, King Hjarne, and of her mother, Queen Gertrude. By the second act, Lyra's brothers have been turned into ravens by an evil spell. If Lyra utters a single word, they will remain that way, never returning to human form.
Ruders described the music as “ear candy with chile peppers.”
Canadian soprano and a winner of the 2017 Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions, Kirsten MacKinnon will star as Lyra. Mezzo-soprano Tamara Mumford will make her Santa Fe debut as Queen Gertrude. Tenor Joshua Dennis is Frederic and Metropolitan Opera tenor (“The Magic Flute,” “Tosca”) Bradley Garvin will sing Drokan. New York bass David Leigh will play King Hjarne in his Santa Fe Opera debut.
One of today's most highly acclaimed composers, Ruders wrote “The Handmaid's Tale,” hailed as a “riveting, kaleidoscopic score” by the New York Times. “The Thirteenth Child” is his fifth opera and Santa Fe's 16th world premiere.

China’s Great Firewall and the end of globalization

Texto completo: The Great Firewall of China—Beijing’s AI-powered website blocker, used to shut down Western media penetration—is spelling an end to the era of globalization. While digital tech encompasses the world, the East and the West have hardened into two separate spheres. There is no looking back.
Through the Great Firewall, China’s leadership has turned off nearly every major English-language news outlet, from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal on down. The Washington Post and the Guardian, two of the last survivors, were zeroed our in time for the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.
Social media has not been spared. All the big US platforms and services, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, are access denied; group chat applications like WhatsApp are firmly out of reach.
Companies including Google have struggled, sometimes secretly, to figure out how to get back into the Chinese market, even if it means working on much cozier or even riskier terms with the country’s military than Americans—and their own workers—are ready to tolerate. The dream of one globally integrated world, networks and ultimately controlled by the masters of the internet, dies hard.
But it has died. Nowhere is the digital divide between East and West sharper than it is where Hong Kong stops and the rest of China begins. Rebellion against a draconian extradition law that would see Hong Kong residents spirited away to the mainland for punishment made national Western headlines, with huge crowds spilling into the streets—and voluntarily shutting down their own online activity to frustrate or defeat Chinese monitoring.
That’s a long way from the days of the Arab Spring, when autocratic regimes put their internets on lockdown to stop protests from mobilizing into more serious political opposition. Today, governments have learned how to reassert sovereignty over their digital domains—not just how to pull the plug.
But for China the two are hardly mutually exclusive. The goal is no Western media, just as Western religion, which is seen to breed rampant heresy, instability, and factionalism, is being all but expunged from the country. China’s digital plan is to remoralize its billion-plus population before venality and vice wrecks civil society.
That’s frighteningly Orwellian to the West. In China, by contrast, the Orwellian imagination is unwelcome: both the fear of servility and the fear of mastery at the heart of 1984. Technological times have changed since Orwell’s day—digital rule is about the triumph of machine memory, not of Big Brother’s compulsory fantasies—but in the West, the dystopian vision endures. In China, no such millennia-old tradition of the slavery-and-mastery morality play exists.
It’s not that the Chinese can have no appreciation for freedom, of course; it’s that their experience with digital will simply not shape them and be shaped by them in the same way as we in the West will ours.
That alone marks a harsh lesson for Western elites. Those clinging bitterly to certitudes that more modernization, more money, or more engagement will eventually bring down the autocratic regime in favor of Western-style democracy are indulging in a fantasy every bit as dangerous as 2 + 2 = 5.
In technology, leading Westerners are beside themselves to see Chinese researchers and companies being squeezed out from American positions. But China has so penetrated strategic American tech and science that it would be negligent at best not to do so.
In academia, leading Westerners fear that the loss of lucrative Chinese students and access to brilliant Chinese graduate students will gobble America’s development of next-generation tools and patents. But the West has grown too lazy and comfortable leaning on outside talent while home-grown students become over-credentialed and under-employable ingrates with a resentful sense of entitlement and little game plan for the future.
And in entertainment media, leading Westerners have grown similarly dependent on “international”—read Chinese—audiences to prop up box office numbers, make movies marketable and produceable, and sustain the illusion that Hollywood and its power brokers hold real cultural authority in America and beyond. But the reality of a contracting and consolidating industry with little to say about life besides formulaic and narrow-cast cultural politics is inescapable.
The message China has sent the West’s elite, in other words, is painfully simple: you need us more than we need you. And the West agrees. It is Western elites, not Chinese ones, who are still hung up on the utopian dream of creating one harmonious and standardized world. China’s bid for international power hinges on its domestic priorities of preventing chaos, civil strife, and the collapse of its sovereignty; if Beijing thought it could lock its power in and fully establish state morality through the populace without a hugely risky intercontinental economic and infrastructure program, it likely would have gone in that direction. It didn’t.
And the West? It harbors three leading assets over the Chinese: its media apparatus, its military capability, and its financial power. Of these, the first has effectively been neutralized in China. The third is holding steady, but the second is showing cracks in its mystique. If China can use technology to make its absolute sovereign control over its culture and morality complete, it will consider itself to have the upper hand.
And if the West continues to fragment into weak and Balkanized camps dominated by bureaucratic revolutionaries at odds with their country’s histories and cultures, and ultimately their own countrymen, the Chinese will be right.

Why I’m not celebrating Harvard’s snub of Parkland teen

Texto completo: html> I’ve been nagged by a smidgen of sympathy for Kyle Kashuv, the token conservative from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland.
Kashuv had his acceptance to Harvard University rescinded following national exposure of what he thought were private online conversations he had a year and a half ago when he was 16.
Three months before the massacre at his school — one that would eventually provide a portal for him and some of his classmates to become instant public figures — Kashuv was just another over-privileged South Florida kid mouthing off like an ignoramus to his friends.
While studying for an AP history exam at midnight with this friends, Kashuv created a permanent record of his juvenile, racist views, by among other things, spelling out the full N-word racial epithet 11 times in a row.
“I’m really good at typing,” he added. “Practice uhhhhhh makes perfect.”
It wasn’t a lone incident of acting out. Months later, acquaintances would recall other bigoted or racist comments he had made. By then, Kashuv had become a near-overnight political figure with a national forum.
While most of his Parkland schoolmates — most notably David Hogg, Emma Gonzalez, and Cameron Kasky — turned their survivor experience into a call for more gun control, Kashuv used the moment to become a vocal proponent for gun rights.
In the battle for public opinion in the wake of the shooting, Kashuv was embraced by groups on the political right as the rare sort of Parkland student they found useful.
That propelled him to multiple appearances on Fox
News and meetings with U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and Vice President Mike Pence.
White House adviser Kellyanne Conway took him under her wing. And within a month after the shooting, Kashuv was the only Parkland student invited to the Oval Office, where he posed for photos and discussed public policy with President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump.
“They’re true patriots,” Kashuv tweeted about the Trumps.
Turning Point USA also latched onto Kashuv. The Republican-megadonor-supported group with the motto “Big Government Sucks” has chapters in American colleges and universities to promote conservative views. Turning Point USA made Kashuv its high school outreach director and sent him around the country to give recruiting speeches to other high schoolers.
Kashuv's celebrity attracted more than 300,000 followers of his Twitter account.
In April, the National Rifle Association invited Kashuv to speak at its annual convention.
“Gun control is not only ineffective, it’s entirely dangerous,” Kashuv said in his NRA speech. “Why is it that every time there’s a shooting by some crazy gunman do we turn and disarm law-abiding citizens?”
While Kashuv was delivering the rhetorical goods to a constellation of right-wing organizations, he was also trying to get admitted to that bastion of the political left, Harvard University, after high school graduation this spring.
Harvard accepted Kashuv for admission earlier this year. A few months later, the racist babble from his pre-massacre days surfaced in screenshots he couldn’t deny.
That prompted Harvard officials to send Kashuv a letter, advising the teenager to explain the “offensive statements” attributed to him.
“As you know, Harvard reserves the right to withdraw an offer of admission under various conditions, including ‘if you engage or have engaged in behavior that brings into question your honesty, maturity, or moral character,’” the letter said.
Kashuv wrote a contrite and lengthy response, explaining that his racist comments were a product of his pre-massacre mindset, and that he had grown since then.
“I was part of a group in which we used abhorrent racial slurs,” he wrote. “We did so out of a misplaced sense of humor: we treated the words themselves as though they bore little weight, and used them only for their shock value.
“Looking back two years later, I cannot recognize that person.”
He also went on to point out that Harvard itself had a “checkered past” of having faculty members that included “slave owners, segregationists, bigots and anti-Semites.”
But he was doomed. The thing that made him stand out enough to get an acceptance letter from Harvard — his status as a national voice — was rapidly evaporating.
Even those on the right were abandoning him. He lost his position at Turning Point USA. And such outspoken conservative commentators as Laura Loomer were showing him no sympathy.
“There are kids who work their a-- off and don’t use the death of 17 people as a résumé holder and kids who don’t call black people the N word who deserve to go to Harvard,” Loomer wrote. “I’d much rather a poor black student get Kyle’s position at Harvard.”
So would I. And yet, a part of me sympathizes with Kashuv, and for that matter, any other teenager who would be held up to an “offensive statements” standard of judgment. Here’s why.
Kids are a product of their upbringing. If white teenagers imagine that they need to express themselves by using racial epithets, that says more about the environment they’ve grown up in, than themselves. It doesn’t mean they’re going to be lifelong racists.
The criminal justice system treats minors differently, making them immune (except in rare cases) from criminal sanctions imposed on adults. Why shouldn't the social justice system work the same way?
I also found myself thinking about Derek Black of West Palm Beach, the son of the founder of the racist website, Stormfront, and godchild of former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke. The young Black was slated to be a future leader of the white nationalist movement in the United States.
Instead, he went off to New College of Florida in Sarasota, living among people his age that he had been taught to hate. The experience made him realize that the racist views he’d been marinating in were wrong.
“Through many talks with devoted and diverse people there — people who chose to invite me into their dorms and conversations rather than ostracize me — I began to realize the damage I had done,” Black wrote in an op-ed piece in The New York Times three years ago. “Ever since, I have been trying to make up for it.”
Harvard may have been a similarly redemptive experience for Kashuv. But we’ll never know.
Because at 16, he did something privately that violated the boundaries of the thought police.

Texto completo: You may have read "Beloved," clutched "The Bluest Eye" to your chest or memorized "Song of Solomon" — but do you know the history of Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison?
A new documentary, "Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am" (in theaters Friday in New York and Los Angeles, expands through summer), seeks to demystify the acclaimed 88-year-old writer, digging into her personal history, showcasing how her work probes the interior lives of African Americans and highlighting the moments in her remarkable career that became touchstones.
Here are five things you probably don't know about Morrison, from how her friendship with Oprah Winfrey started to how she worked her magic on Muhammad Ali.
1. Toni Morrison worked as an editor for years while also writing her own books Morrison began her career as a professor at Howard University, before spotting a classified ad in The New York Review of Books in 1965 for a book editor in Syracuse. That imprint soon was acquired by Random House, sending Morrison to New York, where the single mother of two sons nurtured many influential black writers, including Toni Cade Bambara, Gayl Jones and Lucille Clifton. But at night, she worked on her own books. "Editors are not writers. So I don't tell anybody," she says.
Fun fact: She convinced secretaries to type up her manuscript for 1970's "The Bluest Eye" by baking the ladies one of her famous carrot cakes.
2. She was castigated by early critics for not writing about white people In a 1973 review of "Sula," The New York Times criticized Morrison, saying her work was boxed in by her insistence on writing about her own community — without including confrontation with whites. "Toni Morrison is far too talented to remain only a marvelous reporter of the black side of provincial American life," wrote the critic.
In the documentary, Morrison addresses such claims. "I have had reviews in the past that have accused me of not writing about white people ... as though our lives have no meaning and no depth without the white gaze," she says plainly. "I have spent my entire writing life trying to make sure that the white gaze was not the dominant one in any of my books."
3. She went on a book tour with Muhammad Ali While promoting Ali's book "The Greatest: My Own Story," the two got off to a rocky start. "When I first met him and asked him a question, he would answer and look at a man and never looked directly at me while he was giving the answer. But then I remembered he respects older women," Morrison recalls, saying she realized she should act more like his mother. "So I just crossed my arms as I walked in the room and said, 'Ali, get up from there, you have something to do.' And he would look up and recognize ... a grown-up. And from then on, he did everything I said," she chuckles.
4. Oprah got creative trying to get her phone number After reading "Beloved," Oprah wanted to call Morrison personally, but the famous author's number was unlisted. So the TV star called the fire department and asked for it.
Morrison remembers picking up the phone. "She said, 'Toni Morrison, this is Oprah Winfrey.' I said, 'How did you get my number?'" she laughs. Oprah made her pitch to turn "Beloved" into a movie, ultimately convincing a skeptical Morrison. Oprah made the 1998 film and starred as Sethe, an escaped slave who murders her own daughter rather than see her child returned to a Kentucky plantation to live as a slave.
5. Morrison called time's up on equal pay in the 1970s "Navigating a white male world was not threatening; it wasn't even interesting," says Morrison candidly, recalling her first job as an editor. "I knew more than they did and I wasn't afraid to show it. You have to be a little tough and rely on yourself, and tell people 'no.'"
In her first job, the single mom noticed her male counterparts were getting bigger raises. "So I went to my boss and I said, 'You didn't raise me as much as my colleagues who are men.' He said. 'Yes, but.' And I said, 'I don't want to hear 'but.' I want to tell you something: I am head of the household. Just. Like. You."
She got the money.
Toni Morrison's life is explored in the new documentary "Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am."

Texto completo: A class-action lawsuit seeking at least $100 million in damages was filed Friday against Universal Music Group on behalf of artists including rock bands Soundgarden and Hole, the estates of rapper Tupac Shakur and rocker Tom Petty, and country-rock singer-songwriter Steve Earle over a 2008 fire in Los Angeles in which master recordings made by those artists are alleged to have been destroyed.
It's the first legal action taken since news surfaced last week of the extent of damage from the June 1, 2008, blaze that decimated a storage facility on the lot at Universal Studios Hollywood that housed a trove of recordings in UMG's possession.
The suit, filed in U.S. Central District Court in Los Angeles by three law firms, states that Universal Music owes their clients, and others still to be identified, half of a confidential settlement UMG negotiated with its sister company, Universal Studios, estimated in the court papers to be worth at least $150 million.

Representatives for Universal Music Group could not be reached for comment.
The action also argues that artists are contractually entitled to 50% of an additional insurance settlement UMG is said to have received for losses sustained in the fire -- losses the lawsuit argues were intentionally withheld from the music community, as well as from the public.
"Yet," the complaint charges, "even as it kept plaintiffs in the dark and misrepresented the extent of the losses, UMG successfully pursued litigation and insurance claims it was recently reported to have valued at $150 million to recoup the value of the master records.
"UMG concealed its massive recovery from plaintiffs, apparently hoping it could keep it all to itself by burying the truth in sealed court filings and a confidential settlement agreement," the suit states. "Most importantly, UMG did not share any of its recovery with plaintiffs, the artists whose life works were destroyed in the fire -- even though, by the terms of their recording contracts, plaintiffs are entitled to 50% of those proceeds and payments."
Precisely how many recordings were destroyed and which artists and titles were impacted has never been detailed to the public, but Friday's lawsuit alleges that "UMG, in fact, claims to have created what it internally called a 'God List' that purports to identify with 'reasonable certainty' an inventory of all Master Recordings destroyed in the Fire."
An investigation published June 11 by the New York Times Magazine estimated that as many as 500,000 recordings were destroyed and that a partial list of artists whose works were among those reduced to ashes includes Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday, Bing Crosby, Judy Garland, Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly, Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, Nirvana, Duke Ellington, John Coltrane and Count Basie.
Historic individual recordings listed among those destroyed in that report include Bill Haley & His Comets' "Rock Around the Clock," the Kingsmen's "Louie Louie," Etta James' "At Last," Curtis Mayfield & the Impressions' "People Get Ready," Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats' "Rocket 88" and Bo Diddley's "Bo Diddley/I'm a Man."
UMG quickly took issue with the report, citing, "numerous inaccuracies, misleading statements, contradictions and fundamental misunderstandings of the scope of the incident and affected assets" in a statement issued last week.
The suit, filed jointly by King, Holmes, Paterno & Soriano, McPherson and Susman Godfrey, all Los Angeles-based firms, alleges that UMG did not take "all reasonable steps to make sure [master recordings] are not damaged, abused, destroyed, wasted, lost or stolen" and "it did not 'speak up immediately [when it saw] abuse or misuse' of assets."
The complaint describes the Universal Studios vault that housed the recordings as "an inadequate, substandard storage warehouse... that was a known firetrap...."
"Immediately after the fire," according to the court filing, "UMG embarked on a systematic and fraudulent scheme of misrepresentation and misdirection designed to conceal the loss of the master recordings destroyed in the fire."
The filing then quotes from contemporaneous reports in the Los Angeles Times, Billboard, the New York Daily News and New York Times in which representatives for Universal Music downplayed the severity of the damage.
"At this point, it appears that the fire consumed no irreplaceable master recordings, just copies," a 2008 L.A. Times editorial stated.
"The studio and the record company both are fortunate enough to have the resources to preserve multiple copies of their source materials around the country. They've also been duplicating their recordings in high-quality digital formats, creating additional backups in the event the originals are lost," the editorial added.
"To this day," the complaint states, "UMG has not informed Plaintiffs that any Master Recordings embodying musical works owned by them were destroyed in the fire, and has refused to disclose or account to Plaintiffs for settlement proceeds and insurance payments received by UMG for the loss of the Master Recordings."
Last week, UMG CEO Lucian Grainge instructed his worldwide staff to cooperate fully with any artists seeking information on the status of particular master recordings.
In an internal memo, a copy of which was obtained by The Times, Grainge told employees to direct artists' inquiries to the company's senior vice president of recording studios and archive management, Pat Kraus.
Grainge's message also stressed that "We owe our artists transparency. We owe them answers. I will ensure that the senior management of this company, starting with me, owns this."
The fire took place under a previous UMG administration when Doug Morris was still chairman and chief executive of the world's largest music conglomerate.
Last week, the head of Universal Music's parent company, France-based Vivendi, dismissed the New York Times report as "noise" at a time when Vivendi is seeking to sell off 50% of UMG to help finance other acquisitions.
Various estimates in recent months have placed the value of UMG between $25 billion and $50 billion.
"It's a credit to the leadership of Lucian Grainge," Vivendi CEO Arnaud de Puyfontaine told Variety last week, praising Grainge's handling of the news. "It happened 11 years ago and [recent] headlines are just noise."
Howard King, principal in King, Holmes, Paterno & Soriano, one of the firms that filed the class action suit on Friday, shot back that "the likelihood that their life's works may have been destroyed by the gross negligence of Universal Music is far from 'just noise' to any potentially affected artist.
"It wasn't 'just noise' in 2009 when Universal Music sued NBC Universal, claiming that hundreds of thousands of irreplaceable masters had been lost in the devastating fire. It wasn't 'just noise' when Universal Music collected tens of millions of dollars, or more, in compensation for the lost masters.
"I believe that Mr. De Puyfontaine wishes this would all disappear and not interfere with his financial planning," King said. "This wish will not come true."
Among the plaintiffs are former record executive Tom Whalley -- a trustee of the Afeni Shakur Trust established after the 1996 shooting death of Tupac Shakur -- and Tom Petty's first wife, Jane Petty, over her interest in specific Petty recordings in which she was assigned half interest in the masters for his albums "Damn the Torpedoes, "Full Moon Fever" and "Southern Accents," believed to have been destroyed in the fire.

Leonard isn't only option for Clippers; Team plans to court numerous players, including the highly coveted Raptors star.

Texto completo: Less than an hour after the NBA draft ended Thursday, a night in which the Clippers added two players they'd targeted all along, the team's president of basketball operations walked into a Manhattan Beach hotel conference room energized.
The night had gone as well as Lawrence Frank and his staff could have planned.
Next came the pivot. The NBA's free agency period begins June 30, and just like the draft, the Clippers have targeted a handful of players for months, if not since the team's front office was reshuffled and expanded nearly two years ago. Free agency is not like the draft, where teams hold a measure of control. By mid-July there is no guarantee the Clippers will leave free agency with a bounce in their step, their carefully detailed plan executed as envisioned.

"In the draft the organization chooses the player," Frank said. "In free agency, the player chooses the organization."
With enough salary cap room to sign a star to a maximum salary contract, the Clippers are rapidly approaching the NBA's free agency period confident in their planning but without any clue whether it will pay off.
"All we can do is be ourselves and represent ourselves in the best possible light," Frank said. "And hopefully the players that we're attracted to are also attracted to us and we just keep building."
They are most attracted to NBA Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard, who will hit free agency only weeks after the Moreno Valley-raised forward led Toronto to its first championship. Signing Leonard would represent a coup for a team that has never been a top destination for free agents. Adding a player of his caliber would transform the Clippers -- one of three teams never to appear in a conference finals -- into a Western Conference title contender.
The New York Knicks and Lakers are expected to be granted meetings with Leonard as well, but the race for Leonard's signature has long been considered a two-team fight between the Clippers and Raptors. What he will decide remains anyone's guess.
Frank cautioned that the Clippers "never put all our eggs in one basket" in free agency, and the team, with its projected $52 million in cap space, will court numerous players.
Qualifying offers are expected to be made to guard Rodney McGruder and center Ivica Zubac to make them restricted free agents. Also expected is an attempt to re-sign JaMychal Green, a forward who made a strong impression during three months with the team following a February trade from Memphis. During a first-round playoff matchup against Golden State, the Clippers were most effective when the 6-foot-9 Green was inserted as a small-ball big man. Should Green sign elsewhere, the roster would need another player with similar skills, capable of guarding centers close to the rim while pulling them away from the hoop offensively to open spacing for Clippers' playmakers.
One free agent expected to draw strong interest across the league is forward Al Horford, who declined his contract option with Boston next season worth $30.1 million to seek a longer, more lucrative deal. A New York Times report suggested he did so with the knowledge that at least one offer in the range of four years and $100 million will be waiting. The Clippers are one of the few teams with enough cap space to even consider paying Horford more than $20 million annually, but the fit does not appear seamless. Such an asking price is steep and Horford's age -- he recently turned 33, more than a decade older than the young core the Clippers are building around in hopes of extending their window as a contender as long as possible.
The Clippers will face a difficult decision in what to offer Patrick Beverley. The veteran guard is an unrestricted free agent coming off a strong season in which he served as the Clippers' spark plug and reduced doubts about his ability less than two years after a serious knee injury. Beverley, who will turn 31 in July, has made clear in several interviews since the season's end that he will follow the money. Caught by TMZ cameras waiting for a ride at Los Angeles International Airport this week, Beverley called his summer goal "securing my family's future."
The Clippers never downplayed the Chicago native's importance last season, when Beverley's edge rubbed off on the rest of the locker room. For his part, Beverley has said leaving teammates he has grown close to would be difficult. It remains to be seen how closely the two sides will see eye to eye on his market value.
After the draft, Frank called himself more excited than nervous for free agency, believing in his team's preparation. Left unsaid were other reasons for optimism. Given the team's numerous future draft picks that could be swapped in a trade, free agency isn't the only pathway for the Clippers to potentially acquire a star player. The team could have cap space next summer too.
"However it plays out we just feel very, very confident that we're going to build a sustainable contender," Frank said.
Minutes later, he left the conference room and returned to the team's draft room. A fruitful night was almost over. A world of uncertainty awaited.

Texto completo: Question: Can you tell me the approximate value of old newspapers and magazines? I have the full copy of the New York Times newspaper from April 15, 1865, with the headline "Awful Event, President Lincoln Shot by an Assassin," as well as a newspaper of Kennedy's assassination. I also have old Playboy magazines from the 1950s-'70s.
Answer: Old newspapers covering major events, like the assassinations of Lincoln and Kennedy, the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby, the sinking of the Titanic, the San Francisco earthquake and other major catastrophes, sell for the highest prices.
The front page of the April 15, 1865, New York Times sold at auction for $450 last year. A copy of the same issue, with eight pages, sold for $1,200 three years ago. Most Playboy magazines sell for only a couple of dollars. A collection of 30 magazines sold for $76. But beware, many copies have been made of the famous newspapers. Old newspapers yellow and fall apart unless properly stored.
Q: I am trying to find out what my silver tray is worth. It is oval and has a rope twist rim. There is a mark on the bottom with a three-leaf stem, a crown and a standing lion over two more lions and a star. The mark also has old-English-looking letters: EBM & S.
A: The letters on your tray are actually EGW & S, which stand for E.G. Webster & Son of New York City and Brooklyn. The Elizur G. Webster firm started in New York City in 1860. In 1864, Webster partnered with William Dupree and the firm became Webster & Dupree.
After a few changes in partnerships with William Dupree and Webster's brother Adelbert Webster, E.G. partnered with his son Fred H. Webster in 1886, and the firm became E.G. Webster & Son. E.G. died in 1900. His son continued the business until 1928, when it was sold to International Silver Co. In 1981, it was sold to Oneida. Your tray is silver plate and the pattern is No. 210. The mark dates it from 1886 to 1928.
Medium-size silver-plated serving trays in good condition are worth $35 to $50.
Q: I have an antique buffet that I bought 30 years ago at an antiques shop in Florida. It has two long drawers and two cupboards with interior shelves. There is a paper label that says "Fulton Street at Hoyt, Abraham & Straus, Brooklyn" and "No. 445-1" is burned into the wood. I'd like to know more about the buffet and its value.
A: Abraham & Straus started in 1865 as Wechsler & Straus. The name became Abraham & Straus in 1893 after the Straus family bought out Weschler. It became part of Federated Department Stores in 1900. The name Abraham and Straus continued to be used until 1995.
The number is probably the model number. Your buffet was made in the first half of the 20th century. Many reproductions of earlier styles of furniture were made before 1960. A buffet would sell for about $750-$1,000 depending on style and condition.
Q: Is there any value to an old box of phonograph needles? I have an unopened tin that contains 200 needles. It says "Columbia medium tone needles" on the lid. It says "Brilliant" above that and "Use each needle once only" below. It's yellow with brown and white and has music notes on either side of the writing.
A: Tin phonograph needle cases appeal to people who collect phonographs, music memorabilia or advertising items. The tins are very small, about 2 inches across, and often have attractive graphic designs lithographed on the top and sides. Your tin is from the 1920s and sells online for about $15. The unused needles are also wanted by those who play their old records.
Tip: To get rid of smoke smell, try boiling an onion for an hour or two. Make sure there is enough water so it stays covered while boiling.

Texto completo: Kim Crockett, vice president of a Minnesota think tank, has been placed on an unpaid 30-day disciplinary suspension for comments she made about Somali-Americans in a recent New York Times story examining the resistance to refugee resettlement in St. Cloud.
The article, published Thursday under the headline " 'These People Aren't Coming From Norway': Refugees in a Minnesota City Face a Backlash," quoted several anti-immigration activists who are advocating for an increasingly explicit anti-Muslim agenda. Sources sounded off on their fears that the influx of Somali immigrants to the predominantly white region is fundamentally changing the culture.
Crockett, of the Center of the American Experiment, told the reporter that she plans to challenge the resettlement program in court.
"I think of America, the great assimilator, as a rubber band, but with this -- we're at the breaking point," she was quoted as saying. "These aren't people coming from Norway, let's put it that way. These people are very visible."
The remarks were widely criticized as Islamophobic.
On Thursday, the center issued a statement condemning Crockett's controversial comments.
"Center of the American Experiment welcomes all those who immigrate to Minnesota legally, including Somali refugees," wrote John Hinderaker, president of the Twin Cities-based think tank. "The recent comment one of our employees made to the New York Times does not reflect the views and values of our organization. We envision a Minnesota where everyone is free to reap the rewards of their own efforts and build meaningful lives for their families."
Crockett has apologized for her comments, saying that they don't reflect the views of her employer -- or herself.
"I regret the embarrassment to my colleagues who work so diligently to make our state a better place to live and work for all Minnesotans," she said on social media. "I've always advocated taking personal responsibility for one's actions and will strive to rebuild the relationships and trust that I have damaged."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The accusations poured in one after another.
One woman described Donald Trump forcibly kissing her when she tried to get a job at the Trump Organization. Another said he put his hands under her skirt in a Manhattan nightclub, while others say he groped their breasts, attacked them or watched them change in a dressing room. At least 15 have had shared similar stories, all claiming sexual misconduct by the former real-estate tycoon.
But Trump denied and fended off the accusations, which came in the aftermath of the Access Hollywood tape where he was taped in 2005 making vulgar comments about women and groping them.
That tape was released in October 2016, one month before he'd win the presidency.
Now, after two and a half years in the White House, Trump is fighting a new allegation lodged by longtime advice columnist E. Jean Carroll. She writes in a forthcoming book, "What Do We Need Men For? A Modest Proposal," that Trump forced himself on her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room more than 20 years ago. An excerpt from the book was published by New York Magazine and included a photo of Carroll wearing the coat she says she wore the day of the attack.

After Access Hollywood tape: Reports: Multiple women say Trump grabbed them inappropriately
As Democratic challengers to his presidency continue to campaign for the 2020 election, Trump has gone on a quick defense, painting Carroll as someone whose only motivation is to sell books, a tactic he's used to attempt to disprove unflattering tell-all books written about his presidency and the goings on inside the White House.
"I have no idea who this woman is," Trump told reporters as he left the White House Saturday for Camp David. "It is a totally false accusation. " The president alleged Carroll made a habit of accusing men of misdeeds and said "people have to be careful" because "it's happening more and more" that accusations like this are surfacing.
He downplayed a photo included in the New York Magazine story of Carroll with Trump, telling reporters his back was to the camera and he was with his wife. "Give me a break," he said, again repeating that he did not know her. Carroll described the episode in some detail, writing in the excerpt that she ran into Trump while shopping at the elegant New York City department store in the mid-1990s. She said she greeted him as "that real-estate tycoon," and he greeted her as "that advice lady. " He was looking to buy a present for a "girl" and asked for Carroll's help, she wrote. She pointed out handbags and hats but Trump pointed out lingerie and asked Carroll to try on a piece. Near the dressing room, Carroll claimed Trump forced himself on her. "The moment the dressing-room door is closed, he lunges at me, pushes me against the wall, hitting my head quite badly, and puts his mouth against my lips," Carroll wrote. "He holds me against the wall with his shoulder and jams his hand under my coat dress and pulls down my tights. " That's when Carroll claimed Trump "opens the overcoat, unzips his pants, and, forcing his fingers around my private area, thrusts his penis halfway — or completely, I’m not certain — inside me. " The episode lasted no longer than three minutes, Carroll said. It was the last time she had sex, she wrote. The incident was not reported to the police, and Carroll said she told just two close friends about it, whose names were not made public in the story. One told her to go to the police. The other told her to forget about it, she wrote. On Friday, Trump issued a statement saying Carroll's motivation is selling her book. "She is trying to sell a new book—that should indicate her motivation. It should be sold in the fiction section," Trump said in the statement. "Shame on those who make up false stories of assault to try to get publicity for themselves, or sell a book, or carry out a political agenda. " He pointed out that the department store had no footage of the incident or the pair in the store together and said there was no proof of an assault. New York Magazine, along with other outlets, including the New York Times, talked with the two friends who verified that Carroll told them her account. Both said they did not want their names publicized for fear of threats. Carroll could not be reached by USA TODAY on Saturday.

Texto completo: BEIJING -- Pema Tseden, the Tibetan filmmaker and writer, felt ashamed.
For years, he had written stories and screenplays switching between Chinese and his native Tibetan with a nimble linguistic ambidexterity. But lately, grueling filming and publicity schedules had worn him down, leaving him with the time to write only in Chinese, his second and sometimes preferred working language.
The feeling that he was neglecting his native tongue peaked recently when he found himself at an event to introduce a Tibetan edition of his book "Tharlo," which had been translated from the original Chinese.
"Someone else had to translate my own novel into my native language," the soft-spoken director of critically acclaimed films like "Jinpa" and "Tharlo" said in a recent interview. "It felt a bit absurd."
It seemed almost like a confession of guilt, coming from someone whose Tibetan identity has been central to his work and life. And it underscored the contradictions that crop up regularly for a new generation of Chinese-trained Tibetan filmmakers.
Mr. Tseden, 49, is thought to be the first Tibetan filmmaker working in China to shoot a film entirely in the Tibetan language and the first Tibetan director to graduate from the prestigious Beijing Film Academy.
He is an example of an increasingly rare type in China: an art-house director who has managed to work within the censorship-heavy system while still producing films and stories that resonate with audiences far beyond the system's confines.
He has done so by avoiding overt references to politics in his films, despite pressure from some Tibetans abroad to speak out about what they say are increasingly repressive conditions at home. Though all of his movies are set in Tibet or Tibetan areas -- among the most sensitive topics in China -- they do not mention the Dalai Lama, whom the Chinese government accuses of supporting Tibetan independence, and they rarely depict characters from the Han Chinese ethnic majority.
But most Tibetans agree: Mr. Tseden's films are rare in that they offer a Tibetan's view of Tibet, painting an unvarnished, sometimes angry, portrait of a windswept plateau on the fringes of a fast-encroaching modernity.
"Pema Tseden's films are authentic in the sense that they capture the social issues that bind every Tibetan," said Tsering Shakya, a professor of Tibetan literature and society at the University of British Columbia.
Mr. Shakya pointed to Mr. Tseden's film "Tharlo" about a shepherd who makes a rare trip out of his isolated mountain home to a police station in town where he is told that he must register for a government-issued identity card.
"I know who I am, isn't that enough?" says the unassuming shepherd, played by Shide Nyima.

What may seem like a harmless observation takes on a deeper meaning against a highly politicized background. The Red Army seized Tibet in 1951 and China has ruled it ever since. Tensions have grown in the region since a 2008 rebellion by Tibetans, which prompted a government-led security clampdown and a number of self-immolations by Tibetans in protest.
As a result, some experts say, even being forced to obtain an official identity card can seem like an affront to some Tibetans.
"Every Tibetan knows what it feels like in that moment when the government makes it clear that you are one of its subjects," Mr. Shakya said.
Cerebral and bespectacled, with thick eyebrows and a calm demeanor, Mr. Tseden took a sip of tea in a small rented high-rise apartment in a gated complex not far from Beijing's glamorous shopping and entertainment district. In addition to making films, he is also a prolific writer and translator. The first English-language anthology of his short stories, "Enticement: Stories of Tibet," was published last fall.
Many of Mr. Tseden's stories draw on his experience growing up the son of nomadic herders in Qinghai, high on the Tibetan plateau. Back then in his remote mountainous village, he recalled, books were so rare that a dictionary could be traded for a yak. He credits his grandfather, a monk who had him spend hours after school copying Buddhist scriptures by hand, with instilling in him an appreciation for Tibetan language and culture.
"I think I was a literati in a past life," Mr. Tseden said with a smile.
The first in his family to finish college, Mr. Tseden worked for nearly a decade as a schoolteacher and civil servant in Qinghai before moving to Beijing for film school. He brought with him a desire to break the stereotype of Tibetans encapsulated in "Serfs," the classic 1963 Chinese film about the exploitation of a Tibetan serf and his emancipation by the People's Liberation Army.
"Whenever I introduced myself as a Tibetan in middle school and high school, the first word everyone would blurt out was: 'serf,"' Mr. Tseden said. "For many people, their understanding of Tibet is still stuck on that level."
Through his films, Mr. Tseden sought to portray a Tibet stripped of sentimentality and stereotypes. In "The Silent Holy Stones" (2005), his first feature film, crimson-robed monks binge-watch television shows -- a far cry from the heavenly, mist-shrouded Himalayan paradise of popular Western imagination and the far-flung region of former serfs of popular Chinese imagination.
In September, he won the award for best screenplay in the Orizzonti section of the Venice Film Festival for his latest film, "Jinpa," about a Tibetan truck driver who accidentally runs over a sheep and picks up a hitchhiker who is on a mission to kill his father's murderer. The driver, already worried about bad karma from killing the sheep, wonders if he should stop the murder.
Today, Mr. Tseden is often credited with bringing up an entire film industry on the Tibetan plateau, a region where movies were once so irrelevant that they were synonymous with television shows. His films are now made almost entirely with Tibetan actors and crew members, something that was impossible 20 years ago, he said. He also mentors younger Tibetan filmmakers in China who are striking out on their own, like Sonthar Gyal and Lhapal Gyal.
Because Mr. Tseden's films touch on issues related to ethnic minorities, they are vetted through a stricter-than-usual censorship process. Every line in the script is scrutinized. For inspiration about working within the constraints of overwhelming censorship, Mr. Tseden studied the work of Iranian filmmakers like Abbas Kiarostami and Mohsen Makhmalbaf.
Despite the intense scrutiny, all six of Mr. Tseden's feature films have received the official "dragon seal" of approval from Chinese censors -- a testament, critics say, to the subtlety of his cinematic expression. (His films have had limited box office success in China, though, in part because of their slow pacing and art-house aesthetic.)
In conversation as in his films, Mr. Tseden is cautious. When asked about what some critics say are China's increasingly assimilationist policies toward ethnic minorities, he said that he felt "very helpless." He added, "When you are a relatively small subject and you encounter something with greater power, of course you have no choice but to change and adapt."
But his films can be direct. A sense of despair pervades the 2011 film "Old Dog," in which a shepherd would rather kill his beloved nomad Tibetan mastiff than see it stolen or sold to meet the growing black market demand among Chinese businessmen. "A grim and uncompromising allegory of the waning of Tibetan traditions and values," the critic Jeanette Catsoulis wrote in a New York Times review.
The Tibetan language also features prominently throughout Mr. Tseden's films. His insistence on shooting in Tibetan, particularly his native Amdo dialect, comes as bilingual education for ethnic minorities in China and has been subject to increasing pressure. Last year, a Tibetan entrepreneur was sentenced to five years in prison for campaigning to preserve the Tibetan language in the face of the increasing dominance of Mandarin Chinese.
Though the boundaries of what is acceptable are constantly shifting, for now, Mr. Tseden said, "It's possible to still express yourself without touching on the so-called sensitive stuff."
Several years ago, Mr. Tseden moved from Beijing to Xining, the capital of Qinghai, not far from the secluded mountain village where he grew up. Moving back at a time when more Chinese artists are thinking about moving abroad was a natural decision, he said.
"Being an artist in the system in China is a difficult life," he acknowledged. "But freedom is a relative concept. And this is the land I belong to."

Texto completo: You may have read "Beloved," clutched "The Bluest Eye" to your chest or memorized "Song of Solomon" – but do you know the history of Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison?
A new documentary, "Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am" (in theaters Friday in New York and Los Angeles, expands through summer), seeks to demystify the acclaimed 88-year-old writer, digging into her personal history, showcasing how her work probes the interior lives of African Americans and highlighting the moments in her remarkable career that became touchstones.
Here are five things you probably don't know about Morrison, from how her friendship with Oprah Winfrey started to how she worked her magic on Muhammad Ali.
1. Toni Morrison worked as an editor for years while also writing her own books Morrison began her career as a professor at Howard University, before spotting a classified ad in The New York Review of Books in 1965 for a book editor in Syracuse. That imprint soon was acquired by Random House, sending Morrison to New York, where the single mother of two sons nurtured many influential black writers, including Toni Cade Bambara, Gayl Jones and Lucille Clifton. But at night, she worked on her own books. "Editors are not writers. So I don't tell anybody," she says.
Fun fact: She convinced secretaries to type up her manuscript for 1970's "The Bluest Eye" by baking the ladies one of her famous carrot cakes.
2. She was castigated by early critics for not writing about white people In a 1973 review of "Sula," The New York Times criticized Morrison, saying her work was boxed in by her insistence on writing about her own community – without including confrontation with whites. "Toni Morrison is far too talented to remain only a marvelous reporter of the black side of provincial American life," wrote the critic.
In the documentary, Morrison addresses such claims. "I have had reviews in the past that have accused me of not writing about white people ... as though our lives have no meaning and no depth without the white gaze," she says plainly. "I have spent my entire writing life trying to make sure that the white gaze was not the dominant one in any of my books."
3. She went on a book tour with Muhammad Ali While promoting Ali's book "The Greatest: My Own Story," the two got off to a rocky start. "When I first met him and asked him a question, he would answer and look at a man and never looked directly at me while he was giving the answer. But then I remembered he respects older women," Morrison recalls, saying she realized she should act more like his mother. "So I just crossed my arms as I walked in the room and said, 'Ali, get up from there, you have something to do.' And he would look up and recognize ... a grown-up. And from then on, he did everything I said," she chuckles.
4. Oprah got creative trying to get her phone number After reading "Beloved," Oprah wanted to call Morrison personally, but the famous author's number was unlisted. So the TV star called the fire department and asked for it.
Morrison remembers picking up the phone. "She said, 'Toni Morrison, this is Oprah Winfrey.' I said, 'How did you get my number?' " she laughs. Oprah made her plea to turn "Beloved" into a movie, ultimately convincing a skeptical Morrison. Oprah made the 1998 film and starred as Sethe, an escaped slave who murders her own daughter rather than see her child returned to a Kentucky plantation to live as a slave.
5. Morrison called time's up on equal pay in the 1970s "Navigating a white male world was not threatening; it wasn't even interesting," says Morrison candidly, recalling her first job as an editor. "I knew more than they did and I wasn't afraid to show it. You have to be a little tough and rely on yourself, and tell people 'no.'"
In her first job, the single mom noticed her male counterparts were getting more money when the raises were given out. "So I went to my boss and I said, 'You didn't raise me as much as my colleagues who are men.' He said. 'Yes, but.' And I said, 'I don't want to hear 'but.' I want to tell you something: I am head of the household. Just. Like. You."
She got the money.
Toni Morrison's life is explored in the new documentary "Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am."

Historic Hillsborough mill up for sale

Texto completo: HILLSBOROUGH – Homebuyers who "go against the grain" may consider setting their sights on the Neshanic Mill.
The mill was built more than a century ago, in 1876, near the South Branch of the Raritan River. At the time, it served as a grain mill, grinding grain grown by local farmers into flour. Using the power of the river, a water turbine would turn to power all the other mechanisms of the mill, such as the grain elevator and pulleys to transport the grain.
This continued until the 1940s, when the mill was abandoned because of advances in grain production and manufacturing.
A few decades later, in the 1970s, the mill was purchased by the late Dan Cahill, an architect, and repurposed into a house, renovated with new paint and woodwork.
The mill is one of the most recognizable landmarks in Hillsborough; it's pictured on the "Welcome to Hillsborough" signs and is the centerpiece of the Neshanic Mills Historic District.
A mill has been on the site near a dam across the river since 1810, a half century before the village of Neshanic Station on the other side of the river was established with the coming of the Central Railroad of New Jersey. The original structure was destroyed by fire and rebuilt in 1876.
The mill is next to the Central Railroad of New Jersey bridge over the river. The Somerset County Park Commission is developing a park and recreational area on the Branchburg side of the river next to the Elm Street Bridge.
Vincent Costa, a real estate agent for RE/MAX Competitive Edge, said in the 1990s, after Cahill moved to Florida, the present owner bought the house and refurbished it even more by restoring the field outside the mill, incorporating newer plumbing and modernizing the interior.
What is unique about the property is its open floor plan, which allows for flexibility, he said.
"If you want to put up a wall in one place, you can. If you don't want to, you don't have to," Costa said. "There's a uniqueness in the way you can really create a home in any way you desire."
Costa said the mill would be ideal for those who are interested in historic homes and living next to the longest river within the borders of New Jersey. Most historic homes have formal living rooms and dining rooms, as well as set spots for electric cables. The Neshanic Mill does not have such walls, since its construction includes large pieces of timber on the sides that hold up the entire house.
This follows the trend of converting old commercial buildings, such as warehouses, churches, schools, prisons and mills, into homes. In Connecticut, the abandoned Ponemah Mills are being repurposed into a series of apartment-style lofts, according to the New York Times. And Costa cites the example of many vacant warehouses in New York City being transformed into loft spaces for incoming residents.
A final draw to the Neshanic Mill is the pieces of history left behind throughout the home. Artifacts such as pulleys, a grain elevator and tracking for grain bags are integrated in the home as a reminder of the mill's long history and past functions.
"They've repurposed a lot of the original parts of the mill into the house," Costa said.
The selling price is $650,000.

Texto completo: During three encounters more than a century ago, Al Michaud’s great-great-grandfather took two shots at the Specter Moose, a gray, beefy, 15-foot tall, 2,500-pound legend of the Maine woods.
Like everyone else, he missed.
“They said it had 10 pounds of lead in it because nobody could kill the moose,” said Michaud, 49.
When Michaud was a boy, his great-uncle would tell tales of the hunts during trips to camp at Moosehead Lake. Asking around years later, Michaud found lots of people told lots of stories.
Researching newspaper archives over a span of 50 years, he found tales there, too, including one in which hunters successfully bagged the animal, only to have the moose resurrect itself the next day.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-6690168 alignleft" src="https://i0.wp.com/multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/06/Specter-Moose.jpg?resize=196%2C300&ssl=1" alt="" width="196" height="300" data-recalc-dims="1" />
He’s gathered the stories into a book, “Hunting Old Moxie: The Largely True History of the Specter Moose of Lobster Lake, Maine,” self-published in April.
Michaud grew up in Winslow, moved to Nashville and returned to Maine last year. He said the Specter Moose hit the national scene in 1899 with stories in The New York Times, The Boston Globe and other newspapers.
Four hunters from away came out of the woods claiming to have taken shots at it, kicking off what Michaud called a “long stretch where it had national fame.”
“The moose had been seen by Maine hunters for a good decade before 1899,” Michaud said. “For quite a while after that, papers across the country would print the latest about the Specter Moose. The first major newspaper coverage was between 1899 and 1904, then returned in 1908, again in 1911, 1917.”
The last article he found ran in 1942. He also discovered it wasn’t enough just to report on a monster moose in the Maine woods.
“Newspapers would speculate, ‘This must be the son or grandson of the original Specter Moose’ — moose only live into their 20s and this had been reported for 50 years,” Michaud said. “It had a lot of supernatural qualities. It was claimed to be 15 feet tall, grayish-white in color, its antlers spread 12 feet across. A very unusual moose. People would report a light would appear between its antlers, like a ball of light, that’s from the newspaper accounts.”
In comparison, adult bull moose in Maine average 1,106 pounds and about 6 feet tall at the shoulder, according to the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife.
State moose biologist Lee Kantar said the state hunting record holder, the 1982 Masardis Bull, weighed more than 1,700 pounds when it was shot.
“That being said, we have not seen a bull that big since,” he said. Even a 1,475-pound bull would be “exceptional. That is a smasher and I would be highly suspect of larger eastern moose.”
Michaud’s great-great-grandfather claimed to have had three encounters with the Specter Moose, in 1889, 1890 and 1903, according to the stories Michaud’s great-uncle would tell.
He said he wrote his book weaving together the history of the woods, hunting, logging and tourism with newspaper accounts and “what I call ‘bean supper tales,’ basically local folklore, people just spinning yarns about it.”
“Maine has a long, wonderful history of yarn spinners, that’s part of our heritage,” he said. “We’re actually nationally known for that. There’s a lot of newspapers from that time period, ‘Here’s another story from Maine …'”
<img class="size-medium wp-image-6690220" src="https://i0.wp.com/multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/06/Al-Michaud.jpg?resize=259%2C300&ssl=1" alt="" width="259" height="300" data-recalc-dims="1" />
While stories originally had the Specter Moose hanging out in the Katahdin area, it was eventually sighted everywhere from Washington County to Aroostook County and Rangeley.
“Lumbermen and hunters in the upper Kennebec, they called it Old Moxie,” Michaud said. “It was also the Ambajejus Giant because it was seen by Ambejejus Lake, near Millinocket. Around Rangeley, it was called Jumbo. Once it became national, it was just called the Specter Moose.”
Michaud, who works as a data analyst for Amazon, found one newspaper story of the Specter Moose actually meeting its end. Sort of.
“It was shot and killed, and it was strung up (and bled out),” he said. “The next day, it was back alive. It was standing outside of their camp.”
He doesn’t take a view on whether the moose was real or not. Michaud said he enjoyed focusing stories on Maine’s inland instead of its more-written-about coast. He sees opportunities the state could be having with the moose today.
It could be the name of a craft beer. Used to promote the Maine woods.
“I could even see, just for fun, legislation making the Specter Moose the official state monster or something,” Michaud said.
He’s included an email address in the book — spectermoose@gmail.com — hoping to collect more tales and add to “Hunting Old Moxie” in the future.

Let's talk Social Security

Texto completo: American voters should get the candidates for president to focus on something that deeply concerns all of us: the future of Social Security.

The system upon which most Americans rely for a significant chunk of their retirement has crossed a threshold and is headed for possible mandatory cuts in 15 years.

Next year, for the first time since 1982, the program must start drawing down its assets to pay retirees all of the benefits they have been promised, according to the New York Times' analysis of the latest government projections.

None of this is a surprise or unexpected. The arithmetic is inexorable.

Unless a solution is found, Social Security's trust funds are expected to be depleted within about 15 years. When that happens, benefit checks for retirees would be cut by about 20 percent across the board.

Republican President Ronald Reagan and Democratic House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill acted almost four decades ago to shore up Social Security. Their major agreement was a gradual increase in the retirement age, to 67 from 65. It's so gradual that we're still eight years away from getting to the 67 retirement threshold.

Since then, Congress has chosen to ignore the problem rather than take advantage of the time gained by the bipartisanship deal made by Mr. Reagan and Mr. O'Neill. By and large, the presidential candidates have ignored the problem too, except for those who offer platitudes about saving the program.

Benefit cuts would be difficult, to say the least, for the one-half of retired Americans who rely on Social Security for most of their retirement income.

A quarter of working Americans have saved nothing for retirement, so the dependence is getting worse.

A promising measure was introduced by Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio) and Sen. Ben Cardin (D., Md.). The Retirement Security & Savings Act would give employers incentives to offer and contribute to retirement plans. The bill also would change rules to encourage saving by part-time and full-time workers.

That's a start. The real solution is going to be difficult to agree on and likely will require increased taxes on both workers and employers and the elimination of the cap on how much income can be taxed.

The issue has barely been mentioned on the 2020 campaign trail. Voters and voter-interest groups need to insist that candidates speak up in detail on where they stand on a robust Social Security system.

Social Security helps support millions of elderly, disabled, and poor Americans, and the vast majority of Americans want to preserve and expand Social Security benefits, not dismantle them. They need to face up to the challenge and insist that their politicians do the same.

Studies: High Potency Cannabis used in Ancient Rituals

Texto completo: WI Staff Report
Evidence in an ancient burial site in China shows that cannabis has been used for healing and ritualist practices thousands ofyears go - far longer than originally believed.
Residue of weed was found in tombs deep in the Pamir mountains of western China by archaeologists and chemists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing in several recent studies.
About 70 artifacts were collected and analyzed using a method known as chromatography-mass spectrometry. Through this procedure cannabis seeds were found in items such as glass beads, harps, wooden bowls and much more.
The peculiar thing about the seeds however, is that instead of being low levels of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) which is more commonly found in Central Asian countries, these levels were quite high and lead researchers to ask what were people using such high levels of THC for in these ritualist practices.
Cannabis stems and seeds have been previously found in other burial sites across Eurasia, there is evidence a weed usage stemming as far back as fifth century B.C. in ancient Greece. Evidence also points to the use of cannabis dating centuries ago in Russia
However, the Pamir site in particular provides evidence that there was more conscious understanding of cannabis potency and spiritual connection, when enacting ritualistic practices including human sacrifice and connecting with the dead.
In an interview with the New York Times, Dr. Mark Merlin, cannabis historian and professor botany said, "the fact that strongly psychoactive ancient residue has been documented in laboratory testing is a new key finding."
Merlin also dictated that high level THC cannabis may have been used as a way for the promote communication between the body and the spirt (afterlife).
"I think the evidence from the Pamir site connects cannabis as a 'plant of the gods,'" he said.
There is evidence that ancient mourners created smoke by laying cannabis plants, most likely stems, and parts of the plant that were nonflowering, in hot stones in wooden braziers- vessels for flaming objects. This leads researchers to believe the cannabis was cultivated and that people who participated in these practices were actively looking for a stronger more potent plant, for a stronger high.

Black media and the Central Park Five compared to new documentary

Texto completo: I have yet to see filmmaker Ava DuVernay's acclaimed, "When They See Us," or Ken Burns and Sarah Burns' 2012 documentary "Central Park Five"-both films based on the 1989 savage rape and near-death assault on a white jogger, Patricia Trisha Meili.
I have, however, read former New York Newsday reporter Jim Dyson's account of the case in The New York Times (May 30, 2019) that recounted the sordid details of the 30-year-old incident, the "investigation," media coverage, arrest and prosecution of five Black youths- Yusuf Salaam, Korey Wise, Kevin Richardson, Raymond Santana and Anton McCray (who were aged between 14 and 16)-and how the system failed by allowing coerced false confessions, and how the prosecutor, Linda Fairstein, withheld critical details and fanned public sentiment that drove a wedge into an already divided city. As Dyson wrote of the case, "There was little interest in the weakness of the confessions."
In the end, five young men were convicted and jailed up to 13 years for a crime they did not commit. The subsequent confession by a convicted serial rapist, corroborated by DNA evidence, helped to overturn their wrongful convictions and in 2002 the five were awarded a total of $40 million in one of the most blatant miscarriages of American justice in recent memory.
The case fanned an angry outcry for justice by a misinformed citizenry, led by developer Donald Trump, Fairstein, a complicii New York City Police Department and the contaminated ink of the city's white media.
Against the fury of a rabid "wolf pack," clamoring for bloody revenge, stood the city's Black press.
If for no other reason than the presumption of innocence, Black media held the responsibility to give voice to activist attorneys, Alton Maddox, C. Vernon Mason, Michael Warren, Louis Clayton Jones, including the Rev. Al Sharpton and others, who at the onset raised flags to a rotten conspiracy in the making. For that act, alone, the city's Black newspapers, The City Sun, Amsterdam News and chiefly, The Daily Challenge, the city's only Black daily (where I had been editor), were profiled as rogues and ghetto rags protecting the rights of the five "savage" youths.
The Daily Challenge had led the attack by publishing the name of the victim, and the major media, which brought their formidable powers to bear, instantly vilified the paper. How dare we make Meili's name public? An avalanche of calls to appear on daytime television news, talk radio stations, and a sudden interest in the Black media followed, and in every case we were called clearly to face the cauldron of white anger.
For me, however, as editor naming the woman was an easy call.
The white press had fired the first volley on victim disclosure two years earlier when 17-year-old Tawana Brawley, a Black teenager in Peekskill, New York, was found bound and gagged in a garbage bag on an isolated lot near her home in upstate New York. The teenager had been smeared with feces, and had racist graffiti scrawled over her body. Before any investigation had been properly put in place as to the facts of the case, the white media had placed young Tawana Brawley's name and face into the public domain. No claims of inadvertent error or apologies were to come.
That the Brawley case was after a long investigation determined to be fabricated and that the teenager had staged her own abduction, was beside the point. Young Tawana Brawley had not been afforded the benefit of a sex crime victim and having her identity protected. White media felt no compunction to apply such standards to a young Black girl and she was treated as meat in the marketplace. Therefore, if white New York felt it had ownership and the prerogative to alter the rules when it came to people of color, then, conversely, so too did the Black press.
In the case of the "Central Park Five," The New York Times, Daily News and other mainstream tabloids had no ethical problems in accepting full-page ads to fill their pages and coffers, paid for by real estate developer Donald Trump demanding the death penalty for the five teenagers. And although one of the suspects was 14 at the time, and supposedly protected by juvenile laws, his name was routinely published. And so the torches of hate, bias and confrontation by the white press set the stage for a public lynching; marching with the mob were the DA's office and New York City Police Department.
A snap consequence for publishing the victim's name in the Black press was that whatever token advertising crumbs swept off Madison Avenue tables to the city's Black media began to be pulled back, state and city RFPs and legal advertisements were suddenly, and curiously, withdrawn. Death threats to myself and family were frequent: in one instance the caller was able to mention my wife by name; bomb threats at the paper's Brooklyn offices became a daily occurrence.
The history of Black America is coded: WHITE WOMAN, THE VICTIM; BLACK MALE, PERPETRATOR has always been an historical and flammable red flag, from the deep south to New York City, from Emmett Till to the Scottsboro Boys, it is in the DNA of bloody American racism.
It's easy for Jim Dwyer to say in retrospect that he could have been a little more upfront, perhaps raised his voice to his own doubts, be more diligent; and maybe the editorial board of The New York Times, Daily News and others could have put ethics before profit in publishing and said no to Donald Trump's brazen call for a lynching; and maybe the editors at the city's white newspapers, and producers of the TV talk shows, and news departments, and the radio talk show hosts could have tempered their quests for ratings.
But none of this happened.
I may not have seen the DuVernay film, nor the Burns' documentary, nor will I see Oprah's sit down with the five men. But I have had a front seat to this sordid chapter of New York City history, and I might add it was not the most comfortable seat in the house.

Senate lawmakers get classified Navy briefing on UFO sightings

Texto completo: Navy officials briefed three U.S. senators Wednesday on reported naval encounters with unidentified flying objects.
Democratic Sen. Mark Warner, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, was among those briefed. His office confirmed the briefing to POLITICO.
“If pilots at Oceana or elsewhere were reporting flight hazards that interfere with training or put them at risk, then Senator Warner wants answers,” Rachel Cohen, his spokeswoman told CNN. “It doesn’t matter if it’s weather balloons, little green men, or something else entirely — we can’t ask our pilots to put their lives at risk unnecessarily.”
Navy pilots have reported strange objects during their flights for years. In an interview with the New York Times, five airmen said that, in 2014 and 2015, they saw unusual aircraft flying at 30,000 feet over the East Coast with no visible engine or infrared exhaust plumes. Other pilots encountered aircraft that appeared to defy the laws of aerodynamics.
The U.S. Navy updated its UFO reporting guidelines in April in response to an increase in sightings and reports of intrusion into sensitive military operations. Prior guidelines often left reports uninvestigated.
“There have been a number of reports of unauthorized and/or unidentified aircraft entering various military-controlled ranges and designated airspace in recent years,” Navy officials told POLITICO. “The Navy is updating and formalizing the process by which reports of any such suspected incursions can be made to the cognizant authorities.”
These strange sightings have been a particular subject of interest for lawmakers.
Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid secured funding in 2009 for the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program that spent nearly $20 million on research of “unidentified aerial phenomena.” The program ran until 2012. In late 2017, the Pentagon set up another program to help study the reports.
This classified briefing comes as President Trump has expressed skepticism toward the issue.
“I did have one very brief meeting on it,” Trump told ABC News in a Sunday interview. “But people are saying they’re seeing UFOs, do I believe it? Not particularly.”

Texto completo: The Chinese say the shortest shadow is found on the day of the summer solstice.
Since ancient times humans have ritualistically celebrated the life-affirming heat and light of the sun. The solstice means the beginning of summer-- early dawns, long days, late sunsets. On Friday (June 21), the Harwood Museum of Art will host a summer solstice celebration through music and poetry.
It's called "Summer Solstice Concert: The Gathering Place." It is set to begin at 7 p.m. in the museum's Arthur Bell Auditorium.
"There wasn't much happening with the solstice in Taos," said event producer Opal Keen. Keen is new to production and fairly new to Taos. She booked the Harwood Museum in March on a wing and an inspiration. The performance grew organically from there with a serendipitous pulse.
By trade Keen is a cardiac sonographer. After relocating to Taos in December of 2018, she took a poetry workshop at the Society of the Muse of the Southwest (SOMOS) with veteran poet and storyteller James Navé.
"Navé made it so comfortable and welcoming and I had a great experience. For me poetry and music are a profound healing to engage with."
So it made sense to call Navé after the booking to ask him to be part of the solstice ensemble.
"I feel a bit of joy, I feel freer - there is more light. The arrival - it's the dance between my joy and my melancholy," Navé says of the solstice. After the sun reaches its apex, the days begin to shorten and the nights become longer.
He says the performance will be open, exploratory, experimental and, he predicts, even a bit mysterious.
There will be a free flow of music and poetry creating a conversation with the audience. The idea is to stay away from a stand-alone performance and lean into an as yet unknown flow. Keen and Navé are confident that the group will intertwine their substantial talents and experiences to evoke a celebration of the sun without overhashing with rehearsals.
Navé is a veteran poet and storyteller with a master's degree from Vermont College. For more than a decade he has partnered with Julia Cameron, author of the book "Artist's Way," as her camp director. Navé has taught writing, performance and creativity in a variety of settings and is known as a whirlwind of energy and passion. He has directed the SOMOS-sponsored Taos Storytelling Festival for the past three years. This year's festival is planned October 11-12 at SOMOS.
After securing Navé, Keen said she felt like she needed one more poet and almost before she finished asking he suggested Olivia Romo. Navé first met Romo at SOMOS when she was a high school student attending his poetry workshops.
"She is a seasoned performer - she knows what she is doing," Navé said.
Romo, a proud Taoseña, is a young and upcoming poet. Only this year she was featured in a New York Times article reporting on the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering in Elko, Nevada. Reporter James Stanley writes, "She uses the rhythms and speech patterns of the spoken word poetry in a strong mixture of Spanish and English." Romo, a water rights activist, received her bachelor's degree majoring in both English and Chicana/o studies from the University of New Mexico.
With two diverse and talented poets gathered into Keen's solstice vision, she cast about for the musical component. She thought of Lebanese singer-songwriter Tony Khalife. Keen met him while attending a yoga retreat in Ojo, California. He was playing the tablas, drums from the subcontinent of India. "When I heard him I thought, 'Is it possible for that to come from someone's hands?' "
Khalife has a powerful story shaped and scoured by war. He was born in Beirut during peacetime in 1964. By the time he was 11, civil and national war broke out and he was drafted into the local militia. What he really wanted to be doing was playing his guitar.
In his late teens, Khalife joined the Marvels, a professional Lebanese band playing American and European music, and was named Best Guitarist in Lebanon. A year later he was on his way to the Guitar Institute of Los Angeles. His music has become a vehicle to increase the world's vibration to bring greater awareness and healing.
Since moving to Taos a year and a half ago, Keen now wants to give back to a community that she says has been incredibly supportive and welcoming. She said her jump from the medical field into poetry to producing a multilayered performance of poetry and music would not have happened to her in any other place.
Tickets are $20; $16 for museum members.
The Harwood Museum is located at 238 Ledoux Street. For more information, call (575) 758-9826 or visit harwoodmuseum.org .

Texto completo: Un jurado de una corte federal de Nueva York halló este miércoles culpable de todos los cargos a Keith Raniere , fundador de la organización de supuesta autoayuda Nxivm, con sede en Albany, que resultó ser una secta de esclavas y trata sexual.
Tras cinco horas de deliberación, los 12 miembros del jurado establecieron un veredicto condenatorio contra el acusado en el juicio que se extendió por un mes.
Raniere, de 58 años, que está en prisión desde su arresto en México en marzo de 2018, enfrentó juicio por varios delitos, entre ellos tráfico sexual con adultos y menores, posesión de pornografía infantil, explotación sexual de un menor y chantaje. Se enfrenta a una posible cadena perpetua.
Pero, si algo llamó la atención de este caso fueron los detalles bizarros y de índole sexual que trascendieron en la Corte del Distrito Este de Brooklyn. A continuación, te presentamos un resumen:
Tres hermanas mexicanas embarazadas y abortos
Tres hermanas mexicanas abortaron a pedido del líder de la secta Nxivm, Keith Raniere, quien las embarazó mientras eran sus esclavas sexuales.
Una de las víctimas, identificadas como Daniela, narró el martirio que tanto ella como sus hermanas vivieron bajo el abuso de Raniere camuflado en el supuesto grupo de autoayuda.
La joven, quien llegó de México junto a otros seis miembros de su familia cuanto tenía 16 años, además relató que la prepararon durante semanas antes de que cumpliera los 18, para que Raniere tomara su virginidad.
“Nunca me habían besado y no había tenido ningún contacto sexual”, dijo Daniela en el tribunal, según citada por medios como The Daily Beast.
Marcadas como “ganado”
Videos muestran cómo las esclavas sexuales eran marcadas a fuego vivo con un cauterizador como una especie de rito de iniciación.
En una grabación se ve el procedimiento mediante el que “tatuaban” a las mujeres con las iniciales del líder de la secta.
En el clip, presentado en exclusiva en el noticiero de Loret de Mola de Televisa, se aprecia a un grupo de cuatro féminas desnudas en una de estas ceremonias.
Una de ellas está acostada mientras la “tatúan”; se trata de Sarah Edmondson, quien denunció en 2017 las prácticas del grupo a The New York Times.
A Raniere, que camuflaba los abusos como cursos de “autoayuda” bajo “Programas de Éxito Ejecutivo”, se le ve en el video pronunciando una especie de juramento que las mujeres a su vez deben repetir.

La “Semana de la vanguardia”
Otro detalle atroz que trascendió en el proceso judicial fue la celebración conocida como “Semana de la vanguardia”, en reconocimiento a Raniere, evento que supuestamente congregaba a miembros de varias ciudades de Estados Unidos y Canadá.
El encuentro, relacionado con el cumpleaños de Raniere el 26 de agosto, reflejaba la idolatría de los participantes de la organización a su líder y estaba dirigido a la satisfacción de las demandas de éste.
El agente especial del FBI Michael Lever dijo en una declaración jurada que Raniere tenía una rotación de 15 a 20 mujeres con las que mantenía relaciones sexuales como parte de las actividades.
Manipulación y soborno con material sexual
La sociedad secreta piramidal llamada “DOS” o el “Voto” a Nxivm era otra humillación a las víctimas en beneficio del líder.
Raniere, el único miembro masculino del grupo, ocupaba el nivel más alto, en su papel de “maestro superior”. A su vez, las primeras esclavas reclutaban a otras.
Para unirse, las mujeres se veían obligadas a dar garantías de fidelidad a sus amos: material sería comprometedor para la mujer que se exponía a este trueque.
Podría tratarse de fotografías y videos sexualmente explícitos de las esclavas.
“Las esclavas entendían que si abandonaban el DOS, hablaban públicamente sobre el DOS o repetidamente incumplían las obligaciones o asignaciones del DOS, sus garantías podían ser publicadas”, expuso Lever.
.
Sexo grupal
Lauren Salzman, una de las mujeres que pertenecía al círculo cercano de Keith Raniere y la actriz de Smallville Allison Mack, confesaron haber aceptado participar – como dos de las siete “esclavas de primera línea”- en una ceremonia de compromiso que incluía sexo oral grupal.
Poco antes de que comenzara la ceremonia en marzo del 2018, los agentes mexicanos rodearon la propiedad de Raniere en una villa en las afueras de Puerto Vallarta (Jalisco) y lo arrestaron . En dicho país se extendieron las redes de este grupo con vínculos con altos líderes como Emiliano Salinas, hijo del expresidente Carlos Salinas.

Texto completo: A medical journal article published this week reported an incident involving an e-cigarette explosion that sent a teenager to a trauma center. The electronic cigarette exploded in the teen's mouth, knocking out several teeth, breaking his jaw and leaving a hole in his gums.
The teen’s mother, Kailani Burton, said she heard a loud pop and saw her son, Austin Adams, run into the living room covering his mouth, according to the New York Times.
“He was bleeding really bad,” Ms. Burton said in an interview with the Times. “It looked like a hole in his chin. ”
They quickly rushed Adams to the hospital in Ely, Nevada but then realized that they needed treatment at a trauma center and drove 200 miles to Salt Lake City, the paper reported.
The incident took place in March 2018 but doctors who treated Adams in Salt Lake City documented the case in an article published by the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday. Dr. Katie Russell, one of the doctors who treated Adams, said she and her colleague decided to publish the case to warn others about the dangers of vaping.
The explosion was “totally unexpected," Dr. Russell told NBC News. “He didn’t recall doing anything wrong with the device beforehand and it just exploded. ”
E-cigarette explosion: Vape pen catches fire in overhead bin on Delta flight
A scary trend: More teens vape, but binge drinking and opioid use are down
According to the news network, Adams needed plates on his jawbones and temporary braces. He also had his gumline sewn together and his jaw wired shut for six weeks, which meant he could only have liquids. Since then, he has fully recovered from his injuries.
Adams, then 17-years-old, bought the vape kit from the company VGOD to quit smoking, NBC News reported. VGOD sells e-cigarette and vape pen devices along with accessories and apparel. The company did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.
A string of incidents involving electronic cigarettes has put the devices on center stage once again. In May 2018, a vape pen exploded in a man’s mouth requiring him to get 65 stitches on his face. The explosion also splashed the 25-year-old with battery acid, causing chemical or heat burns to his left hand, face, mouth and tongue, a suit filed against three companies alleges.
The FDA says on their website causes of vape pen explosions aren’t clear yet but evidence points to battery-related issues.
Cities, such as San Francisco, are beginning to crack down on the sale of e-cigarettes. The city’s supervisors unanimously voted Tuesday to ban manufacturing and all sales of electronic cigarettes. The measure will require a subsequent vote before becoming law.
"We spent the '90s battling big tobacco, and now we see its new form in e-cigarettes," Supervisor Shamann Walton said.
Although terrifying, NBC News said the incident had one positive outcome. Adams was able to quit smoking for good.

New documentary puts Toni Morrison's legacy in place

Texto completo: You may have read "Beloved," clutched "The Bluest Eye" to your chest or memorized "Song of Solomon" – but do you know the history of Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison?
A new documentary, "Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am" (in theaters Friday in New York and Los Angeles, expands through summer), seeks to demystify the acclaimed 88-year-old writer.
Here are five things you probably don't know about Morrison, from how her friendship with Oprah Winfrey started to how she worked her magic on Muhammad Ali.
1. Toni Morrison worked as an editor for years while also writing her own books Morrison began her career as a professor at Howard University, before spotting a classified ad in The New York Review of Books in 1965 for a book editor in Syracuse. That imprint soon was acquired by Random House, sending Morrison to New York, where the single mother of two sons nurtured many influential black writers, including Toni Cade Bambara, Gayl Jones and Lucille Clifton. But at night, she worked on her own books. "Editors are not writers. So I don't tell anybody," she says.
2. She was castigated by early critics for not writing about white people In a 1973 review of "Sula," The New York Times criticized Morrison, saying her work was boxed in by her insistence on writing about her own community – without including confrontation with whites. "Toni Morrison is far too talented to remain only a marvelous reporter of the black side of provincial American life," wrote the critic.
In the documentary, Morrison addresses such claims. "I have had reviews in the past that have accused me of not writing about white people ... as though our lives have no meaning and no depth without the white gaze," she says plainly. "I have spent my entire writing life trying to make sure that the white gaze was not the dominant one in any of my books."
3. She went on a book tour with Muhammad Ali While promoting Ali's book "The Greatest: My Own Story," the two got off to a rocky start. "When I first met him and asked him a question, he would answer and look at a man and never looked directly at me while he was giving the answer. But then I remembered he respects older women," Morrison recalls, saying she realized she should act more like his mother. "So I just crossed my arms as I walked in the room and said, 'Ali, get up from there, you have something to do.' And he would look up and recognize ... a grown-up. And from then on, he did everything I said," she chuckles.
4. Oprah got creative trying to get her phone number After reading "Beloved," Oprah wanted to call Morrison personally, but the famous author's number was unlisted. So the TV star called the fire department and asked for it.
Morrison remembers picking up the phone. "She said, 'Toni Morrison, this is Oprah Winfrey.' I said, 'How did you get my number?' " she laughs. Oprah made her plea to turn "Beloved" into a movie, ultimately convincing a skeptical Morrison. Oprah made the 1998 film and starred as Sethe, an escaped slave who murders her own daughter rather than see her child returned to a Kentucky plantation to live as a slave.
5. Morrison called time's up on equal pay in the 1970s "Navigating a white male world was not threatening; it wasn't even interesting," says Morrison candidly. "I knew more than they did and I wasn't afraid to show it. "
In her first job, the single mom noticed her male counterparts were getting more money when the raises were given out. "So I went to my boss and I said, 'You didn't raise me as much as my colleagues who are men.' He said. 'Yes, but.' And I said, 'I don't want to hear 'but.' I want to tell you something: I am head of the household. Just. Like. You."
She got the money.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The Trump Tower condo in Manhattan forfeited by former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort - who pleaded guilty to wide-ranging fraudulent financial schemes - is on the market for $3.6 million.
The 1,509-square-foot condo with one bedroom and 2½ baths in Trump Tower at 721 Fifth Ave. hit the market Tuesday in a sale being conducted by a real estate broker on behalf of the U.S. Marshal's Office.
Photos on the website of the broker  for the unoccupied and empty condo show polished wood floors with expansive views to the north of Central Park.
Manafort, 70, had to forfeit the condo, along with a Brooklyn brownstone, a SoHo loft and a house in the Hamptons with a pool, tennis and basketball courts, and a chipping green, when he pleaded guilty last year. The value of those New York properties has been estimated at $22 million.
Manafort is serving a 7½-year sentence in a Pennsylvania federal prison.
The sale comes as Manafort faces 16 state charges, including mortgage fraud and other offenses, brought by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. to ensure he will serve time, even if he is pardoned by Trump, who has said Manafort has been treated "unfairly."
While Manafort won't get to enjoy the opulence of his one-time Trump Tower condo, he avoided confinement at the Rikers Island jail complex earlier this week after his attorneys raised concerns about his health.
Deputy Attorney General James Rosen intervened and allowed him to be housed at the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower Manhattan instead for his arraignment next week, The New York Times reported.

Texto completo: You may have read "Beloved," clutched "The Bluest Eye" to your chest or memorized "Song of Solomon" – but do you know the history of Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison?
A new documentary, "Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am" (in theaters Friday in New York and Los Angeles, expands through summer), seeks to demystify the acclaimed 88-year-old writer, digging into her personal history, showcasing how her work probes the interior lives of African Americans and highlighting the moments in her remarkable career that became touchstones.
Here are five things you probably don't know about Morrison, from how her friendship with Oprah Winfrey started to how she worked her magic on Muhammad Ali.
1. Toni Morrison worked as an editor for years while also writing her own books Morrison began her career as a professor at Howard University, before spotting a classified ad in The New York Review of Books in 1965 for a book editor in Syracuse. That imprint soon was acquired by Random House, sending Morrison to New York, where the single mother of two sons nurtured many influential black writers, including Toni Cade Bambara, Gayl Jones and Lucille Clifton. But at night, she worked on her own books. "Editors are not writers. So I don't tell anybody," she says.
Fun fact: She convinced secretaries to type up her manuscript for 1970's "The Bluest Eye" by baking the ladies one of her famous carrot cakes.
2. She was castigated by early critics for not writing about white people In a 1973 review of "Sula," The New York Times criticized Morrison, saying her work was boxed in by her insistence on writing about her own community – without including confrontation with whites. "Toni Morrison is far too talented to remain only a marvelous reporter of the black side of provincial American life," wrote the critic.
In the documentary, Morrison addresses such claims. "I have had reviews in the past that have accused me of not writing about white people ... as though our lives have no meaning and no depth without the white gaze," she says plainly. "I have spent my entire writing life trying to make sure that the white gaze was not the dominant one in any of my books."
3. She went on a book tour with Muhammad Ali While promoting Ali's book "The Greatest: My Own Story," the two got off to a rocky start. "When I first met him and asked him a question, he would answer and look at a man and never looked directly at me while he was giving the answer. But then I remembered he respects older women," Morrison recalls, saying she realized she should act more like his mother. "So I just crossed my arms as I walked in the room and said, 'Ali, get up from there, you have something to do.' And he would look up and recognize ... a grown-up. And from then on, he did everything I said," she chuckles.
4. Oprah got creative trying to get her phone number After reading "Beloved," Oprah wanted to call Morrison personally, but the famous author's number was unlisted. So the TV star called the fire department and asked for it.
Morrison remembers picking up the phone. "She said, 'Toni Morrison, this is Oprah Winfrey.' I said, 'How did you get my number?' " she laughs. Oprah made her plea to turn "Beloved" into a movie, ultimately convincing a skeptical Morrison. Oprah made the 1998 film and starred as Sethe, an escaped slave who murders her own daughter rather than see her child returned to a Kentucky plantation to live as a slave.
5. Morrison called time's up on equal pay in the 1970s "Navigating a white male world was not threatening; it wasn't even interesting," says Morrison candidly, recalling her first job as an editor. "I knew more than they did and I wasn't afraid to show it. You have to be a little tough and rely on yourself, and tell people 'no.'"
In her first job, the single mom noticed her male counterparts were getting more money when the raises were given out. "So I went to my boss and I said, 'You didn't raise me as much as my colleagues who are men.' He said. 'Yes, but.' And I said, 'I don't want to hear 'but.' I want to tell you something: I am head of the household. Just. Like. You."
She got the money.
Toni Morrison's life is explored in the new documentary "Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am."

Three reasons Trump-Russia hasn’t turned into Watergate

Texto completo: Why haven’t efforts to impeach President Trump gained Watergate-style momentum? The lack of energy has created a sense of bafflement and disappointment among some of the president’s most determined adversaries. But there are some simple reasons for it. Here are three: 1. The facts are different. In Watergate, the underlying crime was a break-in at Democratic National Committee headquarters, perpetrated by burglars paid by President Nixon’s re-election campaign. The scandal proceeded from there. In Trump-Russia, the underlying crime was the hacking of the DNC’s and John Podesta’s emails — a crime committed by Russians in Russia. Special counsel Robert Mueller, who indicted a number of Russians and Russian entities for their actions, spent two years trying to find conspiracy or coordination between the Russians and the Trump campaign. He failed.
That single fact has shaped every other aspect of the Trump-Russia affair. In Watergate, the cover-up flowed from Nixon’s desire to conceal his campaign’s involvement in the break-in and other political dark acts. It formed the bulk of the obstruction of justice case against Nixon, which in turn served as the basis for articles of impeachment.
2. The press is different. Just as the facts of Trump-Russia are quite unlike Watergate, so the media environment of 2019 is quite unlike what existed in 1974. Back then, there were three 30-minute broadcast network newscasts: CBS, NBC and ABC. There were two big newspapers, The New York Times and The Washington Post, and TV network executives sat down each day, within a few blocks of each other in Manhattan, to produce newscasts that basically illustrated the papers’ latest stories. There was no internet, no cable news, no podcasts, no social media and no talk radio. Nixon, even if he had had strong defenses, faced a solid wall of media opposition.
Today, the situation is much, much different — and infinitely better. There is far more diversity of opinion in the media writ large, and, importantly, popular access to primary sources. That troubles some media figures who miss the old days of news monopoly.
"During the Watergate era ... there were three networks," Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan wrote recently. "Back then, what was said on those three networks ... was largely believed. Much more than now, there was a shared set of facts."
But it was a limited set of facts — just the ones selected by those network producers in Manhattan. Today’s media diversity, in terms of the Trump-Russia affair, means more facts see the light. And people inclined to support the president, or just be skeptical of the government’s investigative targeting of the Trump campaign, have a way to make their case beyond what anyone had 40-plus years ago.
3. Congress is different. Differences in the facts of the cases and differences in the media’s ability to report those facts have had a profound effect on lawmakers. They’re better informed, if they want to be, and can make a better defense of the president of their party. And having a significant number of constituents supporting the president makes representatives more likely to support him, too. (Unlike today, in 1974 opposition party Democrats controlled all of Congress, with 243 seats in the House and 56 in the Senate.) So this is a new world. It is perhaps not surprising to hear Democrats wish they could somehow turn today’s Trump-Russia affair into yesterday’s Watergate. If they could just hold televised hearings, they say, that could capture the nation’s attention and give Trump-Russia a Watergate-like urgency. Americans would turn against the president by the millions.
Others believe they just need time. It took Watergate years to grow big enough to oust Nixon, they say. But look at the numbers. The break-in was in June 1972, and Nixon resigned in August 1974 — a period of two years and two months. In Trump-Russia, the FBI began its investigation nearly three years ago, in July 2016. The Senate began investigating in January 2017. And Mueller took office in May 2017. It’s been a long time.
Trump-Russia could go longer still, and it would not change the basic facts of the case. It is simply a different case in a different world. Try as they might, the president’s opponents can’t make it 1974 again.

Texto completo: Del Taco will begin serving meat-free Beyond Burritos on Thursday, June 20, two months after the successful launch of its Beyond Tacos.
The new burritos expand Del Taco’s partnership with Beyond Meat, a Los Angeles-based company out to revolutionize meat substitutes with plant-based products that look and taste like beef.
The two new menu items are:
Beyond 8 Layer Burrito: Made with seasoned plant-based crumbles, slow-cooked beans, guacamole, diced tomatoes, lettuce, cheddar cheese, sauce and sour cream wrapped in a flour tortilla.
Epic Beyond Cali Burrito: Beyond Meat plant-based crumbles wrapped with crinkle-cut french fries, sour cream, guacamole and handmade pico de gallo in a flour tortilla.
The two Beyond Tacos on the menu are among Del Taco’s most successful launches. It has sold about 2 million of them since they were added to the menu in mid-April, according to a news release from the Lake Forest-based chain.
Plant-based protein is a hot trend in fast food and fast casual restaurants. Beyond Meat and its main competitor, Impossible Foods, have an expanding list of partners serving their products in burgers, Mexican foods and pizzas. The New York Times reported this week that Red Robin and White Castle are struggling to keep up with demand for Impossible Burgers.
Peas are a key ingredient in the Beyond Burger, while the Impossible Burger is made with soy, but both products are engineered to grill and even bleed like real beef.
Burger King began testing an Impossible Whopper in St. Louis on April 1 and three weeks later announced it would roll out the burger to the entire chain. Bay Area restaurants began serving it last week.

Texto completo: Today is Wednesday, June 19, the 170th day of 2019. There are 195 days left in the year.
Today’s Highlight in History:
On June 19, 1865, Union troops arrived in Galveston, Texas, with news the Civil War was over, and all remaining slaves in Texas were free — an event celebrated to this day as “Juneteenth.”
On this date:
In 1775, George Washington was commissioned by the Continental Congress as commander in chief of the Continental Army.
In 1868, “Tales from the Vienna Woods,” a waltz by Johann Strauss “the Younger,” was first publicly performed by Strauss’ orchestra.
In 1917, during World War I, King George V ordered the British royal family to dispense with German titles and surnames; the family took the name “Windsor.”
In 1934, the Federal Communications Commission was created; it replaced the Federal Radio Commission.
In 1938, four dozen people were killed when a railroad bridge in Montana collapsed, sending a train known as the Olympian hurtling into Custer Creek.
In 1944, during World War II, the two-day Battle of the Philippine Sea began, resulting in a decisive victory for the Americans over the Japanese.
In 1952, the U.S. Army Special Forces, the elite unit of fighters known as the Green Berets, was established at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. The celebrity-panel game show “I’ve Got A Secret” debuted on CBS-TV.
In 1953, Julius Rosenberg, 35, and his wife, Ethel, 37, convicted of conspiring to pass U.S. atomic secrets to the Soviet Union, were executed at Sing Sing Prison in Ossining, New York.
In 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was approved by the U.S. Senate, 73-27, after surviving a lengthy filibuster.
In 1987, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a Louisiana law requiring any public school teaching the theory of evolution to teach creation science as well.
In 2006, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice warned North Korea it would face consequences if it test-fired a missile thought to be powerful enough to reach the West Coast of the United States.
In 2017, Otto Warmbier, a 22-year-old American college student, died in a Cincinnati hospital following his release by North Korea in a coma after more than a year in captivity.
Ten years ago: New York Times reporter David S. Rohde and Afghan reporter Tahir Ludin escaped from militant captors after more than seven months in captivity in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Texas billionaire R. Allen Stanford was indicted and jailed on charges his international banking empire was really just a Ponzi scheme built on lies, bluster and bribery. (Stanford was sentenced to 110 years in prison after being convicted of bilking investors in a $7.2 billion scheme that involved the sale of fraudulent certificates of deposits.)
Five years ago: President Barack Obama announced he was dispatching 300 U.S. military advisers to Iraq to help quell a rising insurgency. Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California won election as House majority leader as Republicans shuffled their leadership in the wake of Rep. Eric Cantor’s primary defeat in Virginia. Gerry Goffin, 75, a prolific and multi-dimensional lyricist who with his then-wife and songwriter partner Carole King wrote such hits as “Will You Love Me Tomorrow,” “(You Make Me Feel Like) a Natural Woman,” “Up On The Roof,” and “The Loco-Motion,” died in Los Angeles.
One year ago: The United States said it was pulling out of the United Nations’ Human Rights Council, a day after the U.N. human rights chief denounced the Trump administration for separating migrant children from their parents; U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley cited longstanding U.S. complaints the council was biased against Israel. Koko, a western lowland gorilla who was taught sign language at an early age as a scientific test subject and eventually learned more than 1,000 words, died at the Gorilla Foundation’s preserve in California’s Santa Cruz mountains at the age of 46. New York mayor Bill de Blasio said as of Sept. 1, police would start issuing summonses to people caught smoking marijuana in public rather than arresting them.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Minnesota U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Democratic candidate for president, vowed on Tuesday to use executive powers in her first 100 days in the White House to undo much of what President Donald Trump has done over the past 30 months.
Ahead of the first Democratic primary debates next week, Klobuchar's campaign released a hefty list of plans she would undertake in the opening months of her potential presidency.
From rejoining the Paris Agreement to fight climate change, to immediately suspending all legal challenges to the Affordable Care Act, ending family separations at the U.S. border and the travel ban on certain Muslim countries, as well as allowing transgender people to serve in the U.S. military, Klobuchar's 18-page plan reads in many parts like a direct repudiation of the Republican president.
The list includes some major legislative proposals, although most of it could be undertaken without congressional approval. It was released Tuesday morning, hours before Trump's re-election kickoff with an evening rally in Orlando, Fla.
"After four years of Donald Trump, the new president can't wait for a bunch of congressional hearings to act," Klobuchar said in a statement. The objective, she said, is "to improve our health care,
combat climate change, pursue economic justice and shared prosperity, and build a stronger democracy and safer world."
Klobuchar is competing against a large group of rivals for the Democratic nomination.
Next week, 20 of those candidates will participate in one of two debates in Miami; Klobuchar will join candidates including Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke on the first night, June 26.
To date, Klobuchar has remained in low single digits in national polls of the Democratic race.
An analysis by the New York Times puts her national polling average at 2% -- tied with Booker and trailing former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders, Warren, Sen. Kamala Harris, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and O'Rourke.
While presidential candidates frequently talk about what they would do in their early days in office, Klobuchar's campaign was not aware of any rivals who have produced a similarly comprehensive road map for the first 100 days.
An online search Tuesday bolstered that claim. Warren, though, has impressed some Democratic activists with a flurry of detailed policy plans.
The document released by Klobuchar's campaign contains 137 separate bullet points listing actions Klobuchar would intend to undertake as president in the early months of 2021, some covering similar territory.
Many would harness the executive power of the presidency, which Trump has frequently used to accomplish policy goals outside the lawmaking process. Many of Trump's executive orders have faced legal challenges, and Klobuchar could face similar legal pushback.
Patrick Condon • 202-662-7452
AMONG THE HIGHLIGHTS
• Klobuchar would rejoin the Paris climate accord on
her first day in office. She would take several other
steps to address climate change, including restoring
the Obama-era Clean Power Plan that set carbon dioxide
emission standards for the states. She also would
introduce a "sweeping" legislative proposal to address
climate change.
• Bring the U.S. back into the Iran nuclear agreement,
and impose full sanctions against Russia for 2016
election interference. Congress has already approved
those sanctions but the Trump administration has
not fully implemented them. Klobuchar would also
restore greater freedom for U.S. citizens and businesses
to travel to and trade with Cuba, which the current
administration has limited.
• Lift the travel ban on immigrants from a handful of
Muslim countries, a subject of fierce legal pushback
since Trump implemented it early in his term. Klobuchar
would also raise a cap on refugee admissions
into the U.S., end family separations at the U.S. border,
and end deportations of certain classes of undocumented
immigrants, including "Dreamers" who came
to the U.S. under age 16.
• End legal and administrative challenges to the
Affordable Care Act -- former President Barack
Obama's signature health care law -- and expand its
open enrollment period. She also would propose legislation
to achieve universal health care, including a
public option. Two other health care proposals include
directing the Food and Drug Administration to grant
waivers allowing importation of cheaper prescription
drugs from Canada, and restoring federal funding to
Planned Parenthood.
• Take executive action to prevent people who have
abused dating partners from buying or owning firearms,
direct the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention to designate gun violence a public health
issue, increase inspections and enforcement against
gun manufacturers and sellers who violate the law, bar
federal funding from being used to arm schoolteachers,
and restore a federal rule meant to prevent those with
severe mental illness from obtaining guns.
• Terminate the military's ban on service by transgender
people, stop the push for federal protections for
those accused of discrimination against LGBTQ people,
create an office of LGBTQ Antidiscrimination in the
White House, and reinstate family visas to same-sex
partners of foreign diplomats.
• Issue an executive order to launch a governmentwide
cybersecurity initiative aimed at improving federal,
state and local responses to cyberthreats to democracy
and infrastructure.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump has repeatedly commented on a case that wrongly accused a group of black and Latino men of assaulting a white female jogger in Central Park in 1989.
Trump's comments surrounding the case, many of which were made in his capacity as a New York business mogul, have resurfaced following a Netflix series on the men who were charged with the assault. The men are commonly referred to as the Central Park Five.
Raymond Santana, Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray, Yusef Salaam and Korey Wise were all boys when they were convicted of raping Trisha Meili. They were then found innocent of the crime after convicted murder Matias Reyes in 2002 confessed to raping Meili, which was confirmed by DNA evidence. The city awarded the men $41 million in 2014, a decade after some of the men initially sued the city for how it handled the case.
Trump, now president, has doubled down on his stance that some involved in the attack were guilty.
On Tuesday, he dodged questions about apologizing for a 1989 ad calling for the death penalty for those involved in an assault.
'You have people on both sides of that': Trump doesn't apologize to Central Park Five
Trump's role: Ava DuVernay lets Trump 'speak for himself' in Central Park Five series 'When They See Us'
Here is a history of Trump's comments and actions surrounding the Central Park jogger case:
"BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY"
Less than two weeks after the attack on Meili, Trump took out a full-page ad in four New York City newspapers with the headline: "BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY. BRING BACK OUR POLICE!"
The $85,000 worth of ads wereq published on May 1, 1989, in The New York Times, The Daily News, The New York Post and New York Newsday. In a statement included in the ad, Trump criticized crime in the city and claimed there was no more "law and order. "
Trump, then a popular business mogul, claimed that the city was being "ruled by the law of the streets, as roving bands of wild criminals roam our neighborhoods, dispensing their own vicious brand of twisted hatred on whomever they encounter. "
"At what point did we cross the line from the fine and noble pursuit of genuine civil liberties to the reckless and dangerously permissive atmosphere which allows criminals of every age to beat and rape a helpless woman and then laugh at her family's anguish?" he continued in the ad.
The ad came several days after New York City police held a controversial press conference claiming that they believed that a group of youth had attacked Meili. Authorities also claimed in the press conference that they were a part of a group of 32 young boys who assaulted eight other people the same night Meili was attacked.
Trump in the ad said he hated "these muggers and murderers. "
"They should be forced to suffer and, when they kill, they should be executed for their crimes. They must serve as examples for their crimes," he continued. "They must serve as examples so that others will think long and hard before committing a crime or an act of violence. "
"Maybe hate is what we need if we're gonna get something done"
Trump defended the ads several days after they were published in an interview on CNN.
He said that he did not believe that the ads were "inciteful," according to a 2016 CNN article that dug up the May 17, 1989 interview.
"I have never done anything that's caused a more positive stir. I've had 15,000 — 15,000 — letters in the last week and a half," Trump said. "The ad's basically very strong and vocal, they are saying bring back law and order. And I'm not just referring to New York, I'm referring to everything. "
Trump also claimed that he "hates" anyone who commits a crime such as rape, but that hatred could also be a key for change.
"And I said, look this woman was raped, mugged, and thrown off a building -- thrown off a building on top of everything else," he continued. "She's got some major problems, to put it mildly. I said, 'of course I hate these people and let's all hate these people because maybe hate is what we need if we're gonna get something done. '"
"One-sided piece of garbage"
Trump in 2013 criticized an award-winning documentary on the Central Park jogger case. By the time the documentary came out, Reyes had already admitted to the raping and assaulting Meili.
The men who had since been exonerated for the crime were in an ongoing legal battle with New York City for how they handled the case. Richardson, Santana, and McCray sued the city in 2003.
Analysis in the documentary "The Central Park Five" suggests that authorities could have connected Reyes to Meili's rape at the time of the attack.
"The Central Park Five documentary was a one-sided piece of garbage that didn't explain the. horrific crimes of these young men while in park," Trump tweeted on April 24, 2013.
Trump in a June 5, 2013 tweet referred to the Central Park Five as "muggers. "
When asked by a Twitter user how Trump felt that the five men who were convicted of the crime were actually innocent, Trump in a tweet on June 29, 2013 responded: "Innocent of what-how many people did they mugg?"

"It's a disgrace"
After the city awarded the five men $41 million in a settlement, Trump maintained that the men — who were young teenagers when convicted — were still guilty.
Trump in an op-ed published in the New York Daily News suggested that "settling doesn't mean innocence. "
"My opinion on the settlement of the Central Park Jogger case is that it's a disgrace," Trump began his op-ed. "A detective close to the case, and who has followed it since 1989, calls it "the heist of the century. "
"Forty million dollars is a lot of money for the taxpayers of New York to pay when we are already the highest taxed city and state in the country," he continued in the op-ed. "The recipients must be laughing out loud at the stupidity of the city. "
The next day, Trump continued to tweet about the settlement.
"How much money are the lawyers for the Central Park Five getting out of the 40 million dollars, or are they paid by the City (or both)?" Trump tweeted on June 22, 2014.
On the same day, Trump also tweeted: "I'd bet the lawyers for the Central Park 5 are laughing at the stupidity of N. Y. C. when there was such a strong case against their 'clients'"
"They admitted they were guilty"
Around a month before the 2016 election, Trump stood by his opinion that he believed that the five men charged for Meili's attack, who have since been exonerated from the crime, were still guilty.
"They admitted they were guilty," Trump said in a statement to CNN in October 2016. "The police doing the original investigation say they were guilty. The fact that that case was settled with so much evidence against them is outrageous. And the woman, so badly injured, will never be the same. "

Subtle Grandeur That Curdled

Texto completo: For decades, the director Franco Zeffirelli, who died on Saturday at 96, was the unabashed emperor of extravagance in opera. He became so associated with unchecked opulence that it's easy to forget what an astute and fresh-thinking artist he was when he was young.
[ Read the Times obituary. ]
Stage actors like Judi Dench, and film stars like Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, valued his guidance. Singers who believed fervently in opera as theater, including Jon Vickers, Teresa Stratas and Maria Callas, trusted him entirely.
Indeed, the most complete record we have of Callas on film is a televised 1964 London performance of Act II from Puccini's "Tosca," directed by Mr. Zeffirelli. It shows how opera, when rendered with honesty and daring, can be as profound and subtle as any form of drama.
[Here are the films and operas that defined Zeffirelli .]
Mr. Zeffirelli was never small-scale, but he was sensitive, as in the lovingly detailed, freshly rethought Renaissance "Falstaff" with which he made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera in 1964.
"To describe this 'Falstaff' as a sumptuous production is putting it mildly," Harold C. Schonberg wrote in his review in The New York Times. "And it also has taste."
But at some point, Mr. Zeffirelli's work took a turn. It had been the lavish scenic elements of opera that first captivated him when he was a boy growing up in Italy. That fascination -- a fixation, really -- began to drive and define his stagings. More than any other director, Mr. Zeffirelli gave rise to the sense that an opera production is all about the set.
During his heyday in the go-go 1980s and still-flush '90s, Mr. Zeffirelli found willing enablers at the Met. Joseph Volpe, the company's general manager from 1990 to 2006, wrote in his memoir that a "gasp effect" has always been integral to opera, starting from the early years of the art form in the Baroque era, when audiences expected stage spectacle along with great singing.
The best Zeffirelli shows are in this tradition, and certainly provide gasp-inducing pleasures. One comes at the opening of Act II in his 1981 Met staging of Puccini's "La Bohème." Mr. Zeffirelli turned the stage into a teeming street in Paris, with a broad set of stairs leading up to a bustling square and an open-air cafe below -- enough space to accommodate some 250 revelers, vendors, mothers chasing rowdy children and, for the finale, a whole marching band.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The "Bohème" bursts with theatrical charm and sheer joy. This past season, it was wonderful to watch a young, gifted cast romping through the onstage garret and leaping around the surrounding rooftops. I've seen more interesting productions, but few as enjoyable.
But grandeur could quickly curdle, as in Mr. Zeffirelli's garish 1987 production of Puccini's "Turandot." When the lights rise on the massive courtyard of the imperial palace in this fantasy China, we see expanses of celestial whites, silvers and golds, a glittering spectacle so bright you almost have to squint. The set manages to be at once magnificent and cheap.
"If the gods eat dim sum," Bernard Holland wrote in The Times, "they certainly do it in a place like this."
These stagings were not just singer- and conductor-proof. They were drama-proof, almost like a parody of opera.
That the Met's most crowd-pleasing director had slipped irretrievably into a creative rut became clear with the company's 1998 production of Verdi's "La Traviata." Mr. Volpe thought that time had come to replace a lavish 1989 staging by -- who else? -- Mr. Zeffirelli with something fresher.
But, unable to find the right director, Mr. Volpe turned again to Mr. Zeffirelli, who gave audiences an even more luridly tasteless take on the work. During the Spanish soiree party scene in Act II, it was hard not to feel bad for the female dancers who appeared dressed as cows in spotted tights, with horn-ribbed headdresses and extra padding in their backsides.
It was the last new production Mr. Zeffirelli would mount in New York. But even as his death marks the end of an era, the farewell to a certain vision of opera, his steroidal aesthetic has kept its hold -- some might say its stranglehold -- on the Met and its core audience.
Not long after Peter Gelb, Mr. Volpe's successor at the Met, began his tenure, he decided to mothball the director's popular 1985 "Tosca," a production that paid scrupulous attention to the actual locales in Rome where the story unfolds.
On opening night of the 2009-10 season, the Met introduced a grim, sordid new production by Luc Bondy. Greeted with boos, the staging was a fiasco. "Tosca" became a proxy battle in opera circles over traditional approaches -- represented by Mr. Zeffirelli's ornate old staging -- and modern concepts like Mr. Bondy's.
And you know what? When the Bondy "Tosca" was itself replaced on New Year's Eve 2017, David McVicar's new production looked suspiciously like Mr. Zeffirelli's.
Mr. Zeffirelli had won -- the battle, if not the war. Even as he stuck stubbornly to a set-is-all, traditionalist style -- and a swath of the Met's audience was stuck there, too -- opera was moving on without him.
At the Met, there have been thrillingly contemporary productions that combine scenic wonder with incisive interpretations. Robert Carsen's splendid "Falstaff" places the story in post-World War II England; Patrice Cheréau's "Elektra" delved into the subtleties of its characters' twisted minds.
Mr. Cheréau's milestone 1976 staging of Wagner's "Ring," for the Bayreuth Festival in Germany, was the grandfather of all those stagings. Presenting the work as a metaphor of heedless ambition during the Industrial Age, not a spectacle of horns and breastplates, this production, among many others like it, showed that opera could be insightful, keenly dramatic, responsive to its performers, and still breathtakingly beautiful.
Mr. Zeffirelli once knew this.

Texto completo: Expertise in the language of the internet is part of what has made BuzzFeed a digital giant. Now members of the website's news staff are using their fluency in digital culture to pressure their employer to come to the bargaining table.
The BuzzFeed News Union, which came to life four months ago when the staff decided to join the national News Guild, invoked an online trope in the bio of its Twitter account: "Building a stronger newsroom while staying nimble -- get you a union who can do both." The line is a play on the "get you a man who can do both" meme, which BuzzFeed explained in a 2016 piece.
Last week, the account posted a "sign bunny" -- a pictogram of a sign-holding rabbit, made from computer symbols -- to note that the company had yet to recognize the union.
On Monday, BuzzFeed News staff members took their efforts offline, staging a four-hour walkout at the company's offices in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington.
The tools of protest at a rally outside its Manhattan headquarters were decidedly old school: signs, T-shirts, chants, a bullhorn for speeches and an inflated rat to signify a nonunion workplace. A Tex-Mex restaurant down the block sent pounds of chips and salsa in solidarity.
"If BuzzFeed is committed to having a news division, they need to keep up the industry labor standards that people fought for for decades," said Dominic Holden, a political reporter who serves on BuzzFeed's union organizing committee.
There has been a wave of unionization at online publications, getting its start at Gawker in 2015. Outlets that have followed Gawker's lead include the original online magazines Slate and Salon; destination sites like Vice Media, HuffPost, Refinery29, The Dodo and Vox; the humor site The Onion; the podcasting company Gimlet Media; the music site Pitchfork; and New York Magazine's online verticals The Cut, Vulture and Intelligencer.
In joining with unions, reporters and editors at online publications are following in the footsteps of their print predecessors. Now that digital media has matured, digital journalists have dropped the we're-just-happy-to-be-published attitude that once sustained them.
"People want a career," said Hamilton Nolan, a staff writer at the website Splinter, who helped lead the Gawker union drive. "They don't just want to jump every couple years from job to job."
The ranks have swelled recently at two unions representing writers and editors: the News Guild, which represents the staff at The New York Times, among other media organizations, and the Writers Guild of America East, perhaps best known for its work with television and film writers. Organizers at the two unions estimated that the digital wave has brought them 2,000 new members.
The trend was in evidence on Friday when workers at Vox Media, whose holdings include SB Nation, Eater, The Verge and the namesake news site, ratified a new contract after more than a year of bargaining. In an email to the staff, the chief executive, Jim Bankoff, announced that the company would extend certain features of the union contract -- such as a 16-week leave for new parents and a new emphasis on diversity -- to all employees.
Amy Plitt, the Curbed NY editor and a member of the Vox bargaining committee, said that after the agreement became public, she noticed posts on Twitter saying Vox Media looked like an attractive place to work.
"I think it will make it easier for companies to bring in talented voices, who ultimately make these brands better," she added.
Things are more contentious at BuzzFeed. Of the site's roughly 1,250 employees, it is the 200 or so journalists at BuzzFeed News, the division led by the editor Ben Smith, who are taking part in the union drive. Among the sticking points between them and company leaders is how to define which employees would be members of the union.
During a meeting with staff in 2015, BuzzFeed's chief executive, Jonah Peretti, expressed his opposition to a union at the company he co-founded.
"I don't think a union is right for BuzzFeed," Mr. Peretti said. He argued that it would put workers and managers at odds and lead to rigid job definitions that would make the company less flexible than Google or Facebook, neither of which has a union.
Nevertheless, Mr. Peretti said Monday that an offer to voluntarily recognize the union was "on the table." The organizing committee has refused to accept that offer because it feels the proposal could unduly restrict the number of staff members who would belong to the union.
Unions are arising in digital media during hard times for the industry. More than a thousand jobs were lost at digital outlets this year, including a layoff of 15 percent of BuzzFeed's staff.
In some instances, digital journalists have lost their jobs soon after joining unions. In 2017, days after reporters at the New York City news sites DNAInfo and Gothamist celebrated their affiliation with the Writers Guild of America East, the billionaire owner Joe Ricketts decided to shut the sites down.
Similarly, most of the union staff members at Mic, an online publication for millennials, were laid off just before Bustle Digital Group bought the site last year.
Those who profit from digital media may be reaping a whirlwind they themselves have sown. BuzzFeed, Vox and HuffPost are among the outlets that speak in the language of progressivism, partly in an effort to attract younger and more diverse readers. Lately, the publishers of those sites have been asked to back up the reams of content they have put into the world with the kind of progressive action that predates the advent of wokeness.
As Mr. Holden, the BuzzFeed News political reporter, put it: "They need to demonstrate that being socially conscious isn't just a brand."

Texto completo: Four years ago, the author Suzanne Collins wrote an emotional letter to mark the conclusion of her blockbuster "Hunger Games" trilogy.
"Having spent the last decade in Panem, it's time to move on to other lands," she wrote of leaving behind her fictional world, as the final film was released.
But now, Collins has decided to return to the story that made her one of the world's most successful children's book authors, with a prequel that takes place in Panem 64 years before the events of "The Hunger Games."
The novel, as yet untitled, is due to come out in May 2020, according to a news release from Collins's publisher, Scholastic.
"With this book, I wanted to explore the state of nature, who we are, and what we perceive is required for our survival," Collins said in a statement. "The reconstruction period 10 years after the war, commonly referred to as the Dark Days -- as the country of Panem struggles back to its feet -- provides fertile ground for characters to grapple with these questions and thereby define their views of humanity."
With a prequel, Collins will revive one of the most successful fantasy franchises of the past several decades.
Set in a fictional dystopian world where children from competing districts are forced to fight in a televised, reality show-like competition, "The Hunger Games" was a groundbreaking novel that redefined the boundaries of young adult fiction. Its gritty, violent story featured a resilient young protagonist, the bow-and-arrow-slinging heroine Katniss Everdeen. In the wake of best-selling Y.A. fantasy series like "Twilight" and "Harry Potter," Collins's series ushered in a new wave of dark dystopian and post-apocalyptic children's books.
[ Read our review of "The Hunger Games." ]
When "The Hunger Games" was released, in 2008, it became an instant best seller. Two more books followed, and the trilogy was translated into 54 languages, with more than 100 million copies in print, and remained on The New York Times best-seller list for more than five consecutive years. Film adaptations, starring Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen, earned nearly $ 3 billion worldwide at the box office. (Lionsgate is in talks with Collins about adapting the prequel novel into a film as well, according to a statement from a Lionsgate executive.)
Collins has said she got the idea for the series when flipping channels between reality TV programs and a news segment about the conflict in Iraq. The jarring contrast gave her the idea for a world where an orchestrated battle to the death was televised for entertainment as a way to appease and oppress the masses. Collins was also influenced by her father's military service in Vietnam and wanted to introduce young readers to "just war theory" by describing a government that was so oppressive that armed revolution would be the only recourse.
Collins has stayed relatively under the radar since the conclusion of "The Hunger Games" trilogy. Her most recent book, "Year of the Jungle," an autobiographical picture book about a young girl whose father goes off to fight in the Vietnam War, was a dramatic departure.
It's unclear whether a prequel without the same beloved characters will hold as much appeal as the earlier books. A decade is an eternity in pop culture, and many fans of the original series may have aged out or moved on to other fandoms. But other authors have successfully managed to extend their franchises while leaving their most famous characters behind, most famously J.K. Rowling, who has extended the universe of "Harry Potter" with spinoffs set in the same world.
Still, even if only a fraction of "Hunger Games" fans pick up the prequel, it will likely still be a massive hit, and Scholastic is betting that readers will still flock to a story set in Panem.
"Suzanne Collins is a master at combining brilliant storytelling, superb world building, breathtaking suspense, and social commentary," Ellie Berger, the president of Scholastic Trade, said in a statement. "We are absolutely thrilled -- as both readers and publishers -- to introduce the devoted fans of the series and a new audience to an entirely new perspective on this modern classic."

Texto completo: Believe the hype. "Fleishman Is in Trouble" is even better than we were promised. Taffy Brodesser-Akner, a New York Times Magazine writer, brings to her first novel the currency of a hot dating app and the wisdom of a Greek tragedy. The result is a feminist jeremiad nested inside a brilliant comic novel - a book that makes you laugh so hard you don't notice till later that your eyebrows have been singed off.
As the story opens, life sounds like an erotic carnival for Toby Fleishman. A New York doctor newly separated from his wife, Toby has arrived at the age of 41 to discover a city suddenly flush with women who want him. Now . "His phone was aglow from sunup to sundown," the narrator writes, with texts that contained "underboob and sideboob and just straight up boob and all the parts of a woman he never dared dream he would encounter." After enduring a chronically nerdy adolescence and a tense 14-year marriage, Toby is dazzled by this sexual bounty. "Could it be," he wonders, "that he wasn't as repulsive as he'd been led to believe by the myriad rejections of just about every single girl he'd ever made eye contact with?"
Brodesser-Akner demonstrates an anthropologist's thoroughness in her study of contemporary adult dating and its catalogue of sexual practices, but her prose, ringing with manic energy, is obscenely funny. She seems equally amused and horrified as she traces the pixels of lust and humiliation flitting across social media.
Poor Toby is thrust into a state of constant arousal, punctuated by moments of deep confusion about his impending divorce from a successful talent agent. What should he reveal to his colleagues about the dissolution of his marriage? How should he respond to those spears of concern from old friends who poke at the carcass of his marriage like gleeful boys around a dead squirrel? And most baffling of all, what should he tell his son and daughter, ages 9 and 11, who find themselves suspended between two homes?
Perhaps every engaged couple should read this book before they tie the knot - the way amateur skydivers must sign a liability release that states: "You May Be Seriously and Permanently Injured or Killed." With merciless precision, Brodesser-Akner traces the arcing trajectory of doomed affections: the glorious takeoff, the deluded calm, the shrieking descent.
Much of the first section of the novel follows Toby's frantic efforts to sleep with as many women as he can, while locking down a big promotion at the hospital and taking care of his children - a cursed schedule of overlapping demands. You see, Fleishman is in trouble. His estranged wife, Rachel, has stopped returning his calls. She's no longer picking up the kids. Toby doesn't even know where she is. It's just her latest infuriatingly selfish stunt - or at least Toby would have us believe as he recalls one example after another of her chilliness, her lack of affection, her complete disregard for how much he does to keep their family humming.
So far, so John Updike. But there's something wonderfully contrary going on here.
This entire story is told by Toby's old friend, Libby Epstein. For large sections of the novel, though, she stays as hidden as a bird hunter in a field blind. So expansive and intimate is her knowledge of Toby's experience - his conversations, his actions, even his thoughts - that it's easy to imagine we're hearing the voice of an omniscient narrator. It turns out that, like Brodesser-Akner herself, Libby used to be a writer for a men's magazine, and she's most comfortable expressing herself in expansive profiles of other people. The further we read into this tale of Toby's marital discord, the more we realize that Libby is trying to work out something about her own existential plight.
That becomes more explicit in the novel's final section. It's not a revelation as dramatic as the second half of Lauren Groff's "Fates and Furies," but it shines a new light on the story of Toby and Rachel's marriage. Libby's sympathies - and ours - are suddenly unmoored in the conflicting currents of love and resentment. Perhaps Toby is not the long-suffering saint he imagines himself to be. But something bigger is happening here than just the dissolution of one wealthy couple. When Libby finally comes out from the margins of this story, she uses Rachel to offer a sustained reflection on the impossible pressures that talented women endure.
I haven't felt this much energy sparking off a novel since Claire Messud's "The Woman Upstairs." Here, in one gut-punching paragraph after another, is the articulate fury of someone who once dared to imagine that her ambition could be expressed and appreciated. Only too late does Rachel realize that "her success made her poison." She's ripped apart by the old demands of full-time motherhood and the new requirements of full-time work and the sheer exhaustion of having to flatter and reassure and soothe all the fragile men in her life.
But Brodesser-Akner swings the sword full circle, slicing through the demeaning rules of the patriarchy just as effectively as she slays the fatuous optimism of that "girl-power" propaganda fed to modern girls. "If you are a smart woman," Libby says, "you cannot stand by and remain sane once you fully understand, as a smart person does, the constraints of this world on a woman."
Conveying the full tragedy of that predicament in a story that's often blisteringly funny is the real triumph of this book. Few novels express so clearly that we're all in trouble.

Texto completo: BY ULA ILNYTZKY
The Associated Press
NEW YORK - Gloria Vanderbilt, the intrepid heiress, artist and romantic who began her extraordinary life as the "poor little rich girl" of the Great Depression, survived family tragedy and multiple marriages and reigned during the 1970s and '80s as a designer jeans pioneer, died Monday at the age of 95.
Vanderbilt was the great-great-granddaughter of financier Cornelius Vanderbilt and the mother of CNN newsman Anderson Cooper, who announced her death via a first-person obituary that aired on the network Monday morning.
Cooper said Vanderbilt died at home with friends and family at her side. She had been suffering from advanced stomach cancer, he noted.
"Gloria Vanderbilt was an extraordinary woman, who loved life, and lived it on her own terms," Cooper said in a statement. "She was a painter, a writer, and designer but also a remarkable mother, wife, and friend. She was 95 years old, but ask anyone close to her, and they'd tell you, she was the youngest person they knew, the coolest, and most modern."
Her life was chronicled in sensational headlines from her childhood through four marriages and three divorces. She married for the first time at 17, causing her aunt to disinherit her. Her husbands included Leopold Stokowski, the celebrated conductor, and Sidney Lumet, the award-winning movie and television director. In 1988, she witnessed the suicide of one of her four sons.
Tributes online came from celebrities and fans of her clothes alike. Alyssa Milano called her "an incredible woman," Dana Delany said she treasures one of Vanderbilt's paintings and model Carol Alt hailed her as a "fashion icon and innovator." And one Twitter user mourned by remembering the canary Vanderbilt jeans she wore in junior high school.
Vanderbilt was a talented painter and collagist who also acted on the stage ("The Time of Your Life" on Broadway in 1955) and television ("Playhouse 90," Studio One," Kraft Theater," U.S. Steel Hour"). She was a fabric designer who became an early enthusiast for designer denim. The dark-haired, tall and ultra-thin Vanderbilt partnered with Mohan Murjani, who introduced a
$1 million advertising campaign in 1978 that turned the Gloria Vanderbilt brand with its signature white swan label into a sensation.
At its peak in 1980, it was generating over $200 million in sales. And decades later, famous-name designer jeans - dressed up or down - remain a woman's wardrobe staple.
Vanderbilt wrote several books, including the 2004 chronicle of her love life: "It Seemed Important at the Time: A Romance Memoir," which drops such names as Errol Flynn, whom she dated as a teenager; Frank Sinatra, for whom she left Stokowski; Marlon Brando and Howard Hughes.
She claimed her only happy marriage was to author Wyatt Cooper, which ended with his death in 1978 at age 50. Son Anderson Cooper called her memoir "a terrific book; it's like an older 'Sex and the City.'"
"I've had many, many loves," Vanderbilt told The Associated Press in a 2004 interview. "I always feel that something wonderful is going to happen. And it always does."
Noting her father's death when she was a toddler, she said: "If you don't have a father, you don't miss it, because you don't know what it is. It was really only when I married Wyatt Cooper that I understood what it was like to have a father, because he was just an extraordinary father."
In 2016, Vanderbilt and Anderson Cooper appeared together in the HBO documentary "Nothing Left Unsaid."
Gloria Laura Madeleine Sophie Vanderbilt was born in 1924, a century after her great-great-grandfather started the family fortune, first in steamships, later in railroads. He left around $100 million when he died in 1877 at age 82.
Her father, Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt, was 43, a gambler and boozer dying of liver disease when he married Gloria Morgan, 19, in 1923. Their daughter was 1 when Vanderbilt died in 1925, having gone through $25 million in 14 years.
Beneficiary of a $5 million trust fund, Vanderbilt became the "poor little rich girl" in 1934 at age 10 as the object of a custody fight between her globe-trotting mother and matriarchal aunt.
The aunt, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, 59, who controlled $78 million and founded the Whitney Museum of American Art, won custody of her niece.
A shocked judge had closed the trial when a maid accused the child's mother of a lesbian affair with a member of the British royal family. The fight was chronicled in the best-selling 1980 book "Little Gloria ... Happy at Last," made into a TV miniseries in 1982 with Angela Lansbury playing Whitney.
The "poor little rich girl" nickname "bothered me enormously," Vanderbilt told The Associated Press in a 2016 interview . "I didn't see any of the press - the newspapers were kept from me. I didn't know what it meant. I didn't feel poor and I didn't feel rich. It really did influence me enormously to make something of my life when I realized what it meant."
After spending the next seven years on her aunt's Long Island estate, Vanderbilt went to Hollywood. She dated celebrities and declared she would marry Hughes. Instead, the 17-year-old wed Hughes' press agent, Pasquale di Cicco, prompting her aunt to cut Gloria out of her will.
Vanderbilt came into her own $5 million trust fund in 1945 at age 21. She also divorced di Cicco, whom she said had beaten her often, and the next day married the 63-year-old Stokowski. The marriage to the conductor lasted 10 years and produced two sons, Stanislaus and Christopher.
After her marriage broke up, Vanderbilt found herself embroiled in another custody case, this time as the mother. During the closed hearings, Stokowski accused Vanderbilt of spending too much time at parties and too little with the boys. She accused him of tyrannizing his sons and said he really was 85, and not 72 as he claimed.
Justice Edgar Nathan Jr. gave Vanderbilt full-time custody. But he commented that the court had wasted a month on "the resolution of problems which mature, intelligent parents should be able to work out for themselves."
Vanderbilt married Lumet in 1956 and lived with him and her children in a 10-room duplex penthouse on Gracie Square. She divorced Lumet and married Cooper in 1963.
Their elder son, Carter, a Princeton graduate and editor at American Heritage, killed himself in 1988 at age 23, leaping from his mother's 14th floor apartment as she tried to stop him. Police said he had been treated for depression and friends said he was despondent over a break-up with a girlfriend. Vanderbilt says in "Nothing Left Unsaid" that she contemplated following him out the window, but the thought of how it would devastate Anderson stopped her.
After her success in designer jeans, Vanderbilt branched out into other areas, including shoes, scarves, table and bed linens, and china, through her company, Gloria Concepts. In 1988 Vanderbilt joined the designer fragrance market with her signature "Glorious."
By the late 1980s, Vanderbilt sold the name and licenses for the brand name "Gloria Vanderbilt" to Gitano, who transferred it to a group of private investors in 1993. More recently, her stretch jeans have been licensed through Jones Apparel Group Inc., which acquired Gloria Vanderbilt Apparel Corp. in 2002 for $138 million.
Vanderbilt became the target of a swindle in the late 1970s and early '80s when she made her psychiatrist and a lawyer associates in her business affairs. A court held that the two had looted millions from Vanderbilt's bank accounts.
Vanderbilt also made headlines in 1980 when she filed, but later dropped, a discrimination complaint against the posh River House apartments, which had rejected her bid to buy a $1.1 million duplex. She claimed the board was worried that black singer Bobby Short, who appeared with her on TV commercials, might marry her.
In 2009, the 85-year-old Vanderbilt penned a new novel, "Obsession: An Erotic Tale," a graphic tale about an architect's widow who discovers a cache of her husband's letters that reveal his secret sex life.
In an interview with The New York Times, she said she wasn't embarrassed about the explicitness of her new book, saying: "I don't think age has anything to do with what you write about. The only thing that would embarrass me is bad writing, and the only thing that really concerned me was my children. You know how children can be about their parents. But mine are very intelligent and supportive."

Trump’s troubling trade tirades

Texto completo: President Donald Trump has declared victory in his confrontation with Mexico. After he threatened to impose crippling tariffs on $350 billion worth of goods Mexico exports annually to the U.S., that country’s leaders agreed to measures aimed at impeding asylum-seekers from Central America that flow through Mexico headed for the American border.
The short-term headlines were certainly favorable to the president. But the long-term cost to Trump could be very damaging. The president’s strongest argument for a second term is a vibrant economy, and his actions are jeopardizing fiscal stability and his own re-election chances.
The clash with Mexico is part of a much larger pattern in which the president blusters and bullies his way around the world, threatening trading partners from China and Japan to France and Canada if they don’t knuckle under to his demands. And the backlash is already blossoming. The U.S. economy added only 75,000 new jobs last month, one of the lowest monthly totals since the last recession ended 10 years ago, and those results reflect a global economic slowdown that many economists blame at least in part on Trump’s trade tirades.
The World Bank cited "rising trade protectionism" as a prime cause of weakening economic growth in 2018.
Republican senators were so alarmed at Trump’s bellicose threats toward Mexico that they were preparing to block new tariffs before the president canceled them.
"We are going to have a lot of our members who are very concerned about where this is headed," said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the second-ranking Republican, to The New York Times.
Since a healthy economy remains a prime GOP campaign issue, he added, "I don’t know why we would want to step on that." The Wall Street Journal warned in an editorial that "the effects of trade uncertainty are rippling out," and that the May jobs report was "a flashing yellow light that Mr. Trump needs to settle his trade wars and get back to promoting growth."
The economic slowdown is not the only thing signaling danger for the president. The brightest warning light, however, foreshadows the impact of Trump’s policies on the economy. Businesses detest chaos and confusion, but the president firmly believes that he thrives in precisely those conditions. And after his encounter with Mexico, he seems more emboldened than ever to raise tensions with trading partners by threatening new penalties.
"Protectionism shows no signs of abating; rather, it is intensifying," Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at MFR Inc., told the Times. Myron Brilliant, head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, added on CNBC: "The weaponization of tariffs — the increase of threats on our economy, and on our farmers, our manufacturers, our consumers — is going to hurt our country."
Those farmers, manufacturers and consumers also vote. And Trump’s tariff tirades risk undermining economic growth, and alienating those voters, just as his re-election campaign is accelerating.

Texto completo: A Nebraska school district will begin testing students who participate in extracurricular activities for nicotine amid a spike in student e-cigarette use, a school official has said.
Fairbury Public Schools Superintendent Stephen Grizzle told USA TODAY that the school district has seen a "tremendous increase" in disciplinary actions tied to vaping and smoking in the past year.
In the most recent academic year, there were 30 incidents in the district's junior-senior high school, which had 383 students enrolled in grades 7 through 12. In the year before, there were only seven incidents.
"We hope to help students to resist the temptation to experiment with these products," Grizzle wrote in an email to USA TODAY.
Speaking with the Lincoln Journal Star, he said, "vaping and smoking in our view is reaching epidemic proportions. "
Students who participate in activities such as sports or band already have to agree to be tested for certain substances, Grizzle said. The school district's new policy was approved last month and will take effect next academic year, he told the New York Times.

The change comes amid national concern over youth vaping. In September, then-Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb declared youth vaping an "epidemic" and announced a series of measures the FDA would take against electronic cigarette manufacturers.
According to Grizzle, 20 to 25 students at a time are randomly selected to be tested, and testing occurs about nine times during the school year.
If a student comes back with a positive result for a banned substance, the consequences vary, he told the Journal Star.
"We hope we are giving students an extra way to say 'no' to peer pressure," he wrote in an email.
Grizzle said reaction to the policy change has been mostly positive.
"There are some who believe it is an intrusion, but most understand that we are simply trying to be a proactive partner with our parents to help deter the use of the harmful, illegal substances," he said.
Nebraska lawmakers also recently raised the legal age to buy vapor and e-cigarette products from 18 to 19, the Journal Star reported.
The U. S. Supreme Court in 2002 ruled to approve random drug testing for middle and high school students competing in extracurricular activities.

Chris Franz, an owner of the testing company the district works with, told the Journal Star that the threshold for testing students' nicotine levels will be high enough so students who inhaled the smoke secondhand will not have positive results.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nicotine can harm children's brain development, including their attention, learning, mood and impulse control.
More than 3. 6 million U. S. middle and high school students used an e-cigarette product in 2018, the CDC says.
While proponents of vaping say the products can help adult smokers transition from harmful traditional cigarettes, Gottlieb said he feared that more teens who otherwise would never have used a nicotine product are getting hooked.

Ad Creators Get Inspiration From Big Data; Consumer data increasingly is shaping the creative process at ad agencies. Some worry that the trend will lead to less originality

Texto completo: Consumer data has become an integral part of digital ad-buying, allowing advertisers to better target consumers on the internet. Now, data is shaping the creative process as well, a trend that is sparking debate within the advertising industry.
Ad agencies' increasing reliance on data is inverting the traditional creative model, where the teams dreaming up ad campaigns use their gut instincts to tap into the zeitgeist. Now, thanks to a preponderance of highly specific information about consumers collected from sources such as social media, surveys and search engines, more agencies are making creative choices based on what the data dictate.
Such an approach is creating tension within the industry, ad executives say, alienating the evangelists who believe that data yield more precise messaging from those who think it should be just another ingredient in the creative calculus—if that. For the moment, the data evangelists appear to be winning out.
Jason Musante, the chief creative officer of Huge, a digital-marketing agency in Brooklyn owned by Interpublic Group of Cos., which recently acquired Acxiom's data-marketing unit, says that data is going to make the adage "Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is, I don't know which half" a thing of the past.
Data can infuse an ad campaign's creative execution in a variety of ways.
Rob Campbell, a Memphis-based director of strategy at VMLY&R, the newly consolidated marketing agency owned by WPP Group PLC, the world's largest ad company, is working on a continuing ad campaign for the U.S. Navy aimed at attracting recruits between the ages of 18 and 24.
Using research provided by the Navy, along with VMLY&R's own data, Mr. Campbell says he and his colleagues zeroed in on one specific factoid to hone the message: Younger people aren't familiar with the Navy's workings because so few of them have friends or family members who serve in the military. So the team crafted a campaign to address that, producing, among other things, a video series called "Faces of the Fleet," featuring interviews with sailors. The goal, he says, was to create a sense of empathy for service members in people in that age group.
Those who saw ads from the campaign two or more times were 16% more likely to consider joining the Navy, according to Sandra Muoio, a senior director at Wavemaker, the WPP-owned media agency that joined with VMLY&R to release the videos.
In the U.K., meanwhile, BBH London recently wrapped up a campaign for Burger King that was geared around "one killer data point," as head strategist Ben Shaw puts it. BBH found that two-thirds of people in the U.K. had never heard of the Whopper, because the burger chain had spent most of the past decade advertising its limited-release items.
In April, the agency released a series of ads across multiple platforms in which Burger King customers were depicted as being reprimanded for referring to the Whopper as a cheeseburger—a playful attempt to explain what the Whopper was to British consumers.
The data point allowed BBH to be somewhat counterintuitive to stir up its audience, a strategy that has also been taken up by other firms such as Droga5, the boutique agency that agreed to be bought by Accenture PLC in April and whose recent clients include Dine Brands Global Inc.'s IHOP chain and the New York Times.
According to Amy Avery, Droga5's chief intelligence officer, the firm wouldn't be able to do its job without data guiding the way.
For instance, when creating an ad campaign for the Times in 2017, the Droga5 team relied on a tool designed to gauge the emotions behind online posts. It determined that the prevailing mood across the country was that the truth was under attack, so it designed a campaign focused on the importance of truth and urging people to support that cause by subscribing to the Times. The agency says the campaign was launched during the Academy Awards, an event that it determined would be popular with the target audience and that was held toward the end of the month, when Times subscriptions tend to fall off.
While consumer data is for many ad executives the sine qua non of ad-making, veteran brand strategist Adam Hanft says that creative directors from the "Mad Men" era were largely skeptical of reading too deeply into marketing research, viewing the findings from focus groups and copy testing, for instance, as a damper on originality.

But that has changed in the past decade or so as data-centric platforms such as Google and Facebook have asserted their control over the ad industry. "We live in an era where data is valuable and it's useful," says Abbey Klaassen, the New York-based president of digital agency 360i, "and if you have zero regard for it, then you aren't going to be effective as a marketer."
Still, while many see data as a panacea, others in the industry remain skeptical about its usefulness. Mark Fitzloff, an ad industry veteran and the founder of Opinionated, a Portland, Ore.-based creative agency, says he ignores the insights gleaned from data all the time because he believes an overreliance on consumer information has taken spontaneity and surprise out of the creative process, leading to a sense of homogeneity in advertising.
"If we all march from this detailed map of consumer behavior," he says, "we're going to make the same stuff."
Others take a more measured view. "There's a danger, obviously, if you follow data as the only guide," says Scott Donaton, the global chief creative officer at Digitas, a Publicis Media agency. "But if you use data as a spark to an insight," he adds, then it can have a positive effect.
Some industry observers say data may become less central to the creative process in the future as concerns over how to safeguard consumers' private information become more of a priority.
But if that day should come, advertisers can always rely on the more traditional approaches.
"What's the oldest data point in the world?" says Mr. Musante, the creative officer at Huge. "It's your gut."

Russian and Chinese officials backed down after protests. Don’t expect that to be a regular thing.

Texto completo: Russian and Chinese authorities were confronted with protests this past week that forced each to blink. They learned a little something about how far they can push people on citizens’ rights, but that doesn’t mean they’ll stop – more likely that they’ll just act a little smarter.
The nub of protests in Hong Kong and Moscow is the well-founded fear that the Chinese and Russian criminal justice systems can do pretty much whatever they want to nearly anyone. At any time. The Russian protests started when Moscow authorities arrested investigative reporter Ivan Golunov on bogus drug charges. In Hong Kong, the fear of abuses via a proposed extradition agreement with the Chinese mainland was enough to get people going.
Golunov, who works for an online news agency based in Latvia (where at least the editors are out of the Kremlin’s reach), was released without charge. A couple of senior police officials were fired. In Hong Kong, the government suspended, but has yet not withdrawn, legislation that protesters fear would be used to seek the extradition of critics of the Chinese government. The New York Times called it China’s “biggest single retreat on a political issue” since Xi Jinping became president seven years ago, and organizers claimed that 2 million people – almost one of every three Hong Kong residents — took to the streets on Sunday to keep the pressure up.
A lot of ink has been spilled on what, exactly, Golunov’s arrest and release says about Vladimir Putin’s grip on Russia. The answer is not very much. There is plenty of corruption to investigate in Russia; Golunov’s targets included a deputy mayor of Moscow and various shady business figures.
It’s likely that someone with influence – but well below Kremlin level – wanted to make him pay, and they went about it in a characteristically ham-handed way. Alexander Baunov of the Carnegie Moscow Center says that while Russia does indeed have a serious drug problem, allegations of drug possession have become a favorite extortion tool of law enforcement: “Alleged drug possession is now a way that officials can extract a bribe, confiscate a business, force someone to emigrate or simply to keep silent.”
An uproar ensued this time, with reporters and editors joining the protest at a particularly inopportune moment for Putin. Golunov’s case drew attention away from a high-profile set piece: speeches by Putin and Xi at the St. Petersburg Economic Forum.
Three things followed: First, it became obvious that the story was making the entire power structure look bad. Second, the Kremlin officials could step in and be good guys. And third, they would make clear that’s where the matter ended.
So charges were dropped. Putin fired two senior Moscow police officials, who took the fall for the whole mess. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, whose job it is to publicly defend Russian officials, called it the “best day.”
But then, the next day came. And Moscow police arrested hundreds of people who had organized a protest in hopes of keeping pressure on authorities.
The Hong Kong protests illustrate the push and pull of “one country, two systems,” the principle China declared when it reassumed control over Hong Kong 22 years ago. It was meant to reassure Hong Kong residents and the world, and it might have turned out all right if China, as many Western policymakers had bet, would gradually liberalize politically as it became more prosperous. Under Xi, it’s heading in the opposite direction.
Hong Kong has a long history as a place where Beijing’s critics can stay close – but not too close. There have been other protests, notably in 2003 against national security legislation and the so-called “Umbrella Revolution” of five years ago over how elections are conducted.
The legislation introduced by Hong Kong’s pro-Beijing government would have allowed for extradition to the Chinese mainland, Macau and Taiwan (Hong Kong already has extradition treaties with other countries, including the United States and the U.K.). The legislation actually was launched in response to a case in Taiwan. A Hong Kong man allegedly killed his girlfriend there, fled to Hong Kong and could not be sent back to face justice.
But the real reasons for the protests are China’s human rights record in general and arbitrary criminal justice system in particular. You can’t commemorate the Tiananmen Square massacre in mainland China, of course, but tens of thousands of people did in Hong Kong earlier this month. And the fact that mainland authorities have trotted out high-tech surveillance systems and locked up as many as a million Uighurs for “re-education” can’t make anyone feel confident their rights will be respected.
The protests were big enough that the government backed down. Chief Executive Carrie Lam might be in trouble with Beijing, but she hasn’t given up yet.
Hong Kong’s rebellious streak is a long-term irritant, but Beijing still is better off managing it than trying to settle it quickly by busting heads. If history is a guide, authorities will make a tactical retreat. But they’ll be back. “One country” is a principle, “two systems” is a tactic. It’s worth noting that the story of the 2014 “Umbrella Revolution” finally ended two months ago — when its leaders were sentenced to jail.

Texto completo: NEW YORK — Gloria Vanderbilt, the intrepid heiress, artist and romantic who began her extraordinary life as the “poor little rich girl” of the Great Depression, survived family tragedy and multiple marriages and reigned during the 1970s and ’80s as a designer jeans pioneer, died Monday at the age of 95.
Vanderbilt was the great-great-granddaughter of financier Cornelius Vanderbilt and the mother of CNN newsman Anderson Cooper, who announced her death via a first-person obituary that aired on the network Monday morning.
Cooper said Vanderbilt died at home with friends and family at her side. She had been suffering from advanced stomach cancer, he noted.
“Gloria Vanderbilt was an extraordinary woman, who loved life, and lived it on her own terms,” Cooper said in a statement. “She was a painter, a writer, and designer but also a remarkable mother, wife, and friend. She was 95 years old, but ask anyone close to her, and they’d tell you, she was the youngest person they knew, the coolest, and most modern.”
Her life was chronicled in sensational headlines from her childhood through four marriages and three divorces. She married for the first time at 17, causing her aunt to disinherit her. Her husbands included Leopold Stokowski, the celebrated conductor, and Sidney Lumet, the award-winning movie and television director. In 1988, she witnessed the suicide of one of her four sons.
Vanderbilt was a talented painter and collagist who also acted on the stage (“The Time of Your Life” on Broadway) and television (“Playhouse 90,” ”Studio One,” ”Kraft Theater,” ”U.S. Steel Hour”). She was a fabric designer who became an early enthusiast for designer denim. The dark-haired, tall and ultra-thin Vanderbilt partnered with Mohan Murjani, who introduced a $1 million advertising campaign in 1978 that turned the Gloria Vanderbilt brand with its signature white swan label into a sensation.
At its peak in 1980, it was generating over $200 million in sales. And decades later, famous-name designer jeans — dressed up or down — remain a woman’s wardrobe staple.
Vanderbilt wrote several books, including the 2004 chronicle of her love life: “It Seemed Important at the Time: A Romance Memoir,” which drops such names as Errol Flynn, whom she dated as a teenager; Frank Sinatra, for whom she left Stokowski; Marlon Brando and Howard Hughes.
She claimed her only happy marriage was to author Wyatt Cooper, which ended with his death in 1978 at age 50. Son Anderson Cooper called her memoir “a terrific book; it’s like an older ‘Sex and the City.’”
“I’ve had many, many loves,” Vanderbilt told The Associated Press in a 2004 interview. “I always feel that something wonderful is going to happen. And it always does.”
Noting her father’s death when she was a toddler, she said: “If you don’t have a father, you don’t miss it, because you don’t know what it is. It was really only when I married Wyatt Cooper that I understood what it was like to have a father, because he was just an extraordinary father.”
In 2016, Vanderbilt and Anderson Cooper appeared together in the HBO documentary “Nothing Left Unsaid.”
Gloria Laura Madeleine Sophie Vanderbilt was born in 1924, a century after her great-great-grandfather started the family fortune, first in steamships, later in railroads. He left around $100 million when he died in 1877 at age 82.
Her father, Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt, was 43, a gambler and boozer dying of liver disease when he married Gloria Morgan, 19, in 1923. Their daughter was 1 when Vanderbilt died in 1925, having gone through $25 million in 14 years.
Beneficiary of a $5 million trust fund, Vanderbilt became the “poor little rich girl” in 1934 at age 10 as the object of a custody fight between her globe-trotting mother and matriarchal aunt.
The aunt, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, 59, who controlled $78 million and founded the Whitney Museum of American Art, won custody of her niece.
A shocked judge had closed the trial when a maid accused the child’s mother of a lesbian affair with a member of the British royal family. The fight was chronicled in the best-selling 1980 book “Little Gloria … Happy at Last,” made into a TV miniseries in 1982 with Angela Lansbury playing Whitney.
The “poor little rich girl” nickname “bothered me enormously,” Vanderbilt told The Associated Press in 2016. “I didn’t see any of the press — the newspapers were kept from me. I didn’t know what it meant. I didn’t feel poor and I didn’t feel rich. It really did influence me enormously to make something of my life when I realized what it meant.”
After spending the next seven years on her aunt’s Long Island estate, Vanderbilt went to Hollywood. She dated celebrities and declared she would marry Hughes. Instead, the 17-year-old wed Hughes’ press agent, Pasquale di Cicco, prompting her aunt to cut Gloria out of her will.
Vanderbilt came into her own $5 million trust fund in 1945 at age 21. She also divorced Di Cicco, whom she said had beaten her often, and the next day married the 63-year-old Stokowski. The marriage to the conductor lasted 10 years and produced two sons, Stanislaus and Christopher.
After her marriage broke up, Vanderbilt found herself embroiled in another custody case, this time as the mother. During the closed hearings, Stokowski accused Vanderbilt of spending too much time at parties and too little with the boys. She accused him of tyrannizing his sons and said he really was 85, and not 72 as he claimed.
Justice Edgar Nathan Jr. gave Vanderbilt full-time custody. But he commented that the court had wasted a month on “the resolution of problems which mature, intelligent parents should be able to work out for themselves.”
Vanderbilt married Lumet in 1956 and lived with him and her children in a 10-room duplex penthouse on Gracie Square. She divorced Lumet and married Cooper in 1963.
Their elder son, Carter, a Princeton graduate and editor at American Heritage, killed himself in 1988 at age 23, leaping from his mother’s 14th floor apartment as she tried to stop him. Police said he had been treated for depression and friends said he was despondent over a break-up with a girlfriend. Vanderbilt says in “Nothing Left Unsaid” that she contemplated following him, but the thought of how it would devastate Anderson stopped her.
After her success in designer jeans, Vanderbilt branched out into other areas, including shoes, scarves, table and bed linens, and china, through her company, Gloria Concepts. In 1988 Vanderbilt joined the designer fragrance market with her signature “Glorious.”
By the late 1980s, Vanderbilt sold the name and licenses for the brand name “Gloria Vanderbilt” to Gitano, who transferred it to a group of private investors in 1993. More recently, her stretch jeans have been licensed through Jones Apparel Group Inc., which acquired Gloria Vanderbilt Apparel Corp. in 2002 for $138 million.
Vanderbilt became the target of a swindle in the late 1970s and early ’80s when she made her psychiatrist and a lawyer associates in her business affairs. A court held that the two had looted millions from Vanderbilt’s bank accounts.
Vanderbilt also made headlines in 1980 when she filed, but later dropped, a discrimination complaint against the posh River House apartments, which had rejected her bid to buy a $1.1 million duplex. She claimed the board was worried that black singer Bobby Short, who appeared with her on TV commercials, might marry her.
In 2009, the 85-year-old Vanderbilt penned a new novel, “Obsession: An Erotic Tale,” a graphic tale about an architect’s widow who discovers a cache of her husband’s letters that reveal his secret sex life.
In an interview with The New York Times, she said she wasn’t embarrassed about the explicitness of her new book, saying: “I don’t think age has anything to do with what you write about. The only thing that would embarrass me is bad writing, and the only thing that really concerned me was my children. You know how children can be about their parents. But mine are very intelligent and supportive.”

In 2016, Vanderbilt and Anderson Cooper appeared together in the HBO documentary “Nothing Left Unsaid.”
Gloria Laura Madeleine Sophie Vanderbilt was born in 1924, a century after her great-great-grandfather started the family fortune, first in steamships, later in railroads. He left around $100 million when he died in 1877 at age 82.
Her father, Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt, was 43, a gambler and boozer dying of liver disease when he married Gloria Morgan, 19, in 1923. Their daughter was 1 when Vanderbilt died in 1925, having gone through $25 million in 14 years.
Beneficiary of a $5 million trust fund, Vanderbilt became the “poor little rich girl” in 1934 at age 10 as the object of a custody fight between her globe-trotting mother and matriarchal aunt.
The aunt, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, 59, who controlled $78 million and founded the Whitney Museum of American Art, won custody of her niece.
A shocked judge had closed the trial when a maid accused the child’s mother of a lesbian affair with a member of the British royal family. The fight was chronicled in the best-selling 1980 book “Little Gloria … Happy at Last,” made into a TV miniseries in 1982 with Angela Lansbury playing Whitney.
The “poor little rich girl” nickname “bothered me enormously,” Vanderbilt told The Associated Press in 2016. “I didn’t see any of the press — the newspapers were kept from me. I didn’t know what it meant. I didn’t feel poor and I didn’t feel rich. It really did influence me enormously to make something of my life when I realized what it meant.”
After spending the next seven years on her aunt’s Long Island estate, Vanderbilt went to Hollywood. She dated celebrities and declared she would marry Hughes. Instead, the 17-year-old wed Hughes’ press agent, Pasquale di Cicco, prompting her aunt to cut Gloria out of her will.
Vanderbilt came into her own $5 million trust fund in 1945 at age 21. She also divorced Di Cicco, whom she said had beaten her often, and the next day married the 63-year-old Stokowski. The marriage to the conductor lasted 10 years and produced two sons, Stanislaus and Christopher.
After her marriage broke up, Vanderbilt found herself embroiled in another custody case, this time as the mother. During the closed hearings, Stokowski accused Vanderbilt of spending too much time at parties and too little with the boys. She accused him of tyrannizing his sons and said he really was 85, and not 72 as he claimed.
Justice Edgar Nathan Jr. gave Vanderbilt full-time custody. But he commented that the court had wasted a month on “the resolution of problems which mature, intelligent parents should be able to work out for themselves.”
Vanderbilt married Lumet in 1956 and lived with him and her children in a 10-room duplex penthouse on Gracie Square. She divorced Lumet and married Cooper in 1963.
Their elder son, Carter, a Princeton graduate and editor at American Heritage, killed himself in 1988 at age 23, leaping from his mother’s 14th floor apartment as she tried to stop him. Police said he had been treated for depression and friends said he was despondent over a break-up with a girlfriend. Vanderbilt says in “Nothing Left Unsaid” that she contemplated following him, but the thought of how it would devastate Anderson stopped her.
After her success in designer jeans, Vanderbilt branched out into other areas, including shoes, scarves, table and bed linens, and china, through her company, Gloria Concepts. In 1988 Vanderbilt joined the designer fragrance market with her signature “Glorious.”
By the late 1980s, Vanderbilt sold the name and licenses for the brand name “Gloria Vanderbilt” to Gitano, who transferred it to a group of private investors in 1993. More recently, her stretch jeans have been licensed through Jones Apparel Group Inc., which acquired Gloria Vanderbilt Apparel Corp. in 2002 for $138 million.
Vanderbilt became the target of a swindle in the late 1970s and early ’80s when she made her psychiatrist and a lawyer associates in her business affairs. A court held that the two had looted millions from Vanderbilt’s bank accounts.
Vanderbilt also made headlines in 1980 when she filed, but later dropped, a discrimination complaint against the posh River House apartments, which had rejected her bid to buy a $1.1 million duplex. She claimed the board was worried that black singer Bobby Short, who appeared with her on TV commercials, might marry her.
In 2009, the 85-year-old Vanderbilt penned a new novel, “Obsession: An Erotic Tale,” a graphic tale about an architect’s widow who discovers a cache of her husband’s letters that reveal his secret sex life.
In an interview with The New York Times, she said she wasn’t embarrassed about the explicitness of her new book, saying: “I don’t think age has anything to do with what you write about. The only thing that would embarrass me is bad writing, and the only thing that really concerned me was my children. You know how children can be about their parents. But mine are very intelligent and supportive.”

Texto completo: NEW YORK — Gloria Vanderbilt, the intrepid heiress, artist and romantic who began her extraordinary life as the “poor little rich girl” of the Great Depression, survived family tragedy and multiple marriages and reigned during the 1970s and ’80s as a designer jeans pioneer, died Monday at the age of 95.
Vanderbilt was the great-great-granddaughter of financier Cornelius Vanderbilt and the mother of CNN newsman Anderson Cooper, who announced her death via a first-person obituary that aired on the network Monday morning.
Cooper said Vanderbilt died at home with friends and family at her side. She had been suffering from advanced stomach cancer, he noted.
“Gloria Vanderbilt was an extraordinary woman, who loved life, and lived it on her own terms,” Cooper said in a statement. “She was a painter, a writer, and designer but also a remarkable mother, wife, and friend. She was 95 years old, but ask anyone close to her, and they’d tell you, she was the youngest person they knew, the coolest, and most modern.”
Her life was chronicled in sensational headlines from her childhood through four marriages and three divorces. She married for the first time at 17, causing her aunt to disinherit her. Her husbands included Leopold Stokowski, the celebrated conductor, and Sidney Lumet, the award-winning movie and television director. In 1988, she witnessed the suicide of one of her four sons.
Vanderbilt was a talented painter and collagist who also acted on the stage (“The Time of Your Life” on Broadway) and television (“Playhouse 90,” ”Studio One,” ”Kraft Theater,” ”U.S. Steel Hour”). She was a fabric designer who became an early enthusiast for designer denim. The dark-haired, tall and ultra-thin Vanderbilt partnered with Mohan Murjani, who introduced a $1 million advertising campaign in 1978 that turned the Gloria Vanderbilt brand with its signature white swan label into a sensation.
At its peak in 1980, it was generating over $200 million in sales. And decades later, famous-name designer jeans — dressed up or down — remain a woman’s wardrobe staple.
Vanderbilt wrote several books, including the 2004 chronicle of her love life: “It Seemed Important at the Time: A Romance Memoir,” which drops such names as Errol Flynn, whom she dated as a teenager; Frank Sinatra, for whom she left Stokowski; Marlon Brando and Howard Hughes.
She claimed her only happy marriage was to author Wyatt Cooper, which ended with his death in 1978 at age 50. Son Anderson Cooper called her memoir “a terrific book; it’s like an older ‘Sex and the City.’”
“I’ve had many, many loves,” Vanderbilt told The Associated Press in a 2004 interview. “I always feel that something wonderful is going to happen. And it always does.”
Noting her father’s death when she was a toddler, she said: “If you don’t have a father, you don’t miss it, because you don’t know what it is. It was really only when I married Wyatt Cooper that I understood what it was like to have a father, because he was just an extraordinary father.”

Texto completo: It’s time for straight Americans to pay.
Heterosexuals owe their gay compatriots not just an apology for historical grievances, but financial compensation, too. Or at least, that's the assertion of professor Omar G. Encarnación in a New York Times op-ed that circulated over the weekend, titled “The Case for Gay Reparation.”
The notion of race-based “reparations” was revived recently as several Democratic presidential candidates have flirted with the idea and endorsed its further study. Yet in this piece, Encarnación argues that gays are also entitled to restitution, calling reparations “a struggle worth pursuing” and “a useful tool for restoring dignity for those victimized by discriminatory policies and for allowing countries to close long and painful chapters of homosexual repression.”
This is absurd. Proposals for race-based reparations are highly impractical and morally questionable, but at least there is a serious historical basis that can justify restitution, and a clear intergenerational impact that stems from historical discrimination. This simply isn’t the case when it comes to the gay community, a fact that Encarnación conveniently ignores.
To start, Encarnación endorses “moral rehabilitation...which entails a formal apology by the state and the expunging of criminal records of those convicted of a homosexual offense.” He cites the New York Police Department’s recent apology for the 1969 police raid on Stonewall Inn, an incident that’s credited in part with sparking the 1970s gay rights movement. Yet even if it makes sense to pardon and expunge the records of those convicted of sodomy and similar offenses in times past, there’s something empty and even fundamentally immoral about these kinds of formal apologies.
They are offered in most instances by people who did not commit the deed in question and weren’t even involved. Sometimes, they weren’t even born yet. For instance, the leadership of today's NYPD bears no moral responsibility for decisions they played no part in 50 years ago. Additionally, modern gay Americans (like myself) who are the recipients of these apologies were, in most cases, not involved in or affected by these deeds.
This is just as true for many of the other examples Encarnación cites, such as Britain’s 2009 apology to the gay community for the chemical castration of Alan Turing 60 years earlier. Frankly, no one owes me an apology for something they were not involved in and did not do to me.
Encarnación shies away from endorsing the idea of all gay people receiving financial restitution, but he doesn’t come out against it, either. Instead, he starts by praising Germany’s 2016 effort to financially compensate victims of anti-gay atrocities that occurred during the Holocaust. While government compensation for those murdered and interned is reasonable enough, it still essentially punishes modern German taxpayers for the sins of their ancestors. That’s hard to justify morally, and any form of financial gay reparations that goes further would be a disaster.
After all, gay people don’t have an intergenerational legacy in the same way a racial group does. When African Americans were enslaved and brutalized, this created wealth disparities that then perpetuated themselves over the decades and were passed down across generations. And to this day, many or most of them would be able (especially with the help of DNA matching technology) to trace their ancestry back to the person who was wronged, thus proving their family was defrauded of the free labor of their ancestor.
This simply isn’t the case for gays, lesbians, or others whose sexuality was repressed. We have no evidence of homosexuality being passed between generations en masse like racial or ethnic characteristics. This means that today’s gays are largely not financially affected in a lingering way by past atrocities. That makes broad financial reparations impossible to justify. Moreover, the nongay descendants of people once repressed for the crime of homosexuality might end up receiving reparations from modern gay people whose ancestors oppressed them. Is this what we're aiming for?
All in all, this Times op-ed represents just another escalation in the social justice movement’s Oppression Olympics. The author claims that gay Americans are still under attack, referencing the Trump administration’s supposed “hostility.” Yet the only examples he cites are the deletion of web pages from federal websites, and President Trump’s decision to not allow embassies to fly the rainbow flag.
If you want to spin a narrative of modern-day oppression, you’re going to have to do better than that. And until progressives do so, the "Case for Gay Reparations" will remain incredibly weak.

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump respondió a sus bajos números en las encuestas despidiendo a tres de los cinco esncuestadores de su campaña luego que se filtaron a la prensa las preocupantes cifras del apoyo electoral del magante en estados claves para su reelección en 2020.
La medida se produce después de que la semana pasada, varios medios de comunicación informaran sobre la existencia de una encuesta de 17 estados, que supuso muy malas noticias para la reelección de Trump.
El sondeo, realizado por Tony Fabrizio, encuestador líder de la campaña de Trump, entre el 13 de marzo y el 28 de marzo, encontró a Trump detrás del ex vicepresidente Joe Biden con dos dígitos en todos los estados que se consideran cruciales para su victoria en 2020.
Esa misma encuesta que se filtró a la prensa también mostró a Trump con un desempeño inferior en los estados republicanos confiables que no han sido competitivos durante décadas en las elecciones presidenciales.
La decisión de la campaña de despiddir a sus propios encuestadores , Michael Baselice, Adam Geller y Brett Lloyd, tiene el propósito de evitar nuevas fugas de datos de encuestas internas, informó el New York Times el domingo.
Trump ha negado airadamente la cobertura de los números en los últimos días, y dijo a ABC News en una entrevista transmitida el jueves: “Esas encuestas no existen. Acabo de reunirme con alguien que es un encuestador y estoy ganando en todas partes, así que simplemente No sé de qué estás hablando “.
Trump también tuiteó que sus números son “los mejores números que hemos tenido”, y afirmó que los números informados eran de “Encuestas falsas”.

Texto completo: NEW YORK (AP) - Gloria Vanderbilt, the intrepid heiress, artist and romantic who began her extraordinary life as the “poor little rich girl” of the Great Depression, survived family tragedy and multiple marriages and reigned during the 1970s and ‘80s as a designer jeans pioneer, died Monday at the age of 95.
Vanderbilt, the great-great-granddaughter of financier Cornelius Vanderbilt and the mother of CNN newsman Anderson Cooper, who announced her death via a first-person obituary that aired on the network Monday morning.
Cooper confirmed Vanderbilt died at home with friends and family at her side. She had been suffering from advanced stomach cancer, he noted.
“Gloria Vanderbilt was an extraordinary woman, who loved life, and lived it on her own terms,” Cooper said in a statement. “She was a painter, a writer, and designer but also a remarkable mother, wife, and friend. She was 95 years old, but ask anyone close to her, and they’d tell you, she was the youngest person they knew, the coolest, and most modern.”
Her life was chronicled in sensational headlines from her childhood through four marriages and three divorces. She married for the first time at 17, causing her aunt to disinherit her. Her husbands included Leopold Stokowski, the celebrated conductor, and Sidney Lumet, the award-winning movie and television director. In 1988, she witnessed the suicide of one of her four sons.
Vanderbilt was a talented painter and collagist who also acted on the stage (“The Time of Your Life” on Broadway) and television (“Playhouse 90,” ‘’Studio One,” ‘’Kraft Theater,” ‘’U.S. Steel Hour”). She was a fabric designer who became an early enthusiast for designer denim. The dark-haired, tall and ultra-thin Vanderbilt partnered with Mohan Murjani, who introduced a $1 million advertising campaign in 1978 that turned the Gloria Vanderbilt brand with its signature white swan label into a sensation.
At its peak in 1980, it was generating over $200 million in sales. And decades later, famous-name designer jeans - dressed up or down - remain a woman’s wardrobe staple.
Vanderbilt wrote several books, including the 2004 chronicle of her love life: “It Seemed Important at the Time: A Romance Memoir,” which drops such names as Errol Flynn, whom she dated as a teenager; Frank Sinatra, for whom she left Stokowski; Marlon Brando and Howard Hughes.
She claimed her only happy marriage was to author Wyatt Cooper, which ended with his death in 1978 at age 50. Son Anderson Cooper called her memoir “a terrific book; it’s like an older ‘Sex and the City.’”
“I’ve had many, many loves,” Vanderbilt told The Associated Press in a 2004 interview. “I always feel that something wonderful is going to happen. And it always does.”
Noting her father’s death when she was a toddler, she said: “If you don’t have a father, you don’t miss it, because you don’t know what it is. It was really only when I married Wyatt Cooper that I understood what it was like to have a father, because he was just an extraordinary father.”
In 2016, Vanderbilt and Anderson Cooper appeared together in the HBO documentary “Nothing Left Unsaid.”
Gloria Laura Madeleine Sophie Vanderbilt was born in 1924, a century after her great-great-grandfather started the family fortune, first in steamships, later in railroads. He left around $100 million when he died in 1877 at age 82.
Her father, Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt, was 43, a gambler and boozer dying of liver disease when he married Gloria Morgan, 19, in 1923. Their daughter was 1 when Vanderbilt died in 1925, having gone through $25 million in 14 years.
Beneficiary of a $5 million trust fund, Vanderbilt became the “poor little rich girl” in 1934 at age 10 as the object of a custody fight between her globe-trotting mother and matriarchal aunt.
The aunt, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, 59, who controlled $78 million and founded the Whitney Museum of American Art, won custody of her niece.
A shocked judge had closed the trial when a maid accused the child’s mother of a lesbian affair with a member of the British royal family. The fight was chronicled in the best-selling 1980 book “Little Gloria ... Happy at Last,” made into a TV miniseries in 1982 with Angela Lansbury playing Whitney.
After spending the next seven years on her aunt’s Long Island estate, Vanderbilt went to Hollywood. She dated celebrities and declared she would marry Hughes. Instead, the 17-year-old wed Hughes’ press agent, Pasquale di Cicco, prompting her aunt to cut Gloria out of her will.
Vanderbilt came into her own $5 million trust fund in 1945 at age 21. She also divorced Di Cicco, whom she said had beaten her often, and the next day married the 63-year-old Stokowski. The marriage to the conductor lasted 10 years and produced two sons, Stanislaus and Christopher.
After her marriage broke up, Vanderbilt found herself embroiled in another custody case, this time as the mother. During the closed hearings, Stokowski accused Vanderbilt of spending too much time at parties and too little with the boys. She accused him of tyrannizing his sons and said he really was 85, and not 72 as he claimed.
Justice Edgar Nathan Jr. gave Vanderbilt full-time custody. But he commented that the court had wasted a month on “the resolution of problems which mature, intelligent parents should be able to work out for themselves.”
Vanderbilt married Lumet in 1956 and lived with him and her children in a 10-room duplex penthouse on Gracie Square. She divorced Lumet and married Cooper in 1963.
Their elder son, Carter, a Princeton graduate and editor at American Heritage, killed himself in 1988 at age 23, leaping from his mother’s 14th floor apartment as she tried to stop him. Police said he had been treated for depression and friends said he was despondent over a break-up with a girlfriend.
After her success in designer jeans, Vanderbilt branched out into other areas, including shoes, scarves, table and bed linens, and china, through her company, Gloria Concepts. In 1988 Vanderbilt joined the designer fragrance market with her signature “Glorious.”
By the late 1980s, Vanderbilt sold the name and licenses for the brand name “Gloria Vanderbilt” to Gitano, who transferred it to a group of private investors in 1993. More recently, her stretch jeans have been licensed through Jones Apparel Group Inc., which acquired Gloria Vanderbilt Apparel Corp. in 2002 for $138 million.
Vanderbilt became the target of a swindle in the late 1970s and early ‘80s when she made her psychiatrist and a lawyer associates in her business affairs. A court held that the two had looted millions from Vanderbilt’s bank accounts.
Vanderbilt also made headlines in 1980 when she filed, but later dropped, a discrimination complaint against the posh River House apartments, which had rejected her bid to buy a $1.1 million duplex. She claimed the board was worried that black singer Bobby Short, who appeared with her on TV commercials, might marry her.
In 2009, the 85-year-old Vanderbilt penned a new novel, “Obsession: An Erotic Tale,” a graphic tale about an architect’s widow who discovers a cache of her husband’s letters that reveal his secret sex life.
In an interview with The New York Times, she said she wasn’t embarrassed about the explicitness of her new book, saying: “I don’t think age has anything to do with what you write about. The only thing that would embarrass me is bad writing, and the only thing that really concerned me was my children. You know how children can be about their parents. But mine are very intelligent and supportive.”

Texto completo: When’s the last time you had a bad thought about your body?
Maybe about the weight you want to lose? The stretch marks on your stomach? Or the underarm flab that threatens to send you airborne when you wave?
If you’re like most women, you have these thoughts constantly. I’m too fat. I’m too thin. I’m too old. I’m too something not quite right. We think about our bodies when we get naked before a shower, when we stand on the scale at night, when we eat food we’ve told ourselves we “shouldn’t” be having. We talk about our bodies with other women — comparing, complaining, commiserating.
In short, we think about our bodies a lot . More specially, we think about what we hate about our bodies.
That’s why I loved a piece in The New York Times this week by Jessica Knoll titled "Smash the wellness industry," who says women have become victims of the lie of the “wellness” industry that thin equals healthy. And because of that myth, women find themselves in a near-constant state of talking/thinking/obsessing all the ways our bodies fall short, all under the guise of seeking better health.
I’ll be the first to admit it, I do this all the time. I set food limits for myself. I set exercise goals. I use apps to help me track my calories. I say (and often believe) it’s because I want to be healthy (because of course I do!), but deep down, at the core of most of these decisions is the fact that I want my body to look like the body I want (and am told I should have).
Knoll concludes with the idea that pursuing health doesn’t have to mean hating our bodies. She writes, “Most days, I feel good in my skin,” she writes. “That said, I’m probably never going to love my body. … We don’t have to love our bodies to respect them.”
I think it’s a shame that women often reach this conclusion: I don’t hate my body, but I don’t love it either. Why not? Why don’t we love our bodies, with all their sags and scars and cellulite?
Does something have to be perfect to be loved? As a mother, I love my children, not because they are perfect or brilliant, but because they are mine. Because they are a gift.
My body is the same. It is mine, given to me to watch over and to care for. And while that means I definitely should be fueling it well and exercising it often, it doesn’t mean I can’t love it with all its imperfections. I tell my children I will love them no matter what. So why would I turn around and deny my body that same kind of unconditional love?
I don’t have to hate my body (and my extension, myself) as I am working towards optimal health. Striving for physical wellness or better eating habits doesn’t have to become synonymous with shame. We don’t have to shame ourselves — scold ourselves — simply because we fall short of some ideal we’re told we need to be.
I, for one, am tired of being ashamed. And with two daughters in my home, watching me step on that scale, hearing me say “I shouldn’t have eaten that” or talk negatively about my body, I think it’s time for a little less shame and a little more love of my body. Not because it’s perfect, but because it’s mine.
And when I look at my girls, I hope they grow up feeling nothing but love for their bodies, no matter the size, shape or scars that come with it.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Sunday floated the possibility of staying in office longer than two terms, suggesting in a morning tweet that his supporters might "demand that I stay longer.
The 22nd Amendment of the Constitution limits the presidency to two terms.
In tweets Sunday morning, Trump also voiced dissatisfaction with recent news coverage of his administration, calling both The Washington Post and The New York Times "the Enemy of the People.
He added: "The good news is that at the end of 6 years, after America has been made GREAT again and I leave the beautiful White House (do you think the people would demand that I stay longer? KEEP AMERICA GREAT), both of these horrible papers will quickly go out of business & be forever gone!
Last year, Trump also joked about doing away with term limits in a speech to Republican donors at his Mar-a-Lago estate in which he praised Chinese President Xi Jinping for doing so in China.
"He's now president for life. President for life. No, he's great, Trump said, according to CNN. "And look, he was able to do that. I think it's great. Maybe we'll have to give that a shot some day.

Texto completo: YARMOUTH -- Sometime toward the end of last year, Shannon Chase and Vox Nova, the highly regarded chamber choir she founded in 2009, parted ways, and it looked briefly as though this adventurous ensemble, which specialized in contemporary choral music, would vanish from the midcoast arts scene.
But by the end of 2018, a group of its singers, intent on continuing the choir's mission, reorganized, with a new artistic director - Virgil Bozeman IV - and a new name, Una Voce Chamber Choir.
The new group quickly introduced itself - its first concert was in January, barely a month after its reconstitution was announced - and Saturday evening, it presented its second program, "Seeking What Is Yet Unfound" - an evening of contemporary settings of poetry by Walt Whitman, Robert Frost and e.e. cummings - at St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church.
Here is some good news: First, though Bozeman will undoubtedly reshape the choir in his own way, he seems comfortable continuing its practice of focusing on contemporary scores, presented in thoughtful, thematic programs. And second, the choir sings with the unity and blend implied by its new name ("a voice," singular).
To open the program, Bozeman turned over the podium to Drew Albert, a tenor in the choir who is also its associate conductor, who led a bright, energetic performance of Paul Rardin's "My Spirit is Uncaged," setting of Whitman's "Jubilant Song." Short as it was, the piece was a fine test of the choir's mettle, given its energy and consistent rhythmic demands, which the singers handled easily while also projecting the text with impressive clarity. Kellie Moody negotiated the involved piano writing ably, and proved a fine accompanist through the rest of the program as well.
Bozeman reclaimed the podium for David Conte's "A Whitman Triptych" and the rest of the program, which included Randall Thompson's "Frostiana (Seven Counry Songs by Robert Frost)" as well as two works by Eric Whitacre, "The City and the Sea (Five Settings of poems by e.e. cummings)" and "I carry your heart," also a cummings setting.
Conte's unaccompanied work, which includes illuminating settings of "O Setting Sun," "What Is the Grass" and "Facing West," posed steeper challenges for the choir. Mainly, it demands a broader range of expression and the ability to move effortlessly from serenity to robustness. The choir met those requirements easily.
But Conte's score also pointed up a few areas where this choir needs work, or at least, an injection of confidence. One is that Bozeman will have to identify strong soloists within the group, or better encourage those he chooses to show what they have. Both soloists in the Conte - baritone Ryan Newell and tenor Albert (who had conducted, earlier) - have appealing voices, and clearly know how to shape a line effectively. But they sounded underpowered, as if they were singing in a corner on their own, not wanting to disturb anyone.
Another was that in passages in which the focus shifted between the male and female sections of the choir, the sopranos and altos seemed able to project power more decisively than the tenors and basses. That should not be difficult to address; in fact, the disparity was less striking in the Thompson, where every movement required a different choral deployment - sometimes the full choir, sometimes just the sopranos and a divided alto section, sometimes just the tenors and basses (divided in various ways).
The Thompson includes a few of Frost's best known poems - "The Road Not Taken" and "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening," among them - and is written in a melodically rich, folksy style that captures Frost's spirit beautifully. But folksiness isn't this music's only striking quality. Chromaticism and rhythmic vitality drive some of the settings as well, and Thompson's setting of "A Girl's Garden" has an overt theatricality, as if it were an outtake from one of Leonard Bernstein's early stage works.
Whitacre, born in 1970, was the youngest composer on the program, but probably the most famous these days, thanks to his prolific output of works and recordings. These e.e. cummings settings are, like many of his works, immediately gratifying to the ear, and sufficiently varied - rhythmically, harmonically and in terms of contrasting levels of energy - to hold the listener's interest. They also captured the wit (and in "i carry your heart," the passion) of the cummings poems, which Una Voce, in turn, conveyed with an admirable directness.
The concert was dedicated to the memory of Christopher Hyde, my predecessor in this space, who died on June 2.

Harriet Tubman $20 bill can't escape wrangling over delay

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Extensive work was. well underway on a new $20 bill bearing the image of Harriet Tubman when Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced last month that the design of the note would be delayed for technical reasons by six years and might not include the former slave and abolitionist.
Many Americans were deeply disappointed with the delay of the bill, which was to be the first to bear the face of an African American. The change would push completion of the imagery past President Donald Trump's time in office, even if he wins a second term, stirring speculation that Trump had intervened to keep his favorite president, Andrew Jackson, a fellow populist, on the front of the note.
But Mnuchin, testifying before Congress, said new security features under development made the 2020 design deadline set by the Obama administration impossible to meet, so he punted Tubman's fate to a future Treasury secretary.
In fact, work on the new $20 note began before Trump took office, and the basic design already on paper most likely could have satisfied the goal of unveiling a note bearing Tubman's likeness on next year's centennial of the 19th Amendment, which granted women the right to vote.
An image of a new $20 bill, produced by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing and obtained by The New York Times from a former Treasury Department official, depicts Tubman in a dark coat with a wide collar and a white scarf.
That preliminary design was completed in late 2016.
A spokeswoman for the bureau, Lydia Washington, confirmed that preliminary designs of the new note were created as part of research that was done after Jacob J. Lew, President Barack Obama's final Treasury secretary, proposed the idea of a Tubman bill.
The development of the note did not stop there. A current employee of the bureau, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter, personally viewed a metal engraving plate and a digital image of a Tubman $20 bill while it was being reviewed by engravers and Secret Service officials as recently as May 2018. This person said that the design appeared to be far along in the process.
Within the bureau, this person said, there was a sense of excitement and pride about the new $20 note.
But the Treasury Department, which oversees the engraving bureau, decided that a new $20 bill would not be made public next year. Current and former department officials say Mnuchin chose the delay to avoid the possibility that Trump would cancel the plan outright and create even more controversy.
In an interview last week, Mnuchin denied that the reasons for the delay were anything but technical.
"Let me assure you, this speculation that we've slowed down the process is just not the case," Mnuchin said, speaking on the sidelines of the G-20 finance ministers meeting in Japan.
The Treasury secretary reiterated that security features drive the change of the currency and rejected the notion that political interference was at play. He declined to say if he believed his predecessor had tried to politicize the currency.
"There is a group of experts that's interagency, including the Secret Service and others and BEP, that are all career officials that are focused on this," he said, referring to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. "They're working as fast as they can."
Monica Crowley, a spokeswoman for Mnuchin, added that the release into circulation of the new $20 note remained on schedule with the bureau's original timeline of 2030. She did not, however, say that the bill would feature Tubman.
"The scheduled release (printing) of the $20 bill is on a timetable consistent with the previous administration," she said in a statement.
But building the security features of a new note before designing its images struck some as curious.
Larry E. Rolufs, a former director of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, said that because the security features of a new note are embedded in the imagery, they normally would be created simultaneously. ,
"It can be done at the same time," said Rolufs, who led the bureau from 1995 to 1997. "You want to work them together."
The process of developing U.S. currency is painstaking, done by engravers who spend a decade training as apprentices. People familiar with the process say that engravers spend months working literally upside down and backward carving the portraits of historical figures into the steel plates that eventually help create cash. Often, multiple engravers will attempt different versions of the portraits, usually based on paintings or photographs, and ultimately, the Treasury secretary chooses which one will appear on a note.
Rolufs said that because of the complexity of creating new currency, circulating a new note design by next year was ambitious. He also acknowledged that making major changes to the money is an invitation for backlash.
"For the secretary to change the design of the notes takes political courage," he said. "The American people don't like their currency messed with."
As a presidential candidate, Trump called the decision to replace Jackson, who was a slave owner, with Tubman "pure political correctness." An overhaul of the Treasury Department's website after Trump took office removed any trace of the Obama administration's plans to change the currency, signaling that the plan might be halted.
Within Trump's Treasury Department, some officials complained that Lew had politicized the currency with the plan and that the process of selecting Tubman, which included an online poll among other forms of feedback, was not rigorous or reflective of the country's desires.
The uncertainty has renewed interest in the matter. This week, Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, where Tubman was born, wrote a letter to Mnuchin urging him to find a way to speed up the process.
"I hope that you'll reconsider your decision and instead join our efforts to promptly memorialize Tubman's life and many achievements," wrote Hogan, a Republican.
Last week, a group of House Democrats demanded that the Treasury secretary provide specific information about the security concerns that were impeding the currency redesign. - (The New York Times)

Texto completo: At the start of Elizabeth Gilbert's much-anticipated new novel, "City of Girls," the year is 1940, and Vivian Morris is a Vassar dropout shipped off by her well-to-do family to live with her offbeat Aunt Peg in Manhattan. Vivian is a pretty 19-year-old with no discernible ambition but an eye for all that's beautiful, sensuous and frivolous - "a girl so freshly hatched there was practically yolk in my hair" - and her arrival in the big city practically shocks her into consciousness, propelling her into a life worth telling about.
Her Aunt Peg owns the Lily Playhouse Theatre, a "grandiose" yet "crumbling" old palace that puts on schlock for its working-class neighborhood audience. Still, this world dazzles Vivian. The Lily attracts a wondrous hodgepodge of misfits: a tough stunner of a showgirl named Celia; a cantankerous and gloomy playwright; and a friend of Peg's, Edna Parker Watson, an esteemed stage actress with impeccable style, who finds refuge at the Lily with her handsome lout of a husband after their London home is destroyed in the Blitz.
Living in an apartment above the theater, Vivian embarks on a series of wanton adventures glued to the side of fast-living Celia, soaking up gin and male attention in one swank nightclub after another.
Months after Vivian's arrival, the Lily puts on a play that's worthy of Edna Parker Watson's star power. That play - "City of Girls" - turns the shambling theater into a destination for New York's elite. Gilbert unfurls the premiere of the play in rapturous, breathless chapters that, in a tour de force of literary mimicry, are punctuated with reviews by Brooks Atkinson from The New York Times and Walter Winchell for the old New York Daily Mirror.
The good days last just a little bit longer. When reflecting upon her adventures in show business and sex, Vivian is so prone to hyperbole she can appear to be hooked on hallucinogens; to her, everything in her new life is cranked up to impossible extremes. New York City, for example, is a synapse-frying wonderland orgy of booze and handsome men.
This isn't a criticism - a first move to the big city is an extreme experience for a young person, especially a beautiful, moneyed 19-year-old starting out in pre-WWII Manhattan. But just as the endless nights of waking up hung over in makeup-streaked sheets start to become monotonous - to Vivian and to the reader - the fantasy comes to an abrupt end, when Vivian is mixed up in a ruinous scandal splashed all over the gossip rags.
The city spits her out - temporarily, at least - thus setting off a surprising, more sober second half to her story, as World War II transforms the city and the world. It's no spoiler to say this isn't a novel about an indecorous woman's descent into disgrace - Vivian harbors no shame in her checkered past; it's her taste for sex and adventure, independence and rebellion, that makes her life worth following over seven decades.
For fans of Gilbert's best-known work, "Eat, Pray, Love," there are no concrete similarities with that juggernaut memoir. Yet "City of Girls" embraces some of the same themes: the power of a woman breaking from a traditional path, and the wisdom of taking true joy in the pleasures that life offers up. The only other similarity? "City of Girls" is an unbeatable beach read, loaded with humor and insight.

Lakers agree to acquire Anthony Davis in blockbuster trade

Texto completo: After seemingly endless drama, wary negotiations and a season that ended in turmoil, the Lakers have pulled off the mega-deal that’s been talked about for months.
Though later than they might have liked, the A.D. Era has begun in Los Angeles.
The New Orleans Pelicans have agreed to ship off star forward Anthony Davis, a six-time All-Star, to the Lakers for a hefty price: Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart and three first-round draft picks, including the No. 4 overall pick in Thursday’s NBA Draft. A source close to the team confirmed the deal, first reported by ESPN, to the Southern California News Group. The trade cannot be officially completed until July, when teams can begin operating under next season’s salary cap.
While the risk is considerable – the Lakers are betting Davis will choose to stay in Los Angeles when his contract expires in 2020 – the reward might just be worth it. In what NBA observers have dubbed as perhaps the most significant trade for a star in his prime since the Lakers acquired Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 45 years ago, getting Davis for the next year alongside LeBron James forms the foundation of what the Lakers hope is a team that can return to championship-level contention after six consecutive seasons out of the playoffs.
The trade has been discussed since January, when Davis publicly announced his desire to be traded from the only pro franchise he’s ever known. While talks fell flat at the February trade deadline, they reheated in the past few weeks as new power brokers took over for the respective teams.
It’s one of the biggest trades the Lakers have ever made and one that is certain to define the controversial tenure of General Manager Rob Pelinka, who took over basketball operations in April after team president Magic Johnson resigned. It fulfills the organization’s vision of pairing two All-NBA superstars on the same roster – a vision it has touted since Pelinka entered the team’s front office in 2017.
It’s also a bold start to new Pelicans executive David Griffin’s tenure: The unabashed flirtations between Davis and the Lakers touched a nerve for many New Orleans fans, which isn’t likely to quickly heal despite the package the team received back. The Pelicans now hold the No. 1 and No. 4 picks in the upcoming draft, though ESPN reported Griffin was already seeking a trade for the Lakers’ pick.
Since being drafted first overall in 2012, Davis has largely lived up to the expectations that have rested upon his 6-foot-10 frame. He’s become one of the league’s surest double-double men and a scorer from all levels (25.9 ppg, 10.5 rpg, 2.4 bpg) and his defensive prowess has helped make him a six-time All-Star and the third-place candidate for league MVP last season.
There’s one area in which he’s been short: winning. Davis has made the postseason just twice in seven seasons in New Orleans, and he won his first playoff series, a sweep of the Portland Trail Blazers in 2018.
The Lakers are coming off a disappointing season themselves, winning just 37 games and failing to make the playoffs. For James, it was the first time since 2005 he missed the postseason, fueling criticism of the Lakers’ roster construction last summer and adding sting to the bevy of injuries the team suffered.
The connection between James, 34, and Davis has been hotly discussed since September when Davis hired Rich Paul, James’ agent and close friend. James added juice to the subplot when he told ESPN in November it would be “amazing” and “incredible” if he could play with Davis. James raised eyebrows and fanned flames when he selected Davis to his All-Star squad on Feb. 7, the day of the trade deadline when talks had fizzled.
The cost of Davis and trying to win next season was trading in the future: Between Ingram, Ball and the No. 4 pick this year, the Lakers surrendered three former or future lottery picks. Ingram and Ball were once considered the nucleus of the Lakers’ future, and team’s previous attempts to pry them away in trade talks (most notably Kawhi Leonard) had fallen flat. Both ended this season with injuries but showed improvement – particularly Ingram, who played his best stretch of basketball after the All-Star break before being sidelined by a blood clot that required surgery. In two seasons with the Lakers, Josh Hart had also cultivated esteem as a rotation player in the lineup, despite struggling with a knee injury for much of this past year.
The one member of the team’s so-called “young core” the Lakers retained was Kyle Kuzma, who became a starter in his second season (18.7 ppg, 5.5 rpg) and vastly outplayed his end-of-the-first-round draft slot when he entered the league in 2017. Kuzma also has the most salary-cap friendly contract of the four players, due to make just under $2 million next season.
The Lakers’ most visible competition for Davis was the Boston Celtics. ESPN reported that the Lakers’ longtime East Coast rivals essentially withdrew themselves from the running once it was clear they didn’t want to include forward Jayson Tatum in a deal.
The cutthroat Western Conference could be in for a dramatic shakeup this offseason: Golden State, the class of the West for five seasons running, suffered significant injuries to stars Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson during its six-game loss to Toronto in the Finals. With lengthy recovery timelines and Durant’s pending free agency, the Warriors’ dynasty might be as vulnerable as ever, and a star-laden Lakers team could be well-poised to leap into contention with a strong offseason haul once free agency starts June 30.
For the Lakers, the deal could not come at a better time: The franchise has been roiled in drama since the season ended April 9, headlined by Johnson’s dramatic resignation. A tortured coaching search, in which the team eventually selected Frank Vogel, and Johnson’s public accusations of Pelinka’s “backstabbing” have hurt the perception of the Lakers’ stability, which Pelinka and Vogel have vigorously defended.
The Lakers still have ample room this summer to chase free agents to fill out their roster, but the sequence of the trade will affect how much space under the salary cap they’ll have. Davis has a $4 million trade kicker that he can choose to waive. The timing of the deal is also essential: If the Lakers can convince the Pelicans to wait until July 30 to complete the trade, the No. 4 pick will count as salary in the deal, and the Lakers could clear as much as $32.4 million under their salary cap – just enough to sign a third max free agent.
The New York Times reported the Lakers were expected to target All-Star guard Kemba Walker in free agency should they clear a max slot. The Lakers themselves have also emphasized that they will be looking for shooting during free agency.

Texto completo: Jill and Chris Bacus, the husband and wife team behind Ciao Wood Fired Pizza & Trattoria in Cape Coral, opened their restaurant in 2011 when the downturn in the U.S. economy was slamming Southwest Florida.
Jill had a background in physical therapy and was caring for both her kids and her mother, who'd suffered a stroke. Chris worked in the corporate division of a large construction company.
"The construction industry tanked," Jill said, "and after 25 years, they sent him home."
The couple needed a new plan, and quickly. Though Chris figured he'd eventually be able to find another job in the construction industry, they realized that housing in Southwest Florida would take a long time to recover.
In the mean time, they asked themselves: What could they do?
"The only thing people were doing in this area during the recession was eating and drinking," Jill said.
"God's honest truth."
Though the pair didn't have a background in restaurants, they were used to hosting big dinner parties at their home.
"We would cook all Italian cuisine," Jill said, "and our friends and family would always say, 'Oh my. This is good. You guys need to open a restaurant.' That was a push in the direction of what our future was going to hold."
The couple took stock of their skill sets. Jill, who is originally from Wisconsin, grew up in an Italian household. Her grandparents emigrated to the U.S. from Calabria in southern Italy, and her family's recipes would form the basis for her cooking at Ciao. Chris was from New Jersey, and though his heritage was German and Lithuanian, he'd grown up in pizza parlors and knew the secrets to making a good pie.
"My mom was a beautiful cook and a beautiful baker," Jill said, "and we just kind of pooled her recipes and decided to go for it on a wing and a prayer.
"It was our first restaurant ever."
She still remembers telling her mother about their plan.
"Oh Jill," her mother said. "That's going to be one of the hardest jobs ever."
Jill thought, "What? Making sauce and meatballs?"
Now, she admits her mother was right.
One of the reasons it's such a hard job? The Bacuses make everything at Ciao from scratch — 14 unique desserts, hand-tossed pizzas, pasta dishes, meat and seafood entrees.
"You have other restaurants who call Sysco and order all their products from them," Jill said. "Those places are food-preparers. We're food-creators. When we do eggplant, it's a three-hour process. When we make our lasagna, it's two and a half hours. It's very labor intensive."
And everything goes into the restaurant's 900-degree oak-fired oven.
Some of Ciao's most popular dishes includes its osso bucco, the classic Margherita pizza made with house-crafted mozzarella, wood-fired duck served with berry sauce, the seven-layer lasagna and, of course, Jill's scratch-made desserts — her ricotta cheesecake, creme brulee, chocolate mousse and various pastries such as her limoncello torte, a recent special.
The Bacuses recognize that Ciao has done exceptionally well in its eight years. Of the 14 restaurants that opened up in the downtown Cape Coral area at the same time, Jill says, Ciao is one of the only ones still in business.
"On my end of it, I grew up with my siblings and it was a very close family," she said. "When anyone came to our home, we welcomed them as family.
"So, we have that corporate end from my husband and we have that family end from me, which created a great business profile for us."

America squandering its power through foreign policy abuses

Texto completo: Last week we watched an unusual spectacle. The foreign minister of Germany, one of the United States’ closest allies, went to Tehran and announced that a European payment system, designed as an alternative to the dollar-based one, would soon be ready. This visit was made in coordination with Britain and France, both of which helped create the new payment mechanism, called INSTEX.
INSTEX will probably fail or prove to be wholly inadequate in the short term. The dollar’s dominance in global transactions — which has been a huge benefit for America — will be hard to displace, but INSTEX is a warning sign, the canary in the coal mine. America’s closest allies are working hard to chip away at a crucial underpinning of U.S. global power.
Why? It’s simple: the Trump administration’s abuse of this power. The United States sits atop the world for now, but there are forces eroding that lofty status. Some of these are deep structural shifts, like the rise of China. But as The Economist points out, others are reactions to a pattern of hegemonic abuse.
Consider the trigger for this search for an alternative to the dollar. Britain, France and Germany are all signatories to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. When the Trump administration unilaterally reneged on the pact last year — even though Iran had abided by it — the U.S. reimposed sanctions, using its dollar power to prevent other countries from doing business with Iran (since most international transactions use the dollar for convenience). Furious at this misuse of authority, the Europeans have set about trying to create a new payment system.
They are not the only ones. The Chinese, Russian and Indians have also been trying to create mechanisms that would allow them to escape the hegemony of the dollar. So far, these efforts have been largely ineffective. But if so many major trading nations, including key European ones, set out to subvert the dollar, they will eventually have some impact. Once upon a time, the British pound was the dominant international currency, but it was supplanted by the dollar. There is no iron law that says the dollar will be king forever.
Or look at the way the Trump administration has been wielding the threat of tariffs. In many cases, the administration has invoked a "national security" concerns. The law that allows the president to levy such tariffs was passed during the Cold War to enable the country to preserve critical industries that might be needed to sustain the geopolitical contest with the Soviet Union. Canadian aluminum and Japanese-made SUVs don’t fit the bill, even if Trump thinks otherwise. As Jennifer Hillman, the former general counsel to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, wrote recently in The New York Times: "If the United States can justify tariffs on cars as a threat to national security, then every country in the world can most likely justify restrictions on almost any product under a similar claim."
The United States has legitimate complaints about China’s trade practices. Beijing will often follow the letter of the law but find clever ways to undermine its spirit through loopholes and exceptions. But that is precisely what the Trump administration is itself doing. By misusing the national security exemption, it is weakening the very trade rules and international laws that it is asking China to follow. If I were a Chinese negotiator, I would simply explain that I would follow trade rules just as much as Donald Trump does.
Or consider Trump’s efforts to crush Chinese tech behemoth Huawei. So far, very few countries have followed America’s ban, but almost all are surely noting that if they remain reliant on crucial American technologies, Washington could suddenly cripple them on a whim. The result will be a greater desire for technological self-reliance and a shift away from American companies.
America still occupies a unique position in the world. But it is clear that we are moving into an era in which more players will have more power. Twenty years ago, China accounted for 3% of global GDP; today its share is 15% and rising. In such a period, it is all the more important that Washington act with restraint, use international institutions and try to establish consensus.
The administration is acting to achieve some short-term gains in limited transactions with other countries. But by abusing its power to do so, it is putting at risk the structure of the international system in which American power is so deeply embedded. It is a bad trade and one for which all Americans will pay the price in decades to come.

Giuliani claims media 'covered up' Chinese deal by Biden's son

Texto completo: President Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani tweeted Sunday that the news media had "covered up" the fact that Hunter Biden, son of Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden, had financial dealings with the Chinese government.
Arguing that his son's dealings influenced Biden's views on China, Giuliani wrote, "A Fox poll shows that Dems view ethics as critical and prefer Biden. That’s because warped media has covered up how he brought his son to China, and while he was caving in to China, his son got $1.5 billion investment from China. Corrupt media can’t hide it forever."
Tweet
Giuliani was referring to claims first reported by the Wall Street Journal in 2014 that Rosemont Seneca, a Washington, D.C.-based investment and advisory company run by Hunter Biden, entered into a deal with Chinese asset managers Bohai Industrial Investment Fund Management Co. The deal eventually raised $1.5 billion in a deal negotiated with the state-owned Bank of China, one of Bohai's largest stakeholders. The elder Biden was vice president at the time and engaged in high-level diplomacy with Beijing.
Biden has long been supportive of relatively friendly policies with China, such as giving it permanent normal trade relations. Last month, Biden dismissed concerns that China was an economic threat to the United States, stating at an Iowa campaign stop, "China is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man. ... They're not bad folks, folks. But guess what? They're not competition for us."
Despite Giuliani's claims, Hunter Biden's economic ties to China have been widely reported. In addition to the Wall Street Journal, they have appeared in such outlets as the Washington Post, New York Times, and Vanity Fair, though often in the context of claims made by Trump allies.

'A mental health crisis': 3 NYPD officers die by suicide in 10 days

Resumen: In 10 days, the New York City Police Department has lost a veteran deputy chief, detective and a third police officer Friday – all from suicides.

Texto completo: At 3:50 p. m. Friday afternoon, a 29-year-old New York City police officer shot and killed himself outside the Staten Island Police precinct where he worked.
It marked the latest in a troubling trend: three suicides of New York Police Department officers in 10 days – and the fourth this year.
The deaths in New York are part of a national problem. Last year, for the third straight year, cops who died by suicide outnumbered line-of-duty deaths.
New York's string of tragedies prompted NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill to deliver a call for action and to encourage fellow cops to not be afraid to seek help if they need it.
"This is a mental-health crisis," O'Neill tweeted Friday night. "And we – the NYPD and the law enforcement profession as a whole – absolutely must take action. This cannot be allowed to continue. Cops spend so much of their days assisting others. There is no shame in seeking assistance from the many resources available, both inside and outside the department.
"Accepting help is never a sign of weakness," he added. "In fact, it's a sign of great strength. "
The NYPD has not released the name of the latest police officer who died from suicide.
A funeral was held Monday for Steven Silks, a 62-year-old deputy police chief who shot and killed himself in a car on June 5. The New York Times reported that Silks, a 38-year veteran of the department, parked his car on a quiet street just hours after his mandatory retirement was announced. He shot himself near where his retirement ceremony would have taken place.
His death rattled many in the department.
"Steve truly was one of the most capable and most dependable cops this job has ever seen," O'Neill said. "His entire career, much of his adult life in fact, was devoted to New York City, to its police officers and to fighting crime and to protect all the people that we serve. "
The day after Silks's death, June 6, Detective Joseph Calabrese, 58, a member of the force for 37 years, went missing. His car was found off Belt Parkway in Brooklyn, The New York Times reported. After a widespread search, he was found dead in nearby bushes at Plumb Beach with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.
"Det. Joseph Calabrese kept New Yorkers safe for nearly four decades," Police Chief Terance Monahan tweeted after his burial Wednesday. "Loved by his fellow cops, the loss of Joe is difficult for every member of the NYPD. As he’s laid to rest, our prayers are with his family. Joe’s death has ignited a conversation we must all continue. #StopSuicide"
In 2018, 159 police officers in the USA died from suicide, according to the Massachusetts-based nonprofit BlueH. E. L. P. , which tracks officer suicides while also seeking to prevent such tragedies from occurring.
That's 9% more than the 144 line-of-duty deaths in 2018. The latter includes include causes such as felonious assaults, patrol vehicle accidents, heart attacks and duty-related illness.
“As tragic as these duty deaths are, the single greatest cause of death for law enforcement officers each year is suicide,” Jeff McGill, co-founder of Blue H. E. L. P, said when the group released the 2018 figures.
The number of suicides last year matched the 159 who took their lives in 2017. In 2016, 140 police officers in the U. S. committed suicide.
Blue H. E. L. P. works to expand police officers’ access to mental health services.
Its organizers say that 151 of the suicides last year were male and eight were female. The average age was 41 years old, and the average length of service in the police force was 15 years.
But according to Steven Hough, co-founder of Blue H. E. L. P. , the number of police suicides is likely greater.
“The problem is we know there are other tragic deaths by suicide that we don’t know about,” Hough was quoted saying this year. “So as bad a number as we have this year, we’re saddened by the fact that we know in reality the number is higher. ”

Texto completo: Do you wish you were an Iowa voter? Imagine how exciting life would be right now. Each morning when you left the house, you'd have no idea how many Democratic candidates for president would try to shake your hand before sunset.
Everybody wants to woo Iowans because they vote first. On Tuesday Joe Biden was in Ottumwa, calling Donald Trump "an existential threat to America." Existential means, well, about existence. Lately people have tended to use it a lot when they mean really, really serious. In 2020 there'll probably be TV ads: "Vote Tuesday. This time it's existential."
Trump himself was in Council Bluffs, trying to make sure nobody could forget about his existence for a single second, bragging about his devotion to farmers and calling Biden "Sleepy Joe." Nicknames have worked very well for Trump, but this one has some perils. Americans may start asking themselves whether they'd rather have a president who sleeps through the night or one who's up at 5 a.m. sending out tweets with a lot of misspelled words.
Biden, meanwhile, was assuring his crowd that Iowa was the existential state: "If you can't cross the line in Iowa, you don't win the marathon." He even apologized for having missed an Iowa Democratic dinner so he could attend his granddaughter's graduation.
It's OK, Joe. Really.
Last weekend, by my count, there were 40 different Democratic events in Iowa, from modest back-porch meet-and-greets to that political dinner, which attracted 19 presidential hopefuls.
Are you jealous, people? Perhaps your idea of fun does not include listening to 19 five-minute speeches after dessert. Or coming out of the grocery store and being forced to interact with Bill de Blasio. But you'd have to love the power. There was a huge buzz last week when a poll by Iowa's leading newspaper found Democratic voters seemed to be cooling on Biden, who was down to 24% while Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg were moving up.
The race at the bottom was so intense that Amy Klobuchar was able to happily announce her 2% showing was better than 16 of her competitors. The poll involved 600 active Democrats. Her 2% boils down to about 12 people. See what I mean?
There's already speculation about how many of the candidates will manage to visit all 99 Iowa counties as a show of devotion. Former Rep. John Delaney had already hit the mark in 2018. Given that he registered 1% in that Iowa poll, I'll hazard a guess that this is not a winning strategy. Nor is unknown-candidate Marianne Williamson's tactic of simply moving in. She's a spiritual adviser to Oprah Winfrey and new resident of a Des Moines condo. Chris Dodd tried the same thing in 2007. He even took his daughter out of kindergarten to enroll her in a Hawkeye State school. He still came in seventh, and he was a U.S. senator.
Most of us never get to know what this kind of voter clout feels like. Back in 1992 - the last year that the Iowa winner didn't grab the Democratic nomination - competition ran on for so long that New York's primary actually made a difference. I cannot tell you how exciting it was hearing presidential candidates vying to sound the most passionate about mass transportation.
Pandering is so cool when you're the one being pandered to.
In Iowa, ethanol is the primo pander topic. You probably know that the government allows gasoline to be mixed with some kind of biofuel like corn. That can cut down on prices, but it can have a significant downside when it comes to the environment, particularly air pollution in the summer.
Still, it does sell a lot of corn, and Trump was in Iowa to brag that he'd opened the door to still more ethanol at the pump.
Very hard to find many anti-ethanol politicians. Bernie Sanders discovered in the last primary season that a program he once disliked is actually "an economic lifeline to rural and farm communities." His Democratic opponents tend to keep their heads down, nodding and mumbling something about electric cars.
Corn obsessions aside, the people of Iowa are extremely conscientious about their being-first responsibilities. But don't you think other states should get a chance?
What about Nebraska? It's like Iowa in many ways, but at least there'd be a change of scene. Right now all the candidates are prepping to go to the Iowa State Fair, where they will marvel at exhibits - who can ever forget the Last Supper carved out of butter? But if the first vote shifted to Nebraska, we'd get to watch the pols trying to look excited at a festival called Kool-Aid Days, celebrating the invention of Kool-Aid, which happens to be the official state soft drink.
We would learn way more interesting facts like this if Nebraska got a turn.
Or Rhode Island. It'd be very easy for candidates to meet the voters in Rhode Island, since most of them are kind of squished together. And instead of ethanol, the contenders would have to pander to a product Rhode Islanders make. Such as - silverware! If Rhode Island was the first state to vote, I bet in no time at all we'd have a law abolishing plastic forks.

The Los Angeles Lakers' storied penchant for acquiring elite big men when they need them most resurfaced Saturday when the glamorous but struggling franchise reached agreement on a trade to acquire Anthony Davis from the New Orleans Pelicans -- thus pairing Davis, a six-time All Star, with LeBron James.
To make Davis their latest front-line centerpiece, the Lakers are sending a vast haul to New Orleans, featuring the prized guards Lonzo Ball and Josh Hart; forward Brandon Ingram; and three first-round draft picks, including the No. 4 selection in Thursday's N.B.A. draft.
Yet the Lakers, after a humbling six consecutive seasons out of the playoffs, thought they had to surrender all those assets for the opportunity to unite James and Davis. Los Angeles must now hope that the two, under the new coach Frank Vogel, can mesh in a manner reminiscent of famed Lakers partnerships such as Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Kobe Bryant alongside Shaquille O'Neal.
The trade, which cannot be completed before July 6 when the new salary-cap year begins in the N.B.A., was confirmed by two people with knowledge of the deal who were not authorized to discuss it publicly. ESPN first reported the teams' agreement, which sets up Davis as the latest in a lineage of decorated Lakers power players that began with George Mikan in Minneapolis in the 1950s and has also featured Wilt Chamberlain, Pau Gasol and Dwight Howard in addition to Abdul-Jabbar and O'Neal.
The Lakers no doubt felt a great deal of urgency to trade for Davis after a hugely disappointing season, James's first with the team and his first since 2005 without a trip to the playoffs. Los Angeles finished well out of contention with a 37-45 record after James missed a significant part of the second half of the season with a groin injury. The Lakers have also been engulfed in management chaos since Johnson abruptly stepped down as team president on April 9.
Johnson has been highly critical of the organization since his departure, but he congratulated Jeanie Buss, the embattled Lakers owner, and General Manager Rob Pelinka in a series of posts on Twitter on Saturday.
"Laker Nation, you wanted the great Jeanie Buss to step up and bring a championship team back to L.A. and she's doing just that!" Johnson posted.
As for Pelinka, whose trustworthiness Johnson has questioned in multiple recent interviews, Johnson tweeted: "Great trade Rob Pelinka! Job well done."
Amid the team's trying season, James was still very productive when healthy, averaging 27.4 points, 8.3 assists and 8.5 rebounds in 55 games. But he is now preparing for his 17th season at age 34, and he has three years left on his contract with the Lakers, who want to maximize the time that he has left as one of the league's best players.
With that in mind, the Lakers plan to make a strong push to sign Charlotte's Kemba Walker when free agency begins on June 30, according to two people familiar with their plans who were not authorized to discuss them publicly.
The Lakers are expecting to have $ 28 million to $ 33 million in salary-cap space to pursue Walker to fill the void in their backcourt created by the departures of Ball and Hart. Walker, a three-time All-Star, has said he will give the Hornets first crack to re-sign him but is also expected to be pursued aggressively by the Dallas Mavericks as well as the Lakers.
James, a four-time N.B.A. most valuable player, still wants to vie for championships, and the race in the Western Conference next season may be fairly wide open as the Golden State Warriors -- after three championships in the past five seasons -- face unexpected uncertainty; Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant, two members of their All-Star core, sustained devastating injuries in the N.B.A. finals.
Both players are bound for free agency, and while Thompson, who tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee, is likely to re-sign with the Warriors, Durant will still have several suitors despite tearing his Achilles' tendon in the finals. The Kawhi Leonard-led Toronto Raptors clinched that series on Thursday to prevent the Warriors from winning a third straight title.
Even as the finals were underway, the Lakers remained in the headlines, as they had all season. After hiring James's agent, Rich Paul, shortly before the start of last season, Davis informed the Pelicans in late January that he wanted to be dealt ahead of the league's February trade deadline and listed the Lakers as one of his preferred destinations. But the Pelicans, with Dell Demps heading their front office, rebuffed several overtures from the Lakers, choosing instead to keep Davis and weigh their options after the season.
Now the Lakers are surrendering numerous assets to get Davis in negotiations with David Griffin, who replaced Demps in May, but Los Angeles did manage to keep forward Kyle Kuzma out of the trade. The New York Times first reported last week that the Lakers were adamant about keeping Kuzma out of the deal.
Davis, the top overall pick in the 2012 draft, averaged 25.9 points and 12 rebounds with the Pelicans last season but was limited to 56 games because of injury. Although Davis, 26, can become a free agent in 2020, Paul has said repeatedly since February that the Lakers and Knicks are the only two teams Davis is interested in signing with long-term.
Those proclamations ultimately gave the Boston Celtics pause in their own trade talks with the Pelicans this week, clearing the way for the Lakers to finally complete the trade they have been chasing for five months. The Times first reported Saturday that the Celtics were unwilling to surrender their top young player, Jayson Tatum, in a Davis deal, fearing that Davis could walk away as a free agent in July 2020 with no compensation for the team.
The trade comes at a critical juncture for the Pelicans. Griffin had been on the job for about a month when the team had the good fortune of winning the No. 1 pick in the draft lottery, a pick it will almost assuredly use on Duke's Zion Williamson, a phenomenal talent.
Williamson would immediately be surrounded by talent in New Orleans, with the Lakers sending three promising players, and three first-round picks, to the Pelicans in return for Davis.
Ball, 21, was the No. 2 pick in the 2017 draft but had two injury-marred seasons with the Lakers. Last season, he averaged 9.9 points and 5.4 assists in 47 games. Ingram, 21, has revealed glimpses of brilliance as a lanky scorer, averaging 18.3 points while shooting 49.7 percent from the field before a blood clot in his right shoulder ended his season in March. Hart averaged 7.8 points last season.

Texto completo: This simple wisdom — “Fans don’t boo nobodies” — is courtesy the pinstriped philosopher Reggie Jackson, and it resonates for anyone who has ever been in the public sphere.
Put yourself out there and the cranks crank it up. In the end, they’re still cranks.
When you are being noticed, it’s because you have become a cause for concern, for somebody.
So that’s how I realized early this month that the formerly minor character known as Mayor Pete has become a serious cause for concern for the Republican National Committee as it continues its unethical quest to re-elect the president.
How did I realize this? Because the RNC told me so.
On June 3, its Christiana Purves sent me an email: “Good evening — With less than a month to go before the first 2020 Democrat Presidential debate, we’re still only scratching the surface of truly learning about lesser-vetted candidates like Pete Buttigieg. Unfortunately for Mayor Pete, the more we learn, Californians are more likely to see that he was a lousy Mayor who’s struggling to keep up with the pace of presidential politics.”
Then Purves goes on to cite an odd selection of stories from what the Grand Old Party on a normal day, when it didn’t suit its needs, would term the lamestream media.
“‘I ain’t ever seen the dude’ — Residents of South Bend’s poor neighborhoods say Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg left them behind,” the RNC quotes CNBC as saying. Oh, how the GOP is in touch with America’s troubled urban youth. And then: “Buttigieg is only top 2020 presidential candidate not offering staffers health care yet.” Ha ha ha. The former deputy press secretary for Trump buddy Sen. Lindsey Graham concerned a Democratic longshot is not yet being able to afford benefits for his ragtag staff? Ha ha ha.
But with the RNC concerned enough about the guy to start doing a lot of opposition research and sending it out to members of the press, maybe he’s not such a longshot, what?
I have by no means figured out who stands the best chance of preventing the global disaster that would be a second term for this president. No one has stood out in particular from the clearly too many candidates clogging the opposition field. Too bad a gutsy moderate Republican won’t come forward to take advantage of the ridiculously tainted incumbent.
The latest poll of California Democratic voters goes: Biden 22, Sanders 17, Harris 13, Warren 18, Buttigieg 10, O’Rourke 3.
So, only 10 percent of California’s Democratic voters right now say Buttigieg is their main man. Or, to look at it another way, a guy who otherwise just leads the fourth-largest city in Indiana is in fifth place among voters in the nation’s largest state. And this sudden GOP attention would lead us to believe that’s fifth place with a bullet. Harvard and Oxford graduate, former Navy Reserve lieutenant who served in Afghanistan — nice resume. Oh, and he’s gay. And he’s getting noticed — pollsters say awareness of Buttigieg shot up from 4% to 48% in the last six months.
Still actually a stretch, though. The problematical guy who is for some reason not a longshot, Joe Biden, is the frontrunner who is really giving the incumbent conniption fits. The president’s own campaign pollster came to him with numbers from a 17-state survey showing Trump losing to Biden in states that he needs to win, including Texas (sweet!), Michigan and Pennsylvania. After seeing the polls, the president told aides to deny them, Annie Karmin reports in The New York Times.
Biden is “Sleepy Joe” to Trump.
What’s he gonna call Buttigieg when the going gets rough on down the road?

Texto completo: After seemingly endless drama, wary negotiations and a season that ended in turmoil, the Lakers have pulled off the mega-deal that’s been talked about for months.
Though later than they might have liked, the A.D. Era has begun in Los Angeles.
The New Orleans Pelicans have agreed to ship off star forward Anthony Davis, a six-time All-Star, to the Lakers for a hefty price: Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart and three first-round draft picks, including the No. 4 overall pick in Thursday’s NBA Draft. A source close to the team confirmed the deal, first reported by ESPN, to the Southern California News Group. The trade cannot be officially completed until July, when teams can begin operating under next season’s salary cap.
While the risk is considerable – the Lakers are betting Davis will choose to stay in Los Angeles when his contract expires in 2020 – the reward might just be worth it. In what NBA observers have dubbed as perhaps the most significant trade for a star in his prime since the Lakers acquired Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 45 years ago, getting Davis for the next year alongside LeBron James forms the foundation of what the Lakers hope is a team that can return to championship-level contention after six consecutive seasons out of the playoffs.
The trade has been discussed since January, when Davis publicly announced his desire to be traded from the only pro franchise he’s ever known. While talks fell flat at the February trade deadline, they reheated in the past few weeks as new power brokers took over for the respective teams.
It’s one of the biggest trades the Lakers have ever made and one that is certain to define the controversial tenure of General Manager Rob Pelinka, who took over basketball operations in April after team president Magic Johnson resigned. It fulfills the organization’s vision of pairing two All-NBA superstars on the same roster – a vision it has touted since Pelinka entered the team’s front office in 2017.
It’s also a bold start to new Pelicans executive David Griffin’s tenure: The unabashed flirtations between Davis and the Lakers touched a nerve for many New Orleans fans, which isn’t likely to quickly heal despite the package the team received back. The Pelicans now hold the No. 1 and No. 4 picks in the upcoming draft, though ESPN reported Griffin was already seeking a trade for the Lakers’ pick.
Since being drafted first overall in 2012, Davis has largely lived up to the expectations that have rested upon his 6-foot-10 frame. He’s become one of the league’s surest double-double men and a scorer from all levels (25.9 ppg, 10.5 rpg, 2.4 bpg) and his defensive prowess has helped make him a six-time All-Star and the third-place candidate for league MVP last season.
There’s one area in which he’s been short: winning. Davis has made the postseason just twice in seven seasons in New Orleans, and he won his first playoff series, a sweep of the Portland Trail Blazers in 2018.
The Lakers are coming off a disappointing season themselves, winning just 37 games and failing to make the playoffs. For James, it was the first time since 2005 he missed the postseason, fueling criticism of the Lakers’ roster construction last summer and adding sting to the bevy of injuries the team suffered.
The connection between James, 34, and Davis has been hotly discussed since September when Davis hired Rich Paul, James’ agent and close friend. James added juice to the subplot when he told ESPN in November it would be “amazing” and “incredible” if he could play with Davis. James raised eyebrows and fanned flames when he selected Davis to his All-Star squad on Feb. 7, the day of the trade deadline when talks had fizzled.
The cost of Davis and trying to win next season was trading in the future: Between Ingram, Ball and the No. 4 pick this year, the Lakers surrendered three former or future lottery picks. Ingram and Ball were once considered the nucleus of the Lakers’ future, and team’s previous attempts to pry them away in trade talks (most notably Kawhi Leonard) had fallen flat. Both ended this season with injuries but showed improvement – particularly Ingram, who played his best stretch of basketball after the All-Star break before being sidelined by a blood clot that required surgery. In two seasons with the Lakers, Josh Hart had also cultivated esteem as a rotation player in the lineup, despite struggling with a knee injury for much of this past year.
The one member of the team’s so-called “young core” the Lakers retained was Kyle Kuzma, who became a starter in his second season (18.7 ppg, 5.5 rpg) and vastly outplayed his end-of-the-first-round draft slot when he entered the league in 2017. Kuzma also has the most salary-cap friendly contract of the four players, due to make just under $2 million next season.
The Lakers’ most visible competition for Davis was the Boston Celtics. ESPN reported that the Lakers’ longtime East Coast rivals essentially withdrew themselves from the running once it was clear they didn’t want to include forward Jayson Tatum in a deal.
The cutthroat Western Conference could be in for a dramatic shakeup this offseason: Golden State, the class of the West for five seasons running, suffered significant injuries to stars Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson during its six-game loss to Toronto in the Finals. With lengthy recovery timelines and Durant’s pending free agency, the Warriors’ dynasty might be as vulnerable as ever, and a star-laden Lakers team could be well-poised to leap into contention with a strong offseason haul once free agency starts June 30.
For the Lakers, the deal could not come at a better time: The franchise has been roiled in drama since the season ended April 9, headlined by Johnson’s dramatic resignation. A tortured coaching search, in which the team eventually selected Frank Vogel, and Johnson’s public accusations of Pelinka’s “backstabbing” have hurt the perception of the Lakers’ stability, which Pelinka and Vogel have vigorously defended.
The Lakers still have ample room this summer to chase free agents to fill out their roster, but the sequence of the trade will affect how much space under the salary cap they’ll have. Davis has a $4 million trade kicker that he can choose to waive. The timing of the deal is also essential: If the Lakers can convince the Pelicans to wait until July 30 to complete the trade, the No. 4 pick will count as salary in the deal, and the Lakers could clear as much as $32.4 million under their salary cap – just enough to sign a third max free agent.
The New York Times reported the Lakers were expected to target All-Star guard Kemba Walker in free agency should they clear a max slot. The Lakers themselves have also emphasized that they will be looking for shooting during free agency.

Texto completo: When it comes to books on parenting, the same is true.
For Father’s Day, we offer seven new books that are about fatherhood written by a dad, for a dad or in honor of a dad.
Guidebooks
“The Dad Lab: 50 Awesome Science Projects for Parents and Kids” by Sergei Urban ($18, TarcherPerigree)
Create great memories with the kids, have some fun and maybe learn something with these science experiments from Sergei Urban, who created the Dad Lab. Most of the things you’ll need for these projects are things you already have at home or can get very quickly with a trip to a grocery store.
Some of the projects feel more science-y, like Exploring Density in a Glass, which uses honey, oil and water and common objects to see how things float. Some feel more creative, like Painting
With Bubbles, which uses dish soap, food coloring and straws to create colorful bubbles.
“This Is the Book You Give Your Dad: Everything An Awesome Father Wants to Know” by Matt Goulet and Andrew Janik ($20, Simon & Schuster)
“This Is the Book You Give Your Dad” would actually be great for anyone. It offers an illustrated guide to many things such as tools and how to use them; the steps of building a fire and, more importantly, putting out a fire; making cocktails; the actors who played James Bond; how to play Texas Hold ‘Em and bar games; and some easy recipes to feed the kids.
It’s all things that you might know some of but not everything on the page. Who knew there were so many different patterns you could make while mowing the lawn, or that there’s an official way to carve a turkey?
Wisdom from Dad
“Stark Raving Dad: Poems for the Frazzled Parent in All of Us” by Sanderson Dean ($14, Running Press)
Ready to laugh? Parenting does have its unbelievably funny moments, and Sanderson Dean captures those in funny ways in poetry. His poems are inspired by his two sons, Jordan and Kylan.
Some favorites: “King for A Minute,” a three-verse poem about a moment of peace and quiet while sitting on the toilet, which, of course, gets interrupted by kids knocking on the door; “All the Riches in the World,” which puts to pen the common sentiment that you would give anything for more sleep; and “Clean Up Your Room,” which asks the immortal question: How many times does a parent have to tell you to clean up your room before you will do it?
“ The Life of Dad: Reflections on Fatherhood From Today’s Leaders, Icons, and Legendary Dads, by Jon Finkel and Art Eddy ($16.99, Adams Media)
The creators of “The Life of Dad” podcast put their work into book form with this collection of famous dads talking about fatherhood and offering their advice. The book is filled with messages from sports heroes, actors and comedians, musical stars and well-known entrepreneurs. Actor/rapper Ice Cube tells us, “Don’t leave it up to the mother to raise your kids. You need to be just as involved.”
Actor Henry Winkler shows his humanity and failings when he talks about the importance of chores: “Our children were great negotiators — I did their chores.”
Author Brad Meltzer offers this advice: “There is only one rule when it comes to being a parent as far as I am concerned. It is love your kids. You can screw up everything else.”
Finkel and Eddy weave this advice into their own learnings.
“My First Rodeo: How Three Daughters, One Wife, And a Herd of Others Are Making Me a Better Dad” by Stoney Stamper ($17.99, Waterbrook)
Stoney Stamper created the Daddy Diaries blog based on his experience raising one biological daughter and two stepdaughters.
He talks about his uneasiness settling into fatherhood. With one of his stepdaughters they created their own word to say “I love you” without using those words. He talks about the first time his wife leaves for a half-day spa day and the disaster that feels like it is — just 30 minutes into the adventure. In fact, the book is a collection of sweet remembrances of when things didn’t always go that smoothly.
Remembering Dad
“A ll That You Leave Behind” by Erin Lee Carr ($26, Ballantine Books)
Documentary filmmaker Erin Lee Carr, whose most recent work includes “A Heart of Gold” about the U.S. gymnastics scandal, takes a look at the relationship she had with her own father, David Carr, who was an author and columnist for The New York Times.
After her father collapsed in the newsroom in 2015 and died, Erin Lee Carr tries to make sense of her father’s legacy and the things she inherited from him. Sure, there’s the love of telling people’s stories, but there’s also something darker in their genes: addiction.
She uses her father’s emails and messages to try to make understand the things she learned from him. It’s part love letter to her father and therapy session expressing the frustration and disappointment at both her father’s failings and her own.
“ Folded Wisdom: Notes From Dad on Life, Love and Growing Up” by Joanna Guest ($20, Celadon Books)
Joanna Guest’s father, Robert, left her and her brother Theo an incredible legacy. Each day, beginning in 1995, when Joanna Guest was 7 and Theo Guest was 4, Robert Guest sat down to write a note to each of them with advice or thoughts for the occasion of that day. He then folded them up into triangles (like the kind you use for making a football to hike between finger goalposts).
The book is part reprinting of her father’s messages and part how-to for writing your own kids messages and what to say. The book offers a real-world example of the impact writing daily notes can have on a child.

Trump's Daughter and Son-in-Law, Both Aides, Report Up to $135 Million in 2018 Income

Texto completo: In their second year of government service, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner reported income from their companies and investments of as much as $ 135 million, according to their annual financial disclosure reports made public on Friday.
All told, the couple's real estate holdings and other investments were worth as much as $ 786 million, down slightly from 2017. Their total annual income was between $ 29 million and $ 135 million, a range that was lower than what they reported in 2017.
Mr. Kushner's partial ownership of his family-run real estate business, Kushner Companies, has drawn criticism from ethics experts, particularly as the firm has solicited investments from foreign sources, including in the Middle East, where Mr. Kushner is a top White House liaison.
Although Mr. Kushner held on to the bulk of his stake in the company, which he once ran, he sold some of his assets to a trust controlled by his mother.
One of those divested assets was his share in Kushner Companies' flagship property at 666 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. Last year, Kushner Companies struck a deal with Brookfield Asset Management for a roughly $ 1 billion bailout of the troubled property. Brookfield's property arm is partly owned by the Qatari government.
Ms. Trump reported 2018 income totaling between $ 6.7 million and $ 10.7 million. She has resigned from her leadership roles at her fashion business and her family's real estate and branding company since her father became president, but she retained stakes in some of those businesses.
Ms. Trump earned just under $ 4 million from the Trump International Hotel in Washington, which has become a magnet for visiting executives and foreign officials with interests before the federal government.
Ms. Trump reported another portion of an advance from Penguin Random House, for her book "Women Who Work," this time totaling $ 263,500. She also reported donating it to the Ivanka M. Trump Charitable Fund. In 2017, she received about $ 289,000 from that advance.
The couple's total income was between $ 29 million and $ 135 million in 2018, compared with a range of $ 82 million to $ 222 million in 2017.
The drop was due, in part, to their divestment of several assets that previously generated tens of millions of dollars in income for the couple, including the stake in 666 Fifth Avenue.
Last year, The New York Times reported that Mr. Kushner apparently had paid almost no federal income taxes for several years running.

With a sneer, she could gaslight up a briefing room

Texto completo: When Sarah Sanders said Thursday that she hopes to be remembered for her transparency and honesty, the first impulse was to laugh.
But lying to citizens while being paid by them really isn't all that funny.
Sanders took on an impossible job when she became President Trump's spokeswoman, a job that's about to reach a welcome conclusion.
She would claim to represent the truth on behalf of a president who lies.
She did it disrespectfully and apparently without shame or an understanding of what the role of White House press secretary should be.
She misled reporters or tried to, and through them, misled the American people. And all with her distinctive curled-lip disdain.
Thus, she delivered on what New York University professor Jay Rosen has called the "brand promise" of the Trump administration's treatment of the press: "Watch, we will put these people down for you."
Her quintessential moment came in the May 11, 2017, White House press briefing in which she was skeptically questioned by Michael Shear of the New York Times about her statements that she'd heard from "countless" FBI employees about how grateful they were that Trump had fired the agency's director, James B. Comey.
"Really?" asked Shear.
She replied without a shred of doubt, and as if Shear were the dumbest guy she'd ever seen.
"Between, like, email, text messages, absolutely. Yes," Sanders said. "We're not going to get into a numbers game. I mean, I have heard from a large number of individuals that work at the FBI that said that they're very happy with the president's decision."
Eventually, she was forced, under oath, to admit that this was made-up nonsense.
The report by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III: "Sanders told this Office that her reference to hearing from 'countless members of the FBI' was a 'slip of the tongue.' . . . She also recalled that her statement in a separate press interview that rank-and-file FBI agents had lost confidence in Comey was a comment she made 'in the heat of the moment' that was not founded on anything."
Utterly unfounded, but insisted on as if it were carved on tablets, and don't you dare doubt it. That is a pretty good description of gaslighting.
And gaslighting was a Sanders specialty, day in and day out. (After a while, of course, that became week in and week out, then month in and month out, and finally, not at all, as the once-daily briefings were phased out. The last one was more than 90 days ago.)
"Sanders failed at all aspects of the job," Joe Lockhart, press secretary for President Bill Clinton, told me Thursday.
Lockhart elaborated: "She didn't keep the public informed, including canceling the briefings, she was not honest, according to her own testimony to the special counsel, and she stood by and allowed the normalization of labeling the press the enemy of the people."
In August, CNN's Jim Acosta challenged Sanders publicly on Trump's disparagement of the press.
"It would be a good thing if you were to state right here, at this briefing, that the press - the people who are gathered in this room right now, doing their jobs every day . . . are not the enemy of the people," Acosta said. "I think we deserve that."
Sanders refused, deflecting to say that she had suffered media criticism, putting her in danger. At other times, she parroted the president with more destructive language: Some media people were not enemies of the people - only the "fake news" types. (In Trump World, fake news is almost always coverage that reflects poorly on the president.)
And always, with Sanders, the sneering denials of the obvious:
In late 2017, for instance, Trump called Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) "a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office 'begging' for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them)."
Asked in the briefing about what sounded, in that tweet, a lot like sexual innuendo, Sanders went straight to gaslighting, telling the reporter, "Your mind is in the gutter."
Undoubtedly, there were media people who enjoyed a friendly relationship with Sanders behind the scenes.
Some journalists defended her when she was mocked by comic Michelle Wolf at last year's White House Correspondents' Association dinner.
That's all part of access journalism, mixed with some garden-variety humanity, and it shouldn't matter a whit in any true evaluation of how she performed.
The role of press secretary is, at its core, a public-facing one.
On that stage - whether in the briefing room or in an informal driveway gaggle with reporters - Sanders was set up to fail by a president who doesn't value the truth or the press.
And oh, how she rose to that challenge.
Announcing her exit, Trump tweeted warm praise: "She is a very special person with extraordinary talents, who has done an incredible job."
Since incredible literally means "impossible to believe," he got that part exactly right.

Tax fights swirl around Statehouse

Texto completo: "Teaching is turning into a dead end profession."
Niki Slovinski Franklin Lakes teacher
The two New Jersey tax incentive programs at the heart of multiple investigations may be extended before their June 30 deadlines, as two Assembly committees voted Thursday to keep the programs alive until some point in 2020.
Meanwhile, thousands of union members and activists rallied outside the Statehouse in favor of a millionaire's tax and against Senate President Stephen Sweeney's proposed changes to public pensions and health care.
Two tax credits meant to spur development and create and keep jobs in the state, GrowNJ and the Economic Redevelopment & Growth (ERG) programs, are set to end at the end of the month, around the same time when the Legislature and governor must agree on a budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1.
The Assembly Commerce and Economic Development committee and the Appropriations committee considered a bill that would push the deadline from June 30, 2019 to Jan. 31, 2020, proposed by Budget Chair Eliana Pintor Marin, D-Essex. The commerce committee also discussed a bill to change GrowNJ requirements.
Only invited individuals from unions, trade associations and nonprofits were allowed to speak at the commerce hearing in order to make sure the bill can be handed off on time for the appropriations committee to consider. If members of the public want to weigh in, they have to submit comments in writing, said Kevin McArdle, spokesman for the Assembly Democrats.
Activists with the group Working Families, a group critical of the tax incentives, interrupted the start of the hearing by placing seven cardboard boxes on the witness desk to submit as public testimony in protest.
The boxes contained more than 50,000 pages of emails between a lawyers at Parker McCay and officials at the Economic Development Authority. The New York Times, ProPublica and WNYC reported that an attorney with Parker McCay named Kevin Sheehan suggested language into late drafts of the legislation that created the tax incentives and frequently communicated with members of the Economic Development Authority, which issues the credits, as the bill was being written.
"These emails are a representation of unregistered lobbying between a politically connected corporation and until every single one of these emails have been reviewed by this committee, this law should not be extended," said Sue Altman, head of Working Families. "It is unprecedented that today there is no public testimony."
The invited speakers included Brandon McKoy, the president of the left-leaning NJ Policy Perspective, Megan Chambers of the union SEIU 32BJ, and members of the business community, including Michael McGuinness and Anthony Pizzutillo of the real estate nonprofit NAIOP-NJ, Andrew Musick of the NJ Business & Industry Association, Michael Egenton of the NJ State Chamber of Commerce and Christina Renna of the Chamber of Commerce Southern New Jersey.
Gov. Phil Murphy has introduced his own set of five new incentives late last year that would cap awards for job creation and development, and said last week he would not "simply renew a set of incentive programs when serious questions exist about whether they have been successful."
"Extending bad legislation is not the way to attract business to our state. While the deadline is fast approaching, we believe there is still time to work with the Legislature to pass comprehensive tax incentive reform before the current programs expire," Murphy said in a statement.
Members of the New Jersey business community said it would be unwise to make hasty changes or let the programs timing run out.
"Recognizing that the current programs took approximately 18 months to effectuate, we cannot create a new, more effective, functioning program within the next two weeks," said Michael Egenton, executive vice president of the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce. "Nor can we allow for the current ones to expire. A state that lets its economic growth incentives lapse signals that it is 'out of business.'"
The commerce committee members unanimously voted the tax credit extension deadline out of committee, but many said they were doing so because they had no other option.
"Even though my name is on the extension bill, I'm disappointed that we're here," said Assemblyman Roy Freiman, D-Somerset, a sponsor of the bill. "We should have vetted through the governor's proposal. That said, [extending the programs] is the lesser of all evils."
The bill now heads to Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin to consider.
The Economic Development Authority tax break programs are the subject of multiple investigations, including by a state grand jury, both Assembly houses, and an independent task force hired by the governor. Murphy ordered the inquiry after a blistering comptroller's report suggested the agency didn't have processes in place to confirm companies were creating the jobs they promised in exchange for credits.
The task force raised questions about whether companies provided misleading information on applications to the state. Insurance broker George Norcross and companies connected to him that received tax breaks sued Murphy and the task force, claiming they had been falsely accused of misconduct and not given the opportunity to respond. In the midst of the suit, the task force postponed its final public meeting and the release of its findings.
Unions rally for millionaires tax As lawmakers moved forward legislation to keep the business tax incentives alive, union members rallied to pass a millionaire's tax in this year's budget, a policy Murphy is pushing but Legislative leaders refuse to include. The protest was organized by the largest public workers union in the state, the Communication Workers of America, which also criticizes Sweeney's "Path to Progress" plan, a set of 27 bills that would change public health benefits and pension plans.
In a sea of protesters, most wearing red, 4-year-old Eva Slovinski stood out. Donning a red tutu, she hefted a sign reading: "I'd rather be playing but mommy can't afford a babysitter."
Her mother, Niki Slovinski, has taught high school in Franklin Lakes for 17 years.
"When I started teaching we paid nothing into health benefits," Niki Slovinski said. Over time that's increased to more than $500 a paycheck, she said, a burden for her as the sole income-earner in her family.
"Teaching is turning into a dead end profession," she added. She worries pension reform proposed by Sweeney would dip further into her earnings.
"I worry about my pension," she said. "Since my pension is already underfunded, I worry by the time I retire maybe there won't be people paying into it so I can retire."
The Legislature is expected to send a budget bill to Murphy by June 20. It is unclear what Murphy will choose to do with it.
"Teaching is turning into a dead end profession."

Texto completo: KINGWOOD – A new report has named the couple allegedly behind the dog hoarding situation here.
According to a report in the New York Times, the 188 dogs rescued during an animal cruelty investigation were from Rocky Ridge Russells kennel, which is run by the couple and business partners Marcia Knoster and Martin Strozenski.
The 70-year-old Knoster, who lives off of County Route 519 near Stockton, bred a Parson Russell Terrier that went on to win best in breed at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, one of the most prestigious dog breed competitions in the world, according to the report.
The dog became No. 2 Parson Russell Terrier in the United States.
"It all just got out of hand," Strozenski told the Times. "This wasn't backyard breeding. Things just went sideways."
On Tuesday, St. Hubert's Animal Welfare Center, Somerset Regional Animal Shelter, Monmouth County SPCA, Hunterdon County Prosecutor's Office and New Jersey State Police rescued nearly 200 dogs from the property.
The property was in squalor, according to the responders, and most of the dogs, some being pregnant, are thought to not have any veterinary care, including vaccines, microchipping and other standards. According to the report, there were also several dead dogs found on the property.
The Hunterdon County Prosecutor's Office, which has yet to name the people or give the address of the location, said that an animal cruelty investigation is still underway and charges are pending.
Those interested in donating to St. Hubert's can do so by visiting www.sthuberts.org or by calling the organization at 973-377-2295. Somerset Regional Animal Shelter can be reached at www.srasnj.org or at 908-725-0308.

Analysis: Lakers’ negotiations for Anthony Davis involve many moving parts

Texto completo: It might seem like a familiar script: The Lakers are again maneuvering for a potential trade for Anthony Davis.But with new power brokers in charge, a better-than-advertised draft pick and growing urgency for all sides involved, this one might actually bring a new star to L.A.
A New York Times report on Wednesday cited progressing talks between the Lakers and the New Orleans Pelicans, who are trying to structure a multi-team deal around the 6-foot-11 big man who could change the Lakers’ fortunes.
While a potential deal fell apart (or never was terribly close to materializing, depending on who you ask) in February, the Times reported that the Lakers had offered Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram and their No. 4 pick as of Wednesday afternoon for a deal that might involve three or more teams. The Pelicans were pushing for the inclusion of Kyle Kuzma to be packaged into a deal. Amid a narrow field of contenders for Davis, the Lakers seem to have the most progress toward bringing him into the fold.
Getting Davis would be a splash for a franchise that has now missed the postseason for six consecutive years, but it would also be something of a gamble. Davis, 26, would enter free agency next summer, and the Lakers would likely have to re-sign him to a max contract or lose him. But for now, all signs point to Los Angeles being Davis’ desired destination: A Sports Illustrated story published Wednesday quoted Davis’ agent, Rich Paul favorably touting L.A.’s appeal and comparing Davis’ placement in the Southern California market favorably to dating Jennifer Lopez.
While Paul’s interest in moving Davis to L.A. has often been linked to his most prestigious client, LeBron James, Paul dismissed the link as a tertiary draw to the market. At one point in the story, Paul asked rhetorically: “What better place to do it than L.A.?”
The trick has been making the match in the first place.
Talks have long centered around Ball, Ingram and Kuzma, all of whom are first-round draft picks from the past three years. While Ball and Ingram have missed chunks of the last two seasons with injuries – Ingram requiring surgery in March for a blood clot in particular – both are still seen as talented young prospects in the league and are just 21 years old. Kuzma has also worked his way into that realm by outperforming his No. 28 draft slot: He averaged 18.7 points and 5.5 rebounds last season and received an invite to Team USA basketball camp in August. The Lakers’ reported reluctance to trade him indicates the esteem he’s earned.
Part of the value of the Lakers’ youth is that they are still on their rookie deals. Ingram is poised to make $7.3 million next season, his fourth, before becoming a restricted free agent. Ball would make $8.7 with a team option for the following season. Kuzma would pose even greater value because of his draft position, making just under $2 million for next season with a team option for the following year. While he hasn’t been mentioned as a piece in this round of trade talks, Josh Hart would make about $1.9 million next season. Teams acquiring any of those players would have the ability to keep them in restricted free agency when their rookie deals end.
A similar package got the Lakers nowhere at the trade deadline, but Davis’ contract is likely to draw diminishing returns the longer the Pelicans wait to deal him. ESPN reported that newly appointed executive David Griffin would prefer to have a deal done before the June 20th draft, allowing the Pelicans to use any draft picks they receive in the deal.
The Lakers got a huge boost from landing the No. 4 pick, and even on draft lottery night, Pelinka mentioned the possibility that it could be used in a trade. For a team such as the Lakers – who are now trying to maximize LeBron James’ competitive window and return to the playoffs next spring – adding another young player who will take several seasons to develop doesn’t seem to mesh with the timeline.
The Lakers haven’t taken much trouble either to publicly tout possible draft prospects. While the team is meeting privately with some of the players in range of the fourth overall pick, they’ve held just one open workout with one of those individuals: Jarrett Culver from Texas A&M.
The value of the draft pick is a fascinating question: The Pelicans themselves own the enviable spot on the board, No. 1 overall, with which they’re expected to take the universally heralded Duke prospect Zion Williamson to be a franchise cornerstone. Murray State guard Ja Morant and Duke forward R.J. Barrett are widely seen as the next highest prospects on the board – beyond those picks, there is no clear prospect that towers above the rest. While Culver, Vanderbilt’s Darius Garland and others in the No. 4 range have impressed on various stages, it’s unclear who the Pelicans value from that field.
A player as vaunted as Davis isn’t without other suitors. ESPN reported that the Boston Celtics are the leading competitors to land Davis, with a large pool of draft picks and young players including Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier and Jayson Tatum under contract. It’s not clear yet who they’d be willing to part with in a potential deal with Davis. The New York Knicks are also widely seen as another contender, like the Lakers boasting cap room to sign another star this summer. But even though they are armed with the No. 3 draft pick, their young talent – including forward Mitchell Robinson and guard Dennis Smith Jr. – are seen as less proven than the collection the Lakers and Celtics have to offer.
Timing will be of the essence: The Lakers appear to maintain the upper hand on their competition if the Pelicans are willing to deal Davis soon. Due to a clause that prevents NBA teams from having two players on max rookie extensions, the Celtics still can’t consummate a deal for Davis until July 1 when Kyrie Irving comes off their books (although they will still be able to negotiate a trade in principle before then). Time also might be against Boston, too: Since publicly saying he wanted to stay with the Celtics last fall, tension has arisen between Irving and the team, leading to speculation that he might leave in free agency anyway and damage Boston’s ambitions for a star-laden contender.
Trading for Davis (due $27.1 million next season, not counting his $4.1 million trade bonus, which the Pelicans might agree to pay or Davis could agree to waive) also might complicate timing for the Lakers depending on their free agency goals: If they want to sign another max-contract free agent this summer, they could agree on a Davis trade in principle, but not execute it until an elite free agent is signed. The Lakers have a projected $32.5 million in cap space this summer once cap holds from last year’s one-year contracts are cleared from their books – just enough to sign another max deal if that’s how they choose to use their space.
To assemble a trio of stars this summer, the Lakers would need to trade away at least $21.6 million or $24.8 million in salary to match Davis with or without his trade bonus, respectively. In both scenarios, they might need to sign their No. 4 pick (whom they would have drafted on behalf of New Orleans) on July 1 at $7.1 million and then wait 30 days to officially execute a deal that would have to include at least Ball and Ingram and the combined $16 million for their 2019-20 salaries.
Many difficult and critical decisions remain for the Lakers to finish bridging the gap on a deal with Davis. But that gap seems to be as narrow now as it’s been since the drama began.

The dumbest anti-Trump conspiracy theory is that he won't leave the White House after being defeated

Texto completo: One of the oddest things about our political moment is that President Trump regularly says and does things in the open that are easily criticized, and yet his opponents still manufacture wild conspiracy theories about him. To my mind the dumbest theory currently being floated is the idea that if Trump loses in 2020, he simply will refuse to leave the White House. To those pushing the theory, this is all a very real and super serious prospect that we should all be very worried about and so we need to start preparing.
Asked by CNN's Chris Cuomo for his political predictions, Bill Maher declared, "One of those things ... that I've been talking about for years now, almost three years, that a lot of people are talking about now, is that if [Trump] loses ... he won't go."
He said, "We have to worry about that."
It would be easy to dismiss this if the conspiracy theory were only being advanced by an unfunny comedian, but it actually keeps coming up.
Former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen testified that he's worried there won't be a "peaceful transition of power" if Trump loses. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi warned the New York Times that Trump won't accept defeat unless he's beaten by a large enough margin. "We have to inoculate against that, we have to be prepared for that," she said.
There's also been a flood of articles entertaining this possibility.
"What if Trump loses but refuses to leave the White House? We have to start to contemplate the possibility," read an op-ed in the New York Daily News. The Washington Monthly published a "step-by-step guide" under the title, "How Trump Could Lose the Election and Remain President."
There was, it should be said, a similar conspiracy theory involving President George W. Bush canceling the 2008 election in the name of the war on terror. This even inspired some fan fiction in the Nation imagining a news article from the future under the headline, "Bush Postpones 2008 Election."
But the anti-Trump conspiracy has gained more traction, and is being floated by more prominent figures (though in Pelosi's case, it's likely more of a cynical calculation given that promoting the conspiracy is helpful to voter turnout efforts).
In reality, there is simply no reason to have a legitimate fear about Trump somehow refusing to go.
Sure, it's difficult to see a scenario in which he's a gracious loser. He'd likely take to Twitter to claim widespread fraud, lash out at the fake news media, Robert Mueller, and vent in all sorts of ways. But there's no reason to believe he'd somehow refuse to leave the White House, or that he'd successfully remain as president were he to do so.
Trump's presidency has provided plenty of examples of him making bombastic statements about fake news being the "enemy of the people" and threatening or contemplating all sorts of actions. But he doesn't typically follow through.
For all his media bashing, he is not jailing journalists, or actually revisiting libel laws — something he has routinely floated rhetorically. For all his attacks on the Mueller "witch hunt," he never took the step of firing the special counsel, even though he could have done so. Yes, he's taken many executive actions, including ones that I've criticized him for. But when he's been slapped down by courts, while he's bashed the judges, he hasn't simply routinely ignored court orders.
Sure, one could argue that he doesn't deserve praise for simply not jailing journalists. But the point is that refusing to leave the White House after losing the election would follow a pattern of behavior of a president who is willing to jail journalists and routinely ignore court orders, not somebody who likes to pop off on Twitter.
Even if Trump did somehow break with his long-standing tendency of barking and not biting, by refusing to leave, he would not ultimately succeed. He'd be thwarted by courts, and if it came down to it, he'd be escorted out of the White House by the military. Any actions he tried to take as a phantom president would have no legal teeth, and would be easily tossed aside. Unless you believe that the military establishment would effectively support a Trump-led coup, you have nothing to worry about.
The fact that he would have zero odds of successfully executing this coup and could face significant legal consequences if he takes things too far, and that all his advisers would be explaining this to him, is another reason to believe that he would never take things that far.
Trump does not want to spend his remaining years in jail. He wants to spend his remaining years going back to his life as a billionaire, monetizing his massive following, and tweeting about how his successor is a pathetic failure and a stone-cold loser.

Texto completo: "The Queen" by Josh Levin Little, Brown, 432 pages, $29, out now: While on the presidential campaign trail in 1976, Ronald Reagan sought to illustrate welfare fraud by referencing a Chicago woman who "held the record" in collecting ill-gotten government checks. The actual woman behind the stereotype, Linda Taylor, was first called "welfare queen" by the Chicago Tribune, but her story is far more complex, ignored by the press and politicians who borrowed aspects of her image to vilify poor people of color. In re-examining the myth, Slate's Josh Levin explores racism in America and oversimplified narratives that still dominate political discourse.
"On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous" by Ocean Vuong Penguin, 256 pages, $26, out now: It's a big summer for debut novels, and this one by poet Ocean Vuong may be the most widely hyped of them all. "On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous" is a letter from a man in his late 20s addressed to a mother who can't read it. Examining race, class, loss, masculinity and the power of story, Vuong's work is already being hailed as "brilliant," "shattering" and "an epistolary masterpiece."
"In West Mills" by De'Shawn Charles Winslow Bloomsbury, 272 pages, $26, out now: Set in a rural black neighborhood in North Carolina, De'Shawn Charles Winslow's first novel follows a headstrong woman, Azalea "Knot" Centre, determined to live life on her own terms. Over nearly five decades, she and other residents of her tightly knit community grapple with interpersonal drama and long-buried secrets. Early reviews applaud the book's "warmth," and Rebecca Makkai, author of "The Great Believers," calls Winslow's voice "arresting and important and new."
"Recursion" by Blake Crouch Crown, 336 pages, $27, June 11: Last fall, Netflix scooped up the rights to Blake Crouch's "Recursion," which will be developed into a feature film and TV series - and the book isn't out until mid-June. The latest novel from the author of the Wayward Pines trilogy is part sci-fi thriller and part police procedural, with a little romance thrown in for good measure. Starring New York City cop Barry Sutton and brilliant neuroscientist Helena Smith, it explores the lengths people will go to preserve their most precious memories - or, given the chance, reinvent them entirely.
"Fleishman Is in Trouble" by Taffy Brodesser-Akner Random House, 384 pages, $27, June 18: Taffy Brodesser-Akner, a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine, tackles marriage, divorce, ambition and identity in her debut novel. When Toby Fleishman and his wife of more than 14 years, Rachel, decide to separate, the Manhattan hepatologist assumes he knows what he's in for: co-parenting their preteen kids, a chance to put himself out there on dating apps, etc. His assumptions are upended when Rachel drops off their children at his place and ghosts.
"The Vagabonds" by Jeff Guinn Simon & Schuster, 320 pages, $28, July 9: Summer road trips weren't always the popular American pastime they are today. Back when cars were unreliable and roads barely passable, they were downright impractical. So it was a big deal when Henry Ford, Thomas Edison and tire-maker Harvey Firestone decided to spend a series of summers from 1915 to 1925 road tripping around the country. Though the self-described "Vagabonds" traveled with chefs, butlers and other personnel (not exactly roughing it), their ultimate mission was to assess American roadways and drive the automobile straight into ubiquity.
"The Need" by Helen Phillips Simon & Schuster, 272 pages, $26, July 9: The author of "The Beautiful Bureaucrat" returns with an existential thriller that unearths truths about modern motherhood. Molly is a paleobotanist at a fossil quarry and mom to two young children whose life turns upside down when an intruder wearing a deer mask confronts her in her home.
"On the Clock" by Emily Guendelsberger Little, Brown, 352 pages, $28, July 16: In a timely and important look at the harsh realities of the modern American workplace, journalist Emily Guendelsberger recounts her experiences doing hourly labor all over the country. Threatened by automation, low-wage jobs have become all about efficiency but at the cost of humanity. Her question: How can we make such work more humane?
"The Nickel Boys" by Colson Whitehead Doubleday, 224 pages, $24.95, July 16: A great deal of buzz surrounds Colson Whitehead's follow-up to "The Underground Railroad," his searing 2016 novel that won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction, the National Book Award and the Chicago Tribune Heartland Literary Prize. Set in Jim Crow-era Florida, his new book centers on two boys sentenced to a juvenile reformatory where abuse, assault and corruption run rampant. Whitehead based the nightmarish Nickel Academy on a real reform school that used to operate in Florida.
"Three Women" by Lisa Taddeo Avid Reader, 320 pages, $27, July 27: For this impressive feat of narrative nonfiction, Lisa Taddeo spent nearly a decade with a high school student in North Dakota, an entrepreneur in Seattle and a homemaker in suburban Indiana to write an immersive account of the sex lives of ordinary American women. Critics are already raving about this carefully crafted portrait of female desire.
"Trick Mirror" by Jia Tolentino Random House, 304 pages, $27, Aug. 6: Jia Tolentino's incisive cultural commentary has graced the pages of The New Yorker, the NPR airwaves and even the recent "Fyre Fraud" documentary. Soon, her deft insights arrive in book form with "Trick Mirror," an essay collection that probes these precarious times - scams, the devolution of the internet, our optimization fixation - to consider how a near-constant focus on self warps our vision.
"Coventry" by Rachel Cusk FSG, 256 pages, $27, Aug. 20: Rachel Cusk is admired for her heady autofiction, particularly the much-talked-about Outline trilogy. Now a new collection of nonfiction - covering everything from art and family life to feminism and politics - allows Cusk fans a chance to jump back inside her brilliant brain.
"How to Be an Antiracist" by Ibram X. Kendi One World, 320 pages, $27, Aug. 20: Ibram X. Kendi - author of "Stamped from the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America," which won a 2016 National Book Award for Nonfiction - turns his attention toward achieving a more just and equitable future. Blending memoir, social commentary, history and science, "How to Be an Antiracist" seeks to reshape the conversation about racial justice in America: from how not to be racist, to how to be an antiracist.

How energy drinks hurt DJ Khaled's Billboard rank

Texto completo: DJ Khaled's latest offering was not No. 1 in America, and energy drinks are to blame.
His new album "Father of Asahd," which dropped on May 17, had the trappings of a chart- topping record. It featured guests such as Beyoncé, Jay-Z, Cardi B, Justin Bieber and John Legend, to name a few. While promoting it, Khaled appeared on "Saturday Night Live" with surprise guests Lil Wayne, Big Sean, Jeremih, Meek Mill, Lil Baby, J Balvin, SZA and John Legend.
Yet there it was debuting at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, bested by "Igor," the idiosyncratic record by eclectic rapper Tyler, the Creator. It has since dropped to No. 3.
Complicating matters was the fact that each record received nearly the same number of streams - Khaled actually received slightly more - a major factor the folks at Billboard take into account when deciding album placement. But they also looked at another factor: merchandise.
To understand why, it's first necessary to understand "bundling," one of the many innovative ways artists try to scheme their way to top of the charts. It's a simple concept: Buy something, such as a concert ticket or a piece of clothing repping the artist, and you get a free album download. Take advantage of it, and the number of records sold grows by one. Everybody wins, right?
Not exactly. In this particular case, Tyler, the Creator bundled his record with clothing and novelty items such as "Vote Igor" lawn signs, while Khaled chose packs of energy shots (similar to 5-Hour Energy) through Shop.com as his chart-tackling Trojan Horse.
That's where the problem came in. According to the New York Times, Billboard suspected "that some of the marketing by Shop.com and its corporate parent, Market America, had crossed a line by encouraging unauthorized bulk sales."
"In this particular instance, we saw an organization encouraging purchases among their members by promising them material and organizational benefits," Deanna Brown, the president of the Billboard-Hollywood Reporter Media Group, told the newspaper.
That, apparently, is against the rules. But the rules aren't spelled out for the general public.
The story blew up when the New York Post reported that Khaled was planning to sue Billboard, though that was unconfirmed. His team did not respond to multiple requests for comment from The Washington Post. But clearly they are not happy.
"We dispute their decision on behalf of DJ Khaled and, frankly, every artist who is forced to navigate bundling an album download with an inexpensive item that still effectively represents their brand. It's confusing and demeaning to the art," Desiree Perez, Roc Nation's chief operating officer, said in a statement. "We're obviously not fans of bundling. . . . But our hands are being forced by Billboard's desperate, last-ditch effort to keep streaming from eliminating what's left of music downloads."
Billboard declined to comment further on the matter.
It's true that the world of bundling is a confusing one. As the revenue artists make off their actual songs has declined with streaming, the idea of selling other products with music has risen.
It's not a particularly new phenomenon, according to Larry Miller, the director of the music business program at New York University's Steinhardt School. It began in 2004, when Prince gave away copies of "Musicology" with concert tickets. Since then, bundling has seen a number of permutations, including the still-bizarre partnership between Papa John's and Taylor Swift in 2012 to sell her album "Red" along with a large one-topping pizza for $22. Since then it has become fairly standard for things such as T-shirts or concert tickets to come with digital album downloads.
The point of bundles is "to trick people back into buying full albums," Matt McNeal, a veteran manager and A&R person for J. Cole's Dreamville Records, told Rolling Stone. "Fans are probably already listening to the album [on a streaming service], but because I sold them this T-shirt, I also get a CD sale within it."
For some lesser-known artists, it's all about making some extra cash. When someone such as Craig Finn, frontman of indie rock band the Hold Steady, sells his solo record with a T-shirt and pins, he's probably aware he has slight chance of besting records from acts including Tyler, the Creator and DJ Khaled.
For these artists, it's "a revenue maximization strategy," Miller said. "It's about delivering a limited product" - such as a concert poster or limited-run hoodie - "in a world where access to the music itself has become unlimited," Miller said. "There is this concept of giving the fans something that is unique and available for a limited time only and that will almost surely sell out and not be available when the window closes, even though the music itself is always available on every device everywhere in the world."
But when someone such as Swift does this - everything in her digital store, including T-shirts, hoodies, baseball caps and pop-up phone stands comes with a digital copy of her forthcoming album - earning that top spot is probably part of the strategy.
"The Billboard charts, the Hot 100 chart and the album chart in particular are still the currency that artists and senior managers at record companies use in order to determine effectiveness," Miller said. "It is still the most effective feedback mechanism that we have about what is happening across all platforms and territories."
And therein lies the problem: Billboard still matters, but it isn't transparent about the rules surrounding bundling.
"Billboard needs to be clearer about what is going to count and what is not going to count," Miller said. But he acknowledged the challenges the company faces: "Streaming has changed the sound of popular music. It has changed the definition of what an album is or can be. It has changed the way music is created and constructed. It is even challenging the way the referees count music that was consumed."
"[Billboard's] job for the better part of a century is to rank what's popular, and that's still their job," he added. "It has never been more difficult than it is this week."

Texto completo: Clare Bronfman, heredera del imperio licorero Seagram’s, aportó más de $14 millones de dólares para financiar la defensa de los acusados, incluyendo ella misma, el líder Keith Raniere y la actriz Allison Mack, en el caso de la secta sexual Nxivm, señalada de tráfico y esclavitud en las afueras de Albany, capital de Nueva York.
Todos los acusados, excepto Raniere (58), se han declarado culpables y están a la espera de la sentencia, en libertad bajo fianza.
Richard Guerci, testigo de la fiscalía y experto del IRS, declaró ayer que Bronfman había depositado más de $14.3 millones de dólares en un fideicomiso irrevocable para cubrir facturas legales para ella y otros acusados , informó New York Post.
La semana pasada, el fiscal Mark Lesko dijo al tribunal que la suma no se había depositado de una vez, sino en seis o siete pagos, sin detallar las cantidades.
Bronfman (40) era considerada la directora de operaciones de la organización Nxvim, junto con su fundador, Raniere, y Mack, actriz de la serie de televisión “Smallville”.
La heredera neoyorquina se declaró culpable en abril de conspiración para ocultar y albergar a un extranjero ilegal con fines de lucro, entre otros cargos.
Guerci reveló que el fideicomiso tuvo otro donante además de Bronfman: Jack Levy, también antiguo miembro de alto rango de Nxivm, donó $1,030 dólares.
Raniere ha negado todos los cargos presentados contra él. Está acusado de dirigir un grupo secreto de esclavas que fueron maltratadas, expuestas a torturas, hambre y tener sexo sólo con él.
Según los fiscales, en 2015 Raniere formó una sociedad secreta dentro de Nxivm llamada “DOS”, acrónimo en latín para “Amo de las compañeras obedientes”, donde él era el único hombre y líder. La secta operaba con los rangos de “maestros” y “esclavas”.
Todo salió a la luz cuando una “esclava” desertó en 2017 y la historia fue reseñada por The New York Times. Raniere huyó del país poco después de esa publicación.
Hoy es el único de los acusados que se mantiene detenido , tras ser arrestado en México y deportado a Nueva York en marzo de 2018. Enfrenta un mínimo de 15 años de prisión y un máximo de cadena perpetua.

Former farmworker who got bachelor's honored

Texto completo: Just days before Salinas resident Adolfo González is scheduled to take his credential test to become a teacher – and after decades of field work – he held a Monterey County resolution proclaiming Tuesday as "Adolfo González Day."
This followed González's heavily publicized graduation, at 58 years old, from California State University, Monterey Bay.
"As I have said, I have done this for my family and my community, and myself, too," he said. "But I never imagined I can inspire this many people."
He graduated early with honors in Spanish language and culture last month, and The Salinas Californian published a story about his accomplishment.
Soon after, González's story captivated audiences across the U.S. and Latin America through news outlets and social media.
¡Despierta América!, Univision's morning show for Spanish speakers in the U.S., interviewed him on live television. He also spoke with the world's fourth largest news wire service and the largest for Spanish language, Agencia EFE. The New York Times and Los Angeles Times featured González's original story from The Californian in their California newsletters.
In the United States' second largest media market per Nielsen ratings, KTLA also reported on González. The news station has the largest audience in Los Angeles.
His bachelor's degree was the culmination of a decades-long pursuit to continue his education, starting when he moved from his rural village in Mexico, speaking only his native Zapoteco, to the internado, a school for indigenous youth in the city, to learn Spanish.
Later, González moved to the Salinas Valley harvesting celery and living for years without lawful status. But all the while, he emphasized education for his wife and two daughters.
Eventually, though, he would learn English and become a citizen. He began taking classes at adult school, then attended community college and CSUMB, where he graduated May 24.
Monterey County supervisors celebrated his work Tuesday with a day recognizing González, an honor rarely given to residents.
"His story couldn't have come at a better time," said Supervisor Luis Alejo, who represents most of Salinas, where González lives. "We're living at a time when attacks against immigrants is prevalent. But it's these stories that remind us as Americans what it means to fulfill the American dream."
His daughter Marie – holding her 3-month-old Katelyn throughout the ceremony – said family in Mexico and Los Angeles, which has a large Zapoteco population, reached out to reconnect after years apart.
Even former classmates who dropped out also want to speak with her father and Marie, who graduated from CSUMB the year before her father. They tell her they want to go back to school after hearing her family's story.
"Like my dad always says, this just got out of hand – way too much," she said. "We never thought he would get such recognition. We always thought only the family would be happy, would be excited. But it seems like the whole community is excited for him, and motivated."
González once attended the Salinas Adult School before going back to tutor and volunteer there. Salinas Union High School District Superintendent Dan Burns said González's story stands out in the 101-year history of the school with over 20,000 adults attending classes throughout that time.
Susan Landesman, a program specialist at the adult school, first met González when he wanted to tutor there as part of a CSUMB class requirement over a year ago.
She is proud of the school's flexibility and free tuition, which allows adults to slowly work at their education, like González has.
Alongside his wife Maria, his daughters Blanca and Marie, and his grandchildren Katelyn and Mateo, González took time Tuesday to thank everyone who helped him along the way. Even González's 91-year-old mother Carmen, who lives in their small Zapoteco village of San Andres Yaa in Mexico, has supported him in daily phone calls over the years.
"I'm here, that's fine," González said, "but next to me, behind me, there are a lot of persons that have been working hard to achieve my success. As I said, I would like to share this recognition with them."
González's eldest granddaughter Kayla learned chess from him and often studied alongside him but couldn't make it to the ceremony. Kayla was in class Tuesday, preparing to graduate from sixth grade at Salinas' Monte Bella Elementary School.
"She feels proud and with deep responsibility to achieve her academic goals," Marie said of her 11-year-old. "She says she needs to make grandpa proud."

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Re "Times Global Edition Is Ending Daily Political Cartoons" (Business Day, June 11):
I value the values of The New York Times. And these are not only fully compatible with but also encourage political cartoons. Understanding a cartoon requires the same skills as to draw one: intelligence, criticism, sharpness of mind, humor, sense of context. Of course some readers will not understand them properly, or will get wrongly offended. But this requires more cartoons, not fewer.
Daniel Saraga

To the Editor:
Abolishing editorial cartoons from your international edition? Seriously? I know going mano a mano with the Trump administration for the last couple of years is enough to spoil anyone's sense of humor. But get a grip, please!
Look, we all get you're not The New Yorker with cartoons as part of your DNA, but to deny loyal readers the occasional mordant chuckle is just too much to bear, especially in times like these. Even the Gray Lady can wear a clown's nose from time to time, if you catch my drift. And we'll still love you even if the odd cartoon is a dud. Just don't give up on this hallowed, funny art form.

Texto completo: President Trump's critics rushed to judgment over the weekend to deride his immigration deal with Mexico. It turns out that was more because of dislike for him than fact.
Commentators alleged that the new deal was simply a rehash of policies Mexico was already enforcing. The New York Times started the stampede of this allegation, followed by predictable attacks from the usual sources. By Monday, the anti-Trump commentariat was sure it had shown Trump's supposed deal with Mexico over immigration was fake news.
But a report from The Post late Monday based on interviews with U.S. and Mexican officials involved in last week's talks tells the exact opposite tale. Mexican officials did agree to more extensive measures to crack down on Central American migration to the United States than they had before. They also agreed to pursue even more extensive measures if their approach failed to significantly cut the migrant flow. Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has even agreed to consider making Mexico a "safe third country," which would require it to accept Central American migrants itself, if its effort fail.
Trump, it appears, has done what he set out to do: use the threat of tariffs, which would devastate the Mexican economy, to force Mexico to do something to control its borders. It's true he exaggerated the nature of the deal, alleging in one tweet that Mexico had agreed to buy more U.S. agricultural products, a claim that was swiftly denied. But both the Mexican president and the country's foreign minister are now on record saying that Trump's tariff threat spurred faster and more comprehensive action than they would have otherwise taken.
Fair-minded analysts would now change their opinions. They would acknowledge that Trump's move might just work, even if they decry its forceful and bullying nature. They would look carefully at the results and monitor this development, parsing out credit and blame as the evidence suggests. They would withhold final judgment for now and see where the chips fall.
Don't stay up too late waiting for that. The Trump Derangement Syndrome that affects so much of the pundit and opinion-leader class takes precedence over objectivity and fairness.
Remember the North Korean summit this year? The drumbeat of opinion going into the meeting told us how the clever Kim Jong Un would surely fleece Trump, who would take a terrible deal to claim victory in an unnecessary fight caused by his bluster and threats. But when Trump unexpectedly broke off the summit early because Kim's proffered deal was a loser, the horde blamed Trump for pushing the summit in the first place rather than credit him with judgment they didn't think he possessed.
The Mexico deal is simply the North Korea summit redux. Trump makes a move the establishment doesn't like; they lambaste him for it. It results in a deal; they say it's phony. Now we know it's not phony, and they surely will find another way to spin it so that Trump remains a devil, a bumbler and an oaf.
This type of animus-driven herd analysis is doing great harm to the media. It also explains why the media's reporting has had so little influence on public opinion about Trump.
Trump is far from perfect. He makes his share of mistakes and often manages to offend even when he succeeds. He also is a radical - a man who wants U.S. policy to change dramatically and quickly in a host of ways. Anyone who thinks those changes are wrong or pushed too haphazardly has reason to criticize him.
But the leap to condemn his Mexican deal before the evidence was in is, unfortunately, par for the course. The subject matter may be different, but the conclusion is always drearily the same. When the opinion class "knows" he's wrong to begin with, the facts themselves don't really matter. And when facts stop mattering to the writers, they stop mattering to their readers, too.

Executives insult women, say they need abortion rights to succeed at work

Texto completo: Top executives want people to know they're unhappy with restrictive abortion laws recently passed by a number of state legislatures. This uproar comes after many in the entertainment industry questioned their own investments in Georgia, Louisiana, and Alabama. These business leaders affirm that the "right to abortion" is one of the most prominent social causes for the left side of the political aisle.
On Monday, an open letter appeared in the New York Times, signed by almost 200 CEOs, who all lament that efforts to protect the unborn are succeeding. The letter, entitled "Don't Ban Equality," also appears on a site bearing the same name. It reads in part:
"We, the undersigned, represent more than 108,000 workers and stand against policies that hinder people’s health, independence and ability to fully succeed in the workplace. Restricting access to comprehensive reproductive care, including abortion, threatens the health, independence and economic stability of our employees and customers. Simply put, it goes against our values, and is bad for business. The future of gender equality hangs in the balance, putting our families, communities, businesses and the economy at risk."
Included among the signatories is Peter T. Grauer of Bloomberg LP, Jack Dorsey (of Twitter) representing Square, Inc., Matthew McCarthy of Ben & Jerry’s Homemade, Inc., and Elie Seidman of Tinder.
The campaign, supposedly for equality, is a preposterous display of the exact opposite. But in many ways, it meets our expectations. It comes from the popular crowd, a large group that remains disinterested in truth and the basics of morality. Not only is their crusade against abortion restrictions flatly anti-life, but in an attempt to appear pro-woman, the reverse is shown.
Without full access to abortion, we're told by these executives that women can't "fully succeed in the workplace." Are the demands of these companies such that a woman can't be a mother and a successful employee? In order to meet career goals, must a female schedule her unborn child's destruction? Talk about a toxic work environment.
It certainly seems that pregnancy is frowned upon by the many men (and women) who lent their name to this cause. As much as possible and where/when appropriate, being a working mother should be supported by employers. By stating that restricting abortion and allowing more births would cause women to fall short of their goals in the workplace, these executives are only highlighting their own sexism.
In addition, these CEOs have involuntarily admitted the absence of a legitimate, gender-based wage gap within their respective companies. If the burden of children is the main reason for workplace failure and the difference in earnings over the life of a career, then misogyny can be ruled out and personal choice is the sole factor in the equation.
Finally, the problem of latent, wage-related sexism is solved!
Unsurprisingly, some of these companies base a portion of their success in the actual ability to get an abortion. This couldn't be more evident than with Tinder whose CEO, Elie Seidman, added his name to the letter. One can't help but think that the longevity of the dating/hookup app is made more secure if abortion is an option for those who find themselves with more than they bargained for after swiping right. For some, abortion may be the avenue that makes it possible for them to log on yet again. No wonder Seidman is nervous.
As usual, the pro-abortion left can't make a coherent, ethical argument as to why restrictive abortion laws are bad for women and the broader idea of equality. True equality would never seek to deny the most basic right, the right to life, to unborn individuals in the United States. These executives make it clear they don't believe women are capable of starting a family and achieving success in a corporate environment. By rebuking politicians for life-affirming legislation, and telling women it's impossible to do well without abortion, these CEOs confirm that their singular focus is profit, not people.

12-year-old dancer working toward pro career in ballet

Texto completo: Niyah Peterkin is a planner.
She needs to be. She's up at 6:30 and back home around 10:30 p.m. By day, she's an honor roll student at York Suburban Middle School. At night, she transforms into a ballerina with the Central Pennsylvania Youth Ballet.
"I like being on the stage," Niyah said.
This has been a lifetime of work for Niyah, a dancer since she was 2, a serious dancer since 7, when her parents discovered CPYB and the discipline of a dance troupe that boasts alumni like Anna Gerberich, a Dillsburg native who joined the Joffrey Ballet in 2015, and Aran Bell, from Bethesda, Md., who is now with the American Ballet Theatre.
This isn't an extra-curricular activity, her mother said.
"The school makes it pretty clear that the goal for the students that study there is to become professional," Shaneika Peterkin said.
Like the parents of an Olympian, their commitment is nearly as taxing as hers. Vincent Peterkin picks up his daughter at the middle school at 3 p.m. for the hour-long drive to Carlisle, where he works at Geodis Logistic running production control. He works long shifts a couple of days a week, building his entire schedule around her school.
"He has been incredibly flexible to have jobs that allow him to take her to ballet," Shaneika Peterkin said.
Niyah has a planner to keep herself organized. "I just try to write down everything I can," she said. She practices dance 29 hours a week over six days, but not at home. She just runs through her dances in her head.
Because of that commitment to dance, Niyah will move into cyber school for her next academic year.
The dance school A Carlisle 19-year-old, Marcia Dale Weary, opened the Central Penn Youth Ballet in 1955. She wanted ballet to be accessible to all children.
Weary just died this year at age 82.
In a New York Times story after her death, it said this about the school she built: "Graduates are on the rosters of nearly every important American company, including New York City Ballet, American Ballet Theater, San Francisco Ballet, Pacific Northwest Ballet and Miami City Ballet."
Nicholas Ade, CPYB's executive director, said that he and Weary had spent a year working on the transition that would leave the school as she hoped. Among her goals was to keep CPYB accessible to all potential students.
"The only requirement to be admitted to our school is you have to be willing to do the work," Ade said. There are no auditions. The school has 300 students in an academic year and raises more than $300,000 in scholarships for the girls and boys who attend.
With those scholarships in place, classes average about $4 per session. At the top academic level, a school-year commitment to CPYB costs a family about $4,000, Ade said. At most of the schools in the United States at CPYB's level, tuition is about $10,000 a year, Ade said.
Students come from all over the country. The students at CPYB currently represent 23 states.
To help raise money for scholarships, CPYB offers sessions like Spring Into Summer, which will be held June 8 at the school in Carlisle. Niyah and her fellow students will perform, and the school will open its doors for a cocktail party to accompany the show. Tickets are $50.
For Niyah's family, the scholarships have made all the difference.
"The school has been incredibly gracious," Shaneika Peterkin said. The pointe shoes that she wears cost $100 a pair, which she needs to replace about every two to three months because of the wear on the shoe. At higher levels with more demand on the shoes, the older students can go through about a pair every week, she said.
Niyah barely remembers the life she and her family left behind in the city of Baltimore to move to Springettsbury Township six years ago.
She remembers wearing a uniform for the private Christian school she attended. At the time, the Peterkins were beginning to grow out of the small house they bought before they had children, Niyah and brother Mekhi, now 9.
They needed a new home, somewhere safe and affordable, and two kids in private school wouldn't be affordable. They landed in York County, surrounded in a neighborhood by a number of people just like them: Maryland transplants.
"We're in a town that's very welcoming," Shaneika Peterkin said.
She drives an hour to work each day, as a teacher with the Baltimore schools. Her husband goes in the other direction an hour.
"We're constantly evaluating that this is something she wants to do," Shaneika Peterkin said, making sure it's not overwhelming for their daughter, and that she sees her place in it. "I make a point that she goes to other shows where she can see other brown dancers. It's important that she sees she's not the only one."
Ballet has had difficulty diversifying its ranks because there's a common misconception that ballet is very expensive and elitist, Ade said.
"That's just not the case," Ade said. "That's the vision of Marica Dale Weary, to say that this type of training and the life skills that you learn from this ... should be accessible to everyone."
The pointe shoes Niyah Peterkin wears cost about $100 a pair. At this point, she needs a new pair every two or three months, but she may eventually need a new pair each week.

Trump's trade war 'victory' isn't fooling anyone; OP-ED

Texto completo: President Donald Trump's penchant for creating chaos, confrontation and conflict - be it on trade, North Korea, a government shutdown - only to "resolve" it by getting nothing and claiming victory (e.g. falsely suggesting progress on North Korea denuclearization, celebrating a win in the Rose Garden by reopening the government as Democrats demanded) has become tiresome. "He stakes out maximalist positions and issues brutal ultimatums to compel action, arguing that extreme problems demand extreme tactics," as the New York Times aptly describes his act.
Worse, Trump's antics threaten to create real economic and/or political turmoil at a time the economy might be going soft.
In the case of Trump's threatened tariffs that were to go into effect on Monday, shortly after the rotten May jobs numbers were released, Trump started tweeting hints of a "deal." Sure enough, he claimed victory by Friday night, but what had he gotten?
Nothing much he didn't already have, the New York Times reported. "The deal to avert tariffs that President Trump announced with great fanfare on Friday night consists largely of actions that Mexico had already promised to take in prior discussions with the United States over the past several months, according to officials from both countries who are familiar with the negotiations."
This particular routine wasn't even original. The Times reported:
"Under the deal announced this past Friday night, Mexico agreed to deploy its recently formed national guard throughout the country to stop migrants from reaching the United States and to expand a program making some migrants wait in Mexico while their asylum claims are heard in the United States.
"But Mexico had committed to do those things before, and it had rebuffed a more significant demand, a 'safe third country' treaty, which gives the United States the ability to reject asylum seekers if they had not sought refuge in Mexico first. Instead, Mexico agreed to continue talking about such a move over the next 90 days."
The national guard was formed just in March, and there are real questions as to its capabilities. The former Mexican foreign minister recently explained on NPR: "It doesn't really exist. It hasn't really been set up yet. The law was just passed a couple of months or two ago."
Moreover, Trump's attempt to redirect asylum seekers back to Mexico is contrary to U.S. law granting asylum seekers an individualized evaluation here in the United States.
Seeing less-than-spectacular reaction to his non-deal, Trump apparently invented out of whole cloth an agreement by Mexico to buy more agricultural products. This is not in writing. No one can find any evidence of Trump's agricultural deal (and if you believe it, I've got a bridge to sell you).
When Trump's crises collapse with phony wins for Trump, one never knows whether Trump has been conned by the other side (or his own negotiators), or whether he knows full well that this is a charade. Trump truly operates as if the underlying reality is meaningless; all that matters is what heroic message he can feed to Fox News, which dutifully blasts it out to the Trump cult.
However, facts do matter. When border crossings don't dramatically taper off, we'll be right where we were when Trump was threatening to "close the border," another impossible ultimatum. In the meantime (as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has done so many times in dissembling on the "progress" with North Korea), Trump aides will ruin their reputations insisting that Trump got a fabulous deal - the best ever!
Trump's imaginary wins often collide with his next dire concocted emergency. If Mexico will do all these wonderful things, we won't need the wall, right? Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer taunted Trump after the announcement on Friday. ("This is an historic night! @realDonaldTrump has announced that he has cut a deal to 'greatly reduce, or eliminate, Illegal Immigration coming from Mexico and into the United States. ... Now that that problem is solved, I'm sure we won't be hearing any more about it in the future,' " Schumer tweeted.)
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., early Saturday issued a withering statement. "President Trump undermined America's preeminent leadership role in the world by recklessly threatening to impose tariffs on our close friend and neighbor to the south. ... Threats and temper tantrums are no way to negotiate foreign policy."
But they are all that Trump knows. One wonders how long Trump's own advisers, not to mention foreign powers, are going to indulge his playacting.

Texto completo: MEDELLÍN, Colombia -- Colombia's House of Representatives opened a debate on Monday to censure the country's defense minister, amid national criticism that the military had issued orders this year encouraging human rights abuses.
The hearing to discipline the minister, Guillermo Botero, came three weeks after The New York Times revealed new orders instructing top army commanders to "double the results" of their military missions against guerrilla, paramilitary and criminal groups.
The orders sent a chill down the ranks of the military, and some senior commanders said the pressure to carry out attacks would mean high civilian casualties and had already led to suspicious deaths.
Up to 5,000 illegal killings occurred in the mid-2000s under similar circumstances, known today as the "false-positive" executions.
"There are orders which have been made public that have brought us terror that we're headed back to times that we thought were over," said Luis Alberto Albán, a former guerrilla leader of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the rebel group known as FARC, who now serves in the country's Congress.
During the debate in Congress, Mr. Albán noted that more than 130 former FARC members have been killed since the signing of a peace deal, including some by the military.
Katherine Miranda, a lawmaker from the Green Alliance party, said the report in The Times "clearly showed that we have fallen into policies which have incentivized extrajudicial executions."
She noted that the whistle-blowers in The Times report weren't members of the opposition like herself, but rather "top officials in the army," and that "it's the military itself which is saying we are possibly facing false positives."
The high-ranking officers who spoke to The Times provided copies of orders in which they had been told to double the number of surrenders, captures and killings by military operations, and to lower the standard under which they launched them.
They also provided a pledge form in which they said that Maj. Gen. Nicacio Martínez Espinel, the head of the army, had told commanders to set goals for the number of criminals and armed group members killed, captured and forced to surrender in battle.
Shortly after the report in The Times, the military said it would change the form, and Francisco Santos, Colombia's ambassador to the United States, later said it had been withdrawn entirely. On May 24, President Iván Duque said he was appointing an independent commission to review the orders to ensure they did not violate international or human rights law.
Toward the end of the hearing, Mr. Botero went before lawmakers to offer a defense, saying that he had always been honest with the government regarding the actions of the military. He said that while the army had stepped up its attacks this year, its emphasis had always been on captures and surrenders rather than combat kills.
"You can't have results in security matters if you don't observe the Constitution, the law, human rights and international norms," he said.
Mr. Botero's future could be the subject of a vote in the next week, but it remains unclear how far the effort to oust him will go in the country's conservative congressional majority. Last week, Mr. Duque's allies in Congress gave a rank promotion to General Martínez, despite calls for him to resign.
In testimony to the Colombian Senate last week, Mr. Botero said that the number of military operations had expanded during his tenure, up by a third, but that the attacks were "always done with respect for human rights."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: President Trump is the flim flam man.
He routinely takes credit for resolving crises that he himself created - and that, on closer examination, he has not really resolved. "If I had not been elected president of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea," he said in January, even though he was the one who raised the danger level with his reckless threats of "fire and fury" and he has not succeeded in stopping North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.
After offending both Mexico and Canada with his steel and aluminum tariffs and blustery ultimatums, Trump claimed credit for negotiating "the USMCA, the spectacular & very popular new Trade Deal that replaces NAFTA, the worst Trade Deal in the history of the U.S.A." - even though, in truth, there is scant difference between the two accords.
Then, on Friday evening, just days before the tariffs he had threatened to impose on Mexico were to take effect, Trump announced an agreement "to greatly reduce, or eliminate, Illegal Immigration coming from Mexico."
You would think by now that even the president's supporters might be slightly skeptical when he claims spectacular achievements with details to come. But like Charlie Brown trying to kick the football that Lucy always snatches away, they immediately tried to score political points off the nebulous Friday-night announcement.
"The threat of tariffs got Mexico to agree to take unprecedented steps to control illegal migration," crowed Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who once called Trump a "con artist" before joining the sycophancy caucus. That caucus's honorary chairman, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who once tweeted that Trump is "an opportunist" who is "not fit to be President," chirped: "I appreciate President Trump's bold leadership and applaud this agreement." The New York Post - owned by News Corp., whose chairman, Rupert Murdoch, reportedly called Trump a "phony" before becoming his courtier - opined: "Trump left his Mexico critics stunned, speechless."
Ah, if only Trump's toadies had waited a few hours, they might have avoided an own goal. For on Saturday, the New York Times revealed that "the deal to avert tariffs that President Trump announced with great fanfare on Friday night consists largely of actions that Mexico had already promised to take in prior discussions with the United States over the past several months." And those actions - deploying Mexico's ineffectual national guard to its border with Guatemala and allowing some asylum seekers to remain in Mexico while their cases are adjudicated in the United States - are unlikely to have much of an impact on undocumented migration.
But what of Trump's boast that "MEXICO HAS AGREED TO IMMEDIATELY BEGIN BUYING LARGE QUANTITIES OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT FROM OUR GREAT PATRIOT FARMERS!"? The use of ALL CAPS - a little too insistent - and the employment of a description for farmers that sounds as if it was lifted from Pravda, circa 1935, should indicate that this fanfaronade, too, wasn't quite on the level. And, indeed, Mexican officials told Bloomberg News on Saturday they never discussed agricultural purchases in the days leading up the ballyhooed accord.
Our Great Patriot Leader was reduced to claiming that somewhere out there - perhaps in an alternative universe where he really is an "extremely stable genius" - there exists a super-duper, top-secret accord that "will be announced at the appropriate time" but that, on this planet, neither Mexican nor U.S. officials seemed to know anything about.
The striking thing is that Trump's con- artistry continues to find so many willing marks who will remain forever convinced, notwithstanding all that is reported otherwise, that he made Mexico bow before his awesomeness. They are abetted, these Trump dupes, by cynical Republicans on Capitol Hill who know this achievement is as phony as a degree from Trump University but pretend otherwise to flatter the mercurial and egomaniacal occupant of the Oval Office. They are secretly breathing a sigh of relief that Trump's flimflammery averted a potentially catastrophic economic showdown. If they had a little more backbone, these Republicans would see that they have more power than they realize: It was GOP opposition, not Mexican concessions, that made Trump back down from his tariff threats.
What happens next? Well, if migration at the southern border declines in the next few months for any reason, Trump will claim credit, just as he claims credit for a fortune that he inherited from his father and an economic expansion that he inherited from President Barack Obama. And if migration doesn't decline, Trump will holler that Mexico has betrayed him and will engage in another round of brinkmanship that might not have such a happy ending. Trump's amnesiac supporters will not hold the success or failure of this faux accord against him; their faith runs too deep to be shaken by mere facts (a.k.a. "fake news").
But other countries will look at this episode and conclude (a) that Trump is a bad bluffer and (b) that he is quick to declare victory even when he hasn't won anything. The United States' credibility is eroding as rapidly as the presidency's dignity and decorum.

Why a Boston lawyer bankrolled the man behind the FBI's infamous Bigfoot file

Texto completo: The FBI captured the imagination of the nation last week when the bureau released 22 pages of documents concerning the origin of 15 unidentified hairs and tissue sent to the agency by a renowned Bigfoot researcher.
The documents, which date back to the 1970s, include a letter from Peter Byrne, director of the Bigfoot Information Center and Exhibition in Oregon, asking if the FBI would analyze some mysterious samples — “the first that we have obtained in six years which we feel may be of importance" — that he suspected of belonging to a Sasquatch.
The bottom of the type-written note revealed Byrne's sponsor: The Academy of Applied Science, Boston, Massachusetts.
That's right. Boston . Birthplace of the American Revolution. Home of the Celtics, the Red Sox, the Bruins, and apparently, Bigfoot benefactors.
The Academy of Applied Science was founded in 1963 by intellectual property lawyer Robert Rines. A nonprofit dedicated to promoting science and technology, the academy was based out of Rines's home on India Wharf, on Boston's waterfront, at the time, and supplied Byrne with more than $1 million in his quest to prove the existence of the hairy hominid.
The New England lawyer was better known, however, for his fascination with another cryptid: the fabled Loch Ness monster.
Rines, who died in 2009, was a polymath. He held more than 80 patents for his inventions. He founded Franklin Pierce Law Center, the first law school in New Hampshire. He taught patent law at Harvard and MIT, his alma mater. In his spare time, he composed music for Broadway and off-Broadway shows. He even won an Emmy.
But the Loch Ness monster was his obsession. It all started when he was vacationing in Scotland in 1972. Looking through a telescope, he eyed “a large, darkish hump ... with rough, mottled skin, like the back of an elephant," according to The New Yorker. And so the decades-long chase began.
Rines was relentless in his pursuit of the mythic Scottish monster. In the fall of 1970, as the Globe reported, he tried to lure Nessie to the surface with “sexual stimulants" — tape recordings of the mating and eating rituals of various fish and aquatic mammals — dropped into the depths of her watery lair. Needless to say, Nessie resisted temptation.
For later expeditions, Rines collaborated with MIT's famed Harold “Doc" Edgerton to attempt underwater photographs of the monster. He enlisted a pair of camera-mounted dolphins for another mission, but called it off when one tragically died. In the '90s, he turned to high-powered US Navy sonar technology.
“He brought a lot of respectability to the field," said Loren Coleman, founder of the International Cryptozoology Museum in Portland, Maine. “He had credibility. He wasn't some crackpot. He wasn't some fly-by-night person that just threw money at it. He was long-term."
Coleman crossed paths with Rines many times throughout their careers. They started corresponding in the '80s over their shared affinity for cryptozoology. In July 1999, Coleman said, he ran into Rines eating breakfast in the village of Drumnadrochit on the west shore of Loch Ness. Both men were in Scotland on separate expeditions.
Rines must have been impressed with Byrne's Bigfoot credentials, Coleman said.
Byrne was one of the so-called Four Horsemen of Sasquatchery, known for their pioneering research of the Bigfoot phenomenon between the '50s and '70s.
A former serviceman for the British Royal Air Force, Byrne made a name for himself as a successful big-game hunter in Nepal before embarking on his career as an international Sasquatch researcher. (“Hunter" is a common misnomer for Byrne, who stood firmly in the “no-kill" camp of Bigfoot seekers.)
Rines was just one of the wealthy financiers bankrolling Byrne's pricey Bigfoot expeditions across the Pacific Northwest and the Himalayas. On one such trip to Nepal in 1958, financed by Texas oilman Tom Slick, Byrne swiped a finger from the “Pangboche hand," the supposed mummified remains of a yeti, from a Buddhist monastery. With help from the actor Jimmy Stewart and his wife, Gloria, the finger was smuggled to the United Kingdom. (Scientists analyzed the finger's DNA in 2011. The results? Human.)
With Rines' backing, Byrne founded the Bigfoot Information Center and Exhibition in The Dalles, Oregon. By 1976, the center had logged 94 “credible" Bigfoot sightings, The New York Times reported at the time.
That same year, the newly released FBI documents show, Byrne wrote to the bureau asking if it would examine the hairs and tissue he was unable to identify. Surprisingly, the FBI agreed.
It turned out that the samples were “of deer family origin," the FBI said.
Byrne didn't give up. With a $1 million, five-year grant from Rines' Academy of Applied Science, Byrne started the Bigfoot Research Project, also in Oregon, in the early 1990s. The money from Rines allowed Byrne to hire two assistants “to help him launch the most high-tech monster search the world has ever seen," as the Chicago Tribune put it in 1995. Byrne even operated a toll-free number, 1-800-BIGFOOT, that callers could use to report possible Sasquatch sightings or unusually large footprints.
Rines “felt there were new animals to be discovered on the land, in the air and in the sea," Coleman said. “He felt deep down ... he wanted to support those efforts."
Byrne, who is 93, told The Washington Post last week he's actually never seen a Bigfoot. And Rines never recaptured that moment of joy and wonder when he believed he spotted Nessie on his vacation to Scotland in 1972. Rines died of heart failure at the age of 87. Toward the end of his life, he was convinced all Loch Ness monsters had perished, lamenting in interviews the creatures had gone extinct due to global warming.
Any future quest for the legendary beasts, he believed, would only turn up their bones.

Metropolitan Opera To Cut Back on Berlioz

Texto completo: This season, defying the predictions of some operagoers, the Metropolitan Opera managed to tame its technologically temperamental Robert Lepage production of Wagner's "Ring" cycle, and to largely quiet its mammoth set of rotating planks, designed by Carl Fillion.
So it was something of a surprise on Friday when, citing "unanticipated technical demands," the Met announced that it was pulling the plug on the revival of another video-heavy Lepage-Fillion production it had announced for next season: Berlioz's "La Damnation de Faust."
Instead of its planned run of seven staged performances of the "Faust," the Met now plans to give four concert performances of it between Jan. 25 and Feb. 8, featuring the same cast, led by the mezzo-soprano Elina Garanca, the bass Ildar Abdrazakov, with the tenors Bryan Hymel and Michael Spyres dividing the title role. It will be conducted by Edward Gardner.
In its announcement, the company said, "The decision to present Faust in its more usual concert version is driven by the unanticipated technical demands of reviving the Met's staged production, impossible to accommodate within the company's crowded production schedule."
When the production was new, officials said that it introduced "an unprecedented level of technological stagecraft to the house," relying on interactive video designed by the artist Holger Förterer that responded to the singers' movements and voices and showed grassy meadows and fiery hells. Those images were projected on a set of metal scaffolding and catwalks.
Also when it debuted, in 2008, Anthony Tommasini wrote in The New York Times that its video imagery was "stunning," even as he expressed reservations that the use of so much video flattened the scenic impact. But he added that to "judge from the rousing ovation Mr. Lepage received, this innovative production looks to be a popular success."
The Met said that it decided not to revive the production after officials realized that they would need to revamp some elements of it to meet newer industry safety standards, refurbish some of its automated mechanical systems, and update video projections that are more than a decade old.
In a way, the Met's decision to perform the "Faust" in a concert version is a return to the roots of the work: Berlioz described it as a "dramatic legend in four parts," and it was often performed in concert halls before directors later began to try to stage it.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Trump, China attack press

Texto completo: President condemnsU.S. media as Xi orders more news sites blocked
The news out of China over the weekend was bleak: Two more major international media companies - the London-based Guardian and The Washington Post - were added to the nation's "Great Firewall," blocked on the Internet to the country's 1.4 billion citizens as part of a crackdown on dissent by President Xi Jinping.
The ongoing fade-out of public information coincided with the 30th anniversary this month of the bloodshed of the Tiananmen Square protests, a free-speech demonstration that the Communist Party crushed with military force as the world watched in horror.
Meanwhile, in Washington, President Trump had a message: The Post, CNN and NBC were, he wrote on Twitter, "Fake and Corrupt News Media." The New York Times and CNN are "truly The Enemy of the People!" MSNBC, which he called "the opposition," was broadcasting "such lies, almost everything they were saying was the opposite of the truth."
"I know it is not at all 'Presidential' to hit back at the Corrupt Media, or people who work for the Corrupt Media, when they make false statements about me or the Trump Administration," Trump declared in another tweet. "Problem is, if you don't hit back, people believe the Fake News is true. So we'll hit back!"
Trump's tweetstorm against the press corps over the past three days, apparently sparked by his belief that he was not getting enough credit for an immigration deal with Mexico, was nothing new. The incendiary words were so routine that the president, after discounting a Times story on the deal as "false," took his motorcade to Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Va., for five hours of rest and relaxation.
But the president's hostility toward the press in the United States again stood as a striking companion to the antagonism that authoritarian regimes display toward the free flow of information. Trump's tweets came as an estimated 1 million people in Hong Kong took to the streets to protest a new extradition law announced by the Communist Party, fearing further erosion of the one-country, two-systems autonomy that has existed since the British returned control of the island to Beijing in 1997.
"The fact that the president is willing to attack the media so explicitly and so directly makes it harder to point out and to stand up for those attacks in other parts of the world, including China," said Jeffrey Prescott, executive director of National Security Action, a think tank formed by former Obama administration officials to counter Trump's foreign policy.
White House officials did not respond to a request for comment.
The president's silence on China's abuse of free speech and human rights follows his relatively weak reactions to other abuses around the world, including the killing of Washington Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the hands of Saudi Arabia. Trump said in February that he believed North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's claim that he did not have prior knowledge of the mistreatment of Otto Warmbier, an American college student who died days after being released, in a coma, from 17 months in captivity in 2017.
Trump also has not spoken publicly about the ethnic violence against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar or the mass incarceration of more than 1 million Uighur Muslims in "reeducation camps" in China - leaving the job of publicly condemning those actions to his subordinates, including Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
Last month, when two Reuters journalists were released after more than 500 days in government confinement in Myanmar over their reporting of the killing of the Rohingya, Pence and Pompeo hailed the news. A White House spokeswoman also released a statement. But Trump said not a word. The two journalists, who had been named with other journalists as Time magazine's "Person of the Year" in 2018, received the Pulitzer Prize for their work last month in New York.
The twin spectacles of Beijing clamping down on free speech and Trump ratcheting up his attacks on news organizations comes amid a growing trade war between the United States and China.
While the White House has sought to force Beijing to commit to new measures aimed at preventing theft of American trade secrets, the president has failed to go to bat for the Western media companies that are unable to do business in China.
Trump has given the signal to hawkish aides, including Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton, to get tougher with Beijing, noted Daniel Russel, who served as a high-ranking Asia policy official in the Obama administration.
"But there's no reason to believe that's reflective of what President Trump believes in, and we've seen in the past when deals could be made that suit Trump's purpose, including with respect to the most egregious human rights violator, Kim Jong Un, Trump does not hesitate to undercut his own advisers," said Russel, now a vice president at the Asia Society.

Texto completo: Rod Rosenstein predicts Attorney General William Barr's detractors who criticize him for his handling of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation may come around one day.
No stranger to controversy himself, the former deputy attorney general stressed to the New York Times that Barr made the right call when he determined there was insufficient evidence to initiate criminal prosecution against President Trump for obstruction of justice.
“A few years from now, after all of this is resolved, some of Barr’s critics might conclude that his approach was a reasonable way to navigate through a difficult situation,” he said.
A redacted version of the report Mueller's report laid out 10 instances in which Trump might have obstructed justice, but Mueller declined to make a determination on the matter, citing a Justice Department guideline that sitting presidents cannot be indicted. Mueller also did not find sufficient evidence to establish criminal conspiracy took place between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.
Before the report's release in April, Barr released a summary of its principal conclusions which said he and Rosenstein decided there was not sufficient evidence to establish an obstruction crime had occurred. Still, although Trump says he has been vindicated, Democrats argue Mueller's refusal to clear Trump on obstruction provides them a road map to continue to investigate and possibly seek impeachment.
In a CBS News interview last month, Barr contradicted the reasoning Mueller gave about why he did not make a determination on the question of whether Trump obstructed justice. “I personally felt he could’ve reached a decision," Barr said, adding that the special counsel “had his reasons for not doing it” but declined to explain. “I’m not going to, you know, argue about those reasons,” he said.
Rosenstein was the official who appointed Mueller to be special counsel in May 2017, after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey. Trump heavily criticized Rosenstein and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions because of the Russia investigation, which he called a "witch hunt."
But by the time Rosenstein left the Justice Department last month, he appeared to patch things up with the president and has been a vocal defender of Barr, who has become a target of Democrats amid a fight over access to materials and people related to the Mueller investigation.
Barr is now looking into the origins of the counterintelligence investigation into Trump's campaign, which began in the summer of 2016 and was wrapped into Mueller's inquiry, due to misconduct concerns by DOJ and FBI officials, including Comey, and has tasked U.S. Attorney John Durham with leading a review.
“He dives right into things,” Rosenstein said. “He doesn’t act like somebody who just arrived recently. He acts like someone who has been here all along for 30 years.”
Barr previously served a stint as attorney general in the early 1990s under former President George H.W. Bush.

The racial reckoning comes

Texto completo: When I was a boy I was taught a certain story about America. This was the land of opportunity. Immigrants came to this land and found an open field and a fair chance to pursue their dreams. In this story Benjamin Franklin could be held up as the quintessential American - the young hustler, who through his ingenuity and dogged self-improvement created new businesses and communities, a new sort of person and a new sort of country.
This was a unifying national story. When it dominated, politics was over which party could offer the most opportunity.
But that story has been challenged over the years, most compellingly by the people we used to call multiculturalists. The Ben Franklin story, they point out, doesn't include the Native American or African-American experience; it doesn't take into account the ways America has not really offered a fair chance to many of its people.
The multicultural story gradually began to rival the Ben Franklin story, especially in schools. Over the past two years it has almost entirely eclipsed it in many parts of our society.
I realized this while reading my friend and colleague Eric Liu's new book, "Become America." Eric's organization Citizen University hosts regular gatherings called "Civic Saturdays." These look like church or synagogue services, but the object of veneration is America. How can we tell our story? How can we be good citizens? What rituals embody our civic creed?
Eric gives sermons in the middle of these sessions, and the book is a collection of sermons delivered between November 2016 and August 2018 - nearly the first two years of the Trump era. The collection is like a penetrating time-lapse movie of the American mind over that period.
Eric is an enlightened Seattle progressive but with a reconciling, loving temperament. His hero is Abraham Lincoln and his goal is to heal a divided nation. In the early sermons, just after Donald Trump's victory, Eric is torn - he wants to empathize with Trump voters but also to judge them harshly. But, overall, the emphasis is on humbly understanding global populism.
Then come Charlottesville, the outrages at the southern border. As the months go by, Eric's attention turns more to race. Trump is no longer seen as a historic aberration, but the embodiment of white supremacy that has always been near the core of the American experience. He is the modern-day John Calhoun, just as mass incarceration is the modern-day Jim Crow.
Eric is not alone in his shift in emphasis. As Zach Goldberg points out in Tablet, over the past several years there has been a sharp shift in opinion, especially among white progressives, on all subjects racial. For most of the latter half of the 20th century, for example, about 10% of white liberals supported increased immigration; now it's 50%. As Goldberg writes, African-Americans are actually less progressive on these issues than white liberals.
Both Trumpists and their opponents have also de-emphasized the Ben Franklin narrative and embraced narratives that put race at the center. Trump's narrative is: We real Americans (white) have to protect our culture from the alien (brown) who would weaken it.
The opposing narrative is something like this: America began with a crime - stealing the land from Native Americans. It continued with an atrocity, slavery. The American story is the conflict between oppressors who seek to preserve white supremacy and people who seek to move beyond it. The essential American struggle is to confront the national sin, have a racial reckoning and then seek reconciliation.
"A religion provides a moral framework for choice and an ethical standard for action," Eric writes. Both these narratives have taken on the qualities of a civic religion.
As many writers have noted, in the progressive account, racism has the exact same structure as John Calvin's conception of original sin. It is a corrupting group inheritance, a shared guilt that pervades everything - it is in the structures of our society and the invisible crannies of our minds.
I don't know about you, but I walk into this next chapter of American life with a sense of hopefulness and yet great fear. America needs to have a moment of racial reconciliation. History has thrown this task upon us.
But we Americans are not at our best when we launch off on holy wars. Once you start assigning guilt to groups, rather than to individuals, bad, illiberal things are likely to happen. There's a lot of over-generalized group accusation in both these narratives.
I'm haunted by that sentence in Lincoln's second inaugural: "And the war came." Nobody wanted it, but it came. Eric's great contribution is to show how to mix conviction on racial matters with humility and gentleness. Moreover, he is always pushing toward an American creed that moves beyond both the white monoculture and the fracturing multiculturalism. He is always pushing toward a national story large enough to contain all the hybrid voices.
Somewhere in America a young artist is writing that story, that new vision that will serve as a beacon to draw us all onward.

Borscht belt rebirth

Texto completo: Don't look now, but we are in a Catskills moment, and this is no summer fling. This moment hopes to live long past Labor Day, powered by two new high-end neighbors that have put the region in the spotlight.
The gleaming $1.2 billion Resorts World Catskills casino just marked its first anniversary (with an appearance by Paul Anka), while the $200 million Kartrite Resort and Indoor Waterpark opened for business in April. Billed as the state's largest water park, the Kartrite has 11 slippery attractions powered by 318,000 gallons of water.
Both are in Sullivan County, New York's Monticello, the dollop of sour cream on the once-thriving Borscht Belt — which for generations was the summer getaway spot for greater New York Jews and stakes a valid claim to being the birthplace of contemporary American comedy.
But this Catskills moment is about more than slot machines and waterslides. And it is serious business for a chronically depressed region hoping to capture some of the old magic.
This latest Catskills moment mixes pop-culture and nostalgia in the age of streaming video, and a pioneering spirit that has artisans and entrepreneurs betting on the region's revival. Foodies have already begun to gravitate to the region's farm-to-table restaurants.
Call it "Borscht Belt 2.0" — soon to be all over Instagram.
'Maisel' tov The Emmy-winning Amazon series "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel" tipped its pill-box hat to the Catskills experience in its second season.
In three of its 10 episodes, Midge, played by Rachel Brosnahan, and her family take to the mountains for a month of bungalow life that managed to give the title character, a stand-up comedienne, a shot in the big room at the Catskills' biggest hotel, The Concord.
The wider media is taking note of this Catskills moment, too, with assignment editors sending staffers to check out this boutique hotel or that reimagined town.
Last November, The New York Times chronicled one resident's efforts to revive Mountain Dale, his hometown, by buying up dozens of buildings in the down-on-its-luck hamlet.
The travel website Lonely Planet last fall named the Catskills among its "Best in Travel 2019 Top Regions."
In its list of "10 regions that are ready for the spotlight," Lonely Planet placed the Catskills second only to Piedmont, Italy. That put the once-lowly Catskills ahead of northern Peru, the Red Centre of Australia, and the Scottish Highlands, among others.
Among the region's attractions, the site listed the Woodstock Festival 50th anniversary and "an influx of creative farm-to-table restaurants, bespoke breweries and distilleries, and a growing array of arts collectives."
This is all pretty heady company for the Catskills, whose fortunes plunged when the bottom fell out of the Borscht Belt beginning in the 1970s.
Documenting decay Photographer Marisa Scheinfeld, 38, grew up in Kiamesha Lake, just outside Monticello. One of her first jobs was to lifeguard at The Concord's outdoor pool in what would be its final summer.
She spent much of her childhood watching once-great hotels go under and the bungalow colonies that dotted the landscape shutter. Some were lost to fire; many were left to decay.
Scheinfeld, who now lives in Katonah in Westchester County, left to pursue a photography career, but she returned to the Catskills in 2010 to begin a five-year odyssey, part anthropological, part archaeological, to document what remained decades after the last summer visitors had departed.
Her 2016 book, The Borscht Belt: Revisiting the Remains of America's Jewish Vacationland," (Cornell University Press) captures ghostly images of leisure sites in such utter relaxation that nature has reclaimed them:
A lounge chair at Grossinger's indoor pool sits on a carpet of moss;
Dishes in the kitchen at the Nevele Grande Hotel in Ellenville are stacked, awaiting a dinner rush that will never arrive;
Coffee-counter stools in '50s green and chrome stand silent sentinel, their counter long-since removed.
"It's bittersweet, but it's part of that cycle where you have the Borscht Belt starting up in the '20s, booming in the '50s, declining in the '70s, '80s and '90s, technically, and largely stagnant since that," Scheinfeld said.
"People give the same reasons over and over for why the Borscht Belt died out: air-conditioning, suburbs, air travel, cruise industry; all these things, not just one," she said. "It had its day, it had its moment and that moment passed. Now you have this turning over."
Another Scheinfeld is covering that part of the story.
Jillian Scheinfeld, a New York-based freelance writer, was back in the Catskills this month, working on a magazine piece on the new Catskills. And she wasn't alone. Writers from New York magazine and Black Book magazine were there, too, writing about the long-sought renaissance.
"She said she was from the area and everyone was like 'That's so cool,'" Marisa Scheinfeld said. "Trust me, it was not cool to be from Monticello 20 years ago, but now people are like 'It's so awesome up here.'"
A new wave, and a wave of nostalgia Even at age 70, Phil Brown — now a Northeastern University professor of sociology and health sciences — is still a Catskills kid at heart, having spent summer after summer there. His parents owned Brown's Hotel Royal from 1946 to 1952 and labored for decades at several other hotels.
His mother, Sylvia, was a chef. His father was a maître d' who also ran coffee shops before joining a Monticello employment agency, filling the staffing needs of hotels across the Catskills.
Their son started as a busboy at 13 and worked in the Catskills every summer, through grad school: The Cherry Hill in Greenfield Park; Paul's Hotel in Swan Lake; the Nemerson; Brickman's in South Fallsburg; and the Karmel in Loch Sheldrake, now home to the famed Stage Door Manor theater camp.
Brown has written or edited three books on the region: "Catskill Culture: A Mountain Rat's Memories of the Great Jewish Resort Area" (1998); "In the Catskills: A Century of Jewish Experience in 'The Mountains'" (2002); and "Summer Haven: The Catskills, the Holocaust, and the Literary Imagination," which looked at the Catskills during the Holocaust and its immediate aftermath.
Wish you were here Brown also was key to the start of the Catskills Institute (at https://catskillsinstitute.northeastern.edu/), an annual gathering of academics, history buffs and nostalgic fans of the region created in 1995.
The Institute compiled an archive of ephemera, from menus and postcards to ratecards, a loving chronicle of the time when a big piece of Jewish-American culture and identity took up summer residence not far from Route 17 and within easy reach of even the slimmest wallets.
To stay at The Nemerson, which Brown called "a very fancy place" in South Fallsburg, for the July 4 weekend in 1969, you would have paid — a three-day minimum — from $18 to $33 a person. That price included three meals a day.
"The prices were low and there was something everybody could afford," Brown said.
The Catskills hotels pioneered the all-inclusive vacation, an idea that Caribbean resorts and cruise lines would later adopt to meet the expectations their clientele had developed in the Borscht Belt, Brown said.
The Catskills, he also explained, were a place where American Jews — denied access at many hotels — got to be Americanized while keeping their Jewish culture. The average Jew in the old country did not go on vacations, so the Catskills was part of the success, the upward mobility, Brown said.
Gone for good The new 18-story casino is on land once occupied by The Concord, the largest of the Catskills hotels until it closed in 1998. In its heyday, The Concord had more than 1,500 guest rooms and a main dining hall that could seat 3,000.
The casino boasts 332 suites and 100,000 square feet of gaming action, including an area catering specifically to Asian gaming. It has a spa and will, later this year, rechristen the Concord's famed golf course, redesigned by Rees Jones. (www.rwcatskills.com.)
A development that's a closer cousin to the Borscht Belt, Brown said, is one that speaks the same language: the rise of year-round Hasidic and ultra-Orthodox communities who bought aging and shuttered vacation properties.
Brown said he knows the Borscht Belt is gone for good.
"It spawned lots of books and movies and culture and the culinary culture and the comedy culture. That's a great a great slice of history," he said.

Podcast format suits 'Serial' host Sarah Koenig

Texto completo: After making three seasons of the popular "Serial" podcast, host Sarah Koenig is taking a break from the project while her company, Serial Productions, develops other podcasts.
"We're working on a possible fictionalized thing, and that's very exciting — something I haven't done before," Koenig said during a phone interview in advance of her June 10 appearance at Clowes Hall.
Koenig's investigative reporting made "Serial" a cultural sensation when it debuted in 2014 with a 12-episode look into the murder of Baltimore high school student Hae Min Lee.
The initial series collected a Peabody Award (a first for a podcast), and a second season that focused on the desertion of U.S. soldier Bowe Bergdahl earned a national Edward R. Murrow Award.
For long-form journalism, Koenig is the leading voice in podcasting. She said her life isn't drastically different than when she worked as a producer on public-radio series "This American Life" — the show that introduced "Serial" to radio listeners.
"At 'This American Life,' it was, 'Oh, you want to try this thing? Give it a whirl. We'll pay for it, and we'll give you as much time as you need,' " Koenig said. "It's not like I felt stifled before and now I have all this freedom. But it is a different level of being your own boss that's exciting."
There's also a level of celebrity that's arrived for Koenig, who was portrayed by Cecily Strong on an episode of "Saturday Night Live."
It's "surreal," Koenig said, to be approached for fan photos.
"Most of the time, I'm invisible," she said. "I'm only getting recognized if I go to a place for that purpose, where people are arriving because they are interested in 'Serial.' "
At Clowes Hall, Koenig will talk about her career as part of the "Listen Up" speaker series presented by WFYI Public Media.
Koenig shared behind-the-scenes details of "Serial" with IndyStar, and she talked about the public-radio legacy she upholds:
Taking risks in Cleveland Koenig said "Serial's" third season, devoted to day-to-day cases at the Justice Center Complex in Cleveland, was somewhat nerve-wracking in its execution.
"You're like, 'I know there are stories in here somewhere. It's my job to find them,' " Koenig said of the season, which debuted last September. "In one sense, it's very freeing and exciting. 'I could do anything!' It's up to me, and nothing is predetermined. On the other hand, it's totally scary. 'I have no idea if this is going to work. And I don't know how long it's going to take me to figure out if it's going to work.' There's no obvious moment of, 'A-ha, I got it.' "
How 'Serial' is made Although Koenig is known for expressing personal thoughts in the context of her reporting, the New York native said "Serial" is built upon recorded interviews that dictate what she says.
"Writing should service the tape, and not the other way around," she said. "I think of it as my writing servicing and making the most of the tape I have."
Koenig said an episode's structure relies on interviews and field recordings.
"The last thing I'm doing is writing," she said. "We're going straight to the tape first. I read the logs of all my tape, then I go in and pull the tape I want. Then cut down those bits to the length and size I want. I'm messing with the tape like that all the way to the last minute."
Finding her voice Koenig credits "This American Life" for providing a "massive leg up" for her podcasting career. "I started with the biggest advantage anyone could have: I had all of 'This American Life' behind me," she said.
Serial Productions is co-owned by Koenig, former "This American Life" senior producer Julie Snyder and "This American Life" host Ira Glass.
Speaking to IndyStar from the Chicago offices of "This American Life," Koenig said her on-air cadence and tone — a semi-informal, first-person narration labeled as "NPR Voice" by The New York Times — is influenced by Glass.
"Everyone here has learned to do radio from Ira Glass," Koenig said. "He sounds a certain way, and he makes stories a certain way. It's undeniable that the product that comes from all of us owes a debt, for good or evil, to that source."

$3.9M FOR SUFFERING; State settled suit with Central Park Five in 2016; EXCLUSIVE

Texto completo: The Central Park Five, two years after collecting a $41 million wrongful conviction payout from the city, quietly pocketed another $3.9 million in a 2016 settlement with the state, the Daily News has learned.
The low-key state Court of Claims payout covered the economic and emotional devastation caused by the incarceration of the five men, who were just teens when they began serving between six and 13 years in prison. Their convictions in the 1989 rape and savage assault on a Central Park jogger were later overturned.
"I understand people say it's a lot of money. The reality is there's no amount of money that would adequately compensate them," said Jonathan Moore, one of the attorneys in both settlements.
"They've suffered every day since 1989 and they're still suffering."
The state compensation provided plaintiffs Raymond Santana with $500,000 and Antron McCray with $600,000, while former co-defendants Yusef Salaam and Kevin Richardson received $650,000 each. Korey Wise, who served the most jail time, walked away with $1.5 million. His time behind bars was roughly double the other four men exonerated in the prosecution that spawned both the new fictionalized Netflix series "When They See Us" and a renewed interest in the case.
A spokesman for the state court system said the case was settled on the record during a Sept. 13, 2016, hearing before Judge Alan Marin. Calls to the five plaintiffs for comment were not returned.
A spokeswoman for Attorney General Letitia James confirmed the case was settled but declined comment.
The Central Park Five sought $52 million in their lawsuit against the state, the Daily News exclusively reported in 2014. A former law enforcement source familiar with the case emphasized that under New York's wrongful conviction statute, the five would be required to prove their innocence if the Claims case ever went to trial.
The men were exonerated in 2002 when rapist Matias Reyes confessed to the attack, with DNA evidence confirming his claim. The Netflix production, directed by Ava DuVernay, put the racially charged case back in the headlines a full 30 years after the arrests.
Ex-head Manhattan sex crimes prosecutor Linda Fairstein resigned Tuesday from her positions with Vassar College and the board of directors at the God's Love We Deliver charity and the Safe Horizon nonprofit amid criticism about her handling of the case. The best-selling author and her publisher, Dutton, announced Friday that they were no longer in business together.
Fairstein is the author of 24 crime novels, with 16 New York Times best-sellers.
The longtime prosecutor was portrayed in the fictionalized television series as intent on a guilty verdict, even in the face of evidence that the defendants were innocent.
The CP5s Court of Claims case was reactivated after the city settled its wrongful conviction suit with the quintet. Lawyers from then-Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office had argued the case could not proceed until the city lifted a confidentiality order on the evidence in the criminal case.
Schneiderman later changed his position, said Karen Dippold, an attorney for four of the five men.
"It was settled because the attorney general's office changed positions and decided they'd rather continue than wait for all this paperwork to become available," Dippold said.
Calls to two other attorneys who handled the Claims case were not returned.
Plaintiffs' attorney Moore, noting the defendants were as young as 14 when arrested, said no amount of money can repair their ruptured lives.
"Every day Antron McCray wakes up in fear someone is going to come take away," he said. "Every day Kevin Richardson feels that pain of being in prison. Every day. The same is true of all those men. Is it too much? I don't think so."

Texto completo: The 151st running of the Belmont Stakes will signify the end of a bizarre Triple Crown season in which Maximum Security was disqualified as the winner of the Kentucky Derby for interference; the horse who was awarded the victory, Country House, skipped the second leg; and a riderless horse, not the winner, War of Will, dominated headlines in the Preakness Stakes.
On Saturday, War of Will, the only horse in the field to compete in all three Triple Crown races, will be trying to become the 12th horse to win the Preakness and the Belmont after being defeated in the Kentucky Derby since the Triple Crown became widely recognized in 1930.
The Belmont horses are listed in order of post position, with comments by Joe Drape and Melissa Hoppert of The New York Times. The morning-line odds were set by David Aragona of the New York Racing Association.
Purse: $ 1.5 million guaranteed Distance: One and a half miles
Track record: 2:24 (Secretariat, 1973) Weight: 126 pounds
Post time: Saturday at 6:37 p.m. Eastern
How to watch: NBC has the broadcast, beginning at 4. NBC Sports Network coverage runs beforehand from 2:30 to 4.
Coverage will also be streamed on NBC Sports Live.
Our Picks
Joe Drape's win-place-show picks: Tacitus, Intrepid Heart, War of Will
Melissa Hoppert's picks: Tacitus, War of Will, Sir Winston
Here's how we see the field:
1. Joevia
Trainer: Greg Sacco Jockey: Jose Lezcano Odds: 30-1
Drape: This colt offers some early zip, but can he carry it a mile and a half?
Hoppert: A win in the Long Branch at Monmouth his last time out does little to inspire confidence.
2. Everfast
Trainer: Dale Romans Jockey: Luis Saez Odds: 12-1
Drape: He won his first race and has lost 10 since. He did finish second in the Preakness at 29-1.
Hoppert: With Joel Rosario aboard, he had a perfect inside trip in the Preakness, and he now picks up Maximum's Security jockey, Luis Saez, in the Belmont. But lightning won't strike twice.
3. Master Fencer
Trainer: Koichi Tsunoda Jockey: Julien Leparoux Odds: 8-1
Drape: Bred and based in Japan, this colt has plenty of frequent-flier miles but needs to get better in a hurry to have an effect here.
Hoppert: He impressed in the Derby, mounting a furious late rally to place sixth, but he took an awkward step in a recent workout, which is not the best omen ahead of a marathon race.
4. Tax
Trainer: Danny Gargan Jockey: Irad Ortiz Jr. Odds: 15-1
Drape: This gelding did not like the sloppy track in the Kentucky Derby and finished way, way up the track. He is better than that.
Hoppert: The 14th-place Derby finisher has a top jockey who knows his way around this track and a grinding style that could help him hit the board.
5. Bourbon War
Trainer: Mark Hennig Jockey: Mike Smith Odds: 12-1
Drape: This closer finished eighth in the Preakness; coming from behind is tough to do at this marathon distance.
Hoppert: He sheds the blinkers that were added for the Preakness and picks up Mike Smith as his rider. Will he finally live up to his potential? Add him to your exotics just in case.
6. Spinoff
Trainer: Todd Pletcher Jockey: Javier Castellano Odds: 15-1
Drape: Like Tax, this colt didn't take to the peanut-butter surface on Derby day, so his trainer is rightfully giving him another shot. A maybe horse.
Hoppert: The 18th-place Derby finisher is working well and has a trainer who knows how to win this race, but his pedigree suggests he may be better suited to shorter distances.
7. Sir Winston
Trainer: Mark Casse Jockey: Joel Rosario Odds: 12-1
Drape: He earned a spot here with an impressive runner-up finish in the Peter Pan over this track.
Hoppert: Rosario was able to coax a lot out of this colt in the Peter Pan, unleashing his powerful closing kick. He's been training well since then and has the pedigree to win. A viable upset pick.
8. Intrepid Heart
Trainer: Todd Pletcher Jockey: John Velazquez Odds: 10-1
Drape: The third-place finisher in the Peter Pan has only raced three times, but each was better than the last. He has upset potential.
Hoppert: He's a son of Tapit, who has produced three of the last five Belmont winners, and a half brother to Commissioner, who was second in 2014. His pedigree aside, he did not impress his last time out.
9. War of Will
Trainer: Mark Casse Jockey: Tyler Gaffalione Odds: 2-1
Drape: This colt is as tough and gritty as they come. He's the one for Tacitus to beat.
Hoppert: Finally, a clean trip in the Preakness allowed this colt to live up to his huge potential. He's also the only horse in the field to run in all three Triple Crown races, which surely will take a toll.
10. Tacitus
Trainer: Bill Mott Jockey: Jose Ortiz Odds: 9-5
Drape: This striking gray colt had a troubled trip in the Derby but still placed third. He's rested and working well.
Hoppert: This versatile colt is also a son of Tapit, and his dam is a champion mare who has won at longer distances. Plus, he has two New York stalwarts on his side in Bill Mott and Jose Ortiz. He's also fresher than War of Will, so he has my vote in what looks to be a two-horse race.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - Rob Hiaasen, a beloved editor killed during an attack on his newsroom last year in Annapolis, was honored Tuesday for his work with a generation of young journalists.
Hiaasen was posthumously awarded the Richard M. Clurman Award, which recognizes extraordinary efforts to encourage and nurture young journalists, during a luncheon in New York.
Maria Hiaasen, the veteran journalist's widow, accepted the award during the annual Livingston Awards Lunch.
"I can't help but think that things that made Rob a great editor made him a great husband, father, friend," she said.
Hiaasen was an assistant editor and columnist at The Capital in Annapolis and a lecturer at the University of Maryland Philip Merrill College of Journalism. On June 28, he was killed in a mass shooting in the newsroom, along with Gerald Fischman, John McNamara, Rebecca Smith and Wendi Winters. It was the deadliest attack on journalists in the United States on record.
Hiaasen talked about her husband's intelligence, and that he didn't feel a need to be the smartest person in the room. She talked about his empathy for others.
And she talked about his understanding of when to follow and when to break the rules - putting a lesbian couple on the front page of The Capital for Mothers Day to the consternation of some longtime readers.
She was joined at the luncheon by members of her family, and several young journalists who worked with Hiaasen at The Capital as well as longtime colleagues from his time as a features reporter at The Baltimore Sun.
A highlight of the program was a video featuring some of those reporters and others talking about how Hiaasen encouraged and mentored them. They talked about his "dead words" list, and the time he spent talking about stories and the people in them.
"Those things he said to you he said to our kids and he meant them," Maria Hiaasen said.
Funded by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation and the University of Michigan to support a free and independent press, the Livingston awards bolster the work of young reporters, create the next generation of journalism leaders and mentors, and advance civic engagement around powerful storytelling.
Among those who attended the event were New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet; national judges Anna Quindlen, author; Ken Auletta of The New Yorker; and Bret Stephens of The New York Times; and Livingston Awards regional judge Stephen Henderson of WDET (Detroit) introduced the winners.
Other awards presented during the event included:
Lindsey Smith and Kate Wells of Michigan Radio and NPR won the local reporting prize for the podcast series "Believed," an account of U.S.A. Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar's arrest and the army of women - a detective, a prosecutor and survivors - who brought down the serial sex offender.
Chris Outcalt of The Atavist Magazine won the prize for national reporter for "Murder at the Alcatraz of the Rockies," a narrative of a prison murder committed under the gaze of security cameras.
Davey Alba of Buzzfeed News won the international prize for a sweeping investigation of Facebook's breakneck proliferation in the Philippines and how President Rodrigo Duterte's regime weaponized the social media platform
The award given to Hiaasen was named for Richard M. Clurman, a correspondent and editor at Time. He was a founding member of the Mollie Parnis Livingston Foundation board and after he died in 1996 the board created the award in his honor to memorialize his legacy.

Texto completo: Zion Williamson, the projected first pick in the June 20 NBA draft, has been invited to USA Basketball's August training camp as part of a 10-man team of players on the rise, and he could make the senior roster for the FIBA World Cup, the New York Times reported.
“We want to indoctrinate him in terms of USA Basketball,” USA Basketball executive Jerry Colangelo told the Times. “We want to give him a platform to see how he can compete with some of the vets that are going to be there. ”
If he made the team, Williamson would be the youngest player on the World Cup roster in 33 years.
Anthony Davis, who could be Williamson's teammate with the New Orleans Pelicans, James Harden, Donovan Mitchell and Kemba Walker have all reportedly committed to the World Cup team, which will compete in China from Aug. 31 to Sept. 15. San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich will lead the team for the first time, taking over for Duke’s Mike Krzyzewski.
The full roster for the training camp will be officially announced next week.

Texto completo: The Museum of Modern Art is slouching toward a shutdown starting June 15, in order to complete its latest expansion -- which is really an attempt to fix the last one. With the museum on the brink of change, the art and architecture critics of The New York Times took the occasion to revisit favorite (or famous) artworks, review shows not yet covered and consider the implications of the ghost in the machine -- the loss of the American Folk Art Museum, once next door but now part of the Modern's new footprint.
Over the next four months, the museum will cut six openings in its western wall to connect three floors of new galleries to existing ones, and will install the largest-ever display of its vast permanent collection, a feat that curators have been planning for years.
When the museum reopens on Oct. 21, after its $ 450 million overhaul, we are told it will be physically more comfortable, allow better traffic flow, offer free access to the ground floor and its new galleries, and add about 40,000 square feet for the permanent collection. But most important, the story of modernism as we know it -- linear and dominated by European male geniuses -- will be radically revised, expanded and rendered more inclusive.
In preparation for the closing, MoMA has already dismantled its permanent collection galleries on the fourth floor and slightly reconfigured those on the fifth in a way that foreshadows some changes to come. Assessing what remains on view, like tea leaves, provides a moment to think about MoMA's past, present and future, and above all the challenges it faces.
Even before you enter the fifth-floor galleries, there are gestures large and small to consider. In mid-April, with less than two months to shutdown, MoMA went to the trouble of installing Jennifer Bartlett's 1975-76 magnum opus, "Rhapsody," in the atrium. A preparator's nightmare in the form of 987 12-inch steel tiles that perfectly fit the long walls of that yawning space, this jubilant battle of artistic styles and mind-sets covers stark geometric abstraction, paint-by-numbers realism and everything in between. It looks ever more prescient and in some ways exemplifies the pluralism that MoMA needs to aim for in its next life.
A very small hint at the possibilities can be found near the fifth floor escalator, where "Abraham Lincoln, the Great Emancipator, Pardons a Sentry," by Horace Pippin, the great self-taught African-American painter, hangs beside "Christina's World," by the white realist painter Andrew Wyeth and one of the Modern's most popular paintings. This should bode well for the increased visibility and equal status of self-taught and folk artists, whose work had a big role in MoMA's early years. It's also time to end this sidelining of American art from before World War II. It should be mixed in with art from Europe and beyond.
The collection, as now installed in the fifth-floor galleries, is something of a stopgap measure, highly truncated, that starts with the standard hits of Post-Impressionism and Cubism and Matisse and ends with Jasper Johns's 1958 flag, becoming more inclusive in terms of nonwhite, nonmale artists as it proceeds. It is a snapshot of a collection in flux, looking at once full of possibility and a little forlorn.
In some places you'll see MoMA trying to bend its linear view of history toward the justice, and reality, of this more complex view. But it is going to take some doing.
You still sense the weight, the grip, the drag of modernist history on the place, wondering what will go, what will stay. Vincent van Gogh's "Starry Night," for example, which my colleague Jason Farago meditates on, will resume its prominent place in the collection's opening gallery, the museum says. Still, will there ever again be such a large gallery devoted entirely to Matisse's most radical paintings of the 1910s? Or to the founding of Cubism, which at MoMA is 90 percent Picasso? How about Monet's "Water Lilies," a longtime constant? Maybe. Somehow I think we'll manage without some of these genius-infused total immersions.
In the Modern's permanent collection, it is always revealing to check the time lapse between when a work was made and when the museum acquired it. For example, those worried that MoMA might slight Cubism should look to George Braque's small composition, "The Table (Still Life With Fan)" from 1910. It entered the collection in 2008, showing MoMA is still cultivating its central obsession. The painting is a perfect introduction to Analytic Cubism. It is possible to imagine that in the future fewer than 10 Cubist works will be up at one time; this little Braque should remain among them.
The absence of art by women in the first six galleries is breathtaking. The only exception to the unrelieved maleness is Sonia Delaunay-Terk's fiery 1915 "Portuguese Market," acquired in 1955.
In the collection's next iteration, a mixing of mediums has been promised and this may help the paucity of female artists: For example, according to its collection as listed online, MoMA has no painting by Marie Laurencin, but it has several of her prints and drawings that could be installed in the new order of things. MoMA owns nothing at all, as listed online, by Gabriele Münter, a talented German expressionist painter (and Kandinsky's companion). Perhaps MoMA might sell or trade some Picassos to acquire work by female artists from this crucial "heroic" period, perhaps the biggest challenge the museum faces. Blasphemous as selling Picassos may sound, it would not only create a better balance of the sexes but also adjust the scales in a collection heavily weighted toward Picasso. (MoMA lists 1,241 Picasso works online, compared to 385 by Matisse and 46 by Braque.) And selling Picassos would not be new. A catalog of deaccessions assembled by the artist Michael Asher, indicates MoMA sold 20 Picasso paintings between 1929 and 1998.
You don't see another painting by a woman until the seventh gallery, where the Russian Constructivist Varvara Stepanova's weirdly brushy yet angular "Figure" of 1921 (acquired in 1941) shares a corner with Sophie Tauber-Arp's abstract "Composition of Circles and Overlapping Angles" from 1930 (acquired 1983). And the display finally departs the European continent with "Colorhythm 1," by the Venezuelan artist Alejandro Otero, a 1955 painting on wood acquired with alacrity in 1956, and "Planes in Modulated Surface 4" by the Brazilian artist Lygia Clark. Her work in Formica and industrial paint on wood was made in 1957 but didn't reach MoMA until 1983.
In the final fifth-floor galleries, devoted primarily to painting from the 1950s and '60s, and Surrealism, the cavalcade of male innovation is disrupted by Lee Krasner, Helen Frankenthaler, Meret Oppenheim, Frida Kahlo and Louise Bourgeois along with recent acquisitions by artists of color like Norman Lewis and Beauford Delaney. Kazuo Shiraga, known for painting with his feet, is represented by a muscular, lava-like swoosh of red from 1964. Acquired this year, it makes Barnett Newman's robust Abstract Expressionist classic "Vir Heroicus Sublimis" look frail.
One of the most striking new sights in this area is "The Moon," an abstract landscape by the Brazilian modernist Tarsila do Amaral, from 1928 but decades ahead of its time and also acquired this year. Just outside the galleries, you can't miss Faith Ringgold's hair-raising "American People Series #20: Die" made in 1967, a year of widespread race riots in America. It was acquired a half-century after it was painted.
MoMA's imminent closing and reopening casts everything now on view in an unusual light. You can see the future bearing down on the museum's fabulous if blinkered past, which is about to be stretched and rearranged. The question of how profoundly and effectively this will be done should keep us on the edge of our seats all summer.

Texto completo: A group of Democratic senators wants top officials at the Federal Reserve to examine whether Deutsche Bank complied with anti-money-laundering and other laws after bank employees flagged transactions tied to President Trump as potentially suspicious.
The request, in a letter sent Thursday, was in response to a New York Times article that said specialists at Deutsche Bank had recommend that transactions by legal entities controlled by Mr. Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, be reported to a federal financial-crime regulator. Managers at the bank rejected their employees' advice and did not alert the government.
The letter to the Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, and John C. Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, called on the Fed to look into the transactions and whether the bank's handling of the matter adhered to anti-money-laundering laws. The Fed is one of the main regulators of Deutsche Bank's American operations.
"Only by conducting a thorough review of the full range of this activity can we better understand what happened in these cases; what practices, procedures, or personnel may need to be changed at the bank; and what regulators should do to ensure the Federal Reserve's ability effectively to monitor compliance with anti-money-laundering laws," the senators wrote.
Employees in Deutsche Bank's Jacksonville, Fla., office flagged the transactions in 2016 and 2017 -- during the presidential campaign and Mr. Trump's first year in office. The German lender was the only mainstream financial institution consistently willing to do business with Mr. Trump over the past two decades because of his repeated defaults.
The employees said the handling of the Trump and Kushner transactions had been part of a pattern of the bank's executives rejecting valid reports to protect relationships with lucrative clients. The bank had disputed that view.
The letter, sent by Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, also asks the Fed officials for information about their interactions with Deutsche Bank, including whether they have investigated the issues that several former bank employees raised in the Times article. In addition to Mr. Van Hollen, the letter was signed by six other Senate Democrats, including Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who is running for president, and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee.
"This is a test of the Fed's independence," Mr. Van Hollen said in an interview. "It would be gross negligence if they weren't investigating."
Representatives of the Fed and Deutsche Bank declined to comment. The bank has previously said it was cooperating with various government investigators.
Deutsche Bank has a history of run-ins with the Fed. Since the early 2000s, regulators at the central bank have repeatedly criticized Deutsche Bank for a range of problems, including inadequate risk management and sloppy financial accounting. Most recently, in May 2017, the Fed ordered Deutsche Bank to fix anti-money-laundering systems that had failed to stop billions of dollars of illicit transactions by wealthy Russians.
Congress has turned a close eye to the bank's longstanding relationship with Mr. Trump and his family. Deutsche Bank has dispensed a total of about $ 2.5 billion in loans to Mr. Trump's companies, and more than $ 300 million was outstanding when he was sworn in as president, making it by far his largest creditor.
Deutsche Bank "was very good and highly professional to deal with -- and if for any reason I didn't like them, I would have gone elsewhere," Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter last month.
In the House of Representatives, the Financial Services and Intelligence Committees have issued subpoenas to Deutsche Bank, demanding its records about the Trump family. Among other things, the subpoenas seek information about any "suspicious activity reports" that the bank prepared in connection with Mr. Trump's accounts.
Mr. Trump has sued to block Deutsche Bank and another bank, Capital One, from complying with the congressional subpoenas. A federal judge ruled against Mr. Trump last month. The case will most likely be heard by an appeals court this summer.
In the meantime, congressional investigators are preparing to interview former Deutsche Bank employees, including some who have voiced concerns about the bank's anti-money-laundering practices.

Texto completo: YouTube anunció este miércoles planes para eliminar miles de videos y canales que promueven el neonazismo, la supremacía blanca y otras ideologías intolerantes en un intento por limpiar el extremismo y el discurso de odio.
“Los videos que alegan que un grupo es superior para justificar la discriminación, la segregación o la exclusión (serán prohibidos)” , dijo la compañía en un comunicado.
La prohibición también borrará aquellas teorías de conspiración que afirmen que no ocurrieron hechos como el tiroteo en masa en la Escuela Primaria Sandy Hook en Connecticut.
“Es nuestra responsabilidad proteger eso y evitar que nuestra plataforma se use para incitar al odio, el hostigamiento, la discriminación y la violencia” , dijo la compañía en información primero reportada por The New York Times.
La decisión de YouTube, que es propiedad de Google, se suma las acciones de Facebook para rechazar mensajes de ese tipo y vetó a a siete de sus usuarios más controvertidos, incluido Alex Jones , el teórico de la conspiración y fundador de InfoWars, quien también fue vetado en Twitter.
El presidente Donald Trump ha defendido a quienes publican mensajes que abonan a la discriminación, asegurando que las compañías tecnológicas han sido injustas y apoyan a los izquierdistas.
Incluso la Casa Blanca tiene una iniciativa para evitar que eso siga ocurriendo, pero algunas redes sociales y plataformas avanzan en el desecho de mensajes, fotos, videos y otros productos que inciten al odio y cualquier tipo de discriminación.
La comunidad hispana ha sido una de las más afectadas por el incremento de estos grupos de odio, incluso una de esas organizaciones, “Identity Evropa” , organizó una protesta en el Consulado de México en Nueva York en contra de los inmigrantes el 30 de julio de 2018.

Texto completo: A pesar de que los indices delictivos en general han disminuido en la ciudad de Nueva York, un nuevo reporte asegura que los crímenes de odio han crecido en un 64% en comparación al mes de mayo de 2018.
La mayoría de estos casos han sido ataques antisemitas, este tipo de actos representan al menos el 60%, un 10% de los actos criminales han sido raciales, especificamente, a personas de descendencia afroamericana y otro 10% son ataques homofóbicos, el porcentaje restante representa otro tipo de actos criminales.
De acuerdo con las cifras del Departamento de Policía de la ciudad de Nueva York (NYPD) hasta la fecha se han registrado 184 crímenes de odio y durante el mismo periodo de 2018 fueron contabilizados 112 .
Por otra parte, las cifras de crímenes y actos violentos ha disminuido este año, registros indican que se han reportado 15 asesinatos menos, siete violaciones menos y 453 robos menos, destaca The New York Times.
Con el más reciente acto antisemita registrado en Williamsburg hace una semana, el gobernador de Nueva York Andrew Cuomo condenó todo tipo de acto violento y enfatizó que en vez de dividir, la ciudad permanecerá más unida para enfrentar el odio. El gobernador de la entidad le exigió a fuerzas especiales trabajar en estos delítos.
Asimismo, el alcalde Bill de Blasio anunció la creación de una nueva oficina dedicada a la prevención de este tipo de delitos, reporta The New York Times.

Texto completo: Criticizing his fellow justices' decision to block part of an Indiana law that banned abortion based on sex, race or disability, Clarence Thomas performed a public service: He brought two competing historical narratives into contact with each other, on an issue where ideological arguments often pass like trains in the night.
The Thomas argument, common inside the pro-life movement but startling to many, is that the present "reproductive rights" regime may effectively extend older eugenic efforts to reduce populations deemed unfit. His dissent cited the eugenic inclinations of progressive icons like Margaret Sanger, while pointing out that today's abortion rates are highest among populations - racial minorities and the disabled - that the older eugenicists hoped to cull.
This argument prompted multiple rejoinders. First, that many past progressives were racist but today's pro-choice progressivism isn't, and it is a "genetic fallacy" to link the two. Second, that the original eugenicists, Sanger included, did not usually favor abortion, so it's a mistake to connect their views to the pro-choice case. Third, that the original eugenicists wanted governments to practice "collective biosocial engineering," while the contemporary effects Thomas decries are the result of dispersed individual choices, a very different thing.
Now here is a rejoinder to these rejoinders. I agree it is far too simple to say, "Margaret Sanger was a Social Darwinist, therefore Planned Parenthood is eugenicist today." Instead it's useful to divide progressive reproductive policy into three historical stages, with attitudes changing substantially but older impulses lingering in each new dispensation.
The first stage is the eugenic period, defined by a starkly racist confidence in efforts to engineer a fitter species. In this era Sanger's emphasis on empowering women was a minor theme, subordinated to male dreams of racial engineering. And both the would-be engineers and the Sangerian feminists often opposed abortion, preferring eugenic means that did not require killing nascent human life.
This stage ended with the Second World War and revulsion against Nazi eugenics. Thereafter forced-sterilization policies lingered, but the broader progressive program shifted from genetic improvement to population control - with the promise that poorer communities and countries could be uplifted, not just culled, by reducing birthrates, and that such reductions would save the world from famine, plague and war.
This program was still male-dominated, but women's-rights arguments slowly became more important. There was less overt, but plenty of tacit, racism. Support for abortion increased for both feminist and population-controlling reasons, with the latter (and the racism) contributing to support for brutally authoritarian population policies in Africa and Asia.
The legalization of abortion in America happened in the transition from this second dispensation to the third, contemporary one, in which feminist arguments predominate and reproductive policy is understood primarily in terms of female liberty and general sexual emancipation. Which is why, in those 1970s debates over abortion, you can see both arguments at work - with what Ruth Bader Ginsburg once described as a desire to subsidize abortions for "populations that we don't want to have too many of" coexisting with her own rights-of-woman arguments.
In this transition the line between the two kinds of pro-choice arguments was blurrier than today's progressives like to acknowledge. But still, that was almost 50 years ago: Today, feminist arguments are clearly dominant, population-control arguments are in relative abeyance, and the pro-choice consensus officially abjures both racism and authoritarian eugenics.
However: In any other area, the left would look at a history like this and ask whether those formal convictions are the only thing that matters, or whether the eugenic past still exerts a structural influence on the present. And in any other area of policy, Thomas' point about how legal abortion appears, in the aggregate, to act in racist and eugenic ways would be taken as an indicator that something more than just emancipation is at work.
Yes, in their theoretical self-conception, pro-choice institutions are neutral custodians of the right to choose. In theory, the genetic-screening industry exists only to provide information. In theory, the high abortion rate in black America is just the result of countless individual decisions.
But in practice, liberal technocracy still has a "solve poverty by cutting birthrates" bias inherited from a population-panic age, and abortion-rights rhetoric still has a way of sliding into Malthusian fears about too many poor kids in foster care. In practice, the medical system strongly encourages abortion in response to disability, with predictable results. In practice, Planned Parenthood clinics are in the abortion, not the adoption business - and the disparate impact of abortion on black birthrates is shaped by that reality and others, not just by free choice.
None of this tells us whether abortion should be legal. That question still turns on the moral status of unborn life, the requirements of female equality. (Nor does any of this imply that social conservatives are paladins of racial justice.)
But the complicated history and the contemporary patterns are still important signposts - pointing toward a more skeptical view of progressivism's progress and away from the all-good-things-are-liberal-things take that many of Clarence Thomas' critics instinctively believe.

Texto completo: There was a shake-up in the digital division of Vice Media on Tuesday.
Jonathan Smith, a Vice veteran who had been the editor in chief of Vice.com for the last three years, was let go, along with the site's managing editor, Rachel Schallom. The company announced that Erika Allen, a Vice Magazine alumna who was most recently a senior editor at New York Magazine's The Cut, had been named the site's executive managing editor, and other editors took on expanded roles.
Katie Drummond, who was named Vice's senior vice president for digital in March after a stint as deputy editor at Medium, said she had been attracted by the possibility for growth.
"The appeal to me is very clear," she said in an interview Tuesday. "This is a brand that can be fearless, tell big stories, has a global reach, attracts emerging talent."
The company is indeed expanding, having posted listings for roughly a dozen additional editorial jobs, including a features editorial director, an opinion editor and an "authoritarianism reporter." Ms. Drummond added that the restructuring of Vice.com, with various editors heading up teams of reporters, meant there were no plans to name a new editor in chief of the site.
The changes are part of Vice Media's effort to become profitable after a rocky period during which the company laid off 10 percent of its staff and placed several Vice sites under the Vice.com umbrella.
Vice Media also recently announced that it had raised $ 250 million in debt funding from investors including the billionaire financier George Soros. The Walt Disney Company, which invested more than $ 400 million in Vice Media for a quarter of the company, said in a securities filings this year that it doesn't expect to get a return on that investment.
At one point, Vice Media was valued as much as $ 5.7 billion, and its chief executive, Nancy Dubuc, said late last year that it would be profitable by the next fiscal year, but its fortunes have fallen as internet giants continue to gobble up the bulk of online ad revenue.
Vice Media has also tried to improve its workplace culture since a New York Times investigation in December 2017 reported mistreatment of women at the company, with more than two dozen employees saying they experienced or witnessed sexual misconduct there.
Vice has lately focused on its studios division, which produces video content for streaming sites and its own cable channel, Viceland. Vice News and HBO also produce a weekly show, "Vice News Tonight."
Ms. Drummond said she saw the website having a symbiotic relationship with the other departments. She noted that Vice's reporting on the Fyre Festival, the woebegone Caribbean mega-concert two years ago, helped the company produce a popular documentary, "Fyre," that ran on Netflix.
"Everything complements everything," Ms. Drummond said.

Texto completo: Judith Jones, the legendary Knopf editor who died in 2017, is considered by many to be one of the forebears of modern American food culture. After publishing Julia Child's "Mastering the Art of French Cooking" in 1961, she spent the next 50-plus years nurturing the likes of Marcella Hazan, Irene Kuo, James Beard, Claudia Roden, Madhur Jaffrey, Joan Nathan, Marion Cunningham, Lidia Bastianich, Edna Lewis and many others.
Most often celebrated for helping to open the doors of dinner table diplomacy, Jones published authors - many women and people of color - whose books translated foreign cuisines for an American audience. But her work with American food - namely a series of cookbooks collectively devoted to exploring the breadth of American foodways for American readers - is often overlooked. With Knopf's rerelease of Edna Lewis's 1988 "In Pursuit of Flavor" though, this may finally be poised to change.
The reissue of "In Pursuit" is the first glimpse into a larger project of mining and highlighting Knopf's culinary backlist by republishing select titles. Senior Editor Lexy Bloom calls Knopf's culinary backlist an "incredible treasure trove, with some beloved classics and some that have been forgotten about." Leading with "In Pursuit of Flavor," as attention to Lewis has reached something of a fever pitch, is a bid to capture a new audience: In recent years, she has been featured on a U.S. Postal Service stamp, in the New York Times Magazine, at the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture, and on Bravo's "Top Chef." In 2018, I published a book of essays by food world luminaries devoted to examining and celebrating her legacy.
While Knopf's project of reviving cookbooks isn't explicitly a celebration of Jones's work and vision, Bloom says unequivocally, "There's no culinary backlist at Knopf without Judith Jones." And indeed, while Knopf co-founder Alfred A. Knopf was interested in all things gourmand, it wasn't until Jones published Child's "Mastering" that Knopf became synonymous with excellence in cookbooks. For the decade after, Jones sought authors who could do for their own native cuisines what Child had done for French food. Jones's work, at the time, reflected a sensibility then common among the American elite: that food from elsewhere - especially from France - was far superior to that of the United States.
In the early 1970s, though, Jones's interest shifted to American food, when she would sometimes accompany her husband, writer Evan Jones, as he reported around the country for Gourmet, and assist him with the research for his 1975 "American Food: The Gastronomic Story." While Lewis's "The Taste of Country Cooking" was Jones's first book devoted to an American regional cuisine, by the mid-1980s, Jones was taking a deep dive. In 1983, Jones, along with Knopf colleague Angus Cameron, co-authored "The L.L. Bean Game and Fish Cookbook" and in 1986, she published Jane and Michael Stern's "Coast to Coast Cookbook: Real American Food."
Lewis's third book, "In Pursuit of Flavor," co-written with longtime food writer and editor Mary Goodbody, was a quiet lead-up to Jones's most ambitious, but least known, culinary project: Knopf Cooks American.
Through their research and travels, the Joneses had experienced distinct regional and ethnic foodways, and Judith Jones envisioned a series that would narrate those stories, book by book. Rux Martin, vice president at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, recalls visiting the Joneses at their home in northeastern Vermont in the late '80s. Judith Jones, who long had a knack for anticipating the pulse of American culture, "saw important voices emerging for what was going on in American food," Martin says.
Jones understood that, like a novel - including those by her quintessentially American authors John Updike and Anne Tyler - a cookbook can "give you a sense of a person and how they approach the world from his or her kitchen, and their particular world." Of Jones's approach, Martin says, "It was such an articulation of a cookbook as literature."
Knopf published the first titles in the series - "Biscuits, Spoonbread and Sweet Potato Pie" by North Carolina chef Bill Neal, and "Hot Links and Country Flavors: Sausages in American Regional Cooking" by San Francisco Bay area "Sausage King" Bruce Aidells and Danis Kelly - in 1990. Fourteen titles followed in quick succession between 1991 and 1997, celebrating the breadth of American culinary traditions. Jones commissioned writers to chronicle the Italian American community of Providence, R.I., and Jewish American cooking across the nation; barbecue, fruit preserves, the Florida Gulf Coast, and the crazy quilt of (pre-hipster) Brooklyn. She even reissued, verbatim, Helen Brown's timeless 1951 "West Coast Cook Book."
The final works of the series were "Easy Family Recipes from a Chinese-American Childhood" by Ken Hom, and a book on the vast influence of Latino culture on United States foodways entitled "Latin American Cooking Across the U.S.A." by the Cuban-born writer, historian and activist Himilce Novas and Rosemary Silva. In a bold move, Jones insisted the latter be published in both English and Spanish. Speaking of these final titles in a 2017 remembrance of Jones, culinary historian Anne Mendelson noted, "The mere fact that she was eager to champion stateside Latin American food as quintessential American food is extraordinary." Mendelson called the publication of Hom's book an "astonishing testimony to Judith's instinctive sense that nothing was more deeply, truly American than the cooking of immigrant families."
The series marked a critical evolution for an editor whose earlier culinary work seemed intended for well-heeled urban elites rather than diverse and workaday home cooks. Knopf Cooks American "defied the expectations of snobs," Mendelson said and surprised those who associated Jones with refinement and old-world traditions. In New York, as spending power rose and celebrity chef culture was beginning to emerge, these books were a rebuke; in the face of yuppie gentrification and so-called "fusion cuisine," Jones was mounting a case for multiculturalism. Only recently, two decades after the series' final titles were published, Jones's quiet cause has finally reached the forefront of American food culture and media.
Despite their critical importance, many of the Knopf Cooks American books didn't sell well. Martin insists, though, that that should in no way detract from their importance. "She was a seer," she says of Jones. "From Anne Frank to Julia Child, Bill Neal to Irene Kuo, she only published books that made a contribution. And she made it look effortless. That was Judith. That was how she inspired us and continues to."

Trump's tariff plan ignores root causes of migration

Texto completo: Last week, at a migrant shelter in Reynosa, Mexico, I met families from Ukraine, Eritrea, Cuba and Venezuela seeking asylum in the U.S. I was traveling the U.S.-Mexico border, working on a global migration project with photographer John Stanmeyer for National Geographic.
On Thursday, President Donald Trump threatened, via Twitter, to impose a 5% tariff on all goods coming from Mexico starting June 10, "until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico, and into our Country, STOP." In a presidential statement, he further explained that "if the crisis persists" he will raise the tariff by an additional 5% each month for four months.
When I heard this news, my mind instantly jumped to those innocent families that I had met in Reynosa - because it's clear what he means by "if the crisis persists." He's talking about the incoming undocumented immigrants from Mexico whom he has tried to cast as criminals ever since he referred to them as "rapists" on the campaign trail.
It makes sense that a president who has constantly insulted the character and nature of people who are simply looking to find a better life would have no understanding of global migration and the forces that prompt it. Instead of working to address real crises - like climate change - that drive migration, Trump is threatening to punish Mexico.
If Mexico complies with Trump's demands, migrants and asylum seekers in particular could face increasingly inhumane treatment. In the case that Mexico does nothing, or retaliates with additional tariffs, U.S. and Mexican citizens will bear the brunt of the grave economic consequences. According to the New York Times, Mexico sent the U.S. $346.5 billion of goods last year and 5% in tariffs would amount to more than $17 billion - a burden that will most likely be passed on to businesses and consumers.
By singling out Mexico for punishment, Trump fails to recognize the truly global reality of migration. Last week, when I was interviewing migrant families from Eritrea alongside those from Venezuela, Honduras and El Salvador, they described the complex political and environmental factors that drove them to seek asylum in the U.S. I wish Trump would listen to their stories rather than continuing to treat Mexico, our closest neighbor and trading partner, as if it were solely responsible for controlling global migration flows. - (CNN)

The First Amendment isn't a weapon, so stop calling it one

Texto completo: From the sensationalization of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing last September, to last month’s media frenzy over potential challenges to Roe v. Wade and new statewide abortion bans, the public has become increasingly fixated on the role the Supreme Court plays in politics.
This public fascination with the judicial branch follows a larger trend of liberal skepticism regarding the Supreme Court’s alleged “weaponization” of the First Amendment. Liberals cite the rulings in Janus v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, and National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra to argue that under Chief Justice John Roberts, the Supreme Court has manipulated the First Amendment to fight liberal policy.
They see the Supreme Court’s rulings as an attempt to circumvent legislation that protects public sector unions, LGBT individuals, and the right to an abortion in favor of more conservative policy goals. For example, a 2018 New York Times article entitled “How Conservatives Weaponized the First Amendment” described the court’s alleged elevation of "conservative speech" and suppression of "liberal speech."
But you can't “weaponize” a fundamental right. The Constitution and the Bill of Rights were written under the premise that individual rights precede government, not the other way around.
The Masterpiece Cakeshop case didn’t create an affirmative right to discriminate against LGBT couples, it upheld an individual’s right to be free from compelled speech, and asserted that the government cannot constitutionally show hostility toward particular religions. Similarly, NIFLA v. Becerra didn’t restrict a woman’s right to an abortion, it prevented the government from compelling private businesses to display political speech they fervently disagree with. And Janus didn’t, as liberal Justice Elena Kagan dissented, allow “black-robed rulers [to override] citizens’ choices,” it protected an individual’s right to not engage in political activity with which he does not agree. These rulings merely gave credence to our country’s unique reverence for freedom of conscience, and actually enforced the First Amendment.
Although a basic reading of the Constitution should make these rulings glaringly self-evident, the debate surrounding First Amendment jurisprudence has become so politicized that many people don’t see them as such. Even though these cases were decided nearly a year ago, the media hasn’t stopped criticizing the Roberts’ court’s alleged contortion of the Constitution for nefarious ends. Unfortunately, partisans now view First Amendment cases as wins and losses in a zero-sum game of constitutional baseball.
This isn’t how it should be: The First Amendment is an apolitical, fundamental freedom from government interference. This means that an individual's free speech rights shouldn't ever fall victim to political squabbles and partisan interests. The First Amendment shouldn't be a weapon of the Left, the Right or any political faction.
Speech is intrinsically valuable in and of itself, regardless of which interest groups its protection threatens. Without a robust marketplace of ideas, we throw away the cornerstone of our American exceptionalism: the liberty to disagree with other people’s ideas.
Politically motivated interest groups and politicians argue that we must interpret the First Amendment in partisan terms, which has led many to believe that free expression is only valuable when it favors a particular political agenda. However, if you want to adopt a limited speech system that caves to popular will, you run the risk of losing it all when the pendulum swings toward the other party. The Supreme Court was specifically designed to be insulated from public opinion precisely to avoid this danger.
That’s why the Supreme Court’s protection of free speech isn’t “weaponization.” If anything, it’s the opposite, because it protects people of all political stripes.
Interest groups and liberal activists have fogged the lens through which we analyze the Constitution, and attempted to brush aside fundamental rights as mere inconveniences that stand in the way of political priorities. Yet our country’s robust protection of free speech is what makes America so exceptional — and we must never take that for granted.

Texto completo: The Republican Party is headed for trouble at the ballot box. At least, that’s according to New York Times columnist David Brooks, whose bold new column warns of a “millennial apocalypse,” and challenges the GOP to get with young voters or get tossed out of office. He writes:
To put it bluntly, young adults hate [Republicans]. In 2018, voters under 30 supported Democratic House candidates over Republican ones by an astounding 67 percent to 32 percent. A 2018 Pew survey found that 59 percent of millennial voters identify as Democrats or lean Democratic, while only 32 percent identify as Republicans or lean Republican.
Brooks’ rhetoric is a tad alarmist, but the general narrative rings true. The conservative movement must do more to compete for young voters, and to start, this means rethinking the GOP’s approach to racial issues.
Millennials are the most racially diverse generation in history. The generation after millennials, Generation Z, will be the first majority-minority generation, and together, the two voting blocs will have massive political influence. And most young people of all racial demographics prioritize diversity, not just minorities. As Brooks notes, “Seventy-nine percent of millennials think immigration is good for America. Sixty-one percent think racial diversity is good for America.”
Conservatives ought to agree in principle — we support equality under the law, and believe that American identity is rooted in shared values, not shared skin color. But due to a combination of bad-faith media smears and irresponsible rhetoric by some high-profile Republicans, many young people see the GOP as a racist party. Comments like Iowa Rep. Steve King’s reference to immigrants as “dirt” and President Trump’s dismissal of immigration from “shithole countries” unfairly paint all Republicans in a negative light.
The GOP can change this by shifting its messaging on immigration. Trump and his allies are absolutely right that there’s a crisis on our southern border, as top immigration officials have warned that the situation is reaching a “breaking point” amid massive, unsustainable levels of asylum seekers and illegal border crossings. Republicans are right to want to stem this flow, by building wall segments and increasing the number of immigration judges working to process asylum claims.
So we can’t allow critics to paint all conservatives as anti-immigrant, when in reality, we simply seek to curb uncontrolled illegal immigration. But Republicans feed into this narrative when they embrace foolish policies that limit legal immigration, such as the RAISE Act, a bill with Trump’s backing that would slash legal immigration rates by nearly 50%.
Antagonism toward legal immigration isn’t in line with conservative principles. After all, the GOP is the party of economic growth, and legal immigrants contribute nearly $2 trillion to the economy each year. Additionally, high-skilled immigration sparks innovation, and legal immigrants are actually less likely than native-born Americans to commit crimes. Given such ample evidence, young people are not going to support a party that’s seen as against immigration altogether.
Republicans also need to make it clear to young people that the Democratic Party isn’t the only party that cares about minority communities.
To do this, they should follow the example of Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis who won his election with a relatively impressive 15% of black voters — against an African American Democrat endorsed by former President Barack Obama — and nearly 45% of Hispanic voters. DeSantis achieved this by campaigning on school choice, which have helped minority students in Florida escape failing public schools. He achieved this while also taking a strong position on border security, even wading into controversial territory with a bizarre TV ad “building the wall” with his toddler.
DeSantis’ success shows that the GOP should put more emphasis at the national level on expanding school programs that overwhelming help minority students, while also supporting legal immigrants. If Republicans can manage that, then the supposed “millennial apocalypse” might never materialize.

Texto completo: Uno de los crímenes más horrendos en la historia de Central Park se convirtió además en una de las mayores vergüenzas en la historia judicial de Nueva York, cuando cinco adolescentes negros –incluyendo un hispano- fueron enviados a la cárcel por error.
En medio de la euforia, muchos neoyorquinos, incluyendo a Donald Trump, incluso pidieron “restaurar la pena de muerte” para ellos, recordó The New York Times.
Es la infame historia de injusticia conocida como “The Central Pak Five” (“Los 5 de Central Park”), “un recordatorio del tipo de ciudad que fue Nueva York y, en cierto modo, todavía lo es”.
Todo comenzó el 19 de abril de 1989, cuando la banquera Trisha Meili casi murió cuando fue violada y golpeada salvajemente mientras corría en Central Park, a los 28 años de edad (su identidad no fue revelada hasta que publicó sus memorias en 2003, bajo el título “I Am the Central Park Jogger: A Story Of Hope and Possibility”).
Cinco adolescentes negros, de 14 a 16 años de edad, fueron condenados por el crimen de 1989: Korey Wise, Yusef Salaam, Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson y el boricua Raymond Santana.
Pasaron de 6 a 13 años en prisión. Finalmente sus condenas fueron anuladas en 2002, después de que otro boricua (Matías Reyes), que ya estaba en prisión por delitos similares, confesó el ataque y su ADN coincidió con la evidencia de la escena del crimen (tenía 18 años en 1989).
En 2003, los cinco jóvenes exonerados demandaron a la ciudad de Nueva York por la condena injusta. En 2014, la ciudad resolvió el caso y acordó pagarles $41 millones de dólares.
¿Por qué los cinco adolescentes fueron condenados?
Fueron arrestados por la policía después del ataque e interrogados detenidamente. En algún momento, confesaron. Más tarde se retractaron y dijeron que habían sido coaccionados para admitir su culpa. Los fiscales procedieron de todos modos.
Con evidencia física no concluyente, las declaraciones fueron una parte clave del caso de la fiscalía. También fueron condenados por la prensa y la opinión pública. The Times y otros medios se referían a ellos como una “manada de lobos”.
Trump publicó anuncios en los periódicos atacándolos y pidiendo la reactivación de la pena de muerte en Nueva York. Años después, mantuvo su postura.
En 2012 PBS produjo el documental “Los 5 de Central Park”, realizado por Ken Burns, David McMahon y Sarah Burns. Trump lo atacó vía Twitter en 2013: “El documental de Central Park Five fue un pedazo de basura parcializado que no explicó los crímenes terroríficos de estos jóvenes mientras estaban en el parque”.
Después del acuerdo de 2014, Trump escribió en un artículo de opinión para Daily News: “Mi opinión sobre el arreglo del caso del Central Park Jogger es que es una desgracia. Un detective cercano al caso, y que lo ha seguido desde 1989, lo llama ‘el atraco del siglo'” (…) “La solución no significa inocencia”.
Trump no cambió el tono durante su carrera presidencial. “Admitieron que eran culpables”, dijo a CNN en 2016. “La policía que está haciendo la investigación original dice que fueron culpables. El hecho de que ese caso se resolviera con tanta evidencia en su contra es indignante”.
“Miro a Donald Trump y lo entiendo como una representación de un síntoma de Estados Unidos”, dijo recientemente Salaam, uno de los acusados, citado por Esquire. “Fuimos condenados por el color de nuestra piel. La gente pensaba lo peor de nosotros. Ellos crearon leyes de superpredadores debido a lo que sucedió. Y todo esto debido a neoyorquinos prominentes, especialmente Donald Trump”.
Siempre vigente
Jim Dwyer, columnista del Times, cubrió el caso durante años. Dijo que mostraba cómo el sistema de justicia penal podía ser “distorsionado por fuerzas como la raza, y cómo está formado por una atmósfera de miedo”.
Es un “ideal mítico que nuestras cortes y nuestro sistema de justicia penal puedan ser inmunizados o aislados de estas fuerzas”, dijo. Dwyer comentó además que cuando la ciudad resolvió el caso civil, no hubo admisión de irregularidades.
Zachary Carter, abogado de la ciudad, dijo en 2014: “Nuestra revisión del expediente sugiere que tanto los detectives investigadores como los fiscales de distrito asistentes involucrados en el caso actuaron de manera razonable”.
Esta historia nunca ha perdido vigencia, porque representa un patrón que se repite de injusticia, racismo, prejuicios y estereotipos en todo el país, incluso en una ciudad como Nueva York que presume de vanguardia, igualdad, civismo, mentalidad abierta y diversidad.
Apenas en la década siguiente, fueron varios los casos de detención injusta adjudicados al infame ex detective de NYPD Louis Scarcella. Algunos de los sentenciados han recuperado recientemente su libertad tras pagar por crímenes ajenos y otros aún luchan por revertir aquellas condenas.
Scarcella ha sido señalado de apresar a docenas de afroamericanos y latinos en Brooklyn en la década de 1990 por crímenes que no cometieron.
Más recientemente, las muertes de los afroamericanos Trayvon Martin (Florida 2012), Eric Garner (NYC 2014) y Sandra Bland (Texas 2015) también han despertado el debate de la discriminación racial por parte de la policía.
Ahora la historia de 1989 fue adaptada como una miniserie de cuatro partes que Netflix acaba de estrenar, llamada “When They See Us”, dirigida por Ava DuVernay. También es el tema de una ópera a debutar el 15 de junio en San Pedro (California), con música de Anthony Davis y libreto de Richard Wesley.

La gente pensaba lo peor de nosotros. Ellos crearon leyes de superpredadores debido a lo que sucedió. Y todo esto debido a neoyorquinos prominentes, especialmente Donald Trump”.
Siempre vigente
Jim Dwyer, columnista del Times, cubrió el caso durante años. Dijo que mostraba cómo el sistema de justicia penal podía ser “distorsionado por fuerzas como la raza, y cómo está formado por una atmósfera de miedo”.
Es un “ideal mítico que nuestras cortes y nuestro sistema de justicia penal puedan ser inmunizados o aislados de estas fuerzas”, dijo. Dwyer comentó además que cuando la ciudad resolvió el caso civil, no hubo admisión de irregularidades.
Zachary Carter, abogado de la ciudad, dijo en 2014: “Nuestra revisión del expediente sugiere que tanto los detectives investigadores como los fiscales de distrito asistentes involucrados en el caso actuaron de manera razonable”.
Esta historia nunca ha perdido vigencia, porque representa un patrón que se repite de injusticia, racismo, prejuicios y estereotipos en todo el país, incluso en una ciudad como Nueva York que presume de vanguardia, igualdad, civismo, mentalidad abierta y diversidad.
Apenas en la década siguiente, fueron varios los casos de detención injusta adjudicados al infame ex detective de NYPD Louis Scarcella. Algunos de los sentenciados han recuperado recientemente su libertad tras pagar por crímenes ajenos y otros aún luchan por revertir aquellas condenas.
Scarcella ha sido señalado de apresar a docenas de afroamericanos y latinos en Brooklyn en la década de 1990 por crímenes que no cometieron.
Más recientemente, las muertes de los afroamericanos Trayvon Martin (Florida 2012), Eric Garner (NYC 2014) y Sandra Bland (Texas 2015) también han despertado el debate de la discriminación racial por parte de la policía.
Ahora la historia de 1989 fue adaptada como una miniserie de cuatro partes que Netflix acaba de estrenar, llamada “When They See Us”, dirigida por Ava DuVernay. También es el tema de una ópera a debutar el 15 de junio en San Pedro (California), con música de Anthony Davis y libreto de Richard Wesley.

Los inmigrantes donan órganos pero no puede recibir trasplantes. Y es cuestión de vida o muerte

Texto completo: “Tú vas al hospital y puedes donar tus órganos aunque seas inmigrante” e indocumentado , se lamenta Abigail Martínez , pero “cuando tú eres inmigrante no te pueden dar un riñón, yo creo que es injusto ”.
Su marido, José Antonio Martínez, sufre desde hace cinco años una enfermedad renal, según informa la emisora NY1, y el tratamiento de diálisis al que lleva sometiéndose desde entonces ya no es suficiente .
“Su riñón ya se hizo muy pequeño, ya no le sirven los riñones”, explica su esposa, “no tenemos el dinero, no tenemos los fondos para que a él lo operen”.
Martínez necesita un trasplante de riñones para sobrevivir. Y no es el único. Según un estudio publicado en febrero de 2018, alrededor de 6,500 inmigrantes indocumentados en todo el país sufren una enfermedad renal grave, pero en la mayoría de estados sólo pueden ser tratado con diálisis en caso de emergencia.
Y casi nunca pueden recibir un trasplante de riñón (se han registrado casos en California), que es una opción más saludable para el paciente y menos costosa para el erario público que la diálisis. Además, añade el estudio, los inmigrantes indocumentados donan sus órganos en mayor cantidad de la que reclaman un trasplante.
No existe una regulación legal que impida a estos inmigrantes recibir trasplantes; el problema es que, sin seguro médico disponible, el precio es casi siempre inasumible. Y el seguro médico público sólo cubre la diálisis ordinaria (no de emergencia) en estados como Nueva York, California , Illinois y Washington DC (en el resto, sólo se puede realizar en situaciones de emergencia, pese a ser un tratamiento que se precisa periódicamente), pero casi nunca cubre el trasplante.
En 2015, por ejemplo, una clínica de Nueva York se negó a trasplantarle a una mujer con una enfermedad renal en fase terminal el riñón que le iba a donar su propio marido, al enterarse de que ambos eran indocumentados y, por tanto, el seguro público Medicare no cubriría la intervención.
Según informó entonces el diario Daily News, un trasplante costaba 106,000 dólares , mientras que la diálisis (dos veces a la semana de forma indefinida) cuesta 72,000 dólares al año (para toda la vida).
Es por ello que, pese a pagar sus impuestos en Estados Unidos, algunos afectados viajan a México a realizar el trasplante, aunque allí el precio sigue siendo muy alto (40,000 dólares en 2011, según el diario The New York Times) y requieren de préstamos.
El congresista estatal Félix Ortiz ha presentado en mayo una propuesta de ley para que el seguro médico público Medicaid cubra los trasplantes a aquellos pacientes que lleven al menos dos años bajo diálisis. Según ha relatado a NY1, hay al menos seis inmigrantes indocumentados que lo requieren. La misma propuesta ha sido planteada ante el Senado estatal por el congresista Gustavo Rivera.

Texto completo: NEW YORK – A couple of years back, inside the Yankee Stadium press box, Jack Curry made his pitch to David Cone.
"I would love to get inside the mind of a pitcher, you being that pitcher," Curry told Cone. "Tell us what it's like to be on the mound, when times are great and when times are dreary."
After about two minutes, Cone said: "I'm in," and a book was born.
"Full Count, The Education of a Pitcher" hit the New York Times' Best Sellers list last week and "this book would not be successful unless David delivered," Curry said of the insights and anecdotes culled from a 17-year big-league career that included five world championships.
"His honesty about how insecure pitchers can be, how much self-doubt they have out there on the mound, that really stands out to me," Curry said before a recent Red Sox-Yankees game.
"As successful as he was, there were probably moments in every start where he thought, 'Wow, am I going to get through this next inning?' "
Yet, the original book idea probably dates back 20 years, when Cone was pitching for the Yankees and Curry – an Emmy-winning YES Network analyst since 2010 – was covering the Yankees for the Times.
"When he'd talk to us after the game, there was always so much thought that went into the craft of pitching," Curry said. "Once we started working together at YES," where Cone serves as a game commentator, "that burst to the forefront even more."
Jersey strong The pinnacle of Curry's own baseball career is preserved in a laminated newspaper clip from the Jersey Journal:
"Jack Curry bounced a two-out single over third base in the bottom of the seventh inning to give the Hawks a come-from-behind-decision..."
Hudson Catholic wasn't in the midst of a memorable season, but any victory over rival St. Peter's Prep "was a big deal," Curry said of his "one shining moment" as an outfielder for the Jersey City high school.
As a freshman at Fordham University, Curry's thoughts about walking on to the baseball team ended after one practice, surveying the Rams' cast.
"I signed up for the school newspaper and the school radio station the next day," said Curry, a Bergen County resident for the past 27 years.
Around the same time Curry began at Fordham, Cone was in the low minor leagues of his hometown Kansas City Royals, recovering from a torn ACL in his left knee – one of his first major professional hurdles.
Working on the book with Cone, "he talked about some of his Midwest life lessons, and there's some overlap there," Curry said of his Jersey City upbringing.
"There's a toughness of growing up in New Jersey," Curry said. "It's okay to get knocked down in life and prove that you can get back up again."
An inside pitch "Full Count" opens with Cone having a conversation with himself, three outs shy of his perfect game in 1999.
Staring at his reflection in a clubhouse bathroom, "His first words were: 'You better not blow this,' " Curry said of Cone's internal chat. "I think that was indicative of who he was as a pitcher."
Over 300-plus pages, Cone recounts his youthful hardheadedness and the heartbreak of being traded by the Royals. Years later, he hated being dealt by the Mets but loved the idea of returning as a Yankee. There are stories about his interactions with the late George Steinbrenner that "the late '70s Yankees would never have gotten away with," Curry said. The authors go inside Cone's need for a catcher as a co-pilot, connecting with Joe Girardi and Gary Carter but struggling with Jorge Posada and explaining why.
"It started out as a pitching journey, and I think the more we dug in...it became a personal journey for him too," Curry said.

F.B.I. Is Said to Be Investigating College Admissions Practices at T.M. Landry

Texto completo: LAFAYETTE, La. -- T.M. Landry College Preparatory School, a private school in Louisiana that garnered national attention for helping underprivileged and minority students attend elite colleges, is under federal investigation over its college admissions practices after disclosures that it cut corners and doctored applications, according to multiple people contacted by the F.B.I.
The F.B.I. opened the inquiry after an investigation by The New York Times detailed instances of transcript fraud and physical and emotional abuse at the school.
______
"THE WEEKLY" TV SERIES PREMIERE FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES ON FX AND HULU
Watch a preview of "The Weekly," which debuts tonight. Multiple students at a small school in Louisiana accused the founder Michael Landry of abusing them and falsifying their transcripts. Mr. Landry denies the allegations and draws a line in a fiery speech.
______
In the fall, dozens of former students and teachers told The Times that T.M. Landry's founders, Michael and Tracey Landry, doctored school transcripts with fake grades, nonexistent school clubs and fictitious classes. They said the couple embroidered their college application recommendation letters with fabricated stories of hardship that played on negative racial stereotypes.
The report also prompted the Louisiana State Police to open a local law enforcement investigation into more than a dozen allegations of physical abuse at T.M. Landry. That investigation is continuing.
While the scope of the Justice Department investigation is not known, the F.B.I. has discussed T.M. Landry's college application practices as part of the inquiry, according to one person interviewed by federal investigators who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case is not public.
The inquiry comes against the backdrop of a wide-ranging admissions scandal this year, which exposed how ultra-wealthy families bribed officials and faked elaborate athletic credentials to get their children into desirable colleges.
Despite the vast differences, the cases underscore just how important and competitive college admissions have become.
The F.B.I. said it does not confirm or deny the existence of investigations and declined to comment. The Landrys did not respond to a request for comment.
The Landrys and T.M. Landry's board chairman, Greg Davis, have told parents and donors that they have done nothing wrong, and they are working to expand the school's enrollment and repair its reputation. The school has told investigators that it has lost scores of students after the Times article, and that its graduating class dwindled to four, from 16.
In February, the Landrys abruptly broke the school's lease and moved out of an old factory building after failing to meet fire safety codes. It now operates from a former skating rink, according to local news reports.
This spring, the school posted a solemn video on Facebook that showcased its remaining seniors, and the colleges that had admitted them: Emory University, Colgate University, Morehouse College, Bucknell University, St. John's University, Providence College, Clark Atlanta University, Spelman College, Spring Hill College, Tulane University and Howard University. The video was a far cry from those that went viral in recent years, filled with clips of students celebrating and crying with joy as they learned they had been accepted to Ivy League schools.
Mr. Davis has also played up the findings of a 23-page report that summarized an internal investigation into the allegations published in The Times. In letters to donors, Mr. Davis said the report, which was released in April, "validates the academic outcomes" of T.M. Landry students.
The New Orleans law firm that Mr. Davis hired to conduct the internal inquiry, Couhig Partners, worked with Paul Pastorek, a former state superintendent of schools, who described Mr. Davis as a personal friend in his glowing summary of the inquiry.
T.M. Landry "appears to have been a genuine incubator for success, particularly for self-reliant students willing to put faith in a nontraditional education model," Mr. Pastorek wrote.
"No school can be everything to every student, T.M. Landry included," he wrote.
But Couhig described its own work as incomplete. It did not receive requested information from law enforcement agencies regarding abuse allegations at the school, including police reports and witness statements quoted by The Times. And it did not obtain publicly available court documents showing that Mr. Landry pleaded guilty in 2012 to a count of battery and was sentenced to probation for beating a student.
Couhig interviewed five current students, two alumni, six staff members and the Landrys.
While the firm concluded that T.M. Landry was a nurturing place for students and that the Landrys were well intentioned, much of the report confirmed the Times's reporting, including instances of transcript fraud and an episode in which a child was placed in a trash can.
Couhig said that while it "did not uncover evidence of systemic fraud, some errors and discrepancies were apparent in records, as were apparent efforts to show the students in the best light possible."
The firm found an instance in which classes on students' transcripts did not match with their college applications, and another in which grades were incorrectly reported as A's instead of B's. The Landrys also reported on college applications that students had placed in the top 10 and 20 percent of their class, rankings that Mr. Landry essentially acknowledged were made up. One student's transcript showed all "advanced" courses that the Landrys later said should have been "honors;"; they blamed it on a clerical error. And of nine college recommendation letters reviewed by Couhig, seven contained "large or small portions of identical representations."
Mr. Landry and Mr. Pastorek said they would notify colleges that had received applications with discrepancies, according to the report.
The report concluded that the discrepancies appeared "largely insignificant, potentially unimportant to an admissions officer, and appear to be explained by mere sloppiness."
Asked about the disparities, however, "Tracey and Mike Landry sometimes provided explanations that were contradictory," the investigators wrote.
The couple did not agree on how they managed student transcripts. Ms. Landry said the school did not maintain them, but instead created and tailored them to suit a new school or a graduate, based on email exchanges between Mr. Landry and teachers or his own assessments.
Mr. Landry, however, told investigators that each student's transcript was stored in an online account. When he could not produce much documentation of such a system, Mr. Landry told Couhig that the school "has a software person" working on a new transcript portal.
When Mr. Landry was asked about an instance in which one student's grades were changed from B's to A's on the transcript submitted to colleges, he took responsibility for the discrepancy. He said that he entered the grades, and that "although he didn't want to admit it, he needed glasses but refused to see the doctor," the investigators wrote.
And the couple had differing explanations for the "substantially similar recommendation letters" used for multiple students. Ms. Landry said the letters had been shown to parents and students, who confirmed their accuracy. Mr. Landry said that the letters were not shown to parents or students, and that any similarities were a "mistake."
Asked about the abuse allegations made by students and teachers, Mr. Landry acknowledged his guilty plea in 2012 -- which he had denied to The Times -- but said it was for spanking a student. According to court records, Mr. Landry was accused of choking, slapping and slamming a 12-year-old boy onto the floor, and then putting his foot on the child's head. He is said to have dragged the student, made him kneel and forced him to eat rat feces.
In the investigation, Mr. Landry denied a 2017 case in which he was accused of choking and dragging a student and making him kneel. He acknowledged grabbing the student by his hoodie.
He admitted to placing a student in a trash can -- he was alleged to have done this to a student with disabilities -- but said it was part of an "Oscar the Grouch" game he played with students, rather than a punishment. He also said he had placed a student with special needs in a "large storage room" to calm him down, rather than to discipline him.
The internal investigation determined that "kneeling appears to have been normalized method of discipline or correction," but that the students and the Landrys denied that Mr. Landry ever became violent with students. In the investigation, Mr. Landry said that wall-sits and kneeling were used to motivate students and prepare them for the challenges of the real world. Mr. Landry defended yelling at students, saying "he believes that students liked being yelled at, because it helped them reach their goals."
Investigators said Mr. Landry had reformed a number of his educational practices and eliminated corporal punishment after the Times article was published.

Texto completo: "The plain truth," the author Jon Krakauer wrote, "is that I knew better, but went to Everest anyway."
It was 1996. Krakauer, a correspondent for Outside magazine, was to hike to Mount Everest's base camp and write a story for the publication. Instead, he met the guides who helped pioneer the commercial climbing business on the world's highest peak, and convinced the magazine to let him climb to the top. His editors obliged.
By the end of his trip, eight climbers had died during a storm. At the time, it was the deadliest attempted ascent on the mountain. Eleven people have died on Everest this year, due in large part to the vast contingent of unqualified and unguided alpinists who now flock to the mountain during climbing season, the very phenomenon Krakauer went to document.
Three years before his trip, life on Everest changed, but to understand that, you have to understand the mountain's history.
British climbers made early attempts to reach the peak on the northern side of the summit in Tibet in the early 20th century. George Mallory and Andrew Irvine were spotted within hundreds of feet of the top in 1924, but the two never returned to camp to relay whether they'd made it. Mallory's body was found in 1999. Irvine's remains missing.
Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa guide Tenzing Norgay made the first official ascent in 1953 on the mountain's southern side, in Nepal. The first Americans summited in 1963.
But amid the Cold War, access to the mountain was severely restricted. China closed the Tibetan portion of Everest from 1950 to 1980. Nepal for years did not allow foreigners into the country to climb Everest unless they were accompanied by scientists, and when it finally opened its border in 1985, it issued one Everest permit per season per route.
By the 1990s, international tensions had eased and more qualified alpinists began showing up at the mountain, hoping to gain access to climb.
"Everest, you could always get a permit, but you had to be sponsored by your country's climbing agency," said Todd Burleson, founder and president of guide service Alpine Ascents International. He's led two guided journeys to Everest's summit, and said aspiring climbers used to wait several years until their turn for a permit arrived.
"Up until about 1990, you'd take a group of the best climbers from your country to Everest and if one of those climbers got to the top, you were a national success," he said. "But during the '90s we learned a lot, and there were a lot of people who couldn't get on those groups who were very skilled. And then we started bringing them to the mountain."
Sensing opportunities for revenue and fresh off an economic modernization, China began granting more permits. Then Nepal liberalized the permitting process to keep up. Where fewer than 2,000 people attempted to climb the mountain in the 1980s, according to the Himalayan Database, nearly 4,000 have tried each of the past two decades.
"In 1993 the world changed completely," said Eric Simonson, director at International Mountain Guides and a multiple-time Everest summiteer.
Guiding agencies like Adventure Consultants and Mountain Madness, the subjects of Krakauer's 1997 book "Into Thin Air," began leading trips up Everest. Local Sherpas, who experienced mountaineers say are excellent climbers but sometimes unqualified guides, established companies that offered trips at less than half the cost, but not every agency did a thorough vetting of clients to see if they were physically capable of scaling Everest.
And so crowds arrived at the mountain as the services at base camp improved, aided by technology and more precise weather tracking that allowed climbers to reach the peak in more predictably safe conditions.
But the cluster of people on the mountain is dangerous, too, sometimes preventing swift evacuations and cramming climbers together on perilous slopes.
By 1996, one of the world's most remote locales was becoming a tourist attraction. Krakauer, an avid climber, arrived to tell that story.
He summited the mountain on May 10, then returned to a forward base camp. As he descended, the weather turned, and dozens of climbers from three groups were stuck in a traffic jam and exposed to a hurricane-strength storm. So many climbers assaulted the summit at once - even after delays in securing ropes along the treacherous "death zone" some 26,000 feet in the air - they couldn't turn around in a timely fashion and retreat for cover.
Eight climbers died, including three guides.
"The commercialized trips and the overcrowding were what caused the tragedy (in 1996)," Hillary, who died in 2008, told Time magazine in 2003. "It was inevitable. I've been forecasting a disaster of that nature for some time. And it will happen again."
Krakauer wrote a 17,000-word article about the tragedy for Outside, then turned it into a book that made The New York Times bestseller list and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. Sony bought its film rights nearly immediately after publication, and it was adapted into a TV movie ("Into Thin Air: Death on Everest") in 1997, and a feature film ("Everest") in 2015.
(Krakauer has criticized the 2015 movie for departing from actual events on the mountain. He told the Los Angeles Times it was "total bull." Director Baltasar Kormakur responded that his script was not based on the book.)
"I walked off of that mountain," said Burleson, who was awarded the American Alpine Club's most prestigious honor for his part in the 1996 rescue effort, "and I had phone calls from all over the world asking, 'Can I climb Everest? Can I climb Everest?' Before that, there were only a few of us and we knew what we were doing. But now everybody wanted to do it."
The new demand for Everest expeditions outpaced the supply, especially from the mostly Western guide agencies that had offered such services, said Alan Arnette, an Everest expert, summit coach and blogger.
Those firms typically took small groups, often no more than 10 clients, and brought along up to four guides with several more Sherpas, who help fasten ropes and haul gear. Since acclimatizing to Everest's elevation can take days, and the climbing is slow going, the average Everest quest takes close to two months and costs around $70,000.
Other guide agencies began leading larger trips at lower prices without requiring climbers to have certain requisite experience, experts say, and the mountain got even more crowded. And as more underqualified adventurers attempt to summit the peak, Everest was normalized as a tourist destination.
"If you have the money, you can go," Burleson said.

Reports of 'born alive' abortion scenario are rare

Texto completo: Abortion opponents across the country are pushing for new laws governing medical professionals who perform the procedure.
Alabama recently enacted what's considered to be the most restrictive abortion ban in the country, while Georgia and Louisiana have advanced bills that would ban the procedure after about six weeks.
In North Carolina, the bill under consideration isn't a ban but a new directive for medical professionals.
Modeled after the "Born Alive Abortion Survivors Act" introduced in the U.S. Senate, NC's Senate Bill 359 would require medical professionals to provide life-saving care specifically to infants who survive an abortion and to report instances of such births. Medical professionals and hospital employees who don't comply with the law could face felony charges, prison time and up to $250,000 in fines.
The GOP-controlled state House and Senate approved the bill in April. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed it and Republicans are now attempting to override his veto. A vote in the state House is scheduled for June 5.
Generally speaking, Democrats have opposed the bill on grounds that it would bring more bureaucracy into complicated medical situations and may discourage abortions that are medically necessary. Republicans, meanwhile, believe more should be done to prevent infant deaths and hold doctors accountable.
Amid debate on the bill, two key questions stand out.
First: Do infants born alive through the course of an abortion have legal protection? Yes. Experts told PolitiFact that they do.
Second: How often are babies born during a planned abortion, but then killed or neglected to death?
Cooper said the practice "simply does not exist." But statements by some bill supporters give the impression that it's a common occurrence.
"These babies are sometimes left to die without medical care or, worse, helped to die by the very physicians who deliver them into the world," Tami Fitzgerald, executive director of the anti-abortion NC Values Coalition, said in a newsletter.
We found that there's some evidence suggesting that infants occasionally survive abortion attempts, but reports are rare. And there's even less hard evidence to suggest that, when infants do survive those attempts, they're viable but killed by medical professionals or allowed to die.
There is limited data "It's hard to get accurate statistics because it's illegal. So people won't be happy to report things that are illegal," said Mary Ziegler, an attorney and professor at Florida State University College of Law. Ziegler is an attorney and author of two books on abortion who spoke to PolitiFact in a telephone interview.
The types of deaths targeted by the NC bill occur "to the point of almost never," she said. "At the end of the day, we don't know. It would be wrong to say 100 percent it doesn't happen. We don't know. But for a variety of reasons, it's almost impossible" to measure.
The lack of data is part of the reason why the NC bill includes a requirement that medical professionals start reporting such cases.
North Carolina tracks infant deaths but doesn't know how many infants died after being born alive during a failed abortion, said Sarah Lewis Peel, spokeswoman for the NC Department of Health and Human Services.
"In 2017, there were zero deaths with an underlying cause of death of "Termination of Pregnancy," Peel wrote in an email.
The North Carolina Medical Board also failed to identify any cases in which a physician was disciplined for allowing an infant to die, said Jean Fisher Brinkley, the board's communications director.
In fact, PolitiFact found no report that chronicled the number of times that medical professionals have been disciplined for not providing care to infants who'd been born during or after an abortion procedure.
CDC report There is, however, a report on infants who were born alive during an abortion. It was published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and is likely the most-frequently cited report in the "born alive" debate.
The CDC examined infant death certificates between 2003 and 2014 and identified 143 cases where the infant was born alive during an attempt to terminate the pregnancy. To put that in perspective: there were more than 9.3 million abortion procedures performed in the United States during that same 12-year period, PolitiFact Texas reported.
The details of the 143 cases in the CDC report are sparse. The report was generated using death certificates, which included more than 40 terms for describing the cause.
Here's what we do know: 97 reportedly involved a maternal complication or a congenital anomaly. About 42 percent of the deaths occurred within an hour of birth, 54 percent occurred between one and 23 hours after birth, and about 4 percent of the deaths occurred a day after birth.
PolitiFact asked the CDC for state-specific data from its report on the 143 infants born alive, but a CDC spokesman said the agency can't provide it.
Some states track Six states — Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, Oklahoma and Texas — attempt to track cases of babies who survive an abortion, FactCheck.org reported in March.
Minnesota appears to offer the most detailed reports on infants born alive during an abortion.
A 2017 report by Minnesota's health department found that three infants were born alive during the course of an abortion in 2017, but later died (page 27 of the report: nando.com/53-). In two of those cases, no care was given. In one of those two, the infant's vital signs were already weak.
Further information about the cases isn't immediately available from the Minnesota Health Department, spokesman Doug Schultz told PolitiFact in an email. It's also unclear whether the medical professionals in those abortion cases acted within the limits of the law.
"Providing additional information on specific cases would have to be carefully reviewed and likely would not be possible as the information could be potentially identifying. Penalty and prosecution of physicians are outside of our jurisdiction and we don't have any information on that," Schultz said.
Elsewhere, Arizona health authorities in 2017 found that 10 infants were born alive during an attempted abortion between August and December of that year (page 21 of the report: nando.com/53z). Physicians submitted statements about the level of care provided in each case, but those statements aren't detailed in Arizona's report.
Florida reported that 11 infants were born alive during attempted abortions in 2017, six were born alive in 2018 and another has been born alive this year. Details aren't available in the reports.
In 2013, Texas started requiring medical professionals to report cases where an infant was born alive after a failed abortion. There have been zero reported instances, PolitiFact Texas found earlier this year.
Rare cases On conservative news sites and blogs, there are unsubstantiated stories about abortion providers who killed infants who were born alive. There are also stories about abortion clinic employees and what they've said about their operating procedures.
When it comes to proven cases of infanticide, Philadelphia abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell is perhaps the most well-known example. Gosnell was sentenced to life in prison for killing infants, some of whom were born alive.
There's also the case of Sycloria Williams, who in 2006 went to an abortion clinic to try to terminate her 23-week pregnancy. The abortion didn't happen. She gave birth, but her baby was neglected and died, according to the Associated Press, CNN and other media outlets.
A Texas doctor was accused of illegal abortions in 2011, but was cleared of wrongdoing in 2013, the Houston Chronicle reported.
Overall, media outlets — the New York Times, the Associated Press, Vox and FactCheck.org — have interviewed multiple experts who have reported that the situation outlined in the "born alive" bills is extremely rare.
By practice and law, living infants receive care, PolitiFact reported in a recent fact check of President Donald Trump.
Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at New York University Langone Medical Center, told PolitiFact he is unaware of examples of "medically active killing," and that while "allowing to die does happen," it occurs "very rarely — say, a baby born with no lungs at 20 weeks."
Dr. Kristyn Brandi, a New Jersey OB-GYN with fellowship training in family planning and a board member of Physicians for Reproductive Health, told Vox that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 aims to prevent the scenario addressed in the "born alive" bills.
"If we did what these politicians are claiming we're doing, we're already breaking the law. No one is actually doing that," Brandi told Vox. "At least, I should say, no credible doctor or practitioner is doing anything anywhere even close to what they're suggesting."
This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters' Lab and PolitiFact. The NC Local News Lab Fund and the International Center for Journalists provide support for the project, which shares fact-checks with newsrooms statewide.

Assange espionage indictment: classified hypocrisy and a prosecutorial Trojan horse

Texto completo: The May 23 Espionage Act indictment of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange evoked justified outrage and condemnation from media organizations and free speech advocates. Federal prosecutors claim in the indictment that Assange illegally received classified U.S. government information on United States military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, State Department cables involving U.S. foreign relations and the identities of human sources helping American forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Carrie DeCell of the Knight Institute at Columbia University observed on Twitter that the “government argues that Assange violated the Espionage Act by soliciting, obtaining, and then publishing classified information. That’s exactly what good national security and investigative journalists do every day.”
Masha Gessen at The New Yorker addressed an equally weighty issue when she observed, “The last thing we want the U.S. government, or any government, to do is to start deciding who is and who is not a journalist.”
I’m going to take that analogy one step further: the last thing we want is executive branch departments and agencies unilaterally and selectively asserting what should or should not be considered legitimately classified information.
The very law being used to charge Assange was passed over 100 years ago at the beginning of America’s entry into World War I. The Espionage Act of 1917 was used by the Justice Department and Postal Service to cow, investigate, shut down and even prosecute news outlets that challenged the Wilson administration’s wartime policies.
One of the most prominent targets was former Rep. Victor Berger of Wisconsin and his newspaper, the Milwaukee Leader. For publishing editorials critical of the war, Berger was charged and convicted under the Espionage Act in 1919. Though the conviction was overturned two years later, in the interim, Berger won reelection to the House twice but his colleagues refused to seat him.
In Assange’s case, he and Wikileaks did exactly what newspapers have done for decades — seek information about U.S. government policies and actions that were either questionable or outright illegal and publish information accordingly.
In 1971 for the New York Times it was the Pentagon Papers — the classified history of the Vietnam War leaked by then-RAND Corporation analyst and former Marine Corps infantry captain Daniel Ellsberg.
For the Washington Post, it was Watergate, including then-Attorney General John Mitchell’s illegal, secret surveillance slush fund used to target Democratic politicians. For Assange and his then-U.S. Army intelligence analyst accomplice, Chelsea Manning, it was about exposing U.S. war crimes in Afghanistan and Iraq.
In the Assange Espionage Act indictment, federal prosecutors specifically invoke Manning’s sharing and Assange’s receipt of classified information as also involving violations of Executive Order 13526, National Security Information, which states (Sec. 1.4(a)) that “military plans, weapons systems, or operations” are considered classified under the executive order.
But the Army officials who classified the 2007 Apache helicopter video released by Assange showing the killing of Iraqi civilians misused the classification system to conceal criminal conduct — something expressly forbidden by Sec. 1.7(a) of the very same Executive Order federal prosecutors cited in the Assange indictment.
So where are the indictments against Pentagon or CIA officials who knowingly and deliberately misused the classification system to conceal acts of torture or other war crimes in Iraq, Afghanistan or elsewhere? The hypocrisy and selective application of federal laws, regulations and executive orders in matters of national security is on full display in the Assange indictment. And there is another deeply troubling thing about the latest Assange indictment: the Justice Department’s attempt to criminalize the digital transfer of government information to third parties.
The 18th count against Assange focuses on alleged violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), namely that Assange (via Manning) sought to “knowingly access a computer … to obtain information that has been determined by the United States Government … to require protection against unauthorized disclosure” and to “willfully communicate, deliver, transmit, and cause to be communicated, delivered, or transmitted the same, to any person not entitled to receive it.”
The indictment also mentions three times Assange and Manning using “a cloud drop box” for the exchange of the purloined documents. In effect, prosecutors are arguing that the entire chain of digital exchanges between Wikileaks and Manning were illegal, and that the use of a “cloud storage” mechanism was a key feature of the crime.
Multiple news organizations utilize the Freedom of the Press Foundation’s encrypted SecureDrop system for receiving sensitive, including classified, documents from sources seeking to expose illegal or questionable government activities. If federal prosecutors prevail on Count 18 of the Assange indictment, it would open up every news organization in the world utilizing SecureDrop or a similar system to a CFAA prosecution — whether a whistleblower was digitally passing along Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) reports of immigrant abuse, Pentagon documents showing contracting irregularities, etc.
Prosecutors are attempting to overturn the Supreme Court decision in the Pentagon Papers case through a statutory Trojan Horse (the CFAA) all while deliberately ignoring the real crime in this episode — the deliberate misuse of federal classified information statutes and executive orders to conceal American government war crimes.

Texto completo: One of the most generous things you can do for the author of a book is to write a review and post it on Amazon.com or Goodreads.com. This is especially true for indie books — those published by the authors themselves or by small presses.
With their tiny (or non-existent) marketing budgets, these books — a million are published each year — struggle to find readers. Receiving a large number of reviews can help raise a book’s visibility on retail sites like Amazon.
Unfortunately, just like grade inflation in our schools, the awarding of “stars” to indie books has been affected by readers who want to help their author friends sell more books. As a result, amateur reviews have lost credibility. Further, because display order depends on algorithms that take into account star ratings, books that don’t sport a large majority of four- and five-star reviews on Amazon effectively disappear.
While authors understandably fret about one-, two- and three-star or negative reviews, that doesn’t mean readers should write only positive, five-star reviews. Even books considered part of the literary “canon” have received harsh criticism. Literary Hub, an online literary digest, frequently collates one-star reviews of famous novels. An example: in a one-star critique of 1984, a reviewer called it “a wet, moody rag.”
On the other hand, five-star ratings that include no comments and one-sentence positive reviews don’t help sell books, either. I know that writing a review can be intimidating for readers who don’t write much other than an occasional email or Facebook post. It’s even more daunting if you think you must be a literary critic to write a review.
Nothing could be further from the truth. No one expects all readers to have the expertise of a book reviewer for the New York Times or the New Yorker. Your opinion is valuable anyway. To make it easier to contribute an Amazon or Goodreads review, I offer the following “do” and “don’t” tips.
Do
Give a brief summary of the plot. This doesn’t have to be comprehensive; just write a couple of sentences so that another reader will have an idea about whether the book will interest them. While doing this, be sure you don’t spoil the answer to a mystery or give away a secret that the author is keeping for the end.
Give a recommendation: up or down. Should others consider buying this book? If yes, what did you get out of it? Did you learn something? Were you unable to go to sleep until you finished it? Did you love the writing? The characters? And if you didn’t like it, always say why as well.
If you received a free copy of the book in exchange for your review, it’s only fair to the other readers to let them know. It only takes a quick sentence: “I received a free copy in return for agreeing to review this book.”
If it’s appropriate, share a sentence or two about yourself that helps other readers understand your perspective. It might be something like: “I grew up in Iowa, so I know the setting well.” Or: “As a child, I also suffered from parental neglect.” This establishes some credibility for your opinion.
Don’t
Review the book that was written. Never suggest the author should have written a different book. I once read a review of a golf novel in which the reviewer felt romance wasn’t a large enough part of the book. She should have looked for books in the romance section, not the sports fiction section!
Don’t use poor grammar, poor punctuation or bad spelling. Even the most glowing review will mean nothing if it is poorly written. Take a few minutes to review what you’ve written before you dash it off. No one expects you to be a great writer, but your review won’t carry any weight if it looks like you’re illiterate.
Don’t get even with the writer for a past snub, a disagreement or a domestic issue. One of my books was once given a number of one-star reviews — sans comments — by the friends of a women who was divorcing a friend of mine. Not fair!
Don’t pick out a minor detail in the book that you don’t like and make the review about it. I recall reading a one-sentence review that took an author to task for having an overweight character in the book, which the reviewer felt was insensitive.
Finally, to see professionals write reviews, there are many free websites where you can read their offerings, including Kirkus Reviews (www.kirkusreviews.com), Foreword Reviews (www.forewordreviews.com) and Midwest Book Review (www.midwestbookreview.com). A caveat: reviews may be less biased if they’re written soon after the book is released. Average ratings tend to fall once a book receives a major literary award, probably because of heightened expectations on the part of readers and jealousy of the literary crowd that didn’t win the award.

Assange espionage indictment: classified hypocrisy and a prosecutorial Trojan horse

Texto completo: The May 23 Espionage Act indictment of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange evoked justified outrage and condemnation from media organizations and free speech advocates. Federal prosecutors claim in the indictment that Assange illegally received classified U.S. government information on United States military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, State Department cables involving U.S. foreign relations and the identities of human sources helping American forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Carrie DeCell of the Knight Institute at Columbia University observed on Twitter that the “government argues that Assange violated the Espionage Act by soliciting, obtaining, and then publishing classified information. That’s exactly what good national security and investigative journalists do every day.”
Masha Gessen at The New Yorker addressed an equally weighty issue when she observed, “The last thing we want the U.S. government, or any government, to do is to start deciding who is and who is not a journalist.”
I’m going to take that analogy one step further: the last thing we want is executive branch departments and agencies unilaterally and selectively asserting what should or should not be considered legitimately classified information.
The very law being used to charge Assange was passed over 100 years ago at the beginning of America’s entry into World War I. The Espionage Act of 1917 was used by the Justice Department and Postal Service to cow, investigate, shut down and even prosecute news outlets that challenged the Wilson administration’s wartime policies.
One of the most prominent targets was former Rep. Victor Berger of Wisconsin and his newspaper, the Milwaukee Leader. For publishing editorials critical of the war, Berger was charged and convicted under the Espionage Act in 1919. Though the conviction was overturned two years later, in the interim, Berger won reelection to the House twice but his colleagues refused to seat him.
In Assange’s case, he and Wikileaks did exactly what newspapers have done for decades — seek information about U.S. government policies and actions that were either questionable or outright illegal and publish information accordingly.
In 1971 for the New York Times it was the Pentagon Papers — the classified history of the Vietnam War leaked by then-RAND Corporation analyst and former Marine Corps infantry captain Daniel Ellsberg.
For the Washington Post, it was Watergate, including then-Attorney General John Mitchell’s illegal, secret surveillance slush fund used to target Democratic politicians. For Assange and his then-U.S. Army intelligence analyst accomplice, Chelsea Manning, it was about exposing U.S. war crimes in Afghanistan and Iraq.
In the Assange Espionage Act indictment, federal prosecutors specifically invoke Manning’s sharing and Assange’s receipt of classified information as also involving violations of Executive Order 13526, National Security Information, which states (Sec. 1.4(a)) that “military plans, weapons systems, or operations” are considered classified under the executive order.
But the Army officials who classified the 2007 Apache helicopter video released by Assange showing the killing of Iraqi civilians misused the classification system to conceal criminal conduct — something expressly forbidden by Sec. 1.7(a) of the very same Executive Order federal prosecutors cited in the Assange indictment.
So where are the indictments against Pentagon or CIA officials who knowingly and deliberately misused the classification system to conceal acts of torture or other war crimes in Iraq, Afghanistan or elsewhere? The hypocrisy and selective application of federal laws, regulations and executive orders in matters of national security is on full display in the Assange indictment. And there is another deeply troubling thing about the latest Assange indictment: the Justice Department’s attempt to criminalize the digital transfer of government information to third parties.

Orlando doctor indicted in fraud case

Texto completo: An Orlando doctor and a medical consultant have been indicted by federal prosecutors in an alleged scheme to defraud women in connection with pelvic mesh lawsuits, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.
Prosecutors allege that Dr. Christopher Walker, who has a private urogynecology practice in downtown Orlando, was part of a scheme that enticed women with pelvic mesh implants to agree to remove them and then sue the device manufacturers. Walker allegedly paid kickbacks and bribes to the consultant and others involved for the referrals, according to the indictment. Lawsuits involving women who have already removed their pelvic mesh implants tend to results in larger awards, the indictment said.
The alleged scheme is part of a growing industry that was the subject of an investigation by The New York Times last year.
Walker and Wesley Blake Barber, who owned Orlando-based companies that coordinated the surgeries and purchased and resold medical debt for profit, were arrested on May 24. Walker was released later that day and surrendered his passport.
"Dr. Walker denies the charges against him," said his attorney, Fritz Scheller, in an email. "He has always been an excellent doctor who prioritizes the needs of his patients.
Scheller said Walker will continue to practice since "he is presumed innocent and maintains his innocence."
A surgical mesh is a medical device that is used to provide additional support for weakened or damaged tissues. The pelvic mesh, also called a transvaginal mesh, is used as a permanent implant to repair several conditions in women, including pelvic floor disorders and urinary incontinence. Urogynecologists diagnose and treat women with pelvic floor disorders such a prolapse and incontinence.
Several companies produced the implants a decade ago, but it soon became clear that the devices caused pain, discomfort and bleeding in about 15% of the women, leading to dozens of lawsuits, which eventually amounted to more than 100,000 cases and one of the largest mass torts in history. The medical device manufacturers eventually agreed to settle the cases, paying close to $8 billion to resolve the claims, according to The New York Times.
There has also been ongoing individual litigation across the country. Just this month, a Philadelphia jury ordered Johnson & Johnson, which is one of the two remaining manufacturers of the implants, to pay $80 million to a woman injured by her pelvic implant, reported the Philadelphia Inquirer.
Pelvic mesh implants have been subject to much controversy in the medical community. In April, the Food and Drug Administration ordered all manufacturers to stop selling and distributing the mesh implants designed to repair pelvic organ prolapse due to lack of sufficient evidence about their safety. But the agency also said that women with mesh implants don't need to remove them if they're satisfied with their surgery and don't have complications.
"Women who have received transvaginal mesh for the surgical repair of pelvic organ prolapse should continue with their annual and other routine check-ups and follow-up care," the agency said.
Federal prosecutors allege that between 2013 and 2016, Barber and others contacted the women with mesh implants and "fasley and fraudulently" told the victims about the risk of implants and the need to remove them.
Barber's companies, Surgical Assistance and Medical Funding Consultants, were dissolved in 2017, according to the state Division of Corporations.
They also allegedly told women that they had to travel out of state to a pre-selected doctor, including Walker, rather than their local doctors, to have the surgery. Walker allegedly paid kickbacks and bribes to the consultant and others involved for the referrals.
Barber and other companies are also accused of misleading the women about their ability to rely on their health insurance to cover medical expenses and coaxed them into finance their procedures with two unnamed companies in Brooklyn and Boca Raton instead.
In some cases, the women agreed to repay the costs of the removal surgery plus interest, which accrued at high rates, if they ultimately received a settlement or favorable judgment against the mesh manufacturer, according to the Justice Department. In other cases, the victims were responsible for medical bills associated with the removal surgeries even if they didn't receive a settlement.
The indictment names three victims, Jane Doe #1, #2 and #3, who live in the East District of New York.
Walker performed surgeries on Jane Doe #1 and #3, according to the Justice Department.
The department has charged Walker and Barber with one count of wire fraud conspiracy, three counts of wire fraud, one count of travel act conspiracy and one count of travel act violation.
The case has been moved from the Middle District of Florida federal court to the Eastern District of New York, where the indictment was filed.

Duplicity sculpted into an art form

Texto completo: The tale starts like a whodunit, with the estranged daughter rummaging through her deceased father's house when she stumbles upon a plastic bag of computer hard drives and thumb drives containing secrets.
But there is no frisson of delight when the mystery is solved, just a dull anger that stirs as you realize you've been duped again.
The father in the story as told by The New York Times is Thomas Hofeller, the legendary Republican maestro of gerrymandering whose devil's art in countless redistricting cases set in stone the GOP's electoral dominance all over the country. And the information on his drives exposed the lie girding the Trump administration's attempt to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census.
It showed Hofeller had concluded that adding such a question would help Republicans by suppressing minority responses, allowing the party to draw district lines even more skewed against Democrats. And that he brought the idea to the Trump administration and lobbied for it. And that he wrote the justification for adding the question used by the Department of Justice - that it was needed to enforce the 1965 Voting Rights Act, when it actually was intended to disenfranchise voters.
Besides tossing a giant monkey wrench into the case before the Supreme Court, which is about to rule, Hofeller's digital papers also confirmed what has become dreadfully obvious:
We live in duplicitous times.
To be fair, duplicity itself is not unprecedented. We've seen it at all levels of government for as long as there has been government, and in presidential administrations from Barack Obama's Operation Fast and Furious scandal back through prior administrations of both parties. We've seen it in business, sports, the arts and, yes, journalism.
What's different now is the volume and velocity of duplicity. Deceit has become an M.O.
It starts with President Donald Trump, of course, who has passed the 10,000 mark in false or misleading claims, as tracked by The Washington Post. It continues with Attorney General William Barr, who has repeatedly mischaracterized and lied about Special Counsel Robert Mueller's findings in the Russia investigation.
The Trump administration also is looking at changing how poverty is measured; it won't reduce the number of poor people, but it will make it look like the administration has lifted more people out of poverty and allow it to kick more poor people off safety-net services like food stamps, Medicaid and Head Start. 
The Environmental Protection Agency is planning to tinker with the model that predicts how many people will die of pollution, so it can lessen that number on a stat sheet as it rolls back the Obama-era Clean Power Plan. As greenhouse gases rise, the administration will no longer report the long-term effects of climate change, only those projecting to 2040; end-of-century impacts will be far more dire, but you won't hear about them from Trump's staff.  
It's not just our federal government. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration tried to block the release of emails with outside advisers and public relations firms by referring to them as "agents of the city." Factories in China hid the truth that they were using a banned ozone-destroying chemical.
Duplicity is bad on its own, and erodes one's faith in government. Set in a digital world of fake videos and online misinformation and abetted by our own gullibility, it grows very worrisome. That's how you get increases in anti-vaxxers and those who accept outrageous conspiracy theories. And how you get Texas Tech University researchers finding that videos on YouTube sparked a startling rise in the number of people who believe the world is flat, hundreds of years after that preposterousness was debunked. And how, maybe, you influence a presidential election.

Texto completo: The New York Times travel department is rife with parents. We love travel, we love our children and we love traveling with our children.
Until we don't. We know as well as any that even the best-intentioned child can wreck havoc on the most thought-out travel plans, a dream vacation turned into a horror show thanks to a small creature nearest and dearest to your heart.
Collectively, we have experienced hundreds of travel trips and have learned a thing or two, through the good times and the not-so-good. Here are a few of our favorites that have helped us and our children have happy, healthy and enlightening adventures.
On the road and rails
When traveling on a train with a child, make use of Amtrak's Red Cap service. It made my train trips a breeze, lowering the stress level of navigating the train station and the crowds. Red Cap service is offered at 12 of Amtrak's busiest stations, including New York's Penn Station. These Amtrak employees, wearing red caps, not only provide free help to get your baggage on and off trains, but perhaps even more important board you on the train before the "All Aboard" announcement. I liked how the red cap porters on our trips had a key to the escalators, which they used to change its direction and take us to the platform early. All you do is tip them. -- Lynda Richardson
On a road trip, there's nothing like a good audiobook to keep your kids entertained. And if you, like me, have an ulterior motive -- to introduce your children to a few timeless classics -- a road trip presents the perfect opportunity. "Dracula" had us all delightfully frightened as we drove through the dark forested hills of North Carolina. The late 19th-century British sleeper, "Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog)," by Jerome K. Jerome is so hilarious we nearly had to pull off the road. A sure hit is the timeless "D'Aulaires' Book of Greek Myths," with readings by, among others, Paul Newman, Kathleen Turner and Sidney Poitier. -- Suzanne MacNeille
In the air
When my son was 2 1/2, we flew cross-country from New York to San Francisco. I bought about six little (and cheap) toys and wrapped them each separately, with a lot of wrapping paper and invisible tape. I would give him one every hour and each took him a while to open. -- Phaedra Brown
During a long day of air travel, carrying a baby strapped in a baby carrier gets heavy fast. As soon as he was old enough, I much rather preferred using an inexpensive umbrella stroller for our son. Like other strollers, you can check it at the gate but umbrella strollers snap open with one arm and they are usually very light-weight. If it's lost or damaged in flight, you aren't out hundreds of dollars. -- Elisabeth Goodridge

You made it there
After a trans-Atlantic flight from New York to Copenhagen, my 11-month-old son was so grumpy and jet-lagged that he -- of course -- refused to nap. By a miracle, I had booked us in a hotel next to a park with the most wonderful playground. We took him there and he was happy and engaged for hours. When we got back to the hotel, he slept for 12 hours. I will now only book hotels within a block or two of a park or playground. It's the perfect antidote to hours on a plane. -- Danielle Pergament
For older children, let them do things they want to do -- without you. (Do you spend every minute of the day together when you're not on vacation?) The summer my son was 15, we went to Stockholm. He really wanted to go to the Grona Lund amusement park. I really didn't want to go to the Grona Lund amusement park. So he went to the park, and my husband and I went to Waldemarsudde, originally the home of Sweden's Prince Eugen, and now a lovely art museum. My son was by himself in a foreign country where he didn't speak the language, and he loved every minute of it. On the same trip, while we went out to the restaurant Amass in Copenhagen he stayed back and streamed "Breaking Bad." It's one of his favorite memories of vacation, ever. -- Amy Virshup
While traveling, you can find yourself in an Airbnb or rental house with no shades or sheer curtains at best. It's terrible for everyone. Amazon and Home Depot sell paper-accordion blackout shades online and they worked like a miracle. I bought dozens and took them on every trip. Whenever it was time for the kids to take a nap or go to sleep for the night, I'd just unclip them, they'd fall down, and the room was instantly dark. My kids are older now and don't need them, but I'm still tempted to use them. They're basically like melatonin. -- Danielle Pergament
At the Beach
My favorite beach is one known for strong currents and stronger waves, not particularly the ideal place to relax with a baby or toddler who loves the water. Then one summer day I saw another family who had brought a small baby pool along with all their beach toys. It's a brilliant idea. With a few buckets of seawater, the baby pool creates a safe, contained space. Your kid will play happily. They won't miss the waves and you won't miss the worry. -- Elisabeth Goodridge
Anywhere
When your baby or child is wailing inconsolably, and inexplicably, on a plane, train or in a public space offering no escape, just remember that you will never, ever see these people again. Relax. -- Lynda Richardson

Beach Reads From Book Critics

Texto completo: When the critics and editors at The New York Times's Books desk finally get a break and hit the beach, you might imagine they pack a badminton set and leave the reading material home. But you would be wrong. We asked a handful of professionals obsessed with books to tell us what they'll be reading on vacation this summer. Dwight Garner, Critic One novel I'll pack this summer is Robert Menasse's The Capital (June 18), a sprawling story that ostensibly tries to (this is chutzpah) capture the essence of the European Union. Some critics have said he has succeeded -- this timely book arrives on the heels of some low-key intercontinental elation. I'll also bring Mona Awad's Bunny (June 11), about dark goings-on among female M.F.A. students. Every time I open it up, I stumble upon a crackling sentence. I'll also bring David Szalay's new novel, Turbulence (July 16), about 12 people, mostly strangers, and their paths through the world. I've admired everything I've read by Szalay, and it's too late for me to quit him now.
I've always wanted to read the English writer Keith Waterhouse's primer The Theory and Practice of Lunch (1986). I like lunch, and this will be the year. I want to finish The Best of Myles (1968), a collection of Flann O'Brien's very funny Irish newspaper columns. Finally, I'll bring two recent collections by the estimable music critic Robert Christgau: Is It Still Good to Ya?: Fifty Years of Rock Criticism, 1967-2017, published last year, and this year's Book Reports: A Music Critic on His First Love, Which Was Reading. Parul Sehgal, Critic My advance copy of Mostly Dead Things (June 4), a new novel by Kristen Arnett, has been taunting me for months. It looks like such scandalous fun -- a story of family dysfunction, inconvenient desires and an inherited taxidermy business that's giving me shades of Karen Russell and John Waters.
It has been 15 years since Suketu Mehta's extraordinary "Maximum City," and I've been impatient for a new book from him. This Land Is Our Land (June 4) is an examination of the global backlash against immigrants that delves into his own experience as an Indian teenager in New York City.
I'm a Nell Zink completist, and her latest, Doxology (Aug. 27), looks promising. It follows a terrible punk band as it contends with the arrival of a child and (even more shocking) success. But it's Zink, so I'm anticipating a coming-of-age story (of the band, of the nation) delivered with customary astringency.
I'm also eager to return to an old favorite -- We Are Michael Field, Emma Donoghue's 1998 biography of a pair of Victorian poets and playwrights, Katherine Bradley and her niece (and lover), Edith Cooper, who secretly wrote together under the pen name Michael Field. They were fascinating figures who negotiated conventionality and transgression in their idiosyncratic way, and the book draws from their greatest work -- a shared diary they kept for a quarter century.
Jennifer Szalai, Critic My family is taking a short road trip this summer, and because my husband will be doing all the driving, I'll be reading Dan Albert's Are We There Yet? (June 11) -- about the history of American car culture -- as a small (and negligibly helpful) act of solidarity.
Long drives require something to listen to, and the audiobook version of Not Dead Yet (2016), Phil Collins's memoir -- in addition to having a first-rate title -- is supposed to be great: candid, entertaining, full of delectable gossip and abject humiliation. I've heard snippets about Collins's disastrous experience at Live Aid (involving Cher, Led Zeppelin and the Concorde), but I want to listen to him tell it in his own voice.
I'm also planning to read Orange World and Other Stories (released in May), by Karen Russell. Weird, uncanny stories that feature a haunted ski lodge and a suckling demon? Sounds like ideal beach reading to me.
Up next will be I Like to Watch (June 25), a collection of essays by Emily Nussbaum, The New Yorker's television critic. Nussbaum's reviews are the best kind of cultural criticism: funny, irreverent and unremittingly self-aware. After I read Russell's story about the suckling demon, I plan to read Nussbaum's essay about "Buffy the Vampire Slayer."
Sarah Lyall, WRITER AT LARGE I'm always excited to cancel whatever uninteresting plans I have in order to stay home and cuddle up with a new Kate Atkinson novel. Her latest, Big Sky (June 25), has the added bonus of the soulful private investigator Jackson Brodie, who (I thought) was permanently retired some years ago but who has, thrillingly, returned.
I'll also be calling in sick for The Need, by Helen Phillips (July 9), whose unexpected fiction reminds us that the membrane between reality and madness is porous indeed. This book is about an overwhelmed young mother whose natural sense that life is running amok is reinforced by the sudden appearance of things that seem to have sprung from the other side of the looking glass.
Also, how much am I looking forward to reading the new book Spring, by the English novelist Ali Smith? It's the third volume in her exquisite quartet of seasonal novels offering love and redemption and art at an ill-tempered time. When you feel bad about the state of the world, she has a way of restoring your faith.
And finally, I can't wait to read another new one, The Beneficiary, my overly talented former colleague Janny Scott's memoir about her charming, infuriating, flawed father and his grand Pennsylvania family -- and about how money and secrets and obligations and expectations can reverberate, for good and for bad, through the generations.
John Williams, Editor Baseball always plays a significant role in my summer, and this year I plan to supplement the box scores with the new microhistory Ballpark: Baseball in the American City, by the Pulitzer Prize-winning architecture critic Paul Goldberger. I've been to many stadiums myself, and I look forward to "visiting" others through Goldberger's expert eyes.
One place I would have never discovered a writer before the last decade or so is Twitter. But that's where I first read frequent -- and frequently funny -- tidbits by the fiction writer and essayist Kristen Arnett. Her first novel, Mostly Dead Things, is about a woman who struggles to take over her family's Florida taxidermy business after her father's death. Deceased animals and parents don't sound particularly entertaining, but I have a feeling Arnett will make them so.
I've wanted to read Javier Marías's fiction for a long time and have never known where to start. (He's written a lot of it.) So I'm going to stop worrying about where to start and just jump into A Heart So White (1992). Apparently the book is rather slow-paced and philosophical, but I like that kind of thing, and besides, summer is as much about languor as it is about escapism. ✹ DRAWINGS

Delta flight attendants claim uniforms causing headaches and rashes in lawsuit

Texto completo: Two Delta Air Lines flight attendants are alleging that wearing their uniforms causes skin rashes, headaches, fatigue and other issues in a proposed class-action lawsuit filed Wednesday.
The "Passport Plum" uniforms were made by Lands' End, a global fashion retailer, and issued to 64,000 employees in May 2018, according to the lawsuit. Land's End is named as a defendant in the lawsuit; Delta is not.
The suit seeks more than $5 million in damages and was filed in U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York by flight attendants Gwyneth Gilbert and Monica DeCrescentis. Gilbert lives in Sandy Springs, Georgia, and alleges in the lawsuit that she experienced rashes and skin irritations from wearing the uniforms, which consisted of two dresses, a pantsuit and a sweater set.
DeCrescentis, from New York alleges in the suit that she experienced skin reactions, headaches and a low white cell blood count over the past year since she has been wearing the uniform. She also alleged that the dye in the clothing transferred onto her body, sheets, clothes and bathtub.
Lands' End told USA TODAY that it does not comment on pending litigation.
The lawsuit states that because Delta flight attendants are non-union, many flight attendants are afraid to complain about the adverse health consequences they are experiencing from uniforms.
Although Delta is not named in the suit, the airline issued a statement on its uniforms: "Although Delta and Lands' End conducted in-depth testing during every step of development, a small number of employees have reported skin irritations.
The outfits were created by New York fashion designer Zac Posen. The outfits were rolled out with much fanfare in 2018, more than a year after the new threads were first unveiled in the fall of 2016 after "extensive testing" to make sure they would perform as expected.
Find another place to stash boarding pass; Southwest is eliminating paper ticket jackets Flying Southwest this summer and like to stash your boarding pass in those colorful paper holders they hand out at the airport?
You'll have to BYOBP holder beginning June 1.
Ticket jackets, as the document holders are called, are going the way of peanuts on Southwest.
The airline, which doles out about 22 million ticketjackets a year, is eliminating them to "reduce waste, protect our environment, use less paper and ultimately become a greener company," spokesman Dan Landson said in a statement.
Southwest is the last major U.S. airline to ditch the ticket jackets, a relic from an era when airlines issued paper tickets.
Most tickets are now electronic, and boarding passes have moved that way, too. Travelers who don't fly Southwest, the nation's largest domestic carrier, may not even know they still exist.
United Airlines said it eliminated ticket jackets in the early 2000s. Delta Air Lines did away with them in 2008. Alaska says it did away with them more than a decade ago. The last time American used them was in 2014. Spirit Airlines eliminated them in late 2016 as mobile boarding passes and self-service check-in kiosks grew in popularity.
Landson said Southwest has seen an increase in the number of travelers using mobile boarding passes and decided now was the time to eliminate them.
"Through this change in behavior, we feel like we've reached a good point to transition away from paper ticket jackets," he said.
The look of Southwest's ticket jackets, like other airlines', evolved with the airline's style and slogans over the years. The ticket jackets included gate information, Southwest reservations information and ads for Southwest products including gift cards. In the past, baggage claim checks were stapled to them.
A decade ago, one Southwest frequent flier got his close-up on Southwest's ticket jackets.
Terry Buchen, president of Golf Agronomy International, said he was selected to be on the ticket jacket after he gushed nonstop about Southwest at a party the airline hosted for frequent fliers in Baltimore.
Southwest flew Buchen and his wife to Austin, Texas, for a photo shoot and treated them to a luxury hotel, meals and a new outfit from Nordstrom for the ad. (Yes, he got to keep it.)
Buchen was on the ticket jacket from 2007 to 2009.
He was often recognized at the airport by fellow travelers and Southwest employees, earning the nickname "the ticket jacket guy," he told the New York Times in 2008.
"People used to ask me for autographs," Buchen said in a phone interview with USA TODAY. "It was a lot of fun. I really had fun."
Buchen, 72, has a framed copy of the ticket jacket at his home outside Boise, Idaho, and saved about 100 of the ticket jackets with his picture on them.
The last time Buchen used a Southwest ticket jacket was 2016. Not because he's moved to mobile boarding passes — he has but still prints out a hard copy in case his phone dies or malfunctions — but because he doesn't fly Southwest following his move from Virginia to Idaho.
Delta has better flight options from Boise, he said. But no ticket jackets.
Buchen said he folds his backup Delta boarding pass in half and sticks it in the back left pocket of his pants. He said he will always fondly remember ticket jackets.
"It was such a tradition for so many years," he said. "It just made you feel good, sort of like you were carrying a passport. And you'd open it up like a book and there was a boarding pass and a receipt."
Travelers nostalgic for ticket jackets, including Southwest's current version, can find plenty for sale on eBay.
USA TODAY staffers Dawn Gilbertson and Adrienne Jordan contributed.

Dance has been a part of Derek Hough's life since he was a child, but he is also an accomplished musician, actor and singer. In his new stage show, "Derek Hough Live! The Tour," he showcases his many talents and opens up with audiences on a more personal level.
Hough is best known as a cast member on "Dancing With the Stars," a TV competition he has won six times. He won two Emmy Awards for his choreography on the show. He recently served as a judge alongside Jennifer Lopez and Ne-Yo on the TV show "World of Dance."
He has played Corny Collins in "Hairspray Live!," been the male lead in a London production of "Footloose" and had a recurring role on the TV show "Nashville." His book "Taking the Lead: Lessons from a Life in Motion" was a New York Times bestseller.
This tour is a different experience for Hough, who is used to working with his sister. In 2014, 2015 and 2017, he toured with Julianne Hough, also an accomplished dancer, actress and singer.
His new show isn't just him on stage alone, though. He has dancers and a band. The show crosses genres, presenting Motown, Latin, rock-and-roll, big band, hip hop and other styles of music and dance. Hough plays the guitar and drums, along with singing and dancing.
He talked about his solo tour during a recent telephone interview.
Question: How have audiences been responding to your tour?
Answer: The audiences' response, the reactions, the reviews have been overwhelming. I've worked so hard on this show, putting together something that appeals to such a wide demographic, everybody from kids to 90-year-olds and everybody in between.
I really get personal, and I get quite vulnerable in the show towards the end, having a chat. The response so far from everybody has been just beautiful. I'll sign autographs and sign posters after the show, and I ask a lot of people what's their favorite part.
What's so wonderful to hear is everybody has a different favorite part that they love the most. Some will be in tears from the emotional parts of the show, and some are having a blast, having fun, standing up and dancing. It captures all of the different emotions.
Q: Do you feel it's changed how people look at you?
A: There's a lot of singing in the show. I do "Singin' in the Rain," Michael Buble songs and some Top 40 stuff. It's wonderful to share that aspect of what I do as well.
For me to have done so many different tours and for people to come up to me and say that they really, really loved this one, it just makes me so happy. I'm always trying to get better and better, elevate and make the best show possible for these audiences.
Q: What went into choosing the dancers for your show?
A: I picked dancers that can do things that I can't. There's certain things that I'm an expert at, and there are certain areas that aren't necessarily my strongest areas. Every night, I'm blown away by what they are producing on that stage, just their technique, their grace and their athleticism.
Q: When you were getting ready for the show, did it feel different working with them compared to your sister?
A: The biggest difference was trying to figure out how I was going to be onstage for the entire time, or where I was going to not be onstage. It was very important for me to have dancers who were so good that it didn't matter if I was onstage or not.
Also, the one big change for this show is I have a live band. That was a big part of the process. It took a lot more thought, a lot more time. I did all the arrangements and was in the recording studio, putting together music. The band was rehearsing, and we were dancing in the room. What it has done is it has made the show feel more like a concert.
Q: How long did it take to put together the show?
A: It took a long time. The thing that took the longest was the music, getting the music and the set list together. I wanted such a big variety of music that covers the whole spectrum of genres and music that inspires us to move and dance. Also, I wanted to pick music that was meant to be played live. I wanted this music to really pop and really feel exciting when you hear it.
Q: How did you decide what music to use?
A: I picked music that I get excited about but also music that I know that my audience will love as well, infusing them, combining them, updating some of them, changing some of these songs and making them feel more contemporary. For me, what's awesome is after the show having a 6-year-old come up to me and say how much she loved the music and, in the same moment, having a 70-year-old come up to me and say how much she loved the music.
Q: Did you have to brush up on any dance styles for the show?
A: I tap a lot in the show. For me, I love tap dancing so much. I had to definitely work hard on brushing up on my tap. I do a really challenging routine in the show. It's very demanding, very physical. Fortunately, I keep sharp in my styles and what I do, and I work hard, train and practice a lot. When it came to rehearsal, I was ready to go.
Q: It sounds like you've really challenged and pushed yourself with this show.
A: This definitely is a challenging show for everybody, including our dancers. The dancers are working extremely hard. It's a full-out show. When people come and see the show, I think they're surprised by the amount of energy that is exerted on that stage.
Q: What do you hear consistently that audiences always love and get excited about?
A: There's a moment where I get really personal. I really open up about struggles that I've gone through and how we all share this vulnerability. We all share these thoughts, these doubts in our mind. I've really heard from a lot of people that it touched them. It really moved them tremendously. That's my goal. I really just want to inspire, motivate or connect with the audience.
Q: Have your dancers and band helped to shape the show?
A: A lot of the big moments, it could only happen because of the talent of the musicians or the dancers. Being a choreographer isn't just about creating moves that you want to see. It's about bringing the best out in who you have. A lot of times, I will say, "Do something amazing here," and they will do something that is in their wheelhouse and only they can bring that to the table. There are so many of those moments that each dancer brings that couldn't have happened without them.
