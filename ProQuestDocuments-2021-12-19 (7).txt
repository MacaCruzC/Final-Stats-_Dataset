Texto completo: PLAINFIELD, N.H. — Maxfield Parrish, considered one of the most prominent painters and illustrators of the 20th century, came to this rural town in 1898. He bought land across the Connecticut River from where his father lived and designed a home to sit squarely with a view of Mount Ascutney.
The move would herald a renaissance in his artistry. Parrish would gravitate toward landscapes, announcing to the Associated Press in 1931 that he was done with illustrations, done painting “girls on rocks." He'd paint only what he loved: landscapes, “unattainable" scenes people don't see every day.
Parrish painted scenes around his land, which he named “The Oaks" for its giant trees. These 45 acres were his playground, where Parrish the successful illustrator flourished as a painter, architect, mechanic, muralist, and photographer. It was a place where Parrish, the lover of music and theater, and Parrish, the dreamer of fairy tales, was free to explore.
He created some of America's best-known art at “The Oaks," including “Daybreak," a 1922 painting reproduced so many times it was “the decorating sensation of the decade," author Coy Ludwig said in his book “Maxfield Parrish."
Now Parrish's estate, 58 Freeman Road, is on the market in its entirety for the first time in 30 years, listed with Snyder Donegan Real Estate Group for $1,295,000.
The sale offers a glimpse into how where you call home can inspire your art.
A colony of creation
Parrish lived among dozens of the best-known artists in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Some built summer homes in the reclusive hills of the Upper Valley. They worked during the day and socialized at night. They came from cities like New York, seeking relief from summer's humidity.
“They could breathe easier here," said James B. Atkinson, a former Dartmouth College professor who cowrote a book on the colony with Virginia Reed Colby called “Footprints of the Past: Images of Cornish, New Hampshire and the Cornish Colony."
About 100 artists are said to have been part of it, following the lead of renowned sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens. Writers came to write, painters to paint, sculptors to sculpt. Some came to retire. They built expansive homes and gardens that graced the hills and mountain in a region where one of the longest covered bridges in the nation is still perched above the Connecticut River.
Thomas Wilmer Dewing was a famous figure painter who captured the hills and river in “Summer," an oil painting of “two gossamer-clothed women floating through the landscape," Atkinson said.
Henry Brown Fuller painted his famous “Illusions" here — an oil of a nude woman and child with the peak of Mount Ascutney in the background.
Willard L. Metcalf was called “poet laureate of the New England hills" for his Upper Valley landscapes.
Many of the artists stayed just for the summers, but some like Parrish — referred to as “chickadees" for their perseverance in winter — didn't leave. He lived in Plainfield even after the Cornish Art Colony dissipated around 1920; he lived here until his death in 1966.
Parrish Blue
Parrish spoke of “The Oaks" as if it were magic.
He talked about the “glorious" mountain and the “blue hills" he saw outside his window. He photographed the land incessantly and painted it repeatedly.
Parrish became known for dreamlike landscapes and blue horizons — a mixed cobalt blue that appears in the skies and rivers of his paintings again and again. The color was so famous, people named it “Parrish Blue."
Parrish captured his surroundings, including the river and that famous covered bridge in “Early Autumn, White Birch" and “Study for the River at Ascutney."
He painted the trees, never pleased with the result.
“Only God can make a tree. True enough, but I'd love to see Him paint one," Parrish once wrote in a letter to the artistic director at Brown and Bigelow, a calendar and greeting card company, according to Ludwig. “Give me a hundred years or more, and I think I can paint a tree that satisfies me."
The 'power of place'
Valerie Balint, program manager for the Historic Artists' Homes & Studios program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, said an artist's home is a sanctuary and, for many, “laboratories for experimentation." (The program is a consortium of more than 30 independent museums. Parrish's estate is not affiliated.)
Sometimes the land offers a respite, Balint said, “a reboot out of the city and inspiration for the art itself. It's the power of place."
In Parrish's paintings, “Cornish appears as a kind of Arcadian paradise that liberated the imagination, uncovering, in Parrish's case, a tension between an intensified reality and pastoral dream," Sylvia Yount, head of the American Wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, wrote in her book “Maxfield Parrish 1870-1966."
Edward Hopper, named one of most important realists of the 20th century, struggled as a commercial illustrator until he found his place in Truro. Hopper became known for watercolor and oil paintings that captured the light and architecture of his surroundings, according to Gail Levin, a professor of art history, American studies, and women studies at Baruch College in New York City and the author of “Edward Hopper: An Intimate Biography."
And Winslow Homer's artwork shifted from relaxed to dramatic when he moved from New York City to Prouts Neck, Maine, and added a second-floor balcony, enabling him to have unobstructed views of the rocks and the seascape, said Diana Greenwold, associate curator of American art at the Portland Museum of Art. “There is something particular to this environment that really captures Homer's imagination." (Homer's Maine studio is part of the Historic Artists' consortium.)
The popular 20th-century artist Andrew Wyeth captured the area where he grew up in Pennsylvania and summered in Maine. “He wanted to paint trees that he knew and loved and hills that he knew, that he walked on," said Wyeth's son, Jamie, also an artist.
But sometimes an artist's home becomes the subject.
The home Parrish designed was one of his most famous pieces of art, but it's exact rendering cannot be found in any of his work, according to his granddaughter Joanna Parrish Gordon, the former Joanna Maxfield Parrish. It was written about and photographed for dozens of articles, however, and it fascinated critics, as well as Parrish's friends and colleagues.
It was a “child's dream home in every sense of the word," Homer Saint-Gaudens, son of Augustus Saint-Gaudens, told Critic magazine in 1905, according to Yount.
The estate was constructed in tandem with nature. Parrish built around giant oak trees instead of felling them and on top of rocks and ledges, taking a modern approach by leaving gaps between the exterior and interior walls so he could drain the pipes every winter or update the electrical simply by removing a panel.
The main house burned in a chimney fire in 1979. It was rebuilt a year later to match the original exterior architecture, but the interior is different. His original studio, where he created his artwork and eventually spent his winters, remains, however, showcasing Parrish's ingenuity — think giant windows that slide into the walls like pocket doors.
Parrish was always looking for inspiration, even donning snowshoes to walk the property at midnight, his granddaughter said. “He painted a white oak so many times that he said it paid for the place."
But he wasn't adverse to tinkering with nature.
“He was always changing things so that they were beautiful to look at," Parrish Gordon said, recalling how he put weights on the branches of an apple tree so that it would weep over a terrace wall and “look sweet and romantic."
“Granddad's home was from another world," she said.
A resurgence?
It's been a little more than 50 years since Parrish died. Modern conveniences in Cornish and the surrounding areas are still few and far between. The mountain still looms, but the artist colony is long gone.
It's unclear why artists disappeared from this area. Some of their homes are owned by their families. Some have been sold.
Cartoonist Harry Bliss purchased writer J.D. Salinger's home last year.
Bliss, whose illustrations have frequented covers of The New Yorker, didn't know about the Cornish art colony when he bought the house. He said the place just suited him.
“I love the dirt roads. I love the fact that I can get snowed in here and can't leave for a few days," he said.
Bliss thinks the place will inspire colleagues, so he's establishing a residency. “Cartoonists can come here and just relax — just breathe," he said.
“The Oaks" is now owned by Samuel “Sy" Mintz, a Boston architect and city planner. Mintz didn't know anything about Parrish when he bought the property 30 years ago, but the architect grew fond of the painter and his work.
Mintz — who spent 10 years restoring the studio, which had been left open to the weather — said he hopes someone who cares about the property as much as Parrish did buys it.
Parrish's last painting — “Getting Away From It All" — shows his affection for the solitude of rural life. It's of a house on a cliff and a single tree, a scene of life surrounded by nothing but nature.

Texto completo: Baby, it's cold outside.
Wickedly, mercilessly, unsparingly — insert your favorite frozen adverb here — cold.
And it's so brutal across the polar tundra that is the eastern half of the nation, New Year's Eve and New Year's Day celebrations are being nixed or brought indoors.
The arctic invasion is rivaling that of the past 100 years for late December and early January, Accuweather says, and temperatures are projected to continue to feel below zero over much of the Northeast and well below zero in much of the Midwest.
Wind-chill advisories and warnings blanket the Plains, the Midwest, the mid-South and Northeast, according to the National Weather Service.
The bitter temperatures have blasted daily records, including these on Sunday morning, the weather service reports: Huron, S. D. , -27; Bangor, Maine, -24; and Flint, Mich. , -11.
Tiny Embarrass, Minn. , the state's revered "Cold Spot," hit -45: the nippiest in about four years.
And temps aren't the only records being made.
For the first time in 30 years, the annual New Year's Day Lobster Dip to benefit Special Olympics in Old Orchard Beach, Maine, has been rescheduled — to a hopefully milder Jan. 13.
“I’m not going to lie that I’m a little excited about 28 degrees as opposed to negative 16. It certainly makes me look forward to the event a lot more,” Public Relations Director Lisa Bird told Maine Public.
In Springfield, Ill. , the annual New Year's Eve fireworks extravaganza was scrubbed as the mercury is expected to reach just 9 degrees and will be rescheduled for a toastier date.
In Ohio, fireworks were canceled and events moved inside in Miami Township. The New Year’s Eve ball drop and other activities in New Carlisle were reduced to an hour.
The village of Orchard Park near Buffalo scrapped its New Year’s Eve event because of subzero temperatures. “With frigid weather, the chance of a water line break is higher, and I’d rather have my public works crew fixing it than hoisting a ball up to drop,” Mayor Jo Ann Litwin Clinton told the Associated Press.
But for some hearty partiers, the show is going on.

Nine hours before the iconic ball drop, crowds were expected to start packing Times Square. It could be the coldest New Year's Eve there in 50-plus years.
“Hundreds of thousands have withstood very cold weather over the years for a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and we expect this year to be no different,” said Tim Tompkins, president of the Times Square Alliance, which hosts the event.
1917 saw the most frigid New Year’s Eve in Times Square: 1 degree at midnight. This year, the forecast is for 11 degrees with a wind chill about zero, which would tie for second with 1962.
Extra New York Fire Department personnel were going to be on hand to provide medical assistance, and a National Weather Service meteorologist was also scheduled to be on site to monitor weather conditions.
The Penguin Plunge in Narragansett, R. I. , on New Year's Day was also still on. But officials advised would-be plungers, expected in the thousands, to “use their good judgment” when weighing go or no-go.
And in Philadelphia on New Year's Day, Mummers Parade participants will still strut their stuff for the beloved event despite concerns for the young and elderly — and even worries over brass horns freezing up.
The heads of the five Mummers divisions — string bands, fancy brigades, wench brigades, comics and fancies — voted 3-2 to play on as planned, according to the Philly Voice.

Texto completo: BETHEL — In September, Team Hailey Hugs, the local nonprofit dedicated to helping families dealing with childhood cancer, lost its main source of inspiration, Hailey Steward, who passed away after an almost six-year battle with leukemia.
However, Team Hailey Hugs and the people involved have not lost their motivation and drive to provide emotional and financial support to those fighting childhood cancer.
“Team Hailey Hugs members are amazing, and they have taken THH to the level it is today because of their drive for Hailey’s mission to come true,” Hailey’s mother, Tabaitha Steward, said. “And they have been a big part of my lifeline, because losing Hailey will be a pain I will have for the rest of my life.”
Steward said the nonprofit is working on several projects, including continuing its mission to get all 455 towns and municipalities in the state to “Go Gold,” which includes a proclamation, hanging gold decorations and holding events to raise awareness.
Another mission is to get 2,000 applications for a Hailey’s license plate, which features a golden ribbon and butterfly, Hailey’s symbol. The organization needs the applications, which include an order form and a $35 fee, before the license plate can be made available through the Maine Department of Motor Vehicles and used.
In addition, the group is creating THH merchandise that can be sold to pay for operational supplies, so every penny donated can go to families.
“I’ve also been really focused on all the families fighting cancer, and their needs. So far this year, we’ve helped almost 30 families, because of all the people who donated one way or another to Hailey’s cause and mission. Those are the ones we need to thank. Because of them, these families are being touched by love and support,” Steward said.
to donate to Team Hailey Hugs, or sign up for a license plate, visit haileyhugs.org.

Texto completo: Four-year-old Adam Mattson of New Vineyard, whose legs were severed in a bucket loader accident Oct. 23, is getting around in a wheelchair.
Physical and occupational therapists are working to help him stand — a few seconds at a time — on his reattached leg. The length he is able to stand should gradually increase.
Adam walked beneath the bucket of a bucket loader when his mother’s boyfriend of 14 years, Sam Kennedy, had briefly turned away at a family sand pit.
The bucket, which had been down but not resting on the ground, lost hydraulic power and came down on Adam’s legs.
“Sam saved his life,” said Kim Mattson, Adam’s mother who adopted him when he was a baby.
Kennedy rushed Adam to the hospital in Farmington, where he was taken by medical helicopter to Boston Children’s Hospital.
Surgeons were able to reattach Adam’s left leg but were not able to save his right leg, Mattson said.
Adam has had 14 operations. His last, believed to be the final one, was Dec. 18.
They are still waiting to see how well the leg will work, she said. He will get a prosthetic leg on his right side.
Adam’s left leg had to go through several washout processes to remove any gravel or other contaminants that could lead to infection during the reattachment process. He has also had several skin grafts. Five medical teams are working with him.
Adam has a boot on his ankle and foot. His bandages have been removed.
He was allowed out of bed for the first time Dec. 7. He had to ride in a cart because he needs to keep his leg straight and is now using a wheelchair.
He will turn 5 on Jan. 10, and has known from the beginning that he lost his leg in the accident, she said.
“Adam is Adam,” she said. He is physically and mentally strong and is more advanced than a typical 4-year-old, she said.
He is in prekindergarten at the W.G. Mallett School in Farmington.
One of his doctors told Mattson on Dec. 18 that Adam’s open wound is healing well, she said.
The staff at the children’s hospital has made sure he has had fun during his stay. When he couldn’t get out of bed, they wheeled his bed to where an air hockey game was located so he could play. Adam has also participated in water syringe fights with staff members.
He has met members of the Boston Celtics basketball team, created a gingerbread house, made crafts and played games while there.
Adam’s siblings, Kaitlyn Bressette and Mikki Bressette-Konopka, and Kennedy have been constant visitors to the hospital. Mattson’s four other children have visited as often as possible. They came to celebrate an early Christmas with him.
Adam is expected to be moved from the hospital to the Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital at 300 1st Ave. in Charlestown, Mass., by the end of December. He is expected to be there for a few months, with Mattson by his side — as she has been right along.
People have held fundraisers and donated to help with expenses for the family. A gofundme (www.gofundme.com/4m6ltnc) page has been set up to help them.

Texto completo: LEWISTON — One final accreditation hurdle remains before Purdue University’s purchase of Kaplan University is complete.
What that will mean for the future of Kaplan’s physical campus in Lewiston remains uncertain.
“At this time, there have been no determinations made regarding the physical campuses,” Brian Zink, Purdue’s senior director of news and information, wrote in an email last week to the Sun Journal.
In April, Purdue, a renowned public university in Indiana with an undergraduate enrollment of more than 30,000 with an additional 10,000 graduate students, announced the deal to purchase the for-profit Kaplan to obtain its vast online network.
The purchase also includes the 14 campus locations throughout the U.S., including Maine sites in Lewiston and Augusta.
Kaplan, however, is confident that all the facilities will remain in operation after the sale.
“There are no plans to close any campus,” Kaplan spokesman Stephen White said.
The deal for Kaplan has already been approved by the U.S. Department of Education and the Indiana Commission for Higher Education.
All that remains is approval by the Higher Learning Commission, which is reviewing the sale, according to Steve Kauffman, a public information officer for the commission.
It is expected to rule on the matter at its next meeting in February. The commission is a regional accrediting organization that has previously certified both universities individually.
Purdue has made no secret of its desire to create a new online university with Kaplan’s infrastructure in order to expand its programs to reach nontraditional students.
Purdue has said virtually nothing about continuing the brick-and-mortar campuses.
But the Lewiston campus has one unique advantage, Zink noted.
“Specific physical campuses are utilized in certain disciplines for required lab and/or clinical training,” he said. “In the case of the Lewiston site, one of the offerings is a medical assisting program that has on-site clinical requirements.”
While the partnership does not yet have an official name, Purdue will be part of the name. The working title of the new online college is Purdue NewU.
The school will be self-sufficient, relying on tuition and fundraising to cover operating costs. Kaplan will still provide operational support.
Kaplan, which has 32,000 students nationwide, is expected to maintain its open enrollment policy.
The sale has its detractors, most notably the Purdue University faculty. More than 300 have signed a petition that opposes the deal, which was sent to the Higher Learning Commission. The faculty fears that the purchase will harm Purdue’s name, stature and reputation.
“The standards at Kaplan University are not consistent with the emphasis on academic integrity and academic rigor that Purdue University maintains,” according to one of petition’s nine reasons to oppose the deal.
Purdue President Mitch Daniels, the former governor of Indiana, isn’t worried following months of negotiations with Kaplan.
Daniels said universities must improve online access to reach the millions of adults who went to college but never finished their degrees.
“We cannot honor our land-grant mission in the 21st century without reaching out to the 36 million working adults, who started but did not complete a college degree, and to the 56 million Americans with no college credit at all,” Daniels said in a statement when the sale was announced.

Western Maine Play Museum board hopes for 2018 opening

Texto completo: WILTON — The opening of the Western Maine Play Museum will likely stretch into the summer, Angela McLeod, board president, said.
After raising $350,000 to attain a $150,000 matching grant from the Sandy River Charitable Trust in late May, the board had hoped to complete Phase I with the $500,000 and open the main house by the end of 2017.
The first phase included construction of about 4,500 square feet of exhibit room in the main house. A second phase covers renovation of a carriage house or barn into a play village for nearly $200,000.
In August, the town and the museum board learned they would receive a North Border Regional Grant for $157,000, she said. The town was the main applicant because most of these federal-state partnership grants are awarded to municipalities for infrastructure projects, she said.
The museum intends to do a water and sewer pipe upgrade from residential to commercial, and to begin a complete renovation of the 1,500-square-foot carriage house with the funding, she added.
Once they learned they would receive the NBR grant, there was a lot of paper work to do and things to consider. An architect was hired to help, she said.
“We have spent five months trying to figure out what we needed to do for the money,” McLeod said. “But now we are on the right track and construction should start back up in March and likely continue in to July. We will open as soon as possible.”
Instead of opening the main house and then doing construction on the carriage house, it seemed appropriate to complete both phases before opening, she said.
Many supporters have had opportunities to visit similar children’s museums around the state. The Wilton museum expects to also attract visitors from other communities.
“But this is primarily being built for local children who may not have the opportunity to go see something like this in another place,” McLeod said. It is one more tool in helping children overcome the circumstances of their lives, including poverty.
The opening will especially be rewarding for the many board members, supporters and volunteers who have worked to create the play museum.
“When it opens, this project will be five years old,” she said.
The nonprofit organization incorporated in 2013 with the intention of finding space and funding for a children’s play museum. The former home of Dr. Albert York and his family at 561 Main St., Wilton, was donated in 2014.

Wendall "Chummy" Broomhall, Maine skiing legend, dies

Texto completo: Maine — and the United States — have lost a skiing icon.
Wendall “Chummy” Broomhall, an Olympian, one of the most decorated skiers in Maine history, one of the driving forces behind the development of Black Mountain of Maine ski area in Rumford, and one of the most revered of Androscoggin River Valley natives, died Saturday at the Maine Veterans’ Home in South Paris. He was 98.
Broomhall’s impact was as broad as the shoulders that helped shape a region — and, nationally, a sport.
From his service to the country during World War II, to the donation of hundreds of acres of land on which Black Mountain sits today, to the innovations he brought to the Nordic ski trails at the Olympic level, Broomhall truly made an impact across the globe.
In February, Broomball made it to the 100th anniversary celebration of the Chisholm Ski Club in Rumford, where he was the oldest member. At that celebration, Broomhall sat in the Maine Ski Museum exhibit in the Black Mountain lodge and looked out the window over the slopes. Occasionally someone would come up to him and ask him to sign something, or just want to chat.
Broomhall was happy to oblige.
“Time don’t mean anything to me anymore,” Broomhall told the Sun Journal that day. “I just wanted to come to the mountain one last time.”
Growing up, and off to war
In an interview with the Sun Journal one year ago, on the occasion of his 97th birthday, Broomhall fondly recalled growing up on the family farm. One of 15 children, Broomhall said his mother made sure all of them earned their diplomas on time.
Broomhall graduated from high school in 1937. He worked as a logger until problems with his legs forced him to stop.
When World War II broke out, Broomhall was working as a stable boy taking care of horses. He and his buddy — “dumb kids,” he said — quit their jobs and marched down to sign up. Broomhall had his heart set on joining the Air Corps and was one of 20 guys chosen to take a math test. That part was fine, but his eyesight held him back.
“I didn’t pass the physical,” he told the Sun Journal in 2016. “One eye wasn’t 20/20 and I got flunked out. That was the first time somebody was looking after me — I see it that way.”
The 20 local guys who made the Air Corps were shot down somewhere in the Pacific Ocean during the war.
“They got on these rafts and floated around in the hot sun for 30 days,” Broomhall said. “They were treated mercilessly by the Japanese as war prisoners . . . but they survived. . . . I don’t know how they lived and survived.”
When Broomhall didn’t make the Air Corps, he joined the Army. The 10th Mountain Division was just being formed and he began fighting the war in the Pacific Theater. He fought there, as well as in Brazil aboard a B-17, as well as West Africa and Sicily, though after the major invasion of the Italian island after being held up in Algiers.
Back to skiing
Everyone skied when he was younger, Broomhall recalled.
“We only did cross-country skiing,” he said. “I take that back. We jumped, too.”
There were plenty of small jumps around Rumford from which he could launch. And, of course, there was Black Mountain with plenty of trails to ski and train on.
So what did he like most about skiing?
“The competition, of course,” Broomhall said, his blue eyes twinkling behind tortoise shell-framed glasses. “Before the war, I was probably the top cross-country skier there,” Broomhall added. “I won a lot of races.”
When he got back from the war, he discovered he still had it in him.
“I wasn’t satisfied until I saw if I could still beat these young guys,” Broomhall recalled last year. “I ended up getting in that race. They only picked one cross-country runner, I was it. Won it by two minutes, as I recall.”
Broomhall competed in the 1948 Winter Games in St. Moritz, Switzerland, and in the 1952 Games in Oslo, Norway.
In 1960, the United States was hosting the Winter Olympics, and Broomhall was, by default, the country’s expert.
“In 1960, there wasn’t anybody around there that did anything about cross-country so they made me the American representative to Federation of International Ski — the world governing body,” he said.
Broomhall designed the trails for the Olympics in 1960 — and again at Lake Placid in 1980 — and was chief of competition for both events. In 1960, Broomhall became the first to use mechanized equipment to groom trails, a job previously performed by feet and hand-held rakes. This was made necessary because of the icy conditions caused by afternoon sun melting the snow followed by cold nights.
Carving a legacy
And while Broomhall was always happy to lend a hand to his country — and the greater good of the sport — his heart was always with his hometown, and his family. Over the years, he donated about 300 acres and helped lay out the trail system enjoyed by thousands, both for fun, and in competition, at Black Mountain of Maine.
Today, Black Mountain’s Nordic ski trails offer 17 kilometers of terrain, all of which feed into the aptly named Broomhall Stadium. The venue has hosted the U.S. National Cross Country Skiing Championships four times since 2003, and is the site for the annual Chummy Broomhall Cup for Maine colleges, the annual Sassi Memorial Invitational for high schools across Maine, and has hosted numerous state, regional and national high school and youth races.
Broomhall was inducted into the National Ski Hall of Fame in 1981, and was an inaugural member of the Maine Ski Hall of Fame when it was founded in 2003.
His granddaughter, Reagan Carey, is the director of women’s hockey for USA Hockey. On Facebook, she summarized Broomhall with the following list:
“Grandpa, Mentor, Competitor, Storyteller, Athlete, Motivator, Teammate, Champion, Soldier, Olympian, Patriarch, Lumberjack, Encourager, Fair (except in cribbage), Lovable, Volunteer, Hard-worker, Leader, Charmer, Trailblazer (literally and figuratively), Family Man . . . THE BEST!”
Broomhall’s family is planning a life celebration this summer. Also, in lieu of flowers, the family is requesting donations be made to: The Chummy Broomhall Maine Nordic Ski Fund, c/o The Maine Community Foundation, 245 Main St., Ellsworth, ME 04605.

Mercy seeks state's approval for expansion on Fore River
Portland's Mercy Hospital is moving forward with plans to build and relocate to a new facility on Fore River Parkway despite suffering financial losses in recent years. Mercy President Charlie Therrien said Wednesday that the hospital submitted a letter of intent last week to the Maine Department of Health and Human Services to obtain a Certificate of Need for its Fore River hospital project. The current plan calls for a 108,000-square-foot facility in addition to the existing 150,000 square feet of hospital space, not including medical offices, built on the Fore River site in 2008. Following two consecutive years of eight-figure losses, Therrien said, Mercy has rebounded by focusing on efficiency and quality of patient care. The hospital reduced its net operating loss for the 2017 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, to $3.9 million from a loss of $17.4 million the previous year. Therrien said construction of the Fore River hospital, which has an estimated cost of $75 million, would not begin until Mercy experiences at least one full year of solvency following its recent losses.
Maine Med expansion could lead to spring road closures
Maine Medical Center is proposing to close about a block of Congress Street for eight weeks next spring as contractors work on adding three floors to the visitor parking garage. The plan is part of Maine Med's gargantuan $512 million expansion, which is expected to take about five years to complete and will include a new entranceway, surgery center, tower additions and a new employee parking garage. The first steps of the building and renovation project, tentatively scheduled to start in May, would be the construction at the visitor parking garage and adding two stories to the East Tower. City officials said any plan to close part of Congress Street will be heavily scrutinized because of the potential to disrupt traffic on a major road that traverses the length of the peninsula.
RETAIL
Jeweler had a white Christmas, but fell short of Rolex refund
Monday's snowstorm brought a white Christmas to most of New England, but it wasn't enough to trigger an $800,000 giveaway to customers of Springer's Jewelers. In a news release Wednesday, the company said its Portsmouth, New Hampshire, location received 4.3 inches of snow on Christmas Day, 1.7 inches less than required to activate the jeweler's Let It Snow deal. Under the annual promotion's rules, if the Portsmouth store area receives 6 inches or more on Dec. 25, the company will refund the price of any qualifying purchase made at its three locations in the two weeks after Thanksgiving. More than 400 customers shopped at the jewelry stores during the Nov. 24 to Dec. 9 promotional period and bought almost $1 million worth of products. The company carries insurance to cover the cost of the refunds, if they are ever made.
REAL ESTATE & CONSTRUCTION
Restaurants, hotel, car dealer open around Maine Mall area
New restaurants and a hotel have opened their doors in South Portland's west end, a trend likely to continue, according to city officials. Joshua Reny, assistant city manager and economic development director, said generally there has been substantial investment in the city in recent years, concentrated in the Maine Mall area, and broadening the tax base. The assessed value of the entire city totals $3.4 billion, and the Maine Mall-area properties contribute $9.1 million in taxes to the city, according to assessing officials. Tru by Hilton, a 98-room mid-scale brand hotel, opened Dec. 21 at 369 Maine Mall Road. A neighbor to Tru by Hilton is a CarMax, at 415 Maine Mall Road. The dealership will include a 6,700-square-foot building, parking for 550 used vehicles, and parking for 93 other vehicles. New restaurants include Tuscan Table and Big Fin Poke.
Panel recommends housing at former public works complex
The former public works complex on O'Neil Street in South Portland should be redeveloped into housing that fits into the surrounding residential neighborhood, is affordable to people with median incomes, and is designed to be attractive and energy efficient. Those are some of the draft recommendations issued by a 13-member reuse planning committee that spent the last 10 months studying redevelopment options for the sprawling industrial site off Cottage Road. The recommendations got a warm reception at a public forum this month and are expected to be polished up and presented to the City Council on Jan. 8. The council also will get its first look that night at a request for proposals from developers that also will be advertised in January.
LEGAL
Boothbay sued after rescinding gardens expansion permit
Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens has sued the town of Boothbay, alleging the town's Board of Appeals violated the nonprofit organization's constitutional right to due process when it voted in November to overturn the Planning Board's approval of a $30 million expansion. In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Portland on Dec. 20, Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens said the appeals board process was "tainted" in part because it allowed two members to vote after they held private meetings with abutters opposed to the expansion project. The suit identifies those board members as Scott Adams and Stephen Malcom. The board of appeals, with Adams and Malcom in the majority, voted 3-2 in November to rescind a building permit approved by the Planning Board. Richard Perkins, the board's chairman, voted with Adams and Malcolm. The project is already underway.
MARIJUANA
North Yarmouth board blocks applications for pot businesses
North Yarmouth's Select Board on Dec. 19 approved a policy that blocks applications for retail marijuana businesses while the state grapples with establishing oversight regulations. Instead of recommending a moratorium, as did nearby towns Falmouth and Yarmouth, town officials endorsed policy language adopted by other Maine communities, which will be used until state rules are determined. Then the town can decide whether to regulate or ban retail marijuana es establishments.
Lawmakers optimistic they will reach compromise on pot bill
Key lawmakers were scheduled to meet with Gov. Paul LePage on Friday to try to reach agreement on how to change an adult-use marijuana bill so it would gain his support. Members of a special committee that drafted the bill after state voters approved legalization in 2016 said they were optimistic that they could reach a compromise on issues that led LePage to veto the measure in November. The new legalization bill will be debated when the legislative session begins next week, and a public hearing is scheduled for Jan. 5. The bill would set up a regulatory framework for the sale, production and taxation of marijuana for adult recreational use.
HOSPITALITY
South Portland council delays short-term rental decision
The South Portland City Council will hold a fourth workshop on hotly contested short-term rentals next month, delaying plans to bring an ordinance regulating Airbnb-style operations to a council vote in January. It's unclear what impact the delay might have on the council's previously stated unanimous opposition to short-term rentals of entire single-family houses that aren't occupied by their owners. Five of seven councilors agreed Wednesday that the rental issue warrants further discussion, after the council two weeks ago asked city staff members to draft proposed ordinance changes for a first reading and vote in January. Mayor Linda Cohen said a majority of councilors indicated during Wednesday's workshop planning session that they want to take more time with the issue and expect to see proposed ordinance language at a Jan. 24 workshop.

Texto completo: Mainer of the Year profile on Rob Gomez, the Windham runner who helped Jesse Orach across the Beach to Beacon finish line rather than win the Maine residents category himself.
Selfless act won runner much more than a race
Here's the thing about what Rob Gomez did shortly before the finish line of the 20th Beach to Beacon 10K Road Race:
He reacted.
No foresight. No weighing pros and cons. No considering an ethical dilemma.
Gomez, running second in the Maine men's division of a race he had never won, approached the final Fort Williams curve and saw Jesse Orach, defending Maine champion, slumped on the ground, suffering from heat stroke.
"I couldn't let him stay there," said Gomez, 34, a Waldoboro native who lives in Windham. "He had run so hard and run so well that I had to pick him up and carry him across the line."
With a firm hold on one shoulder and a stabilizing hand in the back, Gomez lifted 23-year-old Orach to his feet and guided him over the grass for 75 feet before Orach finally pitched forward, rolling to his back and gasping for air.
"I feel bad," Gomez said. "I kind of shoved him across the mat."
Of course, nearly everyone else felt good about such a selfless display of sportsmanship, including finish-line judges who, by strict rules of interpretation, could have disqualified both runners. Wisely, common sense prevailed.
As a result, the actions of the guy who refused to win won the day. At Orach's request, organizers split the prize money ($1,000 for first, $500 for second), with each runner also donating $150 to race charity Let's Go. Social media was abuzz with praise for Gomez. Even the "Today" show gave him props.
Gomez's mother, a longtime waitress at Moody's Diner, still hears about it.
"I tried to deflect some of that praise because I really don't feel like I deserve it," Gomez said. "The one thing that did change for me is that getting the accolades I did made me realize I want to live up to what people think I am."
Orach and Gomez met again last month in a 5K in Gorham, the week after Gomez had placed seventh in the Philadelphia Marathon.
"He beat the pants off me," Gomez said with a laugh.
They plan to meet this winter for weekly indoor workouts. Gomez told Orach not to expect another lift next August, because Gomez figures he'll be first to arrive at Fort Williams.
"So if he happens to fall again," Gomez said, "I won't be there to take him across."

Texto completo: For years, the college football season in Maine has kicked off with a luncheon in Portland. Sponsored by the Maine chapter of the National Football Foundation, the event features short remarks from each of the stateï¿½s head coaches. They look ahead to the upcoming season, and they celebrate their game.
Every year, Jack Cosgrove spoke last.
Part of it was because at the University of Maine, Cosgrove coached the only Division I team in the state. Also, Cosgrove was so engaging, so gregarious, so passionate, who in their right mind would want to follow him?
After 23 seasons, Cosgrove stepped down as the Black Bears coach following the 2015 campaign. The sideline has a magnetic pull, though, and after two years away, Cosgrove is coming back. On Friday, it was announced Cosgrove is the new head football coach at Colby College.
Itï¿½s always nice when you conduct a nationwide search and the best candidate turns out to be 60 miles up the highway. The truth is, Colby wasnï¿½t going to find a more qualified candidate than Cosgrove.
Under Cosgrove, Maine won three conference championships and played in the NCAA Football Championship Subdivision (or I-AA, if you prefer) playoffs five times. Numerous times, Cosgroveï¿½s Black Bears were nationally ranked. Cosgrove won a school-record 129 games at Maine.
Excitement like Cosgroveï¿½s hiring hasnï¿½t been seen around Colby football in more than a decade. Cony High School football coach B.L. Lippert is a Colby graduate, and was a quarterback for the Mules in the early 2000s.
ï¿½I think itï¿½s a home run,ï¿½ Lippert said of Cosgroveï¿½s hiring. ï¿½He had such an outstanding tenure at the University of Maine and beyond that, Iï¿½ve always respected the class and professionalism that Coach Cosgrove displayed representing the university. I think heï¿½ll be a great fit on Mayflower Hill.ï¿½
All of that is attractive to Colby, which is looking to jump start a football program that won a single game last season, and hasnï¿½t had a winning record since 2005.
The differences in Division I and Division III football are largely cosmetic. The players Cosgrove coached at Maine are bigger and faster than those he will coach at Colby, but the game is the same. Football is football. Cosgrove will not be sending any players on to the NFL like he did with the Black Bears, but he will build relationships with his players and the Colby community.
At the local level, the stakes at Colby are the same as at Maine, or any college football program. Prepare players for life after the game. Run the program with class. That was the case under Jonathan Michaeles, Cosgroveï¿½s Colby predecessor, and that will not change.
On a larger scale, the goals are still local. Colbyï¿½s conference, the New England Small College Athletic Conference, doesnï¿½t allow its members to take part in the NCAAï¿½s Division III playoffs. For Colby and its in-state conference rivals Bates and Bowdoin, itï¿½s all about the CBB, the round robin rivalry that ends their season. Colby hasnï¿½t won the CBB title since 2005. Win that, and set your sights on a conference title as well.
Recruiting at the University of Maine is a chore stuffed in a mission coated in elbow grease. The Orono campus is centrally located in Maine, which puts it on the far side of everyplace else. UMaine is 200 miles from its nearest Colonial Athletic Association rival, the University of New Hampshire. Cosgrove spent more than two decades convincing talented athletes to spend four or five years hundreds of miles from home. He will find academically-motivated football players eager to come to Colby and play for him.
After two years off, Cosgroveï¿½s coaching batteries are recharged. His hiring is a signal from Colby that with new first-class facilities on the way, the school is committed to winning, too. Cosgrove is 62, but said this new challenge makes him feel younger. If he brings half the enthusiasm to Colby he brought to Maine, the Mules are in good hands.

Texto completo: Jordan Murphy scored 13 points and grabbed 12 rebounds, posting his national-best 15th double-double to pace Minnesota during a grind-it-out 65-55 victory over Harvard on Saturday in Minneapolis.
Dupree McBrayer returned from a two-game absence because of a lower left leg injury with a team-leading 15 points on 3-for-6 shooting from 3-point range, a big boost for the Gophers' backcourt with senior point guard Nate Mason sitting out to protect a sprained left ankle.
Freshman Isaiah Washington started in Mason's place and grabbed a game-high 13 rebounds to help soften the blow of a 4-for-17 shooting performance from the field.
Corey Johnson led the Crimson with 12 points, going 4 for 10 from 3-point range. The rest of the team was 3 for 22 behind the arc, including an 0-for-8 performance by Seth Towns, their second-leading scorer this season.
"We didn't get a lot of confidence and momentum there with his offensive production, which we needed," Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.
Amir Coffey, who had 12 points and five assists for the Gophers (12-3), started the second half with a corner 3-pointer to push their lead back to double digits. The Crimson (5-8) didn't fade despite their perimeter-shooting persistence, finally attempting their first free throw with 12:11 remaining in the game.
Chris Lewis, who had 10 points, converted a reverse layup before a 3-pointer by Johnson brought the Crimson within 45-42. But McBrayer sank a 3-pointer at the eight-minute mark and the Gophers survived.
Northeastern 81, James Madison 70 — Vasa Pusica scored 31 points and Shawn Occeus 21, both career highs, and the visiting Huskies (8-5) opened Colonial Athletic Association play by beating the Dukes (4-10).
 Leading by 4 early in the second half, the Huskies outscored the Dukes, 19-9, including 6 straight points from Jeremy Miller and 5 consecutive by Bolden Brace to go up, 72-58, with six minutes left.
 The Dukes got within 76-70 with two minutes left but missed their final four shots.
 Pusica, a junior transfer from San Diego who sat out last season, and Occeus scored 12 points each to open the game then Pusica scored Northeastern's final 12 of the half for a 44-36 advantage.
 Devon Begley added 10 points for the Huskies, who shot 49 percent and have won six of their last seven games. Stuckey Mosley scored 18 points for the Dukes.
St. Bonaventure 98, UMass 78 — Jaylen Adams and Matt Mobley combined for 60 points and nine 3-pointers to propel the host Bonnies (11-2) to a rout of the Minutemen (7-7) in an Atlantic 10 Conference opener.
Luwane Pipkins scored 17 points to lead the Minutemen, who fell to 0-6 on the road. Malik Hines scored a career-high 16, while C.J. Anderson added 11 points, 8 rebounds, and 5 assists.
St. Bonaventure beat the Minutemen for the sixth straight time and has won 10 of the last 12 meetings. UMass leads the all-time series, 41-29.
Butler 101, Villanova 93 — The Wildcats' perfect season is over and their reign at No. 1 probably is, too.
Kelan Martin scored 24 points and Paul Jorgensen had a career-high 23 to help the host Bulldogs upset the previously unbeaten Wildcats. It's the second straight year Butler (12-3, 2-0 Big East) has ended Villanova's perfect start.
Jalen Brunson had 31 points and Mikal Bridges finished with 21 to help Villanova (13-1, 1-1) cut a 23-point deficit to 6 with 1:33 left. But Brunson missed the front end of a 1-and-1 with a chance to make it a 4-point game.
It was a stunning twist for Villanova, which had won 10 of its 13 games by 14 or more points and was allowing 65.8 points per game.
But the difference Saturday was the Bulldogs' 3-point flurry. They made seven in the final seven minutes of the first half to take a 53-45 lead then made all five of their threes in the second half. Butler wound up 15 of 22 on 3s.
Duke 100, Florida State 93 — Marvin Bagley III had 32 points and 21 rebounds and the host and fourth-ranked Blue Devils (13-1, 1-1 ACC) pulled away late to beat the No. 24 Seminoles (11-2, 0-1).
Phil Cofer scored a career-high 28 points and Braian Angola finished with a career-best 23 for the Seminoles, who shot nearly 45 percent and hit 15 3-pointers.
Angola's three with just under four minutes remaining put them up, 91-89, but they missed their final eight shots — six of which came from long range.
Wichita State 72, UConn 62 — Landry Shamet scored 16 points to lead the No. 8 Shockers (11-2) over the Huskies (7-6, 0-1) in Hartford in Wichita State's first American Athletic Conference game.
Rashard Kelly, Conner Frankamp and Austin Reaves each added 11 points for Wichita State, which has won three straight.
Jalen Adams and Terry Larrier each had 18 points for the Huskies, who have lost three in a row and four of their last five. Christian Vital chipped in with 17 points for UConn.
Wisconsin 82, UMass Lowell 53 — Ethan Happ scored 18 points in 20 minutes, and Brevin Pritzl added 18 points to lead the host Badgers (8-7) to the easy win over the River Hawks (6-7). Josh Gantz scored 16 points to lead UMass Lowell.
Rhode Island 83, George Mason 64 — E.C. Matthews had 18 points and five rebounds and the host Rams (9-3) blasted the Patriots for their fourth straight win (6-8).
Columbia 83, Maine 71 — Quinton Adlesh had 16 points with a career-high seven assists and Mike Smith added another 16 points as the host Lions (2-10) thumped the Black Bears. Aaron Calixte led Maine (3-12) with 19 points.
Northwestern 95, Brown 73 — Dererk Pardon scored 18 points and the host Wildcats (10-5) wiped out an early deficit and rolled past the Bears. Brandon Anderson had 26 points for Brown (6-6), which saw its two-game winning streak end.
Men's hockey Northeastern 3, AIC 1 — Zach Solow broke a 1-1 tie at 7:17 of the third period and the eighth-ranked Huskies (11-5-2) got past the visiting Yellow Jackets (6-12-2).
 Nolan Stevens scored 1:06 into the game and Matt Filipe added an empty-netter with 15 seconds left to seal it for NU, which is 4-0-1 in its last five games.

Texto completo: The upper-level disturbance that triggered accumulating snow across the Chicago area moved east Friday night, followed by strengthening northwest winds that, when combined with subzero/single-digit temperatures, will produce dangerous minus 10- to minus 25-degree wind chills across much of the Chicago area Saturday morning.
High temperatures the next three days will most likely struggle in the single digits. If that does indeed occur, it will be the first time that has happened here in nearly 22 years (Feb. 2-4, 1996). The polar vortex looks to hold over Hudson Bay through a good part of next week, so there is very little relief from the persistent cold in sight.

Texto completo: PORTLAND, Maine – Plunging temperatures across half the country Thursday underscored a stark reality for low-income Americans who rely on heating aid: Their dollars aren't going to go as far this winter because of rising energy costs.
Forecasters warned people to be wary of hypothermia and frostbite from an arctic blast that's gripping a large swath from the Midwest to the Northeast, where the temperature, without the wind chill factored in, dipped to minus 32 Fahrenheit on Thursday morning in Watertown, New York.
Even before the cold snap, the Department of Energy projected that heating costs were going to track upward this winter, and many people are keeping a wary eye on their fuel tanks to ensure they don't run out.
The burden caused by higher prices and higher energy usage is felt by all Americans, especially those who struggle to stay warm.
Elizabeth Parker, 88, of Sanford, Maine, said she lives in fear of running out of heating fuel and remains vigilant in monitoring the gauge outside her trailer. She said she is allowed to request a fuel delivery thanks to federal aid, but only when her gauge dips to one-eighth of a tank.
"I couldn't get along without it," said Parker, who lives with her 93-year-old husband, Robert Parker, along with a cat, a dog and four birds.
Prolonged, dangerous cold weather this week has sent advocates for the homeless scrambling to get people off the streets and to bring in extra beds for them. Warming centers also were set up in some locations. Frozen pipes and dead car batteries added to the misery across the region.
In western New York and Erie, Pennsylvania, residents were still cleaning up from massive snowfall. Firefighters had to use a bucket loader to rescue someone trapped in her home in Lorraine, New York.
In Ohio, a dog was found frozen solid on the porch of a house in Toledo, and a third body was recovered near a car that slid off an icy road and flipped into a canal days earlier in the city of Oregon.
Despite the cold, there was some good news for recipients of federal aid from the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. President Donald Trump released nearly $3billion, or roughly 90percent, of the funding in October after previously trying to eliminate the program.
But projected energy cost increases will effectively reduce the purchasing power by $330million, making it imperative that the remaining funds be released, said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors' Association.
This winter, energy costs were projected to grow by 12percent for natural gas, 17percent for home heating oil, 18percent for propane and 8percent for electricity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Energy prices might even be higher than those projections. According to Wolfe, colder weather could lead to even higher levels of consumption, and resulting prices could push the cost of winter heating up to $1,800 this winter for those using heating oil, 45percent more than last year's level.
On Thursday, cold weather records were set from Arkansas to Maine, and the cold air will linger through the weekend, reaching as far south as Texas and the Florida Panhandle through the weekend.
In New Hampshire, the cold set a record for the day of minus 34 atop the Northeast's highest peak, Mount Washington, where a video was posted showing a weather observer emptying a pitcher of boiling water into the air, where it immediately turns to snow.
In the Midwest, temperatures in Minneapolis aren't expected to top zero this weekend, and it likely will be in the teens when the ball drops on New Year's Eve in New York City.
It was so cold that officials in New Jersey canceled a New Year's Day polar bear plunge, in which swimmers dash into the Atlantic Ocean.
A winter storm warning was in effect for much of Montana, calling for significant snowfall followed by dangerously cold temperatures as 2017 comes to an end.

Texto completo: Try describing 2017 in a concise way. We dare you.
In Maine, as in the rest of the country, it was a year that started with a loud and often ugly political debate that never seemed to end. There were scandals of all kinds and tragedies almost too immense to bear.
Locally, the idea to combine Lewiston and Auburn into one city spurred vigorous debate that occasionally mutated into something darker than typical political discourse. News of a missing TV weatherman transformed into a suicide and allegations of rape that floored the community. A deeply respected county sheriff went down in the flames of scandal after lewd photographs were given to a television news station.
The Sun Journal published a story about one woman’s brutal ride in a prisoner transport van that would outrage many and change the way authorities in Maine move their inmates. The scourge of heroin and prescription drugs continued unabated while pot began moving into the mainstream — in a confusing fit of stops and starts.
Will the slopes of Saddleback ever be dotted with happy skiers again? Is there anyone left who ISN’T running for Maine governor? Will Lewiston’s mayoral run-off system continue to produce drawn-out — but close and entertaining — races?
In July, the Costello family announced that after four generations of ownership, it was selling the Sun Journal and 16 other publications to the owner of MaineToday Media, parent company of the Portland Press Herald. Around the same time, a popular marathon runner got into a foot race with bears.
It is hard to describe the year that was and even more difficult to narrow down the selection of top news stories to just 10. We did our best, though, and what follows are the stories our news team has deemed the most interesting and impactful. Read them all and then come up with your own adjectives to describe the year that has come and gone.
• The Great Debate: The proposal to merge Lewiston and Auburn
It is difficult to imagine anything in recent years that galvanized the Twin Cities community like the proposed merger of Lewiston and Auburn.
Throughout the year, hearings and public debates were held on both sides of the Androscoggin River. Campaign signs were placed and T-shirts printed. Every time a public debate was held, the hall was full of supporters and opponents. Between the debates, the arguments still raged — in barrooms, around office water coolers and on social media pages created to further the discourse.
As the year wound down toward Election Day in November, the two sides polished their arguments like swords. Those for the merger, including the group One LA, insisted that a combined Lewiston-Auburn would be a political powerhouse with lower taxes, improved schools and a kind of community vibrancy that other cities covet. This group was represented by some of the communities’ most powerful people, Gene Geiger and Chip Morrison among them. Gov. Paul LePage and Lewiston Mayor Robert MacDonald also supported the merger.
On the other side were those passionately against the idea of marrying the two cities, in particular the Coalition Opposed to Lewiston-Auburn Consolidation led by active citizens that included Bob Stone and Robert Reed. Their vision of the combined cities portended an economically grim scene where seniors and struggling young families have to fork over $5 million in transition costs even before they are hit with $2 million in new costs related to the merger. Only a select few would benefit from the merger, they insisted. And it was those select few pushing the idea, they said.
The debate divided the people of both communities and exposed clear rifts among our public servants. And then, after months of airing the merits of the issue in debates, forums and often-over-the-top social media posts, the people of Lewiston and Auburn had the final say. They decided it emphatically: The proposed merger lost 6,540 to 3,315 in Lewiston and by 6,330 to 1,202 in Auburn.
“It is my hope that this vote will put an end to the idea of merger for at least another 100 years,” said attorney Jim Howaniec, chairman of COLAC.
• Oxford County sheriff resigns amid sex scandal
It was the kind of news that left many thunderstruck. Respected Oxford County Sheriff Wayne Gallant was accused of taking lewd photos of himself and sending them to a local woman. Worse still, the allegations claimed the sheriff was in uniform and in his office when the photos were taken.
Those who knew Gallant well said they could not believe it. The allegations, though, were impossible to deny – when news station WGME reported the allegations against Gallant in late November, the station also presented a key piece of evidence: One of the photos in question showed Gallant exposing his genitals while wearing his sheriff’s uniform.
For Gallant and his supporters, the story would only get worse. A day after the story broke, a police union official announced Gallant had propositioned a male deputy and his girlfriend, threatening to fire the deputy after his advances were rejected.
Gallant denied those claims. He did, however, admit he sent the lewd photo to a woman. He shortly after resigned from the Maine Sheriffs’ Association, of which he had served as president, but stayed on as county sheriff.
“I bring discredit to myself, to my uniform, my badge and the Maine Sheriffs’ Association,” Gallant wrote in his statement.
Even as ugly details emerged about the alleged sexual misconduct, it wasn’t immediately clear whether Gallant would lose his job as county sheriff, a position he’d held since 2006. At a county budget meeting the day the photo surfaced, Gallant insisted he had done nothing illegal.
“It was an adult thing,” the sheriff said, “that happened two years ago.”
But the scandal continued to spiral into dark places. On Nov. 27, Oxford County Administrator Scott Cole confirmed that the county was investigating Gallant.
“The sheriff tolerated, engaged in and fostered inappropriate sexual conduct within the department and workplace in violation of law and county policy on sexual harassment, all of which it was the sworn duty of the sheriff to uphold and enforce,” according to the County Commission’s complaint against Gallant.
On Dec. 6, facing the prospect of being removed by Gov. Paul LePage, Gallant resigned his position, submitting a one-page letter to the County Commission and the Governor’s Office.
• Teen’s suicide spurs community discussion
On a Friday night in late May, more than 200 people jammed into the Green Ladle at the Lewiston High School to discuss some grim facts.
They talked about the many pressures teenagers face on a daily basis. Some sobbed as they wondered aloud whether their own children were unhappy. A few of them offered up potential solutions. Mostly they just talked and cried and then talked some more.
This outpouring of grief and sharing of ideas followed the death of 13-year-old Ani Graham, who committed suicide May 23.
Graham’s death stunned and saddened the Lewiston-Auburn community. It also served as a call to action.
In the days following her suicide, community conversations were held and mental health experts consulted. Protests were organized, grief counselors were consulted and school administrators examined and then re-examined their protocols for dealing with student deaths.
In the week following Graham’s death, hundreds of students saw in-school clinicians every day for nearly a week, according to one Lewiston school official. More than four dozen students were taken to hospitals for evaluation of self-harm, and many others were identified by school staff as at-risk for harm and referred for treatment.
A month after Graham’s death, officials at the middle school still wondered if they had done all they could for the kids in the hours and days that followed.
“We won’t know for years if we did it right, and we have to carry that,” said Principal Jake Langlais. “The real answer will come with time.”
• Rough ride: Sun Journal investigation reveals horrors of prisoner transport
A jail inmate’s letter to the Sun Journal at the start of the year was transformed into a harrowing tale of prisoner abuse that forced the District Attorney’s Office to reconsider the private company it uses to transport inmates.
En route to the Androscoggin County Jail from Florida, Meghan Quinn spent five days locked in a small cage in the back of a van, her hands cuffed to her belly, her ankles shackled together. Except for infrequent occasions, the van drivers refused to stop. When her menstrual cycle started, she was forced to sit in her blood-soaked pants for hours before one of the drivers finally tossed her a pad. She was told to pee in a plastic bag and, at one point, had to use the packaging from her $2 burger as a toilet in full view of strange men, who, like Quinn, were bound and locked in the back of the van but not caged.
In a dramatic interview with Sun Journal reporter Christopher Williams, Quinn provided these details and more as she described the hellish ride she endured in U.S. Prisoner Transport van No. 1304. The result was an award-winning news story that would appall many while changing the face of prisoner transport in Maine. In the days following the March 26 report and accompanying editorial, the newspaper heard from dozens of other people who had been transported by the same company and who had endured experiences similar to Quinn’s.
In response to the unsettling allegations, Androscoggin County District Attorney Andrew Robinson announced the county would stop using U.S. Prisoner Transport. He would later reach out to district attorneys across Maine to encourage them to cancel their contracts. As result, they all did.
By the end of the year, Quinn was free and engaged in a lawsuit against U.S. Prisoner Transport.
• Meteorologist Tom Johnston’s suicide and sex assault investigation
When popular TV meteorologist Thomas Johnston was reported missing April 3, that news was stunning enough by itself. In the days that followed, the story would develop into a drama full of intrigue and darkness, leaving Johnston’s viewers and fans reeling from the weight of it.
Johnston, 46, was reported missing April 3 by his family. Police across the region were on the lookout, but particularly in Auburn. Investigators had pinged Johnston’s cellphone, which showed that he was in the area of Danville Corner Road in Auburn.
On April 6, three days after Johnston had been reported missing, the Auburn Police Department received a call stating Johnston’s vehicle had been located on Cascade Road in Auburn, and that it had been there for several days. Police searched a wooded area nearby and found Johnston’s body, according to the report. Police discovered that Johnston had cut his wrists with a razor blade, causing him to lose a significant amount of blood.
Shortly after, the story grew into something almost surreal.
Nearly a month after his body was found, Johnston was identified by police in Oxford County as the sole suspect in a sexual assault in Newry. Rumors of that nature had been circulating, but now it was official.
Police said Johnston had been in Newry for Sunday River ski resort’s Springfest when the alleged sex assault occurred. The woman who reported the assault said she had awakened from a nap to find Johnston in bed with her. Johnston had removed her clothing as she slept, the woman told police. He then fled when confronted.
Following Johnston’s death, Oxford County Sheriff’s officials announced that, had he lived, he would have been charged with felony gross sexual assault. Instead, he was mourned quietly by his family and by the people of WCSH 6, where he had been employed.
• Marijuana legalization: To grow or not to grow?
If you tried to follow Maine’s marijuana laws and regulations throughout the year, you probably got a little dizzy.
Many people bought property with a pot business in mind, but then had to wait as the state struggled to implement an approved citizen initiative to legalize the recreational use of marijuana in Maine.
On Nov. 6, the Maine House voted to sustain Gov. Paul LePage’s veto of a bill that would create legal framework for the retail sale of recreational marijuana. The bill was the result of more than nine months of work by a special committee tasked with implementing the ballot box law, but LePage and others had concerned with the legislation.
The sale of recreational marijuana is set to become legal Feb. 1, even though lawmakers failed in 2017 to put a licensing and regulatory structure in place. They continue to work on the regulations.
In a related matter, it was announced in December that the state will start cracking down on the increasing number of labs and kitchens that specialize in turning cannabis into a product that does not have to be smoked – foods, tinctures, salves and vaporizer waxes.
The state Department of Health and Human Services said processors, labs and kitchens that turn caregiver cannabis into manufactured products, such as foods, oral tinctures, topical salves and vaporizer waxes for medical marijuana caregivers, are breaking state rules and will face harsh penalties, such as losing their caregiver licenses or referrals to law enforcement. Inspectors are warning caregivers that the crackdown is to begin Feb. 1.
Maine is scheduled to start legal retail sales of recreational marijuana on July 1, 2018, the same month that Massachusetts and Canada are scheduled to begin legal sales. Medical marijuana is already legal in Maine.
• Lewiston dentist on the hot seat
The complaints against Lewiston dentist Jan Kippax were as horrible as they were numerous.
Throughout the year, a multitude of former patients came forward to detail their experiences in Kippax’s chair. Among those experiences, more than a dozen former patients claimed the dentist removed the wrong teeth, failed to provide pain medication, sliced a nerve, broke a jaw and displayed a cavalier attitude toward the difficulties that plague the often low-income people seeking treatment from him.
In February, the Maine Board of Dental Practice took action against the 57-year-old Kippax, suspending his license to practice and ordering a hearing to determine what, if any, discipline it should impose on him. That action followed nearly 200 complaints from 18 patients about the care they received from Kippax between December 2014 and the summer of 2016.
When the suspension was announced, it seemed possible the board might strip Kippax of his right to practice dentistry in Maine.
But by the time the panel got around to holding a formal hearing on Kippax’s alleged misconduct, the state had streamlined the accusations to include 64 charges involving his treatment of five patients. By the end of the year, the state had dropped 32 of the charges and the board wiped out 28 more, and part of one other. The moves left 3 1/2 charges intact, involving two patients. Those charges were the focus when Kippax’s hearing resumed Dec. 29.
James Belleau, the lawyer for Kippax, said he was convinced that once the panel heard his side of the case, the remaining charges would be tossed out. It turns out he was right. On Dec. 29, Maine’s dental overseers threw out the remaining charges against Kippax, bringing the sensational case to an end.
• Opioid epidemic continues in Maine
It was another year marked by a scourge of problems associated with the use of prescription painkillers, heroin and the synthetic opioid fentanyl. The opioid crisis continued across the country, and Maine experienced its share.
By the year’s midpoint, it was announced that 185 people in the state had already died of drug overdoses in 2017. Maine was on track to equal its grim number from 2016, when 376 died due to opiates.
In June, a woman checking on a pair of friends at an apartment on Mill Street in Auburn made a grim discovery: The man and woman living there had died from an overdose of a heroin mix. Deidre Hall, 49, was dead by the time police arrived. Her friend, 50-year-old Kevin Cooper, hung on for another day before he died, too.
For drug officials here, it was a variation on the same old story. With heroin varying from batch to batch, users have no way of knowing what they are getting.
“You don’t know what the drug is or what the cut is,” Maine Drug Enforcement Agency Supervisor Matt Cashman said at the time. “Whether it’s fentanyl, whether it’s pure fentanyl, whether it’s heroin, whether it’s a mixture. . . . You don’t know what the concoction is.”
In December, a special legislative task force assembled to address the problem of opioid addiction released a 27-page report. Among other findings, the report called for an expansion of treatment options and better education for youth on the topic of addiction.
“Every day we hesitate, (it) literally means the death of another Mainer,” said Rep. Jay McCreight of Harpswell, chairman of the task force.
Maine Attorney General Janet Mills put it in even more stark terms: “The opioid epidemic continues to devastate our communities, both rural and urban, all across Maine. It is the greatest challenge of our time.”
• Saddleback sold? We’ll see
What will become of Saddleback Maine?
Since 2015, Maine’s third-largest ski resort has been waiting for the right owner to swoop in and make it operational again. But the popular resort has remained closed for two seasons as the Berry family pursues prospective buyers.
For a time, it seemed that 2017 would be the year. Saddleback owners Bill and Irene Berry of Farmington announced June 28 that they would sell the Rangeley ski area to the Australia-based Majella Group. Majella CEO Sebastian Monsour said at that time the company would buy Saddleback by the end of the summer and turn it into the “premier ski area in North America.”
In the ski community, there was great excitement about the prospect. However, great excitement is not enough to get chairlifts working and skiers onto the slopes.
As has happened in recent years, months passed without a finalized deal. Random posts would appear on the Saddleback Facebook page, where vague details about the pending sale were offered. There was one such post in September and another in October.
In November, a post on the Saddleback Facebook page offered nothing but confusion. Monsour, who signed the post, said the Majella Group is “continuing to work to successfully finalize this sale. I am wholeheartedly committed to this deal.”
But he also deemed the pending sale a “complex and challenging deal. It has posed numerous challenges to our investors.”
Come December, as skiers at other resorts were celebrating early snow, the slopes at Saddleback remained unused, and hopes for a sale remained murky. Fans of the resort have become accustomed to dashed hopes instead of good times on the Saddleback trails.
“I’m not holding my breath given the way things have gone over the past two years,” said Tracy Sesselberg of Cape Elizabeth. “I hate to say it, but we’ve heard this all before. It’s a little like the boy who cried wolf.”
• Plenty of politics
In Auburn, Jason Levesque became mayor in November by a scant 12 votes. It was a close race that required a recount, but it turns out that in the Twin Cities, that was the easy recount.
In Lewiston on Election Night, progressive Ben Chin led the pack with 42 percent of the vote in a five-way race for the mayor’s office. His opponent Shane Bouchard grabbed 29 percent, enough to put him ahead of fellow City Council veteran Mark Cayer, who earned 24 percent of the vote.
Cayer was out. Bouchard and Ben Chin were slated for a runoff vote, as called for under Lewiston regulations, and most political insiders agreed it would be a close one. Turns out it was. A month after Election Day, Bouchard overcame Chin by a mere 145 votes, securing the mayor’s office and sending Chin to his second straight runoff defeat.
It seemed like all of politics in 2017 had to have some drama. Maine will next elect a new governor and, by the end of the year, the cast of candidates has already gotten crowded.
When U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican, announced in October she would not run, the battle to be the GOP’s candidate was on. By the end of the year, five candidates had officially declared they would run, including State House Minority Leader Ken Frechette and Senate Majority Leader Garrett Mason. U.S. Rep Bruce Poliquin is still considered a strong potential candidate, as are former Secretary of State Charlie Summers and two others.
On the Democratic side, the field is even thicker. By late December, 10 candidates had declared their intentions to run for governor, including Maine Attorney General Janet Mills and former Speaker of the Maine House Mark Eves. Another four, including former U.S. Rep. Mike Michaud and former Gov. John Baldacci, have said they might run.
The numbers of candidates were smaller in the Green and Libertarian parties, although five independent candidates had declared by the end of the year, including former state Senator and Lewiston Mayor John Jenkins.
Maine’s two U.S. senators were also in the thick of the Republican tax reform bill that was narrowly approved at the end of the year. Collins threw her support to the reform package after consulting with several economists who convinced her it would create growth without adding to the deficit. Meanwhile, Sen. Angus King expressed concern that few lawmakers actually knew what was included within the tax bill, predicting that it would be found to contain “some pretty stinky stuff.”

BONUS: Bearing down on Moninda Marube
Moninda Marube usually runs for fun and sport. In July, the professional marathon runner said he had to step it up a bit in order to outpace a pair of black bears who charged him on the Whitman Spring Road Trail, near Lake Auburn.
Marube, an Auburn resident born in Kenya, said he considered several options when the bears ran at him during his July 5 morning run.
Climb a tree? No good. Bears can climb trees, too.
Jump in the lake? Also out, Marube said, because he cannot swim.
Stand still and hope for the best? Come on! Who does that?
In the end, Marube did what he does best. He ran, adding a scream of fright to his morning routine as he dashed for an abandoned house, where he took refuge on a screened-in porch.
Marube survived the harrowing chase, which would ultimately make national headlines. In the days that followed, wildlife experts were quick to point out that when confronting an aggressive black bear or two, running is not advisable for most people.
Of course, this was not most people. It was Moninda Marube. If you want to give him advice on how to deal with wildlife, you will have to catch him first.

Texto completo: FREEMAN TOWNSHIP — Police have charged the owner of nine beagles, including three puppies, for leaving them in an abandoned, unheated garage, with an open door, to face subzero temperatures.
David Ellis, 46, of Avon, was charged Friday, Franklin County Sheriff Scott Nichols said.
“The dogs are doing fine at the shelter now; they were well-fed. The issue was the extreme cold conditions they were left in,” Nichols said in an email.
They had shelter, but the structure had an open door and windows.
“I was freezing just standing there,” Nichols said.
Ellis, apparently, had moved out of a property on Foster Hill Road, leaving the dogs for over two days without food and with frozen water, according to what a witness told police.
Someone was on the property to do some work this morning, saw the puppies and felt something should be done. With no animal control officer in that area, the Sheriff’s Office was called in, Nichols said.
Because the dogs are considered evidence and part of the ongoing investigation, Nichols declined a request from the Sun Journal for a photo of the dogs.
The dogs were removed and taken to the Franklin County Animal Shelter in Farmington, Nichols said. At that time, temperatures at the site were reported at minus 14 degrees.
Staff at the animal shelter said the dogs were in good condition but declined further comment.
Based on how the dogs respond to care and the course of the investigation, the district attorney could decide to add additional charges, according to Liam Hughes, director of Maine Animal Welfare.

Texto completo: The five men charged with attempted murder after shots were fired from a car in Calais on Wednesday night now face crack trafficking counts as well, according to Washington County District Attorney Matt Foster.
A Baileyville man and four from New York City were arrested after they reportedly opened fire on a man whom police have refused to identify. Their target was not hurt, police said.
The Baileyville man, 27-year-old Stephen Perkins, was found with 110 individually packaged doses of crack stored in his intestines, according to Foster, who handles Washington Country's drug cases.
The other men, all from the Bronx, were identified as Saul Figuereo, 20; Marcos Luis Figuereo-Frias, 21; Elmer Frias, 26; and Jordan Rodriguez, 24.
All five are now charged with aggravated trafficking of a scheduled drug, crack cocaine. Perkins also faces a possession charge, Foster said.
Each of the five has been charged with conspiracy to commit murder as well as attempted murder.
Perkins was arrested in Calais after leaping from the car he had been driving. The others were arrested 44 miles away in Brookton, after one of Perkins' passengers took the wheel and sped off.
All five were arraigned Friday morning via video conference from the Washington County jail in Machias. As of Friday afternoon, none had posted $250,000 cash bail.

Texto completo: Tim Rollins, a well known abstract artist, who grew up in Maine, died this week.
Tim Rollins, an internationally recognized artist who grew up in Maine and whose work was featured last year by the Portland Museum of Art, died this week of natural causes.
Rollins, 62, lived and taught in New York City, but was born and raised in the central Maine town of Pittsfield.
"Everyone at the PMA was incredibly fond of Tim and deeply saddened by this loss," the Portland Museum of Art said in a blog posted Thursday.
News of his passing came from the Maureen Paley gallery in London and Lehmann Maupin, a New York art gallery, which represented Rollins. The galleries said a public memorial to celebrate his life, which has not been arranged yet, will be announced at a later date.
Rollins studied fine art at the University of Maine in Augusta before earning his bachelor's degree in fine arts from the School of Visual Arts in New York City. In 1981, at the age of 26, he began teaching special education in the South Bronx. His students were classified as being academically or emotionally at risk.
"Today we are going to make art, but we are also going to make history," Rollins reportedly told his middle school students on their first day of class, Art News reported.
In 1984, he established an after-school program that became known as the Art and Knowledge Workshop, which led to the formation of K.O.S., or Kids of Survival, an artist collective that runs workshops for children.
Visitors to the Portland Museum of Art in the past year probably would have seen an oversized, colorful installation titled "A Midsummer Night's Dream" that was created by Rollins and K.O.S.
Rollins and his artists' collective began to earn worldwide recognition in 1985 when they were invited to appear at the Whitney Biennial, an exhibition of contemporary American art in New York City. That was followed in 1986 by solo exhibitions in the East Village and the Bronx.
Jessica May, arts deputy director and chief curator at the Portland museum, was instrumental in getting Rollins and K.O.S. to come to Maine in September 2016 with their art exhibition "Unbound," which drew thousands of visitors. The exhibit ended last Dec. 31.
Rollins embraced the concept of working collaboratively to create art. In 2016, he was quoted by the Portland museum as saying that he learned a lot from watching women patch quilt panels together in his hometown of Pittsfield.
"We do everything through the power of 'our,' " Rollins told the PMA. "That was the incubus for K.O.S. I said, 'You know what? If you want to build a barn, you don't study the theory and practice of barn building. You build a damn barn, and if the barn's broken, what do you do? You fix it.' I just took that homespun philosophy, and we created our own situation. Independent, libertarian. I got that from home."
During his visits to Portland, May got to know the artist she describes as "one of the most profoundly gifted artists that I have ever worked with."
"I valued him as a friend, and I think there was such deep inspiration in the way that he embedded his teaching and his art practice together," May said.
Rollins was also a skilled instructor, she said. He and his K.O.S. students combined lessons in reading and writing with production of works of art. In a creative process that Rollins called "jammin," he or one of his students would read aloud from assigned texts while everyone else drew or painted, relating the stories being read to their own life experiences.
"Tim was a real educator. He really believed in the future," May said. "I think what made him an amazing human being is he wasn't just in it for himself. He believed in helping others and paying it forward."
Several of his K.O.S. students established careers as artists, May noted.
"Tim really transformed their horizon of possibility, and he loved them," she said.
In Thursday's remembrance blog, May spoke fondly of her friend.
"He often told the story of the first work of art he'd ever seen, a high-in-the-air, rotating, electric Sunoco sign in central Maine that never failed to regain its wondrous glory in his repeated descriptions," May wrote. "I loved that story because it reinforced for me a powerful idea that art is not about propriety and boundaries, it's not about the taste of the wealthy, and it's not even really about museums and art history classes.
"Tim made it clear that art was about something wilder and more closely connected to us humans in our deepest recesses and most childlike delights. Tim also made it clear that the bright, obscure majic of art, the alchemy, was located not in it its remoteness and distance, but in its immediate accessibility, its power to transform every life."

Polar plunges in Fall River, Salem, Yarmouth postponed amid freezing conditions

Texto completo: New Year's Day polar plunges in Fall River, Salem, and Yarmouth have been postponed because of frigid temperatures.
Fall River Mayor Jasiel F. Correia II released a statement Thursday announcing that the Jan. 1 polar plunge “has been cancelled due to the dangerous inclement weather expected for that day" and “will be rescheduled for a future date."
Yarmouth's annual plunge, which takes place at Smuggler's Beach and raises money for the town's senior center, has been postponed until Jan. 21, Yarmouth Deputy Chief Steven G. Xiarhos said.
Xiarhos said there were concerns that the cold weather might increase the risk of someone having a heart attack or even drowning.
“We've been watching the weather all week," Xiarhos said. “We decided yesterday that we should postpone it."
Organizers of the Polar Bear Dip & Dash in Portland, Maine, came to a similar conclusion. Judy Berk, a spokeswoman for the Natural Resources Council of Maine, said the 5K run will still happen Dec. 31, but the “dip" portion of the event will not.
“This is the first time we have had to do this, but after consulting with medical professionals we think it is just too cold to jump into the ocean this Sunday," she said in an e-mail.
In Salem, the 9th annual Freeze Your Tush Off was also postponed because of the weather. In a Facebook post, organizers said the “real feel" temperature on New Year's Day was anticipated to be -19 with 32 miles per hour wind gusts coming out of the northwest. Such conditions, organizers said, are dangerous and would put people at risk. The event was postponed to Jan. 20.
But the brutal cold isn't stopping the L Street Brownies New Year's swim in South Boston and the Plunge 4 Pete event in Gloucester on Saturday. Organizers say both events will happen as scheduled, weather be damned.
“Yes, we're still on," said John Frates, whose son Pete has waged a much-publicized battle with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. “We have people coming from near and far, all his wild and crazy friends and all our supporters. So we really can't put the toothpaste back in the tube on this one."
The annual plunge will take place at Good Harbor Beach as planned, Frates said.
“We're going to take all precautions and not encourage people to jump if they don't feel comfortable doing so," he said. “We're gonna race in and race out."
The L Street Brownies are also moving forward with their plans to hold their New Year's swim Monday at the Curley Community Center in South Boston.
Sandy Holden, a spokeswoman for Boston Centers for Youth & Families, said there will be lifeguards on duty, Boston police and EMS will be present, and “because of the cold, we will have warm areas in the building available before and after the swim."
At a news conference Friday where Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh discussed public safety issues related to the cold, a reporter asked him whether he would tell the Brownies not to take the plunge.
“You can try to do that," he joked, adding later, “You can't force somebody not to have an event like that. It's just like we can't force somebody who's homeless to come in. . . . They might not have as big a crowd as they've had in the past, and if they are, they're going to get [out of] that water really fast."
While the weather might be iffy for swimming, it hasn't affected the operations of local ski slopes in Massachusetts. Both Blue Hills Ski Area in Canton and Nashoba Valley Ski Area in Westford reported being open for business as usual Friday morning, as did Wachusett Mountain Ski Area in Princeton.
On Thursday, Wildcat Mountain in New Hampshire had to close because of the cold. “Wildcat will be closed today (Dec. 28) due to sub zero temperatures & high winds resulting in wind chills below -50 degrees," the ski area tweeted. “The safety of our guests and staff is our priority. Sister mountain @AttitashResort is open — all tix valid there too."
But by Friday morning, Wildcat was back in business and open to skiing once again. “It feels sweet out there!" Wildcat officials wrote at 9:30 a.m. “Our summit is a balmy 5 degrees with no winds which makes it one of the warmest spots in the state of NH!"

Texto completo: When Deering High School Assistant Principal Abdullahi Ahmed has a troublesome student, he'll sometimes reach for a lifeline.
"I say, 'Let's put your mother on the phone,' and then things change," Ahmed said.
At Deering, where a mix of different languages bounce through the halls, he has an advantage phoning home: he speaks the school's three most common languages -- English, Somali and Arabic.
Research shows higher parent involvement can have major upsides for student performance, but it takes more than a common language. It takes a lot of work.
Ahmed would know. He has spent years on that puzzle, as a teacher and school administrator working to get parents of his own immigrant community more connected to the city's schools.
"I'm very passionate about it," said Ahmed, who also has a doctoral degree in education from the University of Maine.
His 2015 dissertation spells out why.
"Like many Somalis, I am concerned that the schooling experiences in my new country do not satisfy my people's hope: to prepare their children for securing social and economic gains in order to break the cycle of poverty," he wrote.
Education experts elsewhere in Maine share that concern, and they view parent engagement as one strategy for building more support around students who need it most.
The benefit can be as simple as having parents, students and their teachers agree on goals for a student, and on strategies to reach those goals based on their specific skills or shortcomings.
"Many times, parents won't have a sense of vision or what's possible for their child," said Sue Mackey Andrews, an expert in child and family development and education policy.
Ahmed said such efforts come with few added costs for school systems, which is part of the appeal.
In March, Ahmed said Portland achieved "ideal parental involvement," when school officials adopted a policy for parent engagement largely written by parents. But fulfilling those goals is an ongoing project, he said.
Some might perceive teachers as authority figures who don't want input from parents. Beyond unloading such perceptions, they also might face the challenge of picking up others.
"Newcomers usually do not have the same background to understand the culturally unspoken rules," Ahmed wrote.
Karen Keim, director of the Maine Educational Opportunity Center, said bridging those kinds of gaps are key to starting any honest and productive relationship with parents.
"You can't get family engagement unless you have their trust and their respect," Keim said. "Once you've got that, then you connect their input with the learning objectives and that's where you start having success."
While Ahmed said there's plenty of work still to be done to bring families closer to the school system in Portland, he and participants in the effort here say there are lessons in the city's experience.
Portland Empowered
Years ago, teacher and community organizer E'nkul Kanakan got his first job in Portland schools, working as a translator in classrooms and a facilitator with parents with limited English.
He began inviting parents to school events, but few showed up.
"So, we changed the venues and we went to meet them where they were," Kanakan said.
Portland Empowered, an initiative started five years ago out of USM's Muskie School of Public Service and funded by the Nellie Mae Foundation, took the lesson and ran with it.
Emily Thielmann, a Muskie School employee and coordinator for Portland Empowered, said many of the group's "youth and community engagement events are founded on the idea that every person brings expertise."
[ From Maine Public: To Help Immigrants Succeed, Parents Work With Schools To Overcome Language Barrier]
"It might look different how people are able to express it, but every single parent or guardian or grandparent that we've interacted with really values education," Thielmann said. "To take that and recognize that as a starting point, you can take a whole different kind of strategy."
To reach communities historically left out of the conversation, they recruited parents with connections to different communities to organize events for their peers.
Kanakan, who remains involved with the program, said the approach has led to "little breakthroughs" in the past two years, during which new Mainers and old Mainers crafted a list of priorities for how they wanted to interact with the school system, including a preference for in-person meetings.
The school board adopted the basic recommendations in March as part of a new policy. The policy also included a list of specific recommendations to parents, including suggestions that they talk to students about the importance of school and "inform school staff about children's strengths and challenges."
Ahmed said he couldn't point to specific ways adoption of the policy has led to increased parent engagement, but the development of the policy itself provided something of a crash course in opening those lines of communication.
"The policy and the way it came into existence is the ideal parental involvement," Ahmed said, where parents went beyond volunteering or helping with homework to change school policy.
Having that on the books, he said, gives a clear direction for parents and teachers, and a clear change in tone. The new policy uses the word "family" or "families" a combined 37 times; "community" got nine mentions. The previous policy mentioned each of those words once.
Lessons learned
Priya Natarajan, a teacher at Casco Bay High School and a parent of a middle school student, said the process in Portland holds a general lesson for school systems everywhere: Get the right mix of parents in the room and listen.
"I think it has to come organically from within that community itself," Natarajan said. "And make sure that there is a good variety of parent voices in the room."
Portland Empowered found face-to-face interactions between parents and administrators were important, but barriers such as access to transportation or inflexible work hours sometimes made that difficult. So, to get parents otherwise left out of such events, they made changes.
"Schools almost have their meetings in the morning," said Pious Ali, a policy associate at the Muskie School and coordinator for Portland Empowered. "You have to shift that and make sure that you meet parents where they are."
The events that spawned the group's parent engagement policy took place on Friday evenings.
And for parent leaders organizing the events, they offer a stipend for time where they might otherwise be working.
"If it's hard for them to make the time to be there, then we're honoring that in some way," Thielmann said.
Thielmann said the group's work "is transferrable to all sorts of groups that aren't being served fully by the education system."
As a teacher and parent in the school system, Natarajan said better relationships and communication can help students feel more comfortable in class and can give teachers and parents better information about how to support a child.
"Sometimes our students have struggles that they bring with them to school that we don't always know about," Natarajan said. "If teachers and parents have those trusting relationships, then when those students have struggles that they need help with in school, then parents will come to us."
With that kind of information, teachers can better address student needs or childhood traumas that can alter a child's brain chemistry in ways that disrupt their learning, according to Mackey Andrews.
"For many schools, it's doing stuff that doesn't cost them any money," she said. "It's being much more aware of where kids are coming from and also helping to mitigate some of the damage that untreated trauma can cause. Schools can't do it by themselves, nor should they."
Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated the institution that granted Abdullahi Ahmed a doctoral degree. It is the University of Maine.

Texto completo: New Year's is a great time to be at a mountain resort with celebratory festivities like fireworks, torchlight parades, kids' activities, snowshoe hikes and more.
And this winter promises to be one of the best in years thanks to snowstorm after snowstorm in December dropping precious powder on the slopes, especially in upstate New York, Vermont, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine. For the first time in recent memory, ski conditions in the East are better than the West for this New Year's holiday.
The Christmas storm dropped a foot of snow at Stratton Mountain, in southern Vermont, for a season total of 42 inches. Kicking off the final week of 2017, the mountain offers 68 trails and 337 acres of terrain thanks to all the natural snow along with snowmaking.
Stratton goes all out for New Year's with a number of fun events on New Year's Eve with arts and crafts for kids, face painting and caricatures by John Gurney—all in the base lodge along with a buffet dinner.
Stratton's torchlight parade usually starts around 8 p.m. Instructors carry burning torches and ski down in a snake-like formation on a hill facing the crowd. Then instructors line up on either side of a jump with fiery torches to light it up for the Stratton Freestyle Team. Skiers perform tricks like flips, 360s and cork sevens in what's called the 21 Jump Salute.
On the Sun Bowl side of the mountain, the Coca Cola Tubing Park opens on Friday. Other activities include dog sledding rides as well as snowmobiling for both kids and adults.
The fun doesn't stop on New Year's Eve at Stratton either. Just a week later, the sixth annual 24 Hours of Stratton offers a one-of-a-kind opportunity, for all ages and abilities, to ride around the clock as Stratton lights up its trails.
Ski under the stars all night long or camp out in the base lodge when you get tired.
Choose a shift or go all out. You can sign up as an individual or start/join a team. There's an opening party on Friday Jan. 5 and the epic event starts at 9 a.m. to a cheering crowd with cowbells. The 24 Hours of Stratton is a fundraiser that helps Vermont children in need.
Further north in Vermont, Sugarbush also offers a fun holiday weekend with unique festivities like a dog parade, après-ski s'mores, kids' cooking class, snowcat rides and twilight snowshoe hikes. Torchlight parade and fireworks are also on the agenda for New Year's Eve.
Although it may seem late to plan a ski getaway for New Year's, waiting until the weather forecast is out is almost the way to go these days! The latest storm dropped snow in the Catskills, Berkshires, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.
In Pennsylvania, Jack Frost/Big Boulder reported several inches while other areas nearby did not.
Snow is in the forecast for this weekend along with an Artic blast of cold promising to keep the snow light and dry making turns effortless and fun. Just take plenty of hot cocoa breaks to stay warm.
Whether it's for the entire weekend or just a night, there is still lodging availability in the Stratton area. While Stratton reports open rooms slopeside and other spots, check out nearby inns (Swiss Inn), hotels (Equinox) and bed-and-breakfasts (Silver Service Inn) for availability.
There's a saying that what you do on New Year's will stay with you the entire season so ring in this New Year's with some good cheer, unique fun and powder all around.

Texto completo: The New York Rangers announced Thursday that forward Chris Kreider will be sidelined indefinitely with a blood clot in his right arm. The 26-year-old Kreider left a 1-0 shootout win over Washington on Wednesday night late in the first period. According to Rangers coach Alain Vigneault , Kreider, a Boxford native who played at Boston College from 2009-2012, felt swelling in his arm before the game but was cleared to play after being examined by doctors. He played 5:04 over seven shifts with two shots on goal. After the first period, the swelling had increased and Kreider was sent to the hospital, where testing discovered the blood clot. Kreider, selected in the first round (19th overall) of the 2009 draft by New York, has 11 goals and 11 assists in 37 games this season. He is in his sixth NHL season, all with the Rangers. The team recalled forward Vinni Lettieri from the Hartford Wolf Pack of the AHL.
Jets' Scheifele will be out 6-8 weeks Winnipeg Jets coach Paul Maurice confirmed that top-line center Mark Scheifele will miss 6 to 8 weeks with an upper-body injury. Scheifele was hurt in Wednesday's 4-3 win over Edmonton after taking a hit from Oilers defenseman Brandon Davidson . Scheifele has 15 goals and 23 assists in 38 games . . . Penguins defenseman Kris Letang (lower-body injury) and goaltender Matt Murray (undisclosed) will not play Friday against the Carolina Hurricanes. Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan said they're both day to day. The Penguins will also be missing forward Bryan Rust and defenseman Chad Ruhwedel with upper-body injuries suffered in Wednesday's win over Columbus. Sullivan said Ruhwedel is week to week, while Rust is more long term.
Slovakia upsets United States at World Juniors Samuel Bucek scored an unassisted goal with 2:08 left in the third period to give Slovakia a 3-2 win over the United States at the World Junior Championships in Buffalo. Brady Tkachuk and Casey Mittelstadt scored for the Americans, who fell to 1-1 in preliminary round play. The US faces Canada on Friday at New Era Field, home of the Buffalo Bills. It will be the first international game played outdoors . . . Juuso Valimaki and Henri Jokiharju each had a goal and assist to lead Finland to a 4-1 victory over Denmark at the World Junior Championships in Buffalo. Joona Koppanen and Aapeli Rasanen scored as Finland improved to 1-1 in the preliminary round. Nikolaj Krag scored Denmark's first goal of the tournament while Kasper Krog stopped 58 shots . . . Artur Kayumov and Georgi Ivanov scored third-period goals to lead Russia to a 5-2 win over Switzerland. Kim Kostin and Vladislav Syomin each had a goal and an assist for the Russians, who are 1-1 in preliminary round play . . . Alex Nylander had a goal and an assist and Filip Gustavsson made 24 saves as Sweden skated a 3-1 win over the Czech Republic.
Baseball
Twins' Sano facing assault accusation A photographer accused Minnesota Twins star Miguel Sano of assaulting her after a 2015 autograph session, saying he grabbed her wrist and tried to kiss her and pull her through a door after an autograph signing at a mall. Betsy Bissen said in a tweet that she screamed and resisted Sano until he gave up "after a solid 10 minutes of fighting." Bissen, who works for publications including TwinsDaily, said she long feared that telling her story would cost her access to photograph Twins games. Sano denied any assault occurred. The Twins said they learned of the allegation Thursday. A team statement said the Twins and Major League Baseball "take these allegations very seriously" but had no further comment. Sano was an All Star in 2017, but spent most of the second half of the season sidelined with a stress reaction in his left shin.
College basketball
Millan leads Maine women to rout of BC Blanca Millan had 18 points and seven rebounds as Maine beat BC, 61-40, at Conte Forum, for its first women's basketball road win over an ACC opponent since downing Miami, 54-53, in 2007. Julie Brosseau knocked down four 3-pointers and finished with 14 points while Tanesha Sutton had 9 points, 11 boards, 6 steals, and 4 assists for the Black Bears (7-6). The Eagles (5-8) were led by Emma Guy's 13 points . . . UConn announced that redshirt freshman point guard Alterique Gilbert will miss the rest of the men's basketball season and will likely undergo another surgery on his injured left shoulder. Gilbert originally dislocated the shoulder in high school, and was given an extra year of eligibility after tearing his labrum three games into last season. He played six games this season before taking a hard hit in a loss to Michigan State on Nov. 25. The team said its medical staff and orthopedic surgeon Dr. James Andrews have recommended another surgery. Coach Kevin Ollie says doctors anticipate a complete recovery in time for the start of next season . . . Suspended North Carolina State guard Markell Johnson is facing a felony assault charge in his home state of Ohio. According to a court document, the sophomore was among four people indicted Dec. 5 in Cuyahoga County for causing "serious physical harm" to a male victim on or about Oct. 8. Johnson's next pretrial hearing is scheduled for Jan. 8. Court records show Johnson has pleaded not guilty and posted $5,000 bond on Dec. 20 . . . Maryland forward Justin Jackson , who started 30 games last year and was second on the team in scoring with a 10.5 average, will miss the rest of his sophomore season with a torn labrum in his right shoulder that will require surgery.
College football
TCU edges Stanford in Alamo Bowl Kenny Hill passed for two touchdowns, ran for another and even caught one as No. 13 TCU rallied from a big early deficit to beat 15th-ranked Stanford, 39-37, in the Alamo Bowl in San Antonio. Cole Bunce's 33-yard field goal with just over 3 minutes to play won it for the Horned Frogs, who trailed, 21-3, before storming back behind big plays from Hill and a 76-yard punt return from Desmon White . Stanford running back Bryce Love ran for 145 yards and had a 69-yard touchdown . . . Brian Lewerke threw three touchdown passes and LJ Scott ran for 110 yards and two scores for No. 18 Michigan State, which took advantage of quarterback Luke Falk's absence to rout No. 21 Washington State, 42-17, in the Holiday Bowl in San Diego . . . Mason Rudolph threw for 351 yards and a pair of touchdowns, and James Washington became No. 17 Oklahoma State's career receiving yards leader in a 30-22 victory over No. 22 Virginia Tech in the Camping World Bowl in Orlando, Fla. . . . Backup quarterback Zach Abey scored five touchdowns, Malcolm Perry ran for 114 yards and two scores and Navy beat Virginia, 49-7, in a surprisingly lopsided Military Bowl in Annapolis, Md . . . Nebraska quarterback Tanner Lee said he will skip his final year of eligibility and enter the NFL draft, a move expected after coach Mike Riley's firing and Scott Frost's hiring. Lee won the starter's job after sitting out 2016 following his transfer from Tulane. He threw for 3,143 yards, with 23 touchdowns and 16 interceptions
Alpine skiing
Shiffrin wins slalom in Austria Olympic champion Mikaela Shiffrin held on to a big first-run lead to win a women's World Cup slalom in Lienz, Austria. Backed by a 1.14-second lead from the opening leg, the 22-year-old American avoided risks and posted only the 11th-fastest time in the final run to beat Wendy Holdener of Switzerland by 0.89 seconds. Frida Hansdotter of Sweden was 1.22 behind in third. A giant slalom was originally planned but organizers swapped that race with Friday's slalom because of weather conditions caused by overnight snowfall. The win stretched Shiffrin's lead in the overall standings to a whopping 391 points over Viktoria Rebensburg . . . Dominik Paris dominated on home snow to end the season-long podium drought for Italy's men's team, capturing a World Cup downhill race in Bormio. Paris edged Norway's Aksel Lund Svindal by 0.04 seconds on the demanding Stelvio course, which was softer than usual due to heavy snowfall a day earlier. Kjetil Jansrud of Norway finished third, 0.17 seconds behind.
Miscellany
CFL would approve Manziel contract The Canadian Football League said it would approve a contract for quarterback Johnny Manziel if one is reached with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats , who have the former Heisman Trophy winner on their negotiation list. The team has 10 days to make an offer to the 25-year-old Manziel, who would remain on the list for another year even if he rejects the bid. The ex-Texas A&M star played two tumultuous seasons in the NFL until the Cleveland Browns released the former first-rounder in March 2016 . . . The Minnesota Timberwolves said point guard Jeff Teague will be out indefinitely with a sprained left knee. Teague limped off the court late in the fourth quarter of Wednesday's overtime victory over Denver. He's averaging 13.4 points, 7.3 assists, and a career-high 34.2 minutes per game in his first season with the club . . . US Open runner-up Kevin Anderson extended his dominance over Pablo Carreno Busta with a 6-3, 7-6 (7-2) win in a three-day exhibition event in United Arab Emirates, Abu Dhabi, that also features Serena Williams and Novak Djokovic . Williams, who hasn't played competitively since winning the Australian Open in January while eight weeks pregnant, is scheduled to play French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko on Saturday. Djokovic, out since retiring from his quarterfinal at Wimbledon in July because of an elbow injury, faces Roberto Bautista Agut on Friday.

Resumen: In Maine, there’s a warehouse the size of a middle school gymnasium, stuffed with brand-new medical supplies and gently used medical equipment. The National Academy of Medicine has estimated the health care system wastes around $765 billion a year — about a quarter of what we spend. Eliminating the waste would also stop our rising health care costs from eating up our wage increases.

Texto completo: In Maine, there’s a warehouse the size of a middle school gymnasium, stuffed with brand-new medical supplies and gently used medical equipment. Several pallets are piled with boxes of surgical sutures, still in their shrink wrap, each box worth hundreds of dollars. Tubs overflow with diabetes supplies and surgical instruments that may run hundreds of dollars apiece. There are bins of bandages and gauze and saline and ostomy bags and every other medical supply you can imagine. These materials, unexpired, could easily stock any hospital or clinic. But each item has actually been thrown away by a local medical facility.
The cost of health care has been rising for decades, and Americans are paying the price. In a recent Gallup poll, people cited the high cost of care as their No. 1 financial concern. It’s an enormous problem, and trying to solve it all at once brings on panic and paralysis. But after reporting for a year on the ways the medical industry blows through our money, I have one idea: Let’s end the egregious waste that’s draining our health care system.
The National Academy of Medicine has estimated the health care system wastes around $765 billion a year — about a quarter of what we spend. Eliminating all the waste could allow us to insure 150 million Americans, the Academy of Medicine said, and saving half of it could provide groceries for every household in the country for a year. Eliminating the waste would also stop our rising health care costs from eating up our wage increases. My premiums go up 9 percent next year. Same thing happened last year. Odds are your costs are rising, too.
It’s hard to downplay what I found when I began investigating the issue. Hospitals throw out so many valuable supplies that a cottage industry of charities has sprung up to collect this stuff and ship it to the developing world — otherwise, all those goods in that Maine warehouse would be headed for a landfill.
Nobody tracks how much hospitals waste rather than donate, and I couldn’t track down where each item came from. But experts told me when hospitals change vendors for a type of supply, they often toss the old stuff. Or, if they take over a clinic or facility, they get rid of the items that come with it, even if they are unused and unexpired.
The operating room is a major source of wasted spending. One hospital tracked the value of unused items that went to waste during neurosurgery procedures in a single year. The total: $2.9 million — for one type of surgery at just one hospital. In that case, the surgeons hadn’t updated their system of telling the staff which supplies to prep for each operation. They were opening many items they didn’t need, which then had to be thrown away even though they were unused. The hospital updated its approach to make sure they aren’t setting up for operations with excess supplies.
I learned that nursing homes throw away hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of valuable medication every year. They typically dispense drugs a month at a time for patients and often have them discontinued if the patient dies or transfers. The excess drugs get trashed, incinerated or even flushed down the toilets, contaminating our water supply. The chief executive of a pharmacy that serves nursing homes in Florida told me that his company alone throws away about $2.5 million a year in valuable medication.
In Iowa, the state government funded a program to recover these castoff nursing home meds and donate them to needy patients, for free. This year, they’re on pace to recover and redistribute $6 million in medication. My story led policymakers in Florida and New Hampshire to introduce legislation to try to replicate the Iowa program.
Drugs are a huge source of waste, partly because drug expiration dates don’t mean what we think they mean. The Food and Drug Administration makes pharmaceutical companies show their medication is safe and effective until its expiration date. It doesn’t make them find out how long they actually last.
Studies show it’s common for a drug to be safe after its expiration date. The FDA runs a program that tests and then extends expiration dates on drugs in the federal government’s stockpiles. Those same drugs get thrown away in pharmacies when they “expire,” even though many of them are in short supply. How much of our money does it waste? One midsize hospital in Boston throws away about $200,000 worth of drugs a year that hit their expiration date. If that’s true for other hospitals, the total would be about $800 million a year for hospital pharmacies alone.
Meanwhile, drug companies are making eyedrops two or three times larger than what the eye can even contain. We are paying for the wasted medicine running down our cheeks. I spoke to the former head of research for Alcon Laboratories, a global leader in the eye care industry now owned by Novartis. He told me that in the early 1990s his team created a “microdrop” that eliminated the waste. The microdrops were effective and reduced the burning caused by larger drops. But Alcon’s leaders killed the project because they were worried it could reduce sales.
Vials of cancer drugs are also made too large, which one study said wastes about $1.8 billion a year in the valuable medication. Earlier this year, one drug company switched from a multiuse vial, which could be shared by patients, to a single-use vial that could not be shared, thereby increasing the amount of wasted cancer medication. The change would make the supply chain more reliable worldwide, the company said. But one cancer center calculated that the change would cost each patient an average of $1,000 in waste per infusion. Imagine: You’re fighting cancer and then get billed an extra thousand dollars for medication they toss in the trash. Two U.S. senators responded to my story by introducing legislation to solve the problem of oversized eyedrops and cancer drug vials.
These are not isolated examples or small sums being squandered. Let’s say my reporting identified about $10 billion in wasted spending. That’s a rough estimate because no one is actually tracking how much we’re wasting. What else could we be doing with that money? The Kaiser Family Foundation says it costs an average of $6,690 to pay one person’s insurance premium in 2017. At that rate, the $10 billion saved could insure about 1.5 million people for a year. Tell those people it isn’t important to reduce our wasted health care spending.
The Academy of Medicine did something smart when it reframed our health care overspending as waste. We may be a wasteful country, but we still teach our kids to eat everything on their plates. “Waste not, want not,” is baked into our cultural DNA. It’s a powerful concept because it’s a moral one. It’s wrong to squander the hard-earned dollars Americans are paying into the health care system and then demand they pay more.
We can’t be naive and think it will be easy to fix this problem. Our wasted spending represents revenue and profit for the medical industry. But our health care spending should not be an entitlement program for the medical industrial complex. I put together a prescription for reducing the wasted spending I identified. Our policymakers should stand up to the medical industry and stamp out the waste.

Former Celtic Gerald Green signs with Rockets

Texto completo: The Celtics are minus 11 players from last year's roster, so this season there has been a constant flow of former players making their returns to TD Garden. On Thursday, there was one previously unscheduled addition to the list.
Forward Gerald Green , who averaged 5.6 points and 1.8 rebounds for Boston last season, signed with the Rockets on Thursday morning, and by nightfall he was in uniform for his new team's game at TD Garden.
“Things ended good in Boston," Green said, who was scoreless in 11 minutes in the Celtics' 99-98 win over the Rockets. “Boston, obviously they made a lot of changes to their roster this year, and it's for the better. They're the No. 1 team in the East if I'm not mistaken, and they're doing well. So things for me in Boston did not end bad."
Green said he was surprised by the Celtics' extensive reconstruction after winning 53 games last season.
“But Danny Ainge , he's a genius, man," Green said. “He knows what he's doing. Every year he makes changes that nobody knows. And for some reason they always be successful the next year. So I'm pretty happy for where they are."
Green had a minor role with the Celtics last season, but then he stepped into an improbable position as a starter after they fell behind the eighth-seeded Bulls, 2-0, in the opening round of the playoffs.
Green started the next four games of that series, and the Celtics won each. Green's highlight was an 18-point, 7-rebound performance in Game 4. Celtics coach Brad Stevens on Thursday said Green was a big part of why Boston advanced to the conference semifinals. When that sentiment was relayed to Green, he waved off the praise.
“I'd tell him he's being modest," Green said. “I think it was a team thing. Obviously the way he was able to make adjustments [in] Game 3, Game 4, and throughout the rest of the playoffs was big as well."
Green was an unrestricted free agent last summer. He was signed by the Bucks in September before being released at the end of training camp. He said he was told he had made the team, and then the morning after the last preseason game, he said, the franchise had a change of heart. But now he is glad to get a fresh opportunity.
“I already know how I feel about Houston," Green said. “Especially with everything that Houston's been through this summer, for me to just be a part of this team and how they're playing right now, it's like this definitely was my Christmas gift."
Bennett brought in The Celtics' G-League affiliate, the Maine Red Claws, traded for former No. 1 overall pick Anthony Bennett on Thursday. Bennett was selected by the Cavaliers first overall in 2013 but averaged just 4.4 points and 3.8 rebounds over four mostly disappointing seasons with the Cavs, Timberwolves, Raptors, and Nets. Still, the 6-foot-8-inch forward is just 24 and is a talented rebounder.
The Celtics have a roster spot but cannot call up Bennett from Maine. If they wish to add him to the team they would need to sign him to a contract. Also, any NBA team can sign Bennett while he is playing for the Red Claws.
But Bennett's presence in Maine gives the Celtics a good opportunity to get an up-close look at a mostly discarded prospect. Also, the Red Claws run the same system as the Celtics, so Boston's brass can see how he fares in it.
“We all know that the G-League is being evaluated every day by every team's scouts. So regardless for your organization or for the other 29, it's a good thing for the player," Stevens said. “Then, for us, it's great because it gives us a chance to coach guys and be around guys and learn about guys that you don't know as much about until you're really around them and coaching them. [Red Claws coach] Brandon Bailey — we look at Brandon and Alex [ Barlow , his assistant] and their staff as part of our staff. We're in constant contact with those guys, they do what we do, it's a real benefit, I think."
The Red Claws acquired Bennett and a third-round pick from Phoenix's affiliate, the Northern Arizona Suns, in exchange for a second-round pick and the rights to former Harvard standout Wesley Saunders .
Paul sits out Rockets All-Star Chris Paul on Thursday missed his third consecutive game with a groin injury. Houston also was without starting center Clint Capela , who suffered an orbital fracture in the team's Christmas Day loss to the Thunder . . . For the Celtics, Jaylen Brown missed his second game in a row with a sore knee and backup forward Semi Ojeleye sat out with back soreness . . . New York Yankees general manager Brian Cashman attended Thursday's game. He received a locker room tour from longtime Celtics equipment manager John Connor , where Cashman took pictures of his son, Teddy , with Celtics Jayson Tatum , Terry Rozier , and Marcus Morris .

11 degrees at midnight
in Times Square that will feel like minus-10 degrees."
Paul Walker
AccuWeather senior meteorologist
All the drinks will be on ice for this party.
Revelers in New York's Times Square could face the coldest New Year's Eve celebration in more than 50years as a brutal wave of arctic air tightens its iron grip on much of the nation.
"We are predicting 11 degrees at midnight in Times Square that will feel like minus-10 degrees," AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Paul Walker said. "But everybody from the Rockies eastward is going to experience severe cold through the end of 2017 and into 2018."
The 11 degrees would tie for the second-coldest New Year's Eve on record, matching the temperature in 1962, Walker said. Times Square was a record 1 degree above zero for the party in 1917.
Winds of up to 20 mph will add to the woes facing this year's partiers, Walker said. But few cities will be spared. Boston is looking at 8 degrees with a "feels like" temperature of -21.
Chicagoans can look forward to a relatively balmy 9 degrees that will feel like -3. Even Atlanta will be freezing: 29 degrees that will feel like 24.
"People will really need to bundle up if they are heading out Sunday night for New Year's Eve celebrations in places like Chicago, for example, where the high will be 15 degrees on Sunday, around 15 degrees below normal," AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Dan Pydynowski said.
Gusty winds and frigid air will conspire over the next couple of days to bring nasty weather to the region. Wind-chill advisories were in effect for parts of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York, AccuWeather said.
New Yorkers should get used to the cold. AccuWeather is calling for 11 straight days of high temperatures below freezing. New York City's Emergency Management agency issued a warning for extreme cold and published a guide on social media that urged residents to wear layers and keep their ears covered.
The guide also lists frostbite symptoms, such as discolored skin and numbness.
But alas, New York, snow is not in the picture, at least for now.
"It is looking less and less likely," Walker said.
"If it's going to be that cold, you might as well have some snow with it."

Texto completo: "We are predicting
11 degrees at midnight
in Times Square that will feel like minus-10 degrees."
Paul Walker
AccuWeather senior meteorologist
All the drinks will be on ice for this party.
Revelers in New York's Times Square could face the coldest New Year's Eve celebration in more than 50years as a brutal wave of arctic air tightens its iron grip on much of the nation.
"We are predicting 11 degrees at midnight in Times Square that will feel like minus-10 degrees," AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Paul Walker said. "But everybody from the Rockies eastward is going to experience severe cold through the end of 2017 and into 2018."
The 11 degrees would tie for the second-coldest New Year's Eve on record, matching the temperature in 1962, Walker said. Times Square was a record 1 degree above zero for the party in 1917.
Winds of up to 20 mph will add to the woes facing this year's partiers, Walker said. But few cities will be spared. Boston is looking at 8 degrees with a "feels like" temperature of -21.
Chicagoans can look forward to a relatively balmy 9 degrees that will feel like -3. Even Atlanta will be freezing: 29 degrees that will feel like 24.
"People will really need to bundle up if they are heading out Sunday night for New Year's Eve celebrations in places like Chicago, for example, where the high will be 15 degrees on Sunday, around 15 degrees below normal," AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Dan Pydynowski said.
Gusty winds and frigid air will conspire over the next couple of days to bring nasty weather to the region. Wind-chill advisories were in effect for parts of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York, AccuWeather said.
New Yorkers should get used to the cold. AccuWeather is calling for 11 straight days of high temperatures below freezing. New York City's Emergency Management agency issued a warning for extreme cold and published a guide on social media that urged residents to wear layers and keep their ears covered.
The guide also lists frostbite symptoms, such as discolored skin and numbness.
But alas, New York, snow is not in the picture, at least for now.
"It is looking less and less likely," Walker said.
"If it's going to be that cold, you might as well have some snow with it."

Texto completo: "We are predicting
11 degrees at midnight
in Times Square that will feel like minus-10 degrees."
Paul Walker
AccuWeather senior meteorologist
All the drinks will be on ice for this party.
Revelers in New York's Times Square could face the coldest New Year's Eve celebration in more than 50years as a brutal wave of arctic air tightens its iron grip on much of the nation.
"We are predicting 11 degrees at midnight in Times Square that will feel like minus-10 degrees," AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Paul Walker said. "But everybody from the Rockies eastward is going to experience severe cold through the end of 2017 and into 2018."
The 11 degrees would tie for the second-coldest New Year's Eve on record, matching the temperature in 1962, Walker said. Times Square was a record 1 degree above zero for the party in 1917.
Winds of up to 20 mph will add to the woes facing this year's partiers, Walker said. But few cities will be spared. Boston is looking at 8 degrees with a "feels like" temperature of -21.
Chicagoans can look forward to a relatively balmy 9 degrees that will feel like -3. Even Atlanta will be freezing: 29 degrees that will feel like 24.
"People will really need to bundle up if they are heading out Sunday night for New Year's Eve celebrations in places like Chicago, for example, where the high will be 15 degrees on Sunday, around 15 degrees below normal," AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Dan Pydynowski said.
Gusty winds and frigid air will conspire over the next couple of days to bring nasty weather to the region. Wind-chill advisories were in effect for parts of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York, AccuWeather said.
New Yorkers should get used to the cold. AccuWeather is calling for 11 straight days of high temperatures below freezing. New York City's Emergency Management agency issued a warning for extreme cold and published a guide on social media that urged residents to wear layers and keep their ears covered.
The guide also lists frostbite symptoms, such as discolored skin and numbness.
But alas, New York, snow is not in the picture, at least for now.
"It is looking less and less likely," Walker said.
"If it's going to be that cold, you might as well have some snow with it."

Texto completo: "We are predicting
11 degrees at midnight
in Times Square that will feel like minus-10 degrees."
Paul Walker
AccuWeather senior meteorologist
All the drinks will be on ice for this party.
Revelers in New York's Times Square could face the coldest New Year's Eve celebration in more than 50years as a brutal wave of arctic air tightens its iron grip on much of the nation.
"We are predicting 11 degrees at midnight in Times Square that will feel like minus-10 degrees," AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Paul Walker said. "But everybody from the Rockies eastward is going to experience severe cold through the end of 2017 and into 2018."
The 11 degrees would tie for the second-coldest New Year's Eve on record, matching the temperature in 1962, Walker said. Times Square was a record 1 degree above zero for the party in 1917.
Winds of up to 20 mph will add to the woes facing this year's partiers, Walker said. But few cities will be spared. Boston is looking at 8 degrees with a "feels like" temperature of -21.
Chicagoans can look forward to a relatively balmy 9 degrees that will feel like -3. Even Atlanta will be freezing: 29 degrees that will feel like 24.
"People will really need to bundle up if they are heading out Sunday night for New Year's Eve celebrations in places like Chicago, for example, where the high will be 15 degrees on Sunday, around 15 degrees below normal," AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Dan Pydynowski said.
Gusty winds and frigid air will conspire over the next couple of days to bring nasty weather to the region. Wind-chill advisories were in effect for parts of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York, AccuWeather said.
New Yorkers should get used to the cold. AccuWeather is calling for 11 straight days of high temperatures below freezing. New York City's Emergency Management agency issued a warning for extreme cold and published a guide on social media that urged residents to wear layers and keep their ears covered.
The guide also lists frostbite symptoms, such as discolored skin and numbness.
But alas, New York, snow is not in the picture, at least for now.
"It is looking less and less likely," Walker said.
"If it's going to be that cold, you might as well have some snow with it."

Texto completo: "We are predicting
11 degrees at midnight
in Times Square that will feel like minus-10 degrees."
Paul Walker
AccuWeather senior meteorologist
All the drinks will be on ice for this party.
Revelers in New York's Times Square could face the coldest New Year's Eve celebration in more than 50years as a brutal wave of arctic air tightens its iron grip on much of the nation.
"We are predicting 11 degrees at midnight in Times Square that will feel like minus-10 degrees," AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Paul Walker said. "But everybody from the Rockies eastward is going to experience severe cold through the end of 2017 and into 2018."
The 11 degrees would tie for the second-coldest New Year's Eve on record, matching the temperature in 1962, Walker said. Times Square was a record 1 degree above zero for the party in 1917.
Winds of up to 20 mph will add to the woes facing this year's partiers, Walker said. But few cities will be spared. Boston is looking at 8 degrees with a "feels like" temperature of -21.
Chicagoans can look forward to a relatively balmy 9 degrees that will feel like -3. Even Atlanta will be freezing: 29 degrees that will feel like 24.
"People will really need to bundle up if they are heading out Sunday night for New Year's Eve celebrations in places like Chicago, for example, where the high will be 15 degrees on Sunday, around 15 degrees below normal," AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Dan Pydynowski said.
Gusty winds and frigid air will conspire over the next couple of days to bring nasty weather to the region. Wind-chill advisories were in effect for parts of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York, AccuWeather said.
New Yorkers should get used to the cold. AccuWeather is calling for 11 straight days of high temperatures below freezing. New York City's Emergency Management agency issued a warning for extreme cold and published a guide on social media that urged residents to wear layers and keep their ears covered.
The guide also lists frostbite symptoms, such as discolored skin and numbness.
But alas, New York, snow is not in the picture, at least for now.
"It is looking less and less likely," Walker said.
"If it's going to be that cold, you might as well have some snow with it."

Texto completo: All the drinks will be on ice for this party.
Revelers in New York's Times Square could face the coldest New Year's Eve celebration in more than 50 years as a brutal wave of arctic air tightens its iron grip on much of the nation.
"We are predicting 11 degrees at midnight in Times Square that will feel like minus-10 degrees," AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Paul Walker warned. "But everybody from the Rockies eastward is going to experience severe cold through the end of 2017 and into 2018. "
The 11 degrees would tie for the second-coldest New Year's Eve on record, matching the temperature in 1962, Walker said. Times Square was a record 1 degree above 0 for the party in 1917.
Winds of up to 20 mph will add to woes facing this year's partiers, Walker said. But few cities will be spared. Boston is looking at 8 degrees with a "feels like" temperature of -21. Chicagoans can look forward to a relatively balmy 9 degrees that will feel like -3. Even Atlanta will be freezing: 29 degrees that will feel like 24.
“People will really need to bundle up if they are heading out Sunday night for New Year's Eve celebrations in places like Chicago, for example, where the high will be 15 F on Sunday, around 15 degrees below normal,” AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Dan Pydynowski warned.

Gusty winds and frigid air will conspire over the next couple of days to bring nasty weather to the region. Wind-chill advisories were in effect for parts of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York, AccuWeather said.
New Yorkers should get used to the cold. AccuWeather is calling for 11 straight days where the city's high stays below freezing. New York City's Emergency Management agency issued a warning for extreme cold and published a guide on social media that urged residents to wear layers and keep their ears covered.
The guide also lists frostbite symptoms, such as discolored skin and numbness.
Skiers in New England could face temperatures near minus 30 degrees as an "expansive portion" of the Northeast faces frostbite-ready conditions, AccuWeather said.
Wind-chill advisories or warnings are in effect for all of North Dakota and Wisconsin as well as swaths of South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Michigan and Indiana. Green Bay, Wis. , woke up to -13 degrees. Minneapolis struggled to break above 0 degrees as noon approached — while it was still -10 in Fargo, N. D.
The severe cold swept through the region as much of the northern tier was fending off the final assault of a snow barrage that dumped a record 34 inches of snow on Erie, Pa. , on Christmas Day. Including snow in the days before the holiday and another wall of white on Tuesday, the area has seen about 63 inches since Saturday.
The city of Erie declared a snow emergency, citing "dangerous and impassable" roads:
"This is an incredible amount of snow that we're trying to move and appreciate resident cooperation. "
The snow isn't done. Another blast is forecast for Thursday in places such as Des Moines, Iowa, Minneapolis, Chicago, Milwaukee, Detroit, Cleveland and Pittsburgh, AccuWeather said.
Earlier this week, meteorologists theorized the storm could join up with another storm off the Atlantic coast over the coming weekend to bring heavy snow to parts of New York state and New England. Now, that appears unlikely, he said.
"It is looking less and less likely that those storms are going to hook up in New York state," said Walker, who suggested that New Yorkers would be disappointed at the news. "If it's going to be that cold, you might as well have some snow with it. "

Texto completo: Home to nearly 50 sled dogs, Lone Wolf Kennel is a serious sled dog racing outfit just outside of Greenville, and they offer a variety of guided tours for people who want to experience aspects of the sport firsthand.
The kennels are owned and operated by two registered Maine guides, Mark and Ashley Patterson, who are married and live right on the property. Both of the Pattersons lead the sled-dog tours, as well as a variety of other guided outdoor adventures year round, including moose watching tours, fishing trips and hikes.
For sled dog experiences, the couple currently offers a few options. The first option is a kennel tour, which includes a 3-mile ride pulled by a sled dog team driven by one of the Pattersons, as well as a tour of the dog yard and plenty of photo opportunities. During the ride, each participant is covered with a sleeping bag and sled bag in a canoe chair in a toboggan-style sled.
"It's actually really good for families and people who just aren't physically fit, don't have the ability to be out there for hours at a time," Mark Patterson said.
My Experience: The dogs announced my arrival on Wednesday, Dec. 20, when I pulled into the snowy driveway of Lone Wolf Kennels and parked beside the barn. Their excited yips only mounted as I slogged through the fresh powder toward the dog yard.
Because I've visited other sled dog kennels in Maine, the setup of the dog yard didn't surprise me. Each dog had its own house and space to roam, and they were confined to that space on a chain so they could move freely but couldn't reach their neighbors. With nearly 50 dogs sharing the same yard, I imagine it's very important that they each have their own space. Another detail I noticed was that they each had their own bone to chew on, and straw in their houses to keep them warm and comfortable.
I was there to ask the Pattersons about the upcoming sled dog racing season, not to go on a tour or mush my own team, so I spent most of the time in the dog yard, where the Pattersons were busy cleaning and suiting up a team with harnesses and booties for a 23-mile practice run on nearby logging roads. Because the snowpack wasn't quite thick enough to use the sled, Ashley Patterson would be mushing from a four-wheeler, with a team of 18 dogs leading the way. As she hit the trail with her team, her husband, Mark, offered to drive me to a checkpoint on the route so I could see them in action. He then drove me back to the dog yard, where he explained more about raising, training and housing their 48 sled dogs.
"These guys got such good socializing at a young age that they've no fear of people, which is great for racing and tours," he told me.
We walked around the yard visiting the many dogs that hadn't been selected for the day's practice run, and Mark Patterson explained that it's a common practice to name sled dog litters by themes. Their sled dog Tuba, for example, belonged to their instruments litter, while Slinky belonged to the toys litter, and Whiskey and Cognac were brothers of their hard beverages litter. Using themes makes it easier for them to remember the dogs' names, and it also helps them keep remember of dogs are related and their schedules for vaccines and deworming treatments. But when it comes right down to it, the owners just have to know their dogs, individually, and be attentive to any changes. Each dog eats a specific amount of food per day, and the dogs wear different styles of harnesses, depending on their body type and fur thickness. And each dog has different temperament, quirks and tendencies.
"They all have distinct personalities," Mark Patterson said.
On Dec. 20, these many differences were evident to me. From the start, I noticed how different the sled dogs appeared physically, some with blue eyes and others with brown. Their coats varied from black to white to brown. Some had pointy ears. Some didn't. And as I walked around, I noticed that while most dogs greeted me with wagging tails and excited barks, a select few retreated to their little houses, where they nestled into the straw and watched my movements with interest. Some of the young dogs were mouthy, nipping gently at my mittens and hair. Being a big dog lover, I was in heaven. And when I got home that evening, my own dog, Oreo, seemed very excited and confused as he furiously sniffed my jacket, pants and boots. I'd been hugging sled dogs for hours, after all.

Texto completo: FARMINGTON — A holiday concert helped raise more than $14,000 to help people with the cost of heating their homes in Franklin County through the ECU HEAT “50 for $50” program.
The Franklin County Ecumenical Heating Fund concert on Dec. 14 was organized by the Old South Congregational Church in coordination with New England Celtic Arts, featuring Andrew Harris reciting “A Child’s Christmas in Wales” and Matt and Shannon Heaton, who performed Christmas music on guitar and flute while Shannon sang.
ECU HEAT sponsors, Barbara A. Black, Rockwell and Stephanie Bjorn, the Farmington Rotary Club, Louise McCleery and Kate Foster provided $3,500 toward the goal of raising $5,000 at the concert.
Donations at the concert, along with a portion of ticket sales, garnered $4,000. Donations received through the mail between Dec. 1 and Dec. 15 raised $1,575, bringing the total to $9,075.
This amount more than qualified ECU HEAT for a $5,000 matching grant promised by Sandy River Charitable Foundation.
The ECU HEAT ministry expressed gratitude to all who give so generously to help keep our neighbors warm.
The “50 for $50” program delivers 50 gallons of oil, kerosene, propane, firewood or pellets, depending on the source of heat, to any low income applicant.
The applicant attaches a $50 money order, payable to their regular fuel vendor, with their application. Applications for assistance are available at Western Maine Community Action in East Wilton and at town halls and churches throughout Franklin County.
While applicants pay a $50 share for the delivery, the remainder of the cost is paid by ECU HEAT, a ministry of the Farmington Area Ecumenical Ministry.
For example, a 50-gallon delivery of kerosene at $3.05 per gallon costs $152.50. After the applicant’s $50 share is applied, WMCA pays the balance, $102.50 and then bills ECU HEAT for reimbursement. ECU HEAT receives bills for between 50-100 deliveries every month.
ECU HEAT is only able to make one delivery per household per heating season (November-March), as long as funds are available. Residents of Jay may call WMCA to request assistance from the Good Neighbor Fund serving the Tri-Town area.
In dire emergencies, churches or General Assistance funds from towns may cover the cost of the applicant’s share.
Donations are tax-deductible and are promptly acknowledged. Checks payable to ECU HEAT may be mailed year-round to ECU HEAT, P.O. Box 147, Farmington, ME 04938.

Texto completo: FARMINGTON — Selectmen approved acceptance Tuesday of a Homeland Security grant for $13,500 to buy a rescue strut kit for the fire-rescue department.
The equipment is used to stabilize larger, heavy-duty vehicles, such as buses or tractor trailers, during a rescue extrication, Captain Tim D. Hardy said.
The department has one rescue strut kit it uses for lighter vehicles, but this equipment can lift heavy vehicles up to 10 tons and be used for shoring up a collapsed building or trench, Hardy said.
None of this equipment has been available for response in the local area, Hardy said. With all the large truck traffic, buses and forest and construction vehicles traveling through the area, Hardy explored funding sources.
The new equipment will be housed on the department’s rescue unit, which responds throughout the county and region, according to Hardy. Training to use the equipment is included in the purchase price.
The department is purchasing the equipment from Harrison Shrader Enterprises of Lewiston.
The fire department needs to first purchase the equipment and will then be fully reimbursed through the grant, Fire Chief Terry Bell said.
Selectmen authorized using the amount from the department’s equipment reserve account, which will be reimbursed when the grant funding is provided.
In other business, Police Chief Jack Peck sought approval to apply and receive grants from the Maine Bureau of Highway Safety.
Peck was recently informed that the department was given approval for the grant funds during 2018 if they apply. The funds are used on specific details.
Recognizing the need to curtail distracted driving, the amount available to the department was raised to $14,309.07, he said.
An impaired driving grant will provide $4,655.63 while seat-belt enforcement or the “click it or ticket” program will receive $4,254.24 and speed enforcement will get $4,110.33.
Selectmen also approved an ongoing $1,000 grant for 2018 to the police department to use on underage-drinking enforcement.
The grant is provided by the Healthy Community Coalition through a Drug Free Communities Grant.
The funds will be used for overtime to allow officers to do these details, Peck said.
Selectmen agreed to hold a special meeting at 6:30 p.m. Tuesday, Jan. 2, for their first review of the 2018 departmental budget requests.

Mayor Levesque to put focus on Auburn's brand

Texto completo: AUBURN — Mayor Jason Levesque wants people outside Auburn to know what the city has to offer. He also wants people to know that Auburn is really close to Portland.
“It’s one of the reasons that I ran,” Levesque said Wednesday, after spending a few hours at his office at Auburn Hall, where he goes a few days a week. “We have an amazing set of assets that people outside Auburn don’t know about.”
During the first City Council meeting of the new year, Levesque plans to make good on a few promises he made about a month ago during his inauguration.
On Jan. 8, he plans to announce the formation of an economic-advisory committee that will work to create a branding campaign for the city, which he said will “continue the work” Auburn has already been doing to raise its profile in southern Maine.
He said the committee will include the “best and brightest” from the private sector, as well as business people who he described as having a “vested interest” in Auburn, but do not necessarily live in the city. That could mean real estate agents or marketing professionals. Levesque, owner of Argo Marketing in Lewiston, said when he brings business colleagues to Lewiston-Auburn from elsewhere in the state or country, most of them are surprised by what Auburn has.
During his inaugural address, he told the audience multiple times that he wants Auburn to be recognized “throughout the Northeast.”
On Wednesday, he quickly rattled off a few reasons why.
The list, he said, includes a ski mountain, three golf courses, an indoor turf facility, an ice arena with two rinks, shopping, restaurants, a downtown “ and more land and agricultural conservation than the entire city of Portland has land.”
“If you throw in that our housing costs are 30 percent less than Cumberland County, I think you have a pretty good motivation” for people to move here, he said.
The economic advisory committee is also something Levesque wants to move quickly. He would like the committee to have a plan in place in 90 days, heading into spring.
He also said he is hoping the committee can formulate something that the City Council, city staff and the businesses and residents of Auburn can “all get behind.”
City Manager Peter Crichton said Wednesday that he has talked with Levesque about bolstering Auburn’s brand since the election.
Levesque beat challenger Adam Lee by six votes on Nov. 7, and a recount on Nov. 21 confirmed a 12-vote victory. On Dec. 3, he was handed the reigns by outgoing three-term Mayor Jonathan LaBonte.
Crichton said he agrees that the city needs to find “more ways to get the message out” that Auburn is a great place to live. Both he and Levesque said Wednesday that population growth and economic development work hand-in-hand.
Prior to being hired in Auburn late last year, Crichton spent 18 years as the county manager for Cumberland County, which makes him familiar with the dynamic or Auburn’s reputation – or lack of one – in southern Maine.
“I think there’s something about New Englanders,” he said. “We don’t toot our horn enough.”
Lately, he said, the city has begun producing an online “Auburn Connections” newsletter, with updates from his office as well as other departments. He also gave a nod to Liz Allen, the city’s communications manager, for work she has tackled in getting good news stories to the public.
He said he believes Auburn has some positive momentum going with separate studies moving ahead to look at the agricultural zone and sports tourism, as well as the announcement of a new junior hockey club at Norway Savings Bank Arena.
“One of my goals is to make Auburn one of the best small cities in America,” he said.
At the end of January, Levesque also plans to roll out a task force to come up with a unified strategic plan, or work plan, for officials to follow over the next five years.
He said over the years, the city has accumulated a number of plans and studies, and that it needs to take an inventory and look at the results so far.
“Are we falling short or are we not?” he said. “Let’s combine everything and make that the guiding document for city staff as well as this City Council and future councils to execute.”
Levesque said he would like the task force to consist of city staff and private individuals, much like the economic advisory committee.
On Wednesday, Levesque came back to the proximity involved in pitching Auburn as a greater Portland suburb.
When the branding campaign comes together, he said, he is hoping to get input from real estate agents about what people are seeking in southern Maine.
“Auburn should be the northernmost suburb of Portland, and there’s nothing wrong with being that,” he said. “It’s about shrinking the psychological space between Portland and Auburn.”

Texto completo: Feature from the Red Claws Christmas Showcase basketball tournament
It's not the draw it once was, but for fans like Doug Clukey, the value of the Red Claws Christmas Showcase is still unbeatable.
"I'm a high school sports fan and it's the cheapest form of entertainment an old man can have," said Clukey, a 77-year-old retired elementary school teacher from North Yarmouth.
Clukey paid $3 for his senior citizen/student ticket ($5 for adults), and watched three full games and parts of two others during Tuesday's seven-game opening day at the Portland Expo.
And he said he'll be back for Wednesday's 11:30 a.m. opener between Gray-New Gloucester and Massabesic.
"I'm going to have to leave for a while because my wife has other plans. You have to make certain accommodations over 54 years," Clukey joked. "But I'll be back for the 2:30 game."
The showcase has seven games both Wednesday and Thursday. Most are exhibition games. Wednesday's 7 p.m. Falmouth vs. Cape Elizabeth boys' game, and the Portland vs. Deering girls'/boys' doubleheader starting at 7 p.m. Thursday are regular-season games.
There will be plenty of seats available. The crowd was in the 200-300 range for Tuesday's games, a far cry from when the Expo's holiday event used a tournament format.
"I was here for 14 years when it was a tournament, and you had brackets and it was exciting, and it's sad to see it like it is now," said South Portland Coach Kevin Millington.
The combination of teams playing a regular-season game during the holiday break and being limited to five exhibition contests by the Maine Principals' Association ended the tournament format three years ago.
Portland boys' coach Joe Russo, who runs the event, also longs for a tourney. But this format, with proceeds benefiting the Portland High basketball booster clubs, has merit.
"It still has value because of the venue and if you're going to do a fundraiser, at least it's a fundraiser of interest. It's still basketball," Russo said.
For the players and coaches there are many reasons for participating.
"It's just to get an extra game," said Zac Manoogian, Westbrook High's senior guard. "Every kid on our team is a gym rat, you'd find them in a gym somewhere, so it's just another game for us."
The Biddeford boys' team came with the specific purpose of preparing for a hoped-for Class A quarterfinal game at the Expo. That it played well and beat the Class AA South champion, South Portland, 58-51, made it even better.
The Expo's open shooting backgrounds have been notoriously unkind to teams unfamiliar with the building.
"You have all that blank space and it kind of throws you for a while," said Jerome Criado, who made five 3-pointers for Biddeford in the second half to finish with 15 points.
"We can't come in here and practice," Criado said. "So playing a team like South Portland here is good for us. Now we know what it's like to play here. It's a confidence builder. We know we can play against (one of) the best teams in the state."
South Portland's purpose was two-fold, Millington said.
First, Millington needed to get a good look at everyone on his roster to "find some scoring depth," and to keep his seniors well rested because the Red Riots will play twice Thursday, then start a seven-game, 15-day stretch Saturday.
Portland girls' coach Gerry Corcoran scoffed that his team's 43-31 "exhibition" win against Greely didn't matter.
"We're so early in building this program, at 3-1 (in the regular season) it's crucial for us to learn how to win and to be conditioned in how to win," Corcoran said.
Greely, a top contender in Class A, played without junior all-state guard Anna DeWolfe (ankle injury). DeWolfe said she hopes to be out of her walking boot within a week and able to practice soon.
"We wanted to experiment with some things that we've been working on," said Rangers Coach Todd Flaherty. "Portland was a great draw for us because they're so athletic. It's great to play against a team like that; there aren't a lot of them around. I thought they exposed some of our weaknesses and now we can work on those."
The Portland boys won the final game of the day, 58-38 over Hollis-Brookline of New Hampshire after trailing 24-20 at halftime. Steve Craig can be reached at 791-6413 or: scraig@pressherald.com Twitter: SteveCCraig

Texto completo: City sends resolve to Congress over park
ELLSWORTH ï¿½ Officials in a Maine city are asking the federal government to solve the National Park Systemï¿½s $11.33 billion maintenance backlog.
The Bangor Daily News reported the Ellsworth City Council approved issuing a resolve to Congress this week asking for an income and payment plan. The nearby Acadia National Park has a backlog for $71 million of work.
Maine seeks input on energy plan
AUGUSTA ï¿½ The Governorï¿½s Energy Office is asking Main residents for input in developing a roadmap for energy planning.
The office is working with the Environmental & Energy Technology Council of Maine to hold forums Dec. 29 and Jan. 10 in Presque Isle.
Republican Gov. Paul LePage says Maine must reduce its energy prices to become more competitive with states in different regions.
The plan will address the stateï¿½s energy, economic development and environmental goals.
The starting point is a 2015 state energy plan. It had broad objectives such as achieving energy and cost savings in the residential, commercial, industrial and transportation sectors. The plan also aimed to reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions and support the growth of a strong state and regional energy market and workforce.
South Portland moves on works site project
SOUTH PORTLAND ï¿½ Officials in South Portland have finalized recommendations for the cityï¿½s former public works site.
The Portland Press Herald reports the reuse planning committee outlined multiple draft recommendations for the six-acre site earlier this month. According to the committee, the complex should be redeveloped into housing that is affordable, energy efficient and attractive.
Clearing the old public works site for redevelopment will cost South Portland about $250,000. The city council will begin reviewing developer proposals in the new year.

Texto completo: SKOWHEGAN ï¿½ Geoff Nosach decided to try out his new snowboard Tuesday on opening day at Eaton Mountain Ski Area.
Nosach, of Mercer, was on snowshoes while his friend, Jarret Haiss, of Palmyra, on skis, hiked all the way up the 2,000-foot mountain with a vertical drop of 520 feet and then rode down.
They made the journey up using snowshoes and special ï¿½skinsï¿½ on the skis for traction ï¿½ about a 40-minute trek. The ride down was a crooked 15 minutes of twists and turns down the middle of the mountain and a trial called The Moose.
ï¿½Itï¿½s my first time on the new board,ï¿½ Nosach said, fitting the snowshoes to his feet for the hike up. ï¿½Iï¿½ve never used snowshoes before, either.ï¿½
Once down at the ski lodge, Nosach, covered in snow from a couple of face plants on the way down, said the ride was a blast.
ï¿½I rolled around in the snow a little ï¿½ it was fun,ï¿½ he said. ï¿½It was good. Conditions are great ï¿½ it was worth it.ï¿½
Recent weather events, coupled with the Christmas holiday, forced Eaton Mountain staff to delay the official opening for skiing, snowboarding and snow tubing by a couple of hours Tuesday.
ï¿½We delayed opening by one session to allow us more time to take care of all of the excess snow we got from the blizzard,ï¿½ mountain manager Julie Keaten said. ï¿½And the ice storm just before that set us back a little, cleaning up and grooming the trails.ï¿½
Skiing in Maine got a welcome Christmas present on Monday, with about 12 inches at Eaton Mountain, 10 inches of new snow with 88 trails open at Sugarloaf in Carrabassett Valley and 59 groomed trails at Sunday River in Newry.
Over at Saddleback Mountain in Rangeley, a woman who answered the phone Tuesday said the resort has not reopened since a purchase agreement with an Australian company was announced in June. ï¿½Weï¿½re doing our best to open in some capacity,ï¿½ the woman said.
At Titcomb Mountain in Farmington, skiing and snowboarding is underway with several trails open this week for school vacation. Baker Mountain in Moscow is not open to the public yet this season.
Jarret Haiss said heï¿½s been coming to Eaton Mountain ever since he was a kid. Now at age 34, he comes with his wife Johanna and their almost 3-year-old daughter, Tiger.
ï¿½Eaton Mountain is good ï¿½ the terrain is really good,ï¿½ he said, noting that owner David Beers is ï¿½really passionate about his mountain.ï¿½
Beers purchased Eaton Mountain in 2008. He suffered broken bones and skull fractures Dec. 4, 2011, when an 18,000-pound snow groomer rolled over him at the mountain. His jaw was broken in three places and left him deaf in one ear, but he perseveres.
Contacted out of state on Tuesday, Beers said his passion for the mountain is very real.
ï¿½Anybody with a lick of business sense will tell me not to be trying to do what Iï¿½m doing there, but I havenï¿½t given up on it,ï¿½ he said. ï¿½The mountain is near and dear to my heart and Iï¿½m continuing to do everything I can to keep it going.ï¿½
Keaten agreed, saying Beers has met every challenge from the cost of remodeling to electrical problems in the past. She said Beers has plans for a chairlift at Eaton Mountain, but that still has not materialized.
ï¿½One challenge that we always have had in this industry is we have the ability to make snow here at the mountain, but if mother nature hasnï¿½t helped us, some people donï¿½t start thinking about the snow until they have it in their own back yard,ï¿½ she said. ï¿½This is wonderful that this early in the season we already have this much natural snow.ï¿½
The mountain has two tow lifts that bring skiers to the Lower Bowl of the mountain and another lift for the snowtube park. There is no access to the upper mountain, unless someone is among the ï¿½extreme skiersï¿½ who are willing to trek on foot to the top, as Haiss and Nosach did Tuesday.
Eaton Mountain will be open for snow tubing every day this week starting at noon and for skiing in the Lower Bowl on Saturday, Sunday and Monday, also starting at noon.

Gallagher announced his retirement in November after five years as director of the $1.6 billion financial institution.
The Board of Commissioners will be conducting a search process to recommend a permanent director for consideration by Gov. Paul LePage. Peter Anastos, chairman of the board, said the agency is in good hands while the board undertakes the search process. Compiled from wire reports

Texto completo: Some skiers were stuck for a few minutes on a halted ski lift in chilly temperatures at Sugarloaf Ski Resort on Tuesday because of a power outage that affected thousands of customers in Franklin County.
A representative of the Carrabassett Valley resort said skiers were stuck in the air for about five to 10 minutes around 2:30 p.m. because of the outage before workers could get the auxiliary engines running to bring people back down to the ground.
ï¿½It was probably pretty chilly for the people who were up there,ï¿½ Ethan Austin, director of marketing for the resort, said Tuesday afternoon.
Jason Morais, of Milford, Massachusetts, was a passenger on one of the resortï¿½s lifts when it halted. He told the Morning Sentinel in a tweet that the lift stopped about halfway up the slope and stayed for a while. He said the lift started moving again by 2:30 pm or so.
ï¿½I was dressed for super cold weather so I was all right,ï¿½ he said.
The resort put out a statement via Twitter that power had been restored to the mountain shorty before 5 p.m.
The resort was just one of 2,444 Central Maine Power customers affected by the outage in Carrabassett Valley. There were a total of 7,263 customers in Franklin County and 2,571 customers in Somerset County without power just before 5 p.m. Tuesday.
A dispatcher for CMP said the cause of the outage was not yet known and a company representative didnï¿½t immediately return a call seeking those details.
Austin said Sugarloaf closed its lifts for the day after bringing down the rest of the customers. He said that if the outage had not been resolved by Wednesday, the resort could have used auxiliary engines to operate some of the lifts at the resort.

Texto completo: The Pennsylvania woman held on $20,000 bail on Friday remained behind bars all weekend charged with a second break-in after police reported finding her bloody handprint on a window in a China home.
AUGUSTA ï¿½ A Pennsylvania woman held on $20,000 bail on Friday remained behind bars for the holiday weekend, charged with a second break-in after police reported finding her bloody hand prints on a window in a China home.
Jessica Rose Rohwer, 37, of Scott Township, Pennsylvania, also faces new charges of burglary, criminal mischief and criminal trespass from the break-in that apparently occurred Thursday following a high-speed chase through three central Maine towns.
Rohwer later told police she and her husband fled because ï¿½people are after them.ï¿½ The vehicle crashed and caught on fire.
She was charged Friday with burglary, assault and theft for a break-in at one home where she allegedly took keys and tried to drive away in the homeownerï¿½s Jeep before he pulled her out of it.
The new charges were brought Saturday after the homeownerï¿½s son called police to say he found footprints in the snow leading to his separate residence and blood on the side of the home where he is building a addition. Rohwer made an initial court appearance on the new charges Tuesday at the Capital Judicial Center via video from the Kennebec County jail.
An affidavit by Kennebec County Sheriffï¿½s Office Sgt. Jacob Pierce says he and the caller located blood and a new window that had been broken out.
They followed a blood trail along the floor and on wooden beams and then up the stairs where Pierce said they found an open window with ï¿½what appeared to be bloody hand prints on the window.ï¿½ The homeowner said he had left that window closed.
Rohwerï¿½s hands ï¿½had lacerations and were bleeding,ï¿½ police say, when she was located after the break-in at the other Lakeview Drive home.
Investigators also reported finding $38,200 in cash in fanny packs on Rohwer when she was arrested Thursday evening.
The chase Thursday began on Riverside Drive in Vassalboro, according to an affidavit by Deputy Jeffrey Boudreau, of the Kennebec County Sheriffï¿½s Office. The deputy said he saw a white Ford Expedition pass him going north at an estimated 100 mph and then almost collide with a southbound vehicle while passing another motorist.
Boudreau said he turned on his emergency lights and siren to try to get the sport utility vehicle to stop, even as he witnessed five ï¿½near head-on collisionsï¿½ with other cars.
Police broke off the chase twice, and shortly afterward residents on a fire road in China reported a car on fire and two people fleeing.
Then people living at Lakeview Drive reported that a woman broke into their home and was bleeding.
Rohwer was arrested there and taken to the hospital for treatment before being taken to Kennebec County jail. Boudreau wrote that she later told him she and her husband were former methamphetamine addicts but had been clean for eight years.
Rohwerï¿½s husband, Robert E. Rohwer, 33, also of Scott Township, Pennsylvania, was arrested near Lakeview Drive. He was charged with eluding an officer, driving to endanger and motor vehicle speeding up to 108 mph. His bail was set at $50,000 and he remains at the Kennebec County jail as well.
On Monday, Judge Evert Fowle set $5,000 cash bail on the new charges against Jessica Rohwer.
The prosecutor, Assistant District Attorney Kristin Murray-James, had sought $20,000 in addition to the $20,000 set on the other charges. Murray-James said the new charges were not known when Rohwer was in court on Friday.
Murray-James listed a series of prior criminal convictions for Rohwer, including convictions in 2010 for criminal possession of stolen property, unauthorized use of a vehicle stolen property and a 2008 conviction for unlawful possession of methamphetamine as well as theft, criminal trespass and criminal mischief. She said most of those were from Oregon. Murray-James also said there were non-extraditable warrants for Rohwerï¿½s arrest from Washington state and from Oregon.
Attorney Stephen Bourget, acting as lawyer of the day, requested bail be kept at the $20,000 amount set on Friday.
ï¿½I donï¿½t think consecutive bail is appropriate,ï¿½ Bourget told the judge. He said Rohwer was seen via video on Friday. ï¿½She has quite a story to tell. She did enter a building; she said she was asking for help.ï¿½
Bourget said she and her husband saved the money and were coming to Maine to buy land.
Fowle added a condition of bail that bans Rohwer from being in the town of China and from having contact with the property owner.
She is due in court again 2 p.m. Feb. 13, 2018.

National Weather Service says to expect between 10 to 20 degrees below zero in next few days

Texto completo: Central Maine will get an arctic blast of subzero temperatures in the next few days, temperatures the weather service said are about 30 degrees below normal. The Augusta Community Warming Center is fully loaded with coats and mittens and gloves and hats, too, for people in need.
Following a snowstorm-filled long holiday weekend, central Mainers are now bracing for bone-chilling temperatures that could plummet some 30 degrees below average.
Thatï¿½s prompting area officials to warn about the dangers of frostbite and ask that people prepare for the frigid weather. The high temperature in the area this time of year is usually around 30 degrees with lows in the mid-teens, but on Tuesday highs were expected to rise only in the low 20s. Highs for today and Thursday are expected to only reach the single-digits, according to Meteorologist Andy Pohl, of the National Weather Service in Gray.
Along the way, subzero temperatures will grip the region at night.
ï¿½Weï¿½ll get colder and colder right through Thursday,ï¿½ Pohl said. ï¿½By Thursday, the high will be between zero and 5-degrees, and the low temperatures Thursday night into Friday will be between 10- and 20-degrees below (zero).ï¿½
The cold temperatures come on the heels of an intense but brief Christmas Day storm that brought whiteout conditions and prompted the National Weather Service to issue a blizzard warning for the entire state as more than a foot of snow fell in some areas.
There were 10 inches of snowfall recorded in Winslow, 11 inches in Mount Vernon, and 8 inches in Hallowell, according to the National Weather Service. Norridgewock and Auburn had 12 and 14.5 inches of snow, respectively.
But now it will be dangerously cold the next few days for people who have to be outside for any period of time, especially people working outside. Pohl said anybody who has to be on the road should make sure to have a winter weather safety kit in their vehicle. His kit includes extra gloves and socks, a hat, candles, candy bars and blankets.
Pohl said itï¿½s tough to predict whether any records will be set by this bout of colder-than-normal temperatures, but it will be a ï¿½significant departure from normalï¿½ the next few days. There isnï¿½t any more snow in the immediate forecast, but it is going to be bitterly cold.
ï¿½Think of your pets, because you donï¿½t want to leave dogs outdoors,ï¿½ he said. ï¿½If they have to go outside, make sure itï¿½s for a shorter time. Their paws get pretty tender walking around when itï¿½s that cold.ï¿½
Sugarloaf ski resort in Carrabassett Valley received 10 inches of fresh snow Monday on top of the nearly 2 feet of snow that fell there in the past two weeks. This week is one of the busiest of the season for the ski resort and the cold temperatures arenï¿½t likely to deter skiers, said Ethan Austin, director of marketing at Sugarloaf. He suggests skiers donï¿½t leave skin exposed and take frequent breaks to warm up.
ï¿½(The forecast) is not ideal like weï¿½d like to see, but the fortunate thing is the snow is incredible,ï¿½ Austin said. ï¿½The skiing is really good and as long as people bundle up theyï¿½ll have a great time.ï¿½
The cold snap led to an unusually high number of calls for service for AAA, according to spokesman Patrick Moody. By Tuesday afternoon, the company had 3,330 service calls in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont, considerably higher than an average winter day of 1,500 to 2,000 calls.
ï¿½Weï¿½re anticipating the rest of the week with temperatures dropping to negative digits it will be extremely busy as well,ï¿½ Moody said.
Moody said most of the calls were for people who needed help getting out of snowy driveways, had dead car batteries or had locked their keys in the car while warming it up. He suggested people check car batteries that are more than a couple years old to make sure they are properly charged.
The National Weather Services says people should prepare for the cold temperatures by knowing the signs of both frostbite and hypothermia. Frostbite can happen in minutes skin is exposed to extreme cold temperatures, while hypothermia sets in when body temperatures sink below 60 degrees. The weather services advises people to keep skin covered, stay inside when possible and drink fluids because hydration increases the bloodï¿½s volume.
Pohl also suggested people consider putting a winter safety kit in their car that includes extra gloves and hats, blanket, a flashlight with battery, snacks, socks and a cellphone charger.
In Augusta, the Augusta Community Warming Center ï¿½ in the St. Markï¿½s Parish Hall ï¿½ is preparing for an increase in visitors during the extreme cold spell. The warming center, at 9 Pleasant St., is open daily from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Sarah Miller, project director of Bridging the Gap, the parent organization of the warming center, said the center is fully stocked with winter coats for adults and children, along with hats, socks, scarves, gloves, mittens, boots, blankets and sleeping bags.
ï¿½We are always looking for more and can always use more of those things,ï¿½ Miller said Tuesday morning. ï¿½We have tangible goods that will come in handy during subzero temperatures.ï¿½
Callie Boynton, of Fieldingï¿½s Oil and Propane in Augusta, said No. 2 heating oil is about $2.65 per gallon and kerosene is about $3.15 right now. She urged people to make sure they have enough to heat their homes during this upcoming blast of cold air. She said people should make sure they have their windows insulated and the shades drawn.
ï¿½(Itï¿½s good) to keep the thermostat set to one temperature rather than varying it throughout the day because thatï¿½ll keep the furnace from having to kick on,ï¿½ Boynton said.
Fieldingï¿½s is caught up on their deliveries, she said, and should be able to make a delivery within a day or two after an order is placed.
ï¿½People sometimes will call us just because thereï¿½s cold weather (in the forecast),ï¿½ she said. ï¿½These are the busiest months, January, February and March, and people are probably getting 100 gallons on month.ï¿½
The Augusta warming center has been preparing the facility for the added people the decreasing temperatures may bring in the coming days. Miller said the walkways and sidewalks have been cleared and they have maintenance people ready for any additional work that may be needed.
Miller estimated the warming center, the clothing bank and the essentials pantry together served about 3,500 people over the seasons. Since the center opened earlier this month, Miller said theyï¿½ve had anywhere from 24-30 individuals coming into the center daily. She expects there will be more in the next few days.
ï¿½I think weï¿½ll plan for that and keep that in mind,ï¿½ she said. ï¿½We definitely prepare when we know thereï¿½s weather coming and we make sure all our resources are stocked up.
ï¿½We want to welcome as many people that need to come in,ï¿½ Miller said.
The warming center has a childrenï¿½s play area, as well as a separate child-free area for adults, and the general area where both adults and children are welcome. People can play games, watch DVDs on a television set, or just spend time chatting with others.
The St. Markï¿½s Episcopal Church property, where Bridging the Gapï¿½s services are located, was put up for sale by the former church in 2016. Officials said maintaining the aging facility was too costly.
City officials have said the social services provided by the warming center, the clothing bank and the essentials pantry cannot continue to be provided long-term at the St. Markï¿½s site because city zoning rules donï¿½t allow those services in that zone.
Bridging the Gap and the warming centerï¿½s services are funded by numerous sources, including multiple local church congregations, income from an endowment of about $600,000 made up of the proceeds of the sale of St. Markï¿½s Home, individuals, businesses, and funded by the United Way of Kennebec Valley as a partner agency.

The cold temperatures come on the heels of an intense but brief Christmas Day storm that brought whiteout conditions and prompted the National Weather Service to issue a blizzard warning for the entire state as more than a foot of snow fell in some areas.
There were 10 inches of snowfall recorded in Winslow, 11 inches in Mount Vernon, and 8 inches in Hallowell, according to the National Weather Service. Norridgewock and Auburn had 12 and 14.5 inches of snow, respectively.
But now it will be dangerously cold the next few days for people who have to be outside for any period of time, especially people working outside. Pohl said anybody who has to be on the road should make sure to have a winter weather safety kit in their vehicle. His kit includes extra gloves and socks, a hat, candles, candy bars and blankets.
Pohl said itï¿½s tough to predict whether any records will be set by this bout of colder-than-normal temperatures, but it will be a ï¿½significant departure from normalï¿½ the next few days. There isnï¿½t any more snow in the immediate forecast, but it is going to be bitterly cold.
ï¿½Think of your pets, because you donï¿½t want to leave dogs outdoors,ï¿½ he said. ï¿½If they have to go outside, make sure itï¿½s for a shorter time. Their paws get pretty tender walking around when itï¿½s that cold.ï¿½
Sugarloaf ski resort in Carrabassett Valley received 10 inches of fresh snow Monday on top of the nearly 2 feet of snow that fell there in the past two weeks. This week is one of the busiest of the season for the ski resort and the cold temperatures arenï¿½t likely to deter skiers, said Ethan Austin, director of marketing at Sugarloaf. He suggests skiers donï¿½t leave skin exposed and take frequent breaks to warm up.
ï¿½(The forecast) is not ideal like weï¿½d like to see, but the fortunate thing is the snow is incredible,ï¿½ Austin said. ï¿½The skiing is really good and as long as people bundle up theyï¿½ll have a great time.ï¿½
The cold snap led to an unusually high number of calls for service for AAA, according to spokesman Patrick Moody. By Tuesday afternoon, the company had 3,330 service calls in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont, considerably higher than an average winter day of 1,500 to 2,000 calls.
ï¿½Weï¿½re anticipating the rest of the week with temperatures dropping to negative digits it will be extremely busy as well,ï¿½ Moody said.
Moody said most of the calls were for people who needed help getting out of snowy driveways, had dead car batteries or had locked their keys in the car while warming it up. He suggested people check car batteries that are more than a couple years old to make sure they are properly charged.
The National Weather Services says people should prepare for the cold temperatures by knowing the signs of both frostbite and hypothermia. Frostbite can happen in minutes skin is exposed to extreme cold temperatures, while hypothermia sets in when body temperatures sink below 60 degrees. The weather services advises people to keep skin covered, stay inside when possible and drink fluids because hydration increases the bloodï¿½s volume.
Pohl also suggested people consider putting a winter safety kit in their car that includes extra gloves and hats, blanket, a flashlight with battery, snacks, socks and a cellphone charger.
In Augusta, the Augusta Community Warming Center ï¿½ in the St. Markï¿½s Parish Hall ï¿½ is preparing for an increase in visitors during the extreme cold spell. The warming center, at 9 Pleasant St., is open daily from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Sarah Miller, project director of Bridging the Gap, the parent organization of the warming center, said the center is fully stocked with winter coats for adults and children, along with hats, socks, scarves, gloves, mittens, boots, blankets and sleeping bags.
ï¿½We are always looking for more and can always use more of those things,ï¿½ Miller said Tuesday morning. ï¿½We have tangible goods that will come in handy during subzero temperatures.ï¿½
Callie Boynton, of Fieldingï¿½s Oil and Propane in Augusta, said No. 2 heating oil is about $2.65 per gallon and kerosene is about $3.15 right now. She urged people to make sure they have enough to heat their homes during this upcoming blast of cold air. She said people should make sure they have their windows insulated and the shades drawn.
ï¿½(Itï¿½s good) to keep the thermostat set to one temperature rather than varying it throughout the day because thatï¿½ll keep the furnace from having to kick on,ï¿½ Boynton said.
Fieldingï¿½s is caught up on their deliveries, she said, and should be able to make a delivery within a day or two after an order is placed.
ï¿½People sometimes will call us just because thereï¿½s cold weather (in the forecast),ï¿½ she said. ï¿½These are the busiest months, January, February and March, and people are probably getting 100 gallons on month.ï¿½
The Augusta warming center has been preparing the facility for the added people the decreasing temperatures may bring in the coming days. Miller said the walkways and sidewalks have been cleared and they have maintenance people ready for any additional work that may be needed.
Miller estimated the warming center, the clothing bank and the essentials pantry together served about 3,500 people over the seasons. Since the center opened earlier this month, Miller said theyï¿½ve had anywhere from 24-30 individuals coming into the center daily. She expects there will be more in the next few days.
ï¿½I think weï¿½ll plan for that and keep that in mind,ï¿½ she said. ï¿½We definitely prepare when we know thereï¿½s weather coming and we make sure all our resources are stocked up.
ï¿½We want to welcome as many people that need to come in,ï¿½ Miller said.
The warming center has a childrenï¿½s play area, as well as a separate child-free area for adults, and the general area where both adults and children are welcome. People can play games, watch DVDs on a television set, or just spend time chatting with others.
The St. Markï¿½s Episcopal Church property, where Bridging the Gapï¿½s services are located, was put up for sale by the former church in 2016. Officials said maintaining the aging facility was too costly.
City officials have said the social services provided by the warming center, the clothing bank and the essentials pantry cannot continue to be provided long-term at the St. Markï¿½s site because city zoning rules donï¿½t allow those services in that zone.
Bridging the Gap and the warming centerï¿½s services are funded by numerous sources, including multiple local church congregations, income from an endowment of about $600,000 made up of the proceeds of the sale of St. Markï¿½s Home, individuals, businesses, and funded by the United Way of Kennebec Valley as a partner agency.

Texto completo: AUGUSTA ï¿½ Like it or not, lofty expectations have been placed on the Hall-Dale boys basketball team this season.
The Bulldogs return the bulk of a team that finished 14-6 in Class C South last year and appear primed for a deep run into the postseason. That doesnï¿½t mean every game will be a cakewalk. Tuesday at the Augusta Civic Center, they struggled through three periods before pulling away from Mountain Valley Conference opponent Madison for a 61-42 victory.
Hall-Dale is 5-0 in MVC play while Madison falls to 2-2.
This game was played as part of the 12-team Maine Gold Rush tournament and, unlike the exhibitions played by the other 10 teams, was a countable regular-season game. The team was also scheduled to play Monmouth later Tuesday evening with the winner advancing to a championship game.
Hall-Dale raced to a 22-9 first-quarter lead behind Ashtyn Abbott and Alec Byron. Abbott scored seven of his 13 points in the quarter while Byron scored six of his game-high 16. Madison, however, stormed back in the second period while Hall-Dale went cold. Guards Evan Bess and Sean Whalen combined for nine points while Hall-Dale didnï¿½t score a hoop for the first five minutes of the quarter.
ï¿½We came out flat like we always do,ï¿½ Hall-Dale point guard Tyler Nadeau said. ï¿½We kind of got sloppy. We had eight turnovers, I believe, in the first half and thatï¿½s kind of uncharacteristic for us.ï¿½
Nadeau closed the second quarter with a pair of jumpers from the right side, the second a 3-pointer to give Hall-Dale a 29-22 lead at the break. He finished with 15 points, including three timely 3-pointers.
ï¿½I thought he kept us in it to be honest,ï¿½ Hall-Dale coach Chris Ranslow said. ï¿½He hit big shots that kept us separated.ï¿½
Added Nadeau: ï¿½Primarily Iï¿½m supposed to be getting people the ball in their spots where they can score. This is the most Iï¿½ve shot all season.ï¿½
Madison cut the lead to a point (36-35) on Jacob Meaderï¿½s layup early in the fourth quarter, but Nadeau hit a long 3 to ignite a 9-0 run that pushed the lead to 45-35. Madison had done a good job solving a number of Hall-Dale zone presses and half-court defenses, but fell apart a little in the fourth quarter.
ï¿½Every time we got it to three of four points it seemed like the Nadeau kid hit a big shot,ï¿½ Madison coach Jason Furbush said. ï¿½Heï¿½s a great leader we knew that going in. Heï¿½s a great point guard.ï¿½
Hall-Daleï¿½s defense came alive in the fourth quarter, forcing 10 turnovers that led to a series of easy layups. Byron scored eight in the quarter while Abbott added six.
ï¿½We were playing a little matchup, run and jump,ï¿½ Ranslow said of his defense. ï¿½We mixed it up a little bit, but it doesnï¿½t really matter. You got to play. Top to bottom I thought we were inconsistent. In the end we found a way to get it done.ï¿½
ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½
The tournament is in its second year and includes a 12-team girls session which runs Wednesday at the Civic Center. Itï¿½s the brainchild of former Cony coach Bruce Hunt and former Winthrop coach Dave Poulin. The pair have collaborated on the Gold Rush summer camp, which runs four consecutive weekends at Colby College and is entering its 20th year. Last year 130 teams from Maine, the Canadian Maritimes and Massachusetts participated in the camp.
ï¿½We have so many teams coming to camp, with a lot of the playoffs being held here, we wanted to open it up for teams to play at least one and as many as three games here,ï¿½ Poulin said.
The tournament is divided in two six-team sessions with a championship game at the end of each. Oxford Hills won the first session, defeating Messalonskee 66-45 in the final. The second game of the session included a matchup between Maranacook and neighboring Winthrop who donï¿½t meet in the regular season. Maranacook won that one utilizing its pressing, uptempo style.
ï¿½Weï¿½re so deep and we have so many good athletic kids who love to compete,ï¿½ Maranacook coach Rob Schmidt said. ï¿½One of the biggest things is our thought process that a game is 32 minutes and itï¿½s not going to be over early. It may not look pretty for the whole game but, hopefully, in the course of a 32 minute game, we can wear teams down.ï¿½
Former Mr. Maine Basketball Ryan Martin, who played for Schmidt at Maranacook and helped the Black Bears to two state championships, was back on the floor Tuesday as a first-year head coach for Sanford.

Arctic cold slams much of nation into deep freeze

Texto completo: A white Christmas for much of the Midwest and Northeast has given way to bitter cold until the New Year, and the St. Louis area shares the pain.
The light snowfall here Tuesday wasn't what prompted a warning from the National Weather Service. It was the cold temperatures and related wind chill.
Tuesday's highs stayed in the 20s or below for the region and temperatures were predicted to drop to 7 degrees overnight. The Weather Service warned that the wind chill factor could fall below zero.
And the snow and the cold are expected to stick around for the rest of 2017. Friday has the highest temperature outlook at 28 degrees, according to the Weather Service. There's a chance of more snow Saturday.
Chicago-area National Weather Service meteorologist Amy Seeley predicted colder-than-normal temperatures there for the rest of the week. Temperatures hovered around zero degrees in Chicago on Tuesday.
Meteorologists warn of subzero frigid arctic air and dangerously cold wind chills. Wind chill advisories or warnings are in effect for all of North Dakota and Wisconsin, as well as swaths of South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Michigan and Indiana. Wind chill advisories are also in effect for parts of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York.
Meteorologists say frostbite is possible with as little as 30 minutes of exposure.
Erie, Pa., and surrounding areas were nearly buried in snow. They got 34 inches on Christmas Day, easily topping the previous 24-hour snowfall record. After an additional 24 inches piled up from midnight through 5 p.m. Tuesday, the National Weather Service said Erie had broken Pennsylvania's previous all-time two-day state snowfall record, set in 1958 when Morgantown received 44 inches. An additional 1 foot to 2 feet of snow could fall across the area through Wednesday.
So far, Erie has received 97 inches of snow in December, making it the snowiest month in the city's history. The city averages about 100 inches of snow in an entire season.
City officials declared a state of emergency and were pleading with motorists to stay off city streets and nearby highways, including Interstates 90 and 79. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, was also expected to call up some national guardsmen because so much snow has fallen there is concern ambulances will not be able to reach some patients.
At times, travel lanes on Interstate 90 were blocked by stuck vehicles or jackknifed tractor-trailers. But the highway remained open, although Pennsylvania State Police urged motorists to postpone travel if possible.
The chilly air will even be felt across the South. Parts of the Carolinas and Georgia could get rain, as could areas of Texas. Scattered rain and snow showers will occur across the Northwest, while dry and rather mild weather continues across the Southwest.
In Southern California, wind should be light, helping contain the spread of ongoing wildfires.

Texto completo: Skiers who bargained on a six-minute lift up Bromley Mountain ended up spending several hours Christmas Day dangling in below-freezing winds on a high-speed chair lift at the resort in Bennington County's town of Peru.
At about noon Monday, according to Bromley Mountain Resort's Assistant Managing Director Michael van Eyck, there was "a super high 20- or 25-second burst of wind" that swung empty chairs and a messenger cable together. The cable snagged a grip on a empty chair, derailing it and causing the lift to stop.
Skiers who were riding the lift at the time had to be belayed from their chairs by rope one at a time, which, according to van Eyck, some people found entertaining rather than stressful.
"The winds were not predicted to be that high," van Eyck said. "They were slowly creeping up that morning."
The wind peaks read about 40 mph before the gust, van Eyck said.
"According to the manufacturer, the lift shouldn't operate in winds over 50 miles per hour," van Eyck said. Damaging winds are classified the by National Severe Storms Laboratory as winds that exceed 50-60 mph.
Evacuation of the Sun Mountain Express took two hours and 20 minutes due to high wind on the mountain, according to van Eyck. In normal conditions, van Eyck said it would have taken an hour.
"These guys are well-seasoned," van Eyck said of Bromley Mountain's Ski Patrol members, who rescued the 115 passengers. "They were ready."
"The ski patrol did a great job under a difficult situation," wrote Douglas Rawson, who was on the mountain during the rescue. Rawson wrote that he and his family members were unaffected by the incident.
No injuries were reported, according to van Eyck.
Van Eyck confirmed the mountain's ski report for Tuesday, which said the Sun Mountain Express lift remained closed for maintenance, and added that Bromley staff hope to reopen the lift by the end of the day. Other lifts were functioning as usual. The weather service reported that the mountain received about 10 inches of powder during the past two days.
The only reported chair lift injuries in Vermont occurred in 1972 at Glen Ellen, according to a 2016 report by the National Ski Areas Association. In the Northeast, an incident at the Sugarloaf Resort in Maine in 2015 injured seven.
This data doesn't include numbers of passengers falling out of chair lifts, but Vermont is the only state that requires chair lift restraint bars to be lowered before riders can ascend.
Bromley skiers were in good company. At the Chamrousse Resort in the French Alps on Sunday, 150 skiers needed to be rescued from gondolas.
The ski areas association report couldn't resist a dig at European resorts, stating that those ski areas had "nine times the fatality incidents occurring at American ski areas."

The End of Maine Shrimp?

Texto completo: PORT CLYDE, Me. -- Sitting between Glen Libby's desk at Port Clyde Fresh Catch and the armchair where his brother's old dog, Red, likes to nap are two boxes full of "The Original Maine Shrimp Cookbook." This slim spiral-bound volume includes contributions from various members of the brothers' immediate family, whose shrimping history dates back nearly four decades in this coastal town about two hours northeast of Portland. Mr. Libby loves the small, delicate Northern shrimp, known fondly here as Maine shrimp, and so do customers at his processing and distribution plant. He bought $700 worth of the books to sell.
"I have sold two," Mr. Libby said.
He is unlikely to sell many more. Not long after the cookbook was published in 2009, its central ingredient began vanishing from Maine's waters. In 2014, regulators closed the shrimp fishery (the term that encompasses both the fishing grounds and those who work there). The hope was that the struggling species would replenish itself if left undisturbed.
So far, according to scientists who survey the Gulf of Maine annually, it hasn't. Their most recent data show Northern shrimp numbers at a historic low for the 34 years in which they have been counting the crustacean, Pandalus borealis. Egg production is down. Survival rates for larvae are poor.
Last month, regulators voted to keep the fishery closed again through 2018, the fifth consecutive year without a shrimp harvest. That means no shrimping for the Libbys or the hundreds of other Maine fishermen who have long relied on it as a sweet paycheck (and meal) in the dark of winter.
What makes this an unusual closing is that fishermen are not being blamed for the immediate problem. Cod was overfished. Sea urchins were overfished, as Maine shrimp were in the late 1960s and '70s, But the most widely accepted theory for the rapid decline of this species, which extends no farther south than the Gulf of Maine, is the same force being blamed for disruption of fisheries around the globe: climate change.
While summer swimmers may still gasp with shock on entering Maine's chilly waters, the Gulf of Maine is warming, and becoming increasingly inhospitable to the shrimp. Average winter sea-surface temperatures have increased 4.5 degrees in Boothbay Harbor since 1906.
Plenty of shrimpers believe in climate change. Some don't. All feel stymied.
Patrick Keliher, Maine's commissioner of marine resources, said he had never seen quite as many shrimpers turn out for a meeting as they did on Nov. 29, when a regulatory panel he sits on decided to keep the fishery closed. He raised their hopes, briefly, by arguing unsuccessfully for a "boutique" fishery that would have allowed shrimpers a small but not insignificant catch.
After all, many fishermen reason, if shrimp are going to continue to disappear because of an environmental force unlikely to be stopped, why not just reap what's left? Especially now that unmet demand has sent prices soaring.
Some shrimpers favor backing off on the shrimp to see if they can bounce back. And almost all question the scientific data. Surveys are often run with the help of fishermen, but instead of going where the shrimp typically cluster, the surveys by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration go to mostly random, computer-selected spots to trawl.
"I don't know if it is as bad as they think," said Mr. Libby, whose brother, Gary, is chairman of the advisory panel to the Northern Shrimp Technical Committee, the voting body of the Atlantic State Marine Fisheries Commission that decides the fate of the fishery each year.
But there is one thing most everyone here agrees on: It would be terrible to see the end of Maine shrimp, a touchstone of local tradition, identity and cuisine.
"Maine shrimp is the only shrimp I've ever eaten that has a taste to it," said Arnie Gammage, a longtime shrimp trapper in South Bristol.
"It is probably my favorite seafood to eat," said Andy Cantrell, who runs Cantrell Seafood, a fish store and distribution company in Topsham.
>
Last winter at auction, Mr. Cantrell bought 3,100 pounds of Maine shrimp, brought in by 13 lucky Mainers chosen to conduct a research catch designed to give the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration more data. (They were allowed to catch only a tiny amount, but prices were so high, it paid to be in the game.)
For this coming, shrimpless season, he could buy Northern shrimp imported from Canada. Some Maine restaurants are already substituting it in shrimp dishes, particularly the fried ones. The Canadian shrimp fishery has also experienced declines, but still brings in far more than Maine ever did.
It's the same species, but somehow not the same. "It is usually super small compared to our shrimp," Mr. Cantrell said.
But some of Cantrell's better customers are nostalgic shrimpers, for whom only Maine shrimp will do. Troy Bichrest, a fisherman in Cundy's Harbor, paid $90 for 10 pounds of shrimp at Cantrell Seafood in February, nine times more than he used to be paid at the dock for his catch. He returned to Cantrell Seafood the next day, repeating this process four more times, until his family, including his elderly mother, had their fill.
Maine's relationship with its shrimp is more complex than just love of a flavor.
"We in northern New England love them and have a proprietary relationship with them," said Sam Hayward, a James Beard Award-winning chef and an owner of the Portland restaurants Fore Street and Scales.
Mr. Hayward buys the shrimp at every chance, for use in his home and his restaurants. When this year's research catch was available, he put a nearly raw version, "shocked" with local vinegar, on Fore Street's menu. That was in February, when the vast majority of his customers tend to be locals.
"People from away don't necessarily get Pandalus borealis," Mr. Hayward said.
Even native Mainers can understand why; Northern shrimp aren't easy. Erin French, the chef of the Lost Kitchen, in Freedom, grew up picking shrimp for her father at his diner, the Ridge Top Restaurant in nearby Knox. He'd make her sit at the table until every one was shelled. She hated it.
"I felt like it went on for days and everything smelled like shrimp, and you didn't even want to eat them when you were done with it," Ms. French said.
Then you cook them at your peril; they swiftly turn to mush. "It takes not more than one minute of cooking for peeled, raw shrimp," Marjorie Standish wrote in her 1973 cookbook "Keep Cooking -- the Maine Way."
Glen Libby used to rush his catch from boat to pot to cook it live, like lobster. The simpler the better.
"A load of salt in the kettle," said Craig Durant, who fishes in Cundy's Harbor. "You go find a cold Pepsi, and then you pick until your fingers bleed."
For some, the shrimp still seem like scraps. "Too much bother," said the food historian Sandy Oliver, who lives on Islesboro, an island in Penobscot Bay. "These little, tiny shrimp, with the heads cleaned off and popped out of their shell, what have you got? Not much."
>
Shrimp season usually runs from December to April, when the seas are brutally cold and high, and a shrimper might have to break ice to get to the boat. In those months, shrimp, unlike lobster, can be caught fairly close to shore. And unlike the more restrictive scalloping or lobstering fisheries, shrimping is open to anyone willing to pay for a permit.
As a so-called shoulder fishery, shrimping -- whether trawling with a net or setting traps -- served multiple functions, including providing another income source for shrimpers who might spend the rest of the year chasing lobster, scallops, haddock and cod.
The catch was quick and clean; shrimp move in dense packs, handy for scooping. A fisherman stood a good chance of making his quota in a morning and heading back for the mooring. This eased the worries of wives waiting at home.
The catch also filled their pots and pans. The commercial shrimp fishery in New England sputtered into existence in fits and starts from 1927 to 1938, but fishermen had long been eating the shrimp they had caught in their nets while seeking other fish.
There wasn't a market for Gulf of Maine shrimp. As an aquatic biologist for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the environmentalist Rachel Carson noted even in 1943, when there were roughly 25 boats shrimping, that competition from South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico shrimp was hindering development of the Northern resource.
Home cooks were in all likelihood canning it -- according to Don Lindgren, the owner of Rabelais ("Fine Books on Food and Drink," as it calls itself) in Biddeford -- and were using it in recipes. One of the earliest he has found was for "shrimps à la crème" in the 1906 book "Proved and Tested Cooking Receipts," by the Ladies of the Universalist Society of Rockland.
But efforts were also underway to raise the profile of Maine shrimp. A cannery in Rockport began processing shrimp in 1942. And around that time, Everett F. Greaton, the executive secretary of Maine's Development Commission and a booster of all things Maine, presided with the governor over a dinner that included "Maine apples stuffed with gulf of Maine shrimp." Mr. Lindgren believes that was the first time Maine shrimp was granted such a place of honor.
The shrimping fleet grew steadily, except for a few years beginning in 1953 when the species disappeared; scientists pointed to a pulse of warm water in the Gulf of Maine. In 1969, the year of the biggest catch on record, 11,000 metric tons, there were 223 Maine vessels shrimping, and 42 from Massachusetts. The price at the dock was 13 cents a pound. (The average price in the last decade the fishery was open was 67 cents a pound.)
Prices like those indicate limited demand, but they also helped establish that proprietary feeling so many Mainers speak of. Maine shrimp belonged to the locals, and sold best in seaside shacks, deep-fried and piled up on a paper tray -- with ketchup, tartar sauce or cocktail sauce on the side -- or in a roll or a stew.
As recently as 10 years ago, shrimp was the stuff you could buy by the side of the road, from peddlers who parked their trucks along coastal roads. Gary Libby describes locals coming to the dock with empty buckets and filling them for $10 or less.
"One guy used to come down and he'd give us a loaf of homemade bread, and we'd give him a bucket of shrimp," Mr. Libby said.
Shrimp were abundant -- and loved, even by once-reluctant pickers. When Ms. French wrote her cookbook, "The Lost Kitchen: Recipes and a Good Life Found in Freedom, Maine," she included recipes for shrimp stew and a shrimp roll. But by the time it came out last spring, the recipes might have needed an expiration date.
"Who would have known?" Ms. French said. "It happened so fast."
She approves of the continued closing of the fishery. "Until we really know," she said. "Because when it is gone, it's gone."

Texto completo: "Fishermen are losing ground one a nibble at a time. Eventually, it adds up to a very large piece of the pie."
Joseph Gilbert
a Stonington Connecticut fisherman who owns boats that range from Virginia to Maine
NEW BEDFORD, Mass. – East Coast fishermen are turning a wary eye toward an emerging upstart: the offshore wind industry.
In New Bedford, Massachusetts, the onetime whaling capital made famous in Herman Melville's "Moby-Dick," fishermen dread the possibility of navigating a forest of turbines as they make their way to the fishing grounds that have made it the nation's most lucrative fishing port for 17 years running.
The state envisions hundreds of wind turbines spinning off the city's shores in about a decade, enough to power more than 1million homes.
"You ever see a radar picture of a wind farm? It's just one big blob, basically," said Eric Hansen, 56, a New Bedford scallop boat owner whose family has been in the business for generations. "Transit through it will be next to impossible, especially in heavy wind and fog."
Off New York's Long Island, an organization representing East Coast scallopers has sued the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to try to halt a proposal for a nearly 200-turbine wind farm. Commercial fishermen in Maryland's Ocean City and North Carolina's Outer Banks have also sounded the alarm about losing access to fishing grounds.
Supporters of offshore wind say they have learned from Europe's long experience with it. They also point to the more recent opening of America's lone offshore wind farm, off Rhode Island, as evidence the actual impact to fishermen will be less than feared.
"We want to do this the right way, and I believe we have a path to do that," said Matthew Morrissey, a vice president at Deepwater Wind, the Rhode Island company that opened that five-turbine operation off Block Island last December and is proposing larger farms elsewhere along the East Coast.
In New Bedford, where the state has already built a $113million heavy-duty terminal to take on turbine construction and shipment, city officials envision commercial fishing and offshore wind working hand in hand to revive a region that has long lagged behind nearby Boston.
"There's a lot more in common between these industries than pulling them apart," said Edward Anthes-Washburn, executive director of New Bedford's port, citing the potential for wind farms to provide fishermen with extra work and to contribute to port investments, like a new shipyard.
For fishermen, the broader concern is that offshore wind farms will only lead to more stifling restrictions.
"Fishermen are losing ground one a nibble at a time," said Joseph Gilbert, a Stonington, Connecticut fisherman who owns boats that range from Virginia to Maine. "Eventually, it adds up to a very large piece of the pie."
The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which oversees wind farm developments in federal waters, has taken steps to address fishermen's concerns, among them excluding specific habitats off Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New York from wind farm development, said spokesman Stephen Boutwell.
It has also invested in studies looking specifically at questions raised by fishermen, from the effects of pile-driving during wind farm construction to the effect of electromagnetic fields on fish behavior, he said.
Deepwater Wind, meanwhile, said preliminary findings from environmental studies of its Block Island wind farm suggest fish and lobster populations are "just as strong" as before construction.
The company says it has compensated over a dozen fishermen who temporarily lost access to their fishing grounds during construction.
But while there haven't been reports of fishing boats striking the turbines, about a dozen boats have reported trawls getting damaged by concrete structures covering undersea power cables, costing tens of thousands of dollars in equipment and lost fishing time, said Richard Fuka, president of the Rhode Island Fishermen's Alliance.
U.S. fishermen also cast a worried glance at to Europe, where a range of restrictions have been imposed on fishing around the more than 3,500 turbines spinning off the shores of 10 different countries. U.S. officials and developers stress similar bans aren't being considered stateside, except during construction.

Texto completo: This time of year, we're all deluged with advice on what we should do in the new year, like exercise more (duh!) and spend less time staring at screens (double-duh!). Here's a look at some less obvious, but effective ways to ratchet up the joy in your life.
1. Experience awe
Remember last summer's solar eclipse and how lovely it was to put the world on pause and look up at the sky? For one day, we seemed to forget our differences, united in awe. That may actually happen: According to a May 2015 study led by Paul Piff of the University of California at Irvine, experiencing awe promotes altruism, loving kindness, and magnanimous behavior. But such moments don't have to be rare events. “Awe can be triggered by anything that transcends the ho-hum aspects of the workaday world and makes you say, 'Wow!' " says Christopher Bergland of Provincetown and San Francisco, author of “The Athlete's Way: Sweat and the Biology of Bliss." It can be something as commonplace as a sunrise or the first bloom of spring. Forgetting yourself for a bit and realizing that it's not all about you can boost your happiness, Bergland says.
2. Be adventurous
“An outdoor adventure of any kind is a great way to feel good in 2018," says John Judge, Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) president. “Whether it be a bucket-list trip like climbing some of New Hampshire's 4,000 footers or cycling through Tuscany in Italy, having fun in the outdoors immediately connects to our DNA. It reinforces one of life's joys and gets us away from today's hectic and ubiquitous tech living." AMC's guided adventures (603-466-2727, www.outdoors.org) include snowshoe treks in Maine's 100-Mile Wilderness, snowshoe and spa weekends at the AMC Highland Center in Crawford Notch, lodge-to-lodge ski tours at Maine Wilderness Lodges, and lodge-to-hut adventures in the White Mountains.
3. Eat this; get happy
There are foods that fill you with heartburn and regret. (We're looking at you, chili cheese dog!) Happily, there are also foods that make you feel good right away. “Some foods are scientifically shown to improve our mood," says Carolyn C. Hintlian of Boston Nutrition (www.bostonnutritiondowntown.com.) The list includes nuts, seeds, and dark-colored fruits like blueberries and blackberries (loaded with vitamin E); fish and shellfish (hello, Omega-3 fatty acids); and kale, avocado, and spinach (filled with brain-boosting lutein). The flavonoids (phytonutrients) in dark chocolate (made with at least 70 percent cocoa) are shown to boost spirits and ease symptoms of anxiety and depression. Add to your healthy-recipe repertoire with a free cooking demo, offered by The Kitchen at the Boston Public Market (www.thetrustees.org/kitchen) called Fresh, Fast and Delicious for Less With Project Bread every Thursday. The Kitchen also hosts weekly farm-to-kitchen cooking classes focused on Greek, Mediterranean, and Italian flavors sourcing from local farmers, Taza truffle-making classes using stone-ground cacao, and local seafood workshops with Red's Best Seafood.
4. Say ohm
“The average person can live a happier life by incorporating meditation into their busy schedule," says Andy Kelley, a.k.a. the Boston Buddha (www.thebostonbuddha.com), who teaches mantra and breath-based meditation. “Ten minutes a day, at the same time each day, is an achievable goal even for busy people, and is enough to make a difference in the rest of your day," Kelly says. Several recent studies confirm the health benefits of meditation. Do it while you're stuck in traffic, or in another situation that would unravel you, Kelley suggests. “This small commitment [of time] will help you to remain focused and more relaxed." There are a bazillion books on the subject, but a guided class is a great way to begin, and there are many around Greater Boston. The Boston Buddha leads Meditation Mondays on the rooftop Sky Lounge at the YOTEL Boston hotel in the Seaport District. Mondays, 8-8:30 a.m., $15, free for hotel guests. 617-377-4747; www.yotel.com/boston.
5. Expand your friend zone
Studies reveal that having a strong circle of friends is a major component of well-being. “Friends make us feel valued and understood," says Leslie Sands of Harborside Counseling Services in Newburyport. But as we get older, the number and variety of our friendships tend to decline, she notes. Loneliness and isolation are shown to have adverse effects on health and happiness. “Seeking out friendships with a diverse group of people of different ages and backgrounds can add immeasurably to the richness of life," Sands says. To find them get involved in your community. One option: Look for a Meetup group (www.meetup.com) that matches your interests or create a Meetup group of your own, and greet 2018 with a merry tribe of peeps.
6. Learn something new
Experts agree there are major benefits to learning new things: It stimulates brain activity, increases creativity, and boosts imagination. In 2018, dedicate time to mastering new skills, and you'll be healthier and happier. For inspiration, check out CourseHorse (www.coursehorse.com/boston). Launched in 2017, the online company lists hundreds of classes and workshops in Boston. Always wanted to learn a new language? The Boston Language Institute (617-606-4448, www.bostonlanguage.com) offers group (limited to 12 students), private, and couple lessons in 40 languages. Sessions run from four to six weeks. And, if your last home improvement project was not exactly HGTV-worthy, consider taking a workshop at Boston Building Resources (617-442-2262, www.bostonbuildingresources.com), where you can learn DIY kitchen design, carpentry, window rehab, and more. No time to attend class? Udemy (www.udemy.com) is an online marketplace with a library of more than 55,000 courses.
7. Nurture your inner artist
Research suggests that most of us have a wellspring of creative energy. And there's good reason to tap it: Creative folks tend to be happier, more successful, and even live longer. The Museum of Fine Arts (617-267-9300, www.mfa.org) is a great place to ignite your creative spark. It offers studio-art classes year-round, including drawing, painting, sculpture, and stone carving, along with weekly kids (ages 5-11) and preschool (ages 4-5) classes. A variety of studio-art classes and workshops are offered at Art School 99 (651-245-9710, www.artschool99somerville.com), including a class where parents and children (ages 5-8) create a painting together. Learn to be a better writer (and maybe pen that bestseller) at GrubStreet (617-695-0075, www.grubstreet.org), a nonprofit creative writing center offering more than 600 workshops, classes and events. Play with clay at the Mudflat Pottery School (617-628-0589, www.mudflat.org.)
8. Do good and do better
Lending a hand in the community is a surefire win-win. In a new survey by UnitedHealthcare and Volunteer Match of 2,705 adults, 75 percent of people said volunteering made them feel healthier; 93 percent said it improved their mood; and 79 percent said it lowered their stress levels. There's no time like 2018 to help a neighbor, work at the local food bank, volunteer at a school or senior citizen center, read books to kids at the public library, or get your hands dirty in a community garden. For more options, check out Boston Cares (617-422-0910, www.bostoncares.org) or VolunteerMatch (www.volunteermatch.org) for a list of volunteer opportunities throughout the city.

STATE'S HIDDEN GUNS WOULD GROW UNDER GOP BILL

Resumen: The House's holiday gift to the NRA was especially despicable because it came at the end of the deadliest year for mass shootings in modern U.S. history, and just two months after Stephen Paddock opened fire on concertgoers from his 32nd floor Las Vegas hotel room, killing 58 people and wounding hundreds more before taking his own life. Yet congressional Republicans aren't talking about the top priorities: needed reinstatement of the Assault Weapons Ban that was on the books for just 10 years following a 1993 massacre in California, and outlawing bump stocks like Paddock used to convert semi-automatic rifles into machine guns. In a cynical move, members tied the concealed-carry reciprocity to much-need legislation to improve the federal background check system for gun purchases the system Kelley slipped through despite his past domestic violence conviction.

Texto completo: Next time you're in a restaurant or walking down the street, imagine the person at the next table or approaching on the sidewalk packing a concealed firearm.
He or she might have no gun-safety training. Might be a convicted stalker or have a record of violent crime. Might have never undergone a background check or even obtained a permit to carry.
Yet that person could be legally toting a loaded gun under his jacket. Here. In California. A state with some of the nation's toughest gun laws.
That's the world the National Rifle Association and its Republican toadies in Congress have in mind for you. And, now, they're within a few U.S. Senate votes of making that a reality.
While the nation focused on the horrific tax bill, the House, mostly along party lines, this month passed legislation requiring interstate reciprocity for concealed weapons.
It would mean that people who can legally carry concealed guns in their home states could do the same in San Jose, Oakland or Walnut Creek. Even if they would otherwise be legally barred from doing so here.
California has reportedly issued fewer than 100,000 of the 16 million concealed weapons permits nationwide. Unlike California, 19 states don't require any safety training for a permit. In 12 other states Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Vermont, Wyoming and West Virginia residents don't even need permits, or background checks, to hide guns under their coats.
HR 38, introduced by Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., would allow them to travel freely with their unseen, loaded weapons to any state. Maybe packing populations seem fine elsewhere. But not in California.
Yet congressional Republicans who preach state rights when it serves their purposes sing a different tune when coveted gun-lobby campaign contributions are at stake.
The House's holiday gift to the NRA was especially despicable because it came at the end of the deadliest year for mass shootings in modern U.S. history, and just two months after Stephen Paddock opened fire on concertgoers from his 32nd floor Las Vegas hotel room, killing 58 people and wounding hundreds more before taking his own life.
Yet congressional Republicans aren't talking about the top priorities: needed reinstatement of the Assault Weapons Ban that was on the books for just 10 years following a 1993 massacre in California, and outlawing bump stocks like Paddock used to convert semi-automatic rifles into machine guns.
The House action came just one month after Devin Patrick Kelley killed 26 people at church services in Sutherland Springs, Texas. In a cynical move, members tied the concealed-carry reciprocity to much-need legislation to improve the federal background check system for gun purchases the system Kelley slipped through despite his past domestic violence conviction.
In other words, the GOP and the NRA are insisting even the slightest meaningful change to the nation's gun laws require states in exchange give up the right to control concealed weapons within their borders.
That's a deal the Senate should reject.

Texto completo: Next time you're in a restaurant or walking down the street, imagine the person at the next table or approaching on the sidewalk packing a concealed firearm.
He or she might have no gun-safety training. Might be a convicted stalker or have a record of violent crime. Might have never undergone a background check or even obtained a permit to carry.
Yet that person could be legally toting a loaded gun under his jacket. Here. In California. A state with some of the nation's toughest gun laws.
That's the world the National Rifle Association and its Republican toadies in Congress have in mind for you. And, now, they're within a few U.S. Senate votes of making that a reality.
While the nation focused on the horrific tax bill, the House, mostly along party lines, this month passed legislation requiring interstate reciprocity for concealed weapons.
It would mean that people who can legally carry concealed guns in their home states could do the same in San Jose, Oakland or Walnut Creek. Even if they would otherwise be legally barred from doing so here.
California has reportedly issued fewer than 100,000 of the 16 million concealed weapons permits nationwide. Unlike California, 19 states don't require any safety training for a permit. In 12 other states Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Vermont, Wyoming and West Virginia residents don't even need permits, or background checks, to hide guns under their coats.
HR 38, introduced by Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., would allow them to travel freely with their unseen, loaded weapons to any state. Maybe packing populations seem fine elsewhere. But not in California.
Yet congressional Republicans who preach state rights when it serves their purposes sing a different tune when coveted gun-lobby campaign contributions are at stake.
The House's holiday gift to the NRA was especially despicable because it came at the end of the deadliest year for mass shootings in modern U.S. history, and just two months after Stephen Paddock opened fire on concertgoers from his 32nd floor Las Vegas hotel room, killing 58 people and wounding hundreds more before taking his own life.
Yet congressional Republicans aren't talking about the top priorities: needed reinstatement of the Assault Weapons Ban that was on the books for just 10 years following a 1993 massacre in California, and outlawing bump stocks like Paddock used to convert semi-automatic rifles into machine guns.
The House action came just one month after Devin Patrick Kelley killed 26 people at church services in Sutherland Springs, Texas. In a cynical move, members tied the concealed-carry reciprocity to much-need legislation to improve the federal background check system for gun purchases the system Kelley slipped through despite his past domestic violence conviction.
In other words, the GOP and the NRA are insisting even the slightest meaningful change to the nation's gun laws require states in exchange give up the right to control concealed weapons within their borders.
That's a deal the Senate should reject.

Unless Utah lawmakers allow stronger beer in grocery stores, beer drinkers might soon have fewer options, Anheuser-Busch says

Texto completo: Utah beer drinkers might soon have fewer options when looking for their favoritebrews in grocery stores next year, one of the world’s biggest brewing companies told the state’s beer wholesalers in a recent letter.
As three states phase in laws that allow grocery stores to sell beer stronger than 3.2 percent, Utah will become one of two that limit the strength of beer wholesalers and retailers can sell.
While those 3.2 percent beers account for the vast majority of all beer sold in the state, it may no longer be feasible for some large brewers to create a weak beer for Utahns. Anheuser-Busch, maker of Budweiser, said it was evaluating whether it would cut products next year.
While the company wrote that it was still studying its options, as expected, it included specific estimates for possible cutbacks.
The company wrote in the Dec. 1 letter to Utah’s beer wholesalers it was “considering package reductions of up to 40% of those currently offered to Utah’s consumers.”
“This would mean a decline from 113 packages to less than 70,” wrote Anson Frericks, vice president of sales for the company’s northwest region, “and going from a range of 20 brands to 12.”
Frericks attempted to put the cuts into perspective by comparing the state’s beer options to Maine’s.
“In Maine, which has almost the exact same beer volume as Utah, Anheuser Busch currently offers more than 800 packages,” the company wrote. “That means Utah – while equal to Maine in volume – could have less than 10% of its portfolio offerings.”
Utah and Minnesota will remain the only two states that allow only beer with 3.2 percent alcohol-by-weight — roughly half of the content in bottled craft beers — to be sold in grocery stores and convenience stores.
Unlike Utah, however, the vast majority of beer sold in Minnesota is high-alcohol or “production line” beer sold in private liquor stores. By contrast, over 90 percent of beer sales in Utah are weak beers. Just 0.5 percent of total beer sales in the U.S. are 3.2 percent beers, Anheuser-Busch wrote.
The announcement was expected after three states — Colorado, Oklahoma and Kansas — made changes to their alcohol laws to permit grocery stores to sell stronger beer in coming years.
Jim Olsen, president of the Utah Beer Wholesalers Association, said if the company begins offering fewer options, he expects it will start phasing out products before October 2018, when Oklahoma’s law takes effect.
“They don’t want to be stuck with a lot of 3.2 product in the stores once the change happens,” Olsen said.
Olsen also said he was told to expect a similar letter coming from MillerCoors, another large brewing company, that would be similar to the Anheuser-Busch letter, which was first reported by Fox 13.
The state’s liquor agency, the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, has already said it wouldn’t be able to meet demand if big brewers cut options, noting grocery and convenience stores sell five times more 3.2 beer than liquor, wine and heavy beer sold at state-run liquor stores.
“The DABC cannot realistically replace that market if there is a complete reduction of 3.2 beer,” DABC Executive Director Sal Petilos said in June.
Olsen said he’s alerted lawmakers — specifically Sen. Jerry Stevenson, R-Layton, and Rep. Brad Wilson, R-Kaysville — to the possible cutbacks.
Stevenson said he’s aware of the threats, and he’s spoken with legislative leaders about the issue. But he said the state isn’t clamoring for a fix just yet.
“I don’t know that this is the right year to even consider this,” Stevenson said, referring to the upcoming legislative session. “We had a major alcohol [legislation] year last year.”
Lawmakers last year voted to lower the legal blood-alcohol limit for driving from 0.08 percent to 0.05 percent. They also changed the so-called Zion Curtain law that had required restaurants to put up barriers to keep people from seeing drinks being mixed.
“There could be a market reaction if they take a lot of stuff off the market. But the thing is we don’t know that,” Stevenson said. “We’re a long way from panic mode.”

Record-breaking cold weather to hit Maine

Texto completo: With the potentially record-breaking low temperatures about to hit Maine, National Weather Service meteorologist Margaret Curtis is advising that people “just stay warm.”
Curtis said to expect highs in the single digits and lows below zero.
“There are very cold temperatures coming in,” she said.
The highest temperature forecasted in the next four days in the Lewiston/Auburn area is 7 degrees. The lowest? Minus 14.
Thursday is forecasted to be the coldest day, with a high of 2 and low of -14.
According to the National Weather Service, the normal high for that day is 34 and the normal low is 16 for the Portland area, with a record low of -9.
If the temperatures drop as much as expected, both the record low and minimum high temperature records could be broken, according to the National Weather Service.
Areas farther north, such as Rangeley, will be even colder with a Thursday high of -7, with a windchill warning of -20 degrees.
Heating oil in central Maine is currently priced between $2.43 and $2.59. For anyone who uses oil to heat their home or water, it might be a good time to fill up.
Temperatures this cold can also lead to health problems, including frostbite and hypothermia, which should be treated immediately.
Warning signs of hypothermia include confusion, shivering, difficulty speaking, sleepiness and stiff muscles.
People exposed to extreme cold are susceptible to frostbite in a matter of minutes, especially in uncovered area like hands and feet.
The advice for dressing in for extreme cold? Dress in layers, including insulation, a warm hat and gloves, waterproof boots, a face mask and an outer layer.
“Be careful if you’re outside,” Curtis said. “If you have animals that normally sleep outside, this might be a time to bring them into the barn or the house.”
The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals recommends washing and drying your pet’s feet and stomach after walks or being outside to remove ice, salt and chemicals. You can massage petroleum jelly or other paw protection before going outside to avoid irritation.
The ASPCA also advises giving your animals a warm place to sleep.
Temperatures this cold can freeze buildings’ pipes, often causing them to burst and cause flooding.
To prevent freezing pipes, the American Red cross they recommend insulating pipes with heat tape or newspaper and keeping cabinet doors open to allow warmer air to circulate around plumbing. The Red Cross also recommends letting cold water drip from faucets connected to exposed pipes. Letting water run through the pipe, even at a trickle, helps prevent freezing.
To thaw a frozen pipe, keep the faucet open and apply heat to the frozen section until full water pressure is restored. If you cannot find or access the frozen area, call a licensed plumber.
With below-freezing temperatures, it is recommended to keep your thermostat set to the same temperature during the day and night. If you will be going away during cold weather, leave the heat on in your home, set to a temperature no lower than 55 degrees.
Extremely cold weather can also affect drivers and pedestrians.
Lewiston Public Works Director Dave Jones recommends that drivers ensure their vehicles are properly maintained with antifreeze and windshield-washer fluid. he also recommends that drivers allow their automobiles to run for a few minutes. He said it is good for vehicles and more comfortable for the driver.
Jones also said to dress for the weather. “If you break down or slide off the road, you will need the gear. It’s also a good idea to have a blanket or two in the trunk.”
He said that goes for pedestrians, too.
“Earlier today, I saw a bicyclist downtown at an intersection in a kilt!” Jones said. “Not a good idea in the severe cold.”
He also said to watch for pedestrians because they are often not paying as much attention in the cold while trying to stay warm.
Jones added that pedestrians should be extra careful because drivers cannot always see people because of high snow banks.
Adding to the problem, Jones said, two of the three sidewalk plows operated by Lewiston Public Work are temporarily out of commission.
“With this amount of snow, it is slow going,” he said.
Lewiston Parking Bans
The city of Lewiston utilizes a citywide parking ban system on a storm-by-storm basis. Vehicle owners parking on any city street when a ban is declared will receive a $32 fine and towing at their expense.
Parking garages are free to use on weekdays from 6 p.m. until 6 a.m.
The same rules apply for the municipal lots at the corner of Cedar and Lincoln streets and the lot across from Gas Light Park at 333 Lincoln St.
On weekends, the same parking is free to use from 6 p.m. Friday until 6 a.m. Monday.
If you park in a Lewiston parking garage during a winter parking ban, some of the time may be free and some time may not be. If you enter the parking garage after 6 p.m. and you remove your vehicle before 6 a.m. the next morning, your stay will be free.
If you remove your vehicle after 6 a.m. on weekdays, you will be charged the regular parking fees of $1 per hour up to the daily max of $6.
Auburn Parking Bans
To utilize winter relief parking in Auburn, you must have a winter relief parking permit. These are free and are only available at the Auburn Police Department.
Failure to obtain a permit could result in a $35 fee to the city and fees to the towing company.
Vehicles with a permit may park in the winter relief lots until midnight on the day the ban expires. After that, it is subject to towing. If the parking ban ends at midnight, you have until midnight the following day to move your vehicle. The only exception to this rule is the Mechanics Row Parking Garage.
Vehicles with winter relief parking permits may park in the yellow, orange or green permit spots in the Mechanics Row Parking Garage. On weekdays, vehicles must be removed by 7 a.m. if there is no ban in effect. If a parking ban is in effect, vehicles must be removed within an hour after the ban ends.
Parking in city-owned lots between the hours of 12:01 a.m. and 6 a.m. is not allowed at any time except during a parking ban.
Certain areas of the downtown are part of the Business District Zone. Vehicles parked in this zone are exempt from parking bans from 7 a.m. until 11 p.m. All vehicles parked in this zone must be removed by 11 p.m. or they may be towed.

Hampshire Street housing project moving ahead

Texto completo: AUBURN — A project slated to bring more than 50 housing units to the downtown is moving ahead, after clearing important hurdles.
Last week, the Planning Board paved the way for the workforce housing development after voting unanimously to approve the site plan, special exception and subdivision plans.
The development would take shape on a vacant lot on Hampshire Street near the Auburn Public Library, in the area used for overflow library parking.
The developer, The Szanton Co., plans to bring 39 units of workforce housing and 14 market-rate units to the downtown – a mix that Szanton also produced in Bates Mill in Lewiston.
The project has received a warm welcome from Auburn officials — both the outgoing and incoming administrations — who believe it will spark further redevelopment interest in the downtown.
City Manager Peter Crichton said during a previous meeting that the housing units will be a perfect way to get more people living, working and shopping in the downtown area.
Michael Chammings, director of economic and community development, said Tuesday that other building owners in the area are already redeveloping their properties. He also called The Szanton Co. “a class act.”
Auburn officials said the project, which is slated to take about two years to complete, would represent a $10 million investment in Auburn, and provide $40,000 annually in taxes for the city.
The purchase and sales agreement between Szanton and the city is contingent on Szanton acquiring the necessary financing. The city also offered Szanton tax increment financing of 30 years at 50 percent.
The Planning Board vote last week came one day after the City Council held a public hearing and voted to request a discontinuance of a section of Troy Street, which runs between Hampshire Street and Library Avenue.
That vote was also necessary for the development team.
Chammings said Szanton is competing for Maine Housing tax credits, which is based on a points system, toward the development. Clearing the hurdles from the Planning Board and City Council adds points, he said.
Under the development plans, the road would shift 15 feet to the east, creating a public access drive to the project. The discontinuance would take effect once the city receives notice from Szanton “when they have reasonable confidence that the closing will occur within 90 days.”
At that time, a deed for the discontinued portions of Troy Street would pass to the abutting property owners.
Since the project was announced, there has been some criticism among library staff and supporters, who are concerned that the project will take away needed parking for the library.
Two weeks ago, Auburn’s urban development coordinator, Doug Greene, said those working on the project are trying to identify about 35 to 40 parking spaces in the area that can replace the ones lost in the development.
Chammings said Tuesday that the city is working on a larger downtown parking inventory, as well as planning pedestrian enhancements to make crosswalks and other high-traffic areas more walkable.
“It’s an issue in the whole downtown, not just that area,” he said, referring to parking. “We’ve been looking at it well before this project came up.”
He said there is plenty of space for parking in the area, but it needs to be “identified and put in place.”
When initially announced a few months ago, the only city councilor at the time to oppose the Hampshire Street development was Adam Lee, who was also a candidate for mayor.
He said Tuesday that he opposed the project because the city property was assessed at $378,000, but is in the purchase and sales agreement with Szanton for $45,000.
“I thought moving forward on a deal without a more competitive and thorough investigation of other options for development there was hasty,” he said. “We shouldn’t underestimate the value of our downtown areas … I earnestly hope I am wrong.”
The City Council will hold a second reading on the Troy Street discontinuance on Jan. 8.

Student sections making noise and creating school spirit

Texto completo: Following his team’s 2-0 win over Bangor earlier this month, Edward Little hockey player Ben Cassidy said the Red Eddies were inspired by the cheering of their students.
That fan section takes ts rowdiness serious.
“We pride ourselves on trying to be the best fan section in the state,” senior Isaac Dumont said.
Whether or not the EL student section is Maine’s finest up for argument, but there’s little doubt that it has a perfect name: the Haunted House, a nod to Edward Little High School’s ghost mascot.
Dumont is the coordinator of the Haunted House this school year.
Griffin Mayhew, also a senior, has filled the same role for Mt. Blue High School’s Zoo Crew fan section the past few years.
The goal of both fan sections, of course, is to be loud. But it’s also to come together, show school spirit and have fun.
“It builds a great community around the students,” Mayhew said. “And the students, I believe it impacts them positively. I hope it does.”
Mayhew resurrected the Zoo Crew during the summer between his sophomore and junior years. It had existed before, but the concerted effort of a student section had been dormant for a while.
“Nobody that I knew had done it in a few years, since like 2011,” Mayhew said. “I thought it would be a good idea to pick it back up, knowing that I loved going to all the games. And I thought, the more the merrier.”
When it comes to fan sections, these days there is more to it than just showing up. It’s showing up unified, often in the fashion sense.
There’s blackouts (everyone wears black) and white-outs (everyone wears white). Sometimes maroon-outs, or whatever a school’s primary color is.
Last week, for the boys’ basketball game against Mt. Ararat, the Haunted House had a Christmas theme, which meant the students showed up decked in holiday attire. The Zoo Crew has worn camouflage and hunting orange in the past.
For the biggest games, such as the Edward Little boys’ basketball team’s upcoming matchup with Portland on Jan. 5, the Haunted House goes with a beach theme.
“It’s a lot different. I remember last year at the Lewiston football game, it was like freezing rain outside, we had like 100 kids all dressed up in beach stuff,” Dumont said. “Everyone was freezing, but we were all just jumping and getting loud. I think the beach theme adds a lot of energy to the game.”
Dumont and Mayhew don’t work alone. Mayhew’s “crew” consists of Hunter Smith, Marshall Doyon, Jacob Miller and Olivia Schank. The Haunted House leadership consists of one person from each class: Joining Dumont, the senior, are junior Caleb Yarnevich, sophomore Giles Paradie and freshman Anson Perry.
These groups put time into planning the themes. Once they have an idea, they get it approved by their school’s athletic director or an administrator.
Then they spread the word.
As it has with most things, social media has taken student sections to the next level. Videos of chants hit YouTube and are shared and re-shared. Photos of large, themed-out fan sections from throughout the nation are retweeted on Twitter with the hashtag #studentsectiongoals.
Social media also helps fan sections get the word out about upcoming themes.
“Having the social media is an easier way for me than to go out to everybody at lunchtime,” Mayhew said. “It makes my job a lot easier.”
Dumont and the Haunted House coordinators created a poster that contained an entire schedule of themes for the winter sports and posted it on Twitter. They did likewise earlier this month with a list of chants they want to use this season.
Mayhew also uses social media to keep students updated on upcoming games, and to spread the word about the accomplishments of their fellow students, whether it’s retweeting newspaper stories or finding cross country results on MileSplit and passing them on.
Mayhew said it’s important to him that all of the school’s sports are recognized, not just football and basketball, and not just boys’ sports.
“One of the things that I tried to do from the beginning is not … be like, we only do stuff for the boys’ games,” Mayhew said. “We do stuff for the girls’ and the boys’ games, just as evenly as we can.”
In fact, one of the most attended sports by the Zoo Crew is field hockey. The students even had T-shirts made during the Cougars’ stellar regular season in 2016 that said, “Jody Harmon for president.” (Harmon is the Mt. Blue field hockey coach).
Mayhew also had Zoo Crew shirts made. He sold both shirts for $10 each, and with the profit he created a bank account for future Zoo Crew projects. (The Haunted House also had T-shirts, which were made earlier this year by a sponsor for the basketball tournament.)
The Zoo Crew also made shirts earlier this school year, and this time for a good cause.
Mt. Blue participated in WGME’s School Spirit Challenge, in which schools from around the state compete to raise food for the Good Shepherd Food Bank.
Mt. Blue came in second place, raising, Mayhew said, more than 32,500 pounds of food. The school’s athletic teams played a big role — “We had student-athletes probably bring in 75-80 percent of the cans and the donations,” Mayhew said — but the fan section also helped by sending out reminders and selling shirts, from which all of the proceeds were donated to Good Shepherd Food Bank.
Dumont said that he hopes when he has kids of his own in high school that the fan section will still be going strong. For now, he said the Haunted House makes school more fun, even for kids who aren’t sport fans.
“Just the memories. I think, without the fan section, it gives everyone something to look forward to every week, and just creating memories,” Dumont said. “I think our senior year wouldn’t be as fun without the fan section.”

Texto completo: LEWISTON — For the second consecutive year, Medicare will penalize Central Maine Medical Center for its high rates of infection and patient injuries.
The news comes just weeks after CMMC’s accrediting agency said the hospital was not doing enough in its policies and procedures to prevent infections. The agency gave the hospital 30 days to improve or risk its accreditation.
CMMC President David Tupponce said Tuesday the hospital is working on its issues.
“We’re not trying to hide the fact we still have opportunities to improve as an organization,” he said. “We’re striving toward zero harm to our patients and to our employees. That’s really what we’re striving for.”
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services announced last week that it was fining 751 hospitals for their infections and injuries. In Maine, four hospitals are being fined, including Cary Medical Center in Caribou, Southern Maine Health Care in Biddeford and York Hospital.
CMMC is the only Maine hospital on the list for a second year.
Medicare began penalizing hospitals four years ago to motivate them to cut down on infections and other complications that can hurt or kill patients and cost the federal insurer money. Medicare considered infections from a variety of surgeries and procedures, including hysterectomies, urinary tract catheters and central lines. It also looked at 10 kinds of inpatient injuries and complications, including bed sores, blood clots and sepsis.
Under the program, hospitals lose about 1 percent of their Medicare payments for the year, which can amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars, depending on how many Medicare patients that hospital sees.
Since the list was just announced last week, Tupponce said, it is yet unclear exactly how much money CMMC will lose.
Tupponce noted that Medicare’s infection and injury data is old — between a year and three-and-a-half years old. That’s a common complaint among hospital leaders, who say Medicare’s old data can highlight a problem that has since been fixed or can fail to show current problems.
However, The Joint Commission, CMMC’s accrediting agency, saw problems with the hospital’s infection work as recently as three weeks ago.
In early December, the commission performed its routine reaccreditation survey at the hospital. Such surveys are done about every three years, according to hospital spokesman David Landau.
The group found problems around infection control policies and procedures, and it gave CMMC 30 days to improve. According to Landau, the hospital was told it needs to work on three key areas:
• The processes involved in cleaning high-risk equipment.
• Using best practices to maintain a safe environment for patients and staff before, during and after care.
• Encouraging and empowering staff to identify and correct situations that could put patients or staff in danger.
Landau said the hospital is working on those issues and that CMMC leaders “fully expect our accreditation to be renewed.”
He noted that the commission made re-accreditation more rigorous in 2017, causing many hospitals in Maine and New England to fall short.
A spokeswoman for t commission said standards are always evolving and changes are not confined to one year. She could not confirm whether other area hospitals have had trouble keeping up with those standards.
Tupponce said CMMC has been working on infection control, including putting in place new protocols for urinary tract catheters and central lines.
He said the hospital will soon appoint a chief quality officer and it is working on changing the culture of the hospital to one “where safety and quality is what we’re thinking about every day, and that is where we really focus our resources, our time and our energy.”
Tupponce said the hospital is “raising the bar” and hopes to exceed expectations in the future.
“Even if we have one patient who doesn’t have an optimal outcome,” he said, “there are lessons to be learned there that we can use to continue to improve.”
In October, Leapfrog Group, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that tracks health-care safety, quality and value, gave CMMC a grade of “B” for safety. It found the hospital performed well when it came to two types of infections, blood clots and surgical wounds staying closed.
It found the hospital performed poorly when it came to urinary tract infections during an ICU stay, surgical site infection after colon surgery, patients dying from treatable complications and staff working together to prevent errors.

Texto completo: High school skiing preview with feature on Yarmouth senior Sophia Laukli, 10 boys and 10 girls to watch and top five area teams of each gender.
GIRLS
Alpine
1 Yarmouth: After coming within a point of Class B champion Spruce Mountain last winter, the Clippers are seeking their first outright title since 2011. Seniors Greta Elder, Emi Ruth, Cate Ralph and Emma Marston turned in top-15 state-meet performances. Sophomore Tasha Powers gained experience, and freshmen Maddie Marston and Eleanor Donahue could contribute right away.
2 Camden Hills: Graduation took a toll on the defending Class A champions, but the Windjammers should remain competitive with the likes of senior Audrey Heriz-Smith (top five in slalom and giant slalom), junior Jesi Mann (19th in giant slalom) and junior Courtney King. Sophomore Olivia Lydon is a first-year racer but "an incredible athlete, strong and fast with great focus," said Coach Barry King.
3 Greely: The Rangers were runners-up to Camden Hills by 18 points in Class A but have some rebuilding to do after veteran Nettie Cunningham opted for hockey. Still, seniors Ella Novick, Erin O'Donovan and Greta Van Curan, and junior Sabra Lindsay have state-meet experience, and freshmen Elizabeth Hanson and Marina Jacob show promise.
Nordic
1 Yarmouth: The Clippers saw their string of six Class B Nordic titles end at the hands of Maranacook. The return from a year abroad of senior Sophia Laukli gives Yarmouth a boost. Classmate Hannah Corey, junior Isabel Brennan and sophomore Sadie Cowles each posted at least one top-10 finish at the state meet. Nine other sophomores and six freshmen provide substantial depth.
2 Maine Coast Waldorf: After seven consecutive Class C titles, Maine Coast moves up to Class B to challenge Yarmouth, Maranacook, Freeport and Caribou. Seniors Olivia Skillings and Louise Ahearne (1-2 in classical, 1-3 in freestyle) lead the way. Sophomore Caitlin Keliher and freshman Eliza Skillings are also expected to score. Junior Wilson Haims, sophomore Ava Teegarden and freshman Olivia Reynolds (the Class C cross country running champion) provide depth.
3 Freeport: The top three Falcons return from a squad that placed third in Class B behind Maranacook and Yarmouth. Juniors Lily Horne (two fifths) and Allison Greuel (two ninths) lead the way, along with senior Chloe Davidson (15th classical, 20th skate). Seniors Maya Egan and Mikaela Dorsey, and sophomore Galina Fallon also have state-meet experience. Sophomore Sadie Southall and freshman Jane Dawson could break into the top four.
BOYS
Alpine
1 Falmouth: After winning the Class A title in February, Falmouth might even be stronger. Junior Gibson Scott (second in GS, third in slalom), senior Owen White (eighth in slalom, 14th in giant slalom) and sophomore Nick Shapiro (20th in slalom) all return. Angus Christie (fourth in GS, sixth in slalom) left for a prep school in New Hampshire, but freshmen A.J. Noyes, Ben Keller and Ben Adey (from Waynflete, as part of a co-op team) are capable of filling the void.
2 Cape Elizabeth: Runners-up in Class A last winter, the Capers have dropped to Class B. Leading the way are the Lathrop brothers - junior Devon and sophomore Killian, who went 1-2 in both slalom and giant slalom in the Western Maine Conference. Juniors Nick Martin and Duncan Geike, and sophomore Wylie Fiutak have state-meet experience. Interesting additions include senior Chase Kozlowski, and freshmen Ian Geikie and Gannon Stewart, a national age-group champion in ski cross.
3 Yarmouth: Five years removed from the Class B Alpine title, the Clippers are still rebuilding, particularly with only a few upperclass returners from a team that placed fourth in Class B. Juniors Alex Hall and Eli Anderson, and sophomore Connor Tull have state-meet experience. Junior Griffin Primeau, hurt last season, was 18th in giant slalom as a freshman.
Nordic
1 Falmouth: Senior Simon Pratico and junior Ethan Livingood each had a pair of top-10 finishes last winter as Falmouth, the Class A Nordic champion from 2012-15, was runner-up to Mt. Blue. Senior Graham Bernier, junior Jake Mitchell and sophomore Ben Rooks also have state-meet experience.
2 Maine Coast Waldorf: On the heels of a five-year streak of championships in Class C, Maine Coast has moved up to Class B. Seniors Nick Neveau and Eli Gundersen lead a team that placed second in the Western Maine Conference, ahead of Falmouth and Yarmouth but behind Freeport. Matty Neveau appears most promising among five freshmen. Junior Calvin Soule and sophomore Adams Staples will help.
3 Yarmouth: Senior Max Coury, and juniors Justin Pietropaoli and Grady Welsh each posted top-25 finishes in both classical and freestyle last winter to help the Clippers - state champs from 2012-14 - place third in Class B. Seniors Sean Moore and Justin Reaman, and sophomore Kendrick Langenbach should help round out the scoring. Echoing past skimeisters, freshman Patrick Bergan plans to compete in Nordic and Alpine, as does classmate Maddie Marston.

Christmas brings Northeast blizzard, bitter cold in Midwest

Texto completo: CHICAGO * The good news for many in the Northeast and Midwest was that it has been a white Christmas. The bad news was that a blizzard swept into parts of New England and bitter cold enveloped much of the Midwest.
Even the usually rainy Pacific Northwest got the white stuff. The National Weather Service says it's only the sixth time since 1884 that downtown Portland had measurable snow only an inch or two on a Dec. 25.
A blizzard warning was issued Monday for portions of Maine and New Hampshire, with forecasters saying snow of up to 10 inches and wind gusts up to 50 mph could make travel "dangerous to impossible."
Most businesses were already shuttered on Christmas Day in New England. One of the few open was The Tobacconist cigar shop in Tewksbury, Mass., where area-resident Dwayne Doherty said he welcomed the fresh blanket of snow.
"I'm actually happy," he said, chuckling as he made his way to his pickup. "We haven't had snow on Christmas at all in the last few years. It's actually perfect."
States from Montana and the Dakotas to Wisconsin expected wind chill temperatures in places at 40 below zero, the National Weather Service said. The upper half of Iowa and northern Illinois also braced for subzero temperatures.
Minnesota was experiencing its most frigid Christmas Day since 1996, with wind chills as cold as 35 degrees below zero, KSTP-TV reported. The National Weather Service warned that those whose skin was exposed in such conditions could get frostbite in as little as 15 minutes.
Snow amounts in the Midwest were not large for this time of year. A storm system that swept from Nebraska through Iowa dropped around 2 inches of snow on Chicago, the weather service said.
That was just enough to provide a picturesque backdrop for those gathering for Christmas dinners in the Chicago area. But it wasn't enough to cause havoc either on roadways or airport runaways.
Chicago's O'Hare International Airport was reporting just six cancellations and average delays of only 15 minutes around noon Monday. There were no cancellations at the city's other major airport, Midway, and delays were less than 15 minutes on average.
The nation's third largest city had comparatively little snow for the season until the weekend just over 2 inches in all, the National Weather Service said.
The city of Milwaukee had 103 salt trucks treating slick spots Monday, according to WITI-TV. The trucks were using treated salt that's deployed when temperatures drop below 15 degrees.
OUTAGES AND ADVISORIES
In addition to slowing travel in New England, the storm was responsible for some power outages. Eversource reported more than 20,000 customers in eastern Massachusetts without electricity, the bulk on Cape Cod, which was feeling the brunt of strong winds.
Most of Indiana had been under a winter weather advisory with officials urging motorists to stay put unless they absolutely had to travel. Northern Indiana had been expecting up to 5 inches with slightly less in the southern part of the state.
New England was expected to get up to 8 inches of snow. Strong wind was predicted for Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island with gusts up to 65 mph.
Mountain areas in parts of Colorado, Montana and Wyoming received more than a foot of snow, which started Saturday. It was good news for holiday skiers and resorts, which have struggled with a slow start this season.
But it meant a heightened warning of avalanches in higher elevations outside of ski areas.

Texto completo: There’s a holiday gift coming for California’s minimum-wage earners — pay hikes for 2018.
And it’s not just a Golden State bonus.
Starting Jan. 1, California employers with 26 or more employees will raise their lowest pay grade by 50 cents to $11 an hour. Bosses with fewer workers must raise their lowest hourly rates by 50 cents to $10.50. This increase is part of legislation that will push the statewide hourly minimum to $15 as soon as 2022.
For those who think minimum wages are a bad idea, please note that California is by no means a loner with this action. And if you think the increase is simply politics by a liberal-leaning state government, you should understand that states upping their minimum wages for 2018 are not limited to progressive “blue” states.
Look, the federal minimum wage — $7.25 an hour — hasn’t budged in almost nine years. As a result, local and state lawmakers of various political stripes are taking action to help boost the wages of those working at the lowest pay rungs, especially in high-cost regions like California.
A report by the Employment Policy Institute — no fan of the minimum wage — shows seven states that have leaned decidedly “red” in recent elections, upping their minimum wage for 2018: Montana, Ohio, Florida, Missouri, South Dakota, Michigan and Arizona.
These are states that went for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential race. And minus a Democratic governor in Montana, these states have Republican control of the governor’s seat and the state legislatures. The minimum hourly wage in these states is increasing by an average 24 cents (2.8 percent) to $8.76.
As a comparison, California and eight other very “blue” states are a tad more generous — upping their minimum wage by an average 53 cents (5.5 percent) to $10.23 an hour.
Note: The institute shows two states with conservative reputations but mixed voting habits — Alaska and Maine — are also upping minimum wages.
At the local level, the institute identified 20 municipalities raising their minimum wages for 2018.
In California, it’s happening in 12 Bay area cities — Milpitas, up $1 to $12; Santa Clara, up $1.90 to $13;
Oakland, up 37 cents to $13.23; Richmond, up $1.11 to $13.41; Cupertino, Los Altos, Palo Alto, San Jose and San Mateo, all up $1.50 to $13.50; El Cerrito, up $1.35 to $13.60; Mountain View and Sunnyvale, both up $2 to $15.
Minimum wages also will rise in three New Mexico regions — Albuquerque, Bernalillo County and Las Cruces; three municipalities in Washington state — SeaTac (Seattle Tacoma); and one each in Minnesota (Minneapolis) and Arizona (Flagstaff).
I’m well aware that critics claim higher minimum wages hurt the overall economy as well as the workers the rules intend to help. One set of employment data suggests that harm to the job market isn’t showing up in the California economy, so far.
My trusty spreadsheet filled with federal jobs data didn’t find any signals of California bosses immediately fleeing the state after it raised the minimum wage to $10 an hour to start 2016 then to $10.50 for employers with 26-plus employees to start 2017.
The number of private employers in California grew 4.5 percent in the year ended in June vs. 2.3 percent growth in the rest of the nation. Bosses added 335,839 jobs in California in the year, a 2.3 percent increase vs. 1.8 percent elsewhere. And wages are up: Average weekly pay in California rose 4.8 percent in the year vs. 2.9 percent in the rest of the nation.
And California’s leisure and hospitality industries — businesses that rely heavily on minimum-wage workers — are faring well with no sign of major job cutbacks or business owners closing shop.
The number of California employers in tourism, entertainment and food-serving niches grew by 4.6 percent in the year ended in June vs. 2.4 percent growth in the rest of the nation. These bosses added 61,912 jobs in California, a 3.2 percent increase vs. 2.2 percent elsewhere. And weekly wages? Up 4 percent in California vs. 3.8 percent elsewhere.
So enjoy the pay gift, minimum wage earner! And to the salary Scrooges out there, “Happy Holidays” to you, too!

Rowley paramedic sentenced for drug theft Joseph V. Amello, 50, a paramedic from Rowley, was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in federal prison for stealing fentanyl from ambulances, the US Attorney's office said Thursday. He was also sentenced to three years of supervised release, prosecutors said in a press release. Amello stole 650 vials of fentanyl, a potent opioid, for his own use, while working for an ambulance company from November 2014 to August 2015, the release stated. He pleaded guilty in June to one count of acquiring a controlled substance by deception, fraud and forgery, and one count of tampering with a consumer product.
Boston
Baker to speak at police opioid recovery summit Governor Charlie Baker is due to give opening remarks at the first National Law Enforcement Summit organized by the Police Assisted Addiction and Recovery Initiative, according to a statement from the Gloucester organization, also known as PAARI. More than 200 law enforcement leaders from 27 states and the District of Columbia are scheduled to attend the two-day meeting that starts Tuesday at Boston University School of Medicine, the statement said. Participants will discuss strategies and approaches by public safety agencies across the country to respond to the nation's opioid crisis. Local agencies scheduled to participate include sheriff's departments in Essex and Plymouth counties, and advocates from the recovery communities in Burlington, Gloucester, and Lynn, the statement said.
Providence
State eyes Amtrak service at T.F. Green Rhode Island transportation officials and Amtrak have been discussing ways to add service to T.F. Green Airport, they said on Thursday. The state transportation director, Peter Alviti, told WPRO-AM that his agency did a study with Amtrak about adding airport service and he believes it's doable in the next few years, but it could cost more than $100 million. Currently, only the commuter rail to Boston stops at the airport. Amtrak has just three stops in Rhode Island, in Providence, South Kingstown, and Westerly. Amtrak said in a statement later Thursday that it's too early to make any commitments regarding future service but confirmed the study had been conducted. (AP)
Montpelier
'Merci' for misspelled soccer jerseys Vermont's capital city has said “merci" via Skype to a French city it's named after for some misspelled soccer jerseys that were sent its way. Montpelier, Vt., says Montpellier, France, ordered jerseys for its professional soccer team and fans, but they came in misspelled, with just one L instead of two. The city in southern France decided to send them to Montpelier, Vt., which is spelled with one L, not two. Montpelier Mayor John Hollar thanked Montpellier Mayor Philippe Saurel by Skype on Thursday. Student soccer players at Montpelier High School wore the donated jerseys for the event. (AP)
Augusta, Maine
LePage seeks disaster declaration for Halloween storm Maine Governor Paul LePage has asked President Trump for a disaster declaration to help recover from a powerful wind storm that knocked out power for more than half of the state's homes and businesses. The storm on the day before Halloween toppled drought-weakened trees, left roads impassable, and knocked down more than 1,400 utility poles. The governor said the state documented $4.7 million in damage to public infrastructure, far surpassing the threshold for a declaration. (AP)

'He keeps saying he murdered four people'

Texto completo: The caller can be heard first describing the naked, mud-splattered young man that is on his property on Common Street in Groton.
He then conveyed to the 911 dispatcher what the young man told him he just did.
“He's a little bit crazy," said Wagner Alcocer . “And he keeps saying he murdered four people."
The man Alcocer was describing was Orion Krause, whom prosecutors allege used a baseball bat to kill his mother, his grandparents, and a health aide working for the elderly couple at their home in Groton on Sept. 8.
Alcocer's description of Krause featured on one of two 911 recordings from the aftermath of the bloody quadruple homicide that were released Wednesday night following a public records request from the Globe.
“He needs help," said Alcocer on the recording.
During the call, Alcocer can be heard telling the dispatcher that the man, later identified by authorities as Krause, was sitting in a chair in his backyard. Alcocer said he did not know who the man is. When Alcocer told the dispatcher he was going to give Krause a towel, the dispatcher urged him not to do that.
“Do not go anywhere near him," the dispatcher said.
It's an order Alcocer heeded.
The dispatcher then asked if Alcocer can see police arriving to his home. Alcocer said they had yet to arrive. A brief back-and-forth between him and the dispatcher followed, and the call ended when police arrived at his home.
The other 911 call released featured Rockport, Maine Police Sergeant James C. Moore calling Groton authorities. Rockport is Krause's hometown. Moore identified himself to the dispatcher, then said “What I've got is a . . . mental health problem . . ."
The dispatcher interjected, asking if the call was about Krause.
“Holy cow, yes it is," said Moore.
“You're like the fifth call we've gotten," replied the dispatcher.
The dispatcher then asked Moore if Krause has any weapons.
“None that I know of," said Moore.
Moore then told the dispatcher he received a call from one of Krause's former teachers. The dispatcher then confirmed he spoke with the same teacher, and shortly thereafter the call ends. The entire call lasts 46 seconds.
On the day of the murders, the wife of Oberlin College professor Jamey G. Haddad, who had taught Krause at that school, had contacted police in Maine, according to a Rockport police report.
“I think I have to kill my mom," Krause twice told Haddad, according to the report.
In the call with Moore, the dispatcher mentioned that Groton authorities had been in contact with a “Mr. Haddad."
Krause now faces four counts of murder. Last month, he was found competent to stand trial.
The slayings rocked the small town of Groton, which is located about 40 miles northwest of Boston. Before the quadruple homicide, the community had not experienced a murder in more than 20 years.
Laura Crimaldi, John R. Ellement, and Brian MacQuarrie of Globe staff contributed to this report. Danny McDonald can be reached at daniel.mcdonald@globe.com. Follow him on Twitter @Danny__McDonald.

Texto completo: OKLAHOMA CITY -- The misdeeds of notorious twin sisters Birdie Jo and Becky Jo Hoaks have again caught up with them, but this time, the Hoopeston natives broke federal laws and were sentenced to prison on Tuesday for defrauding the U.S. postal service.
Identical twins, Roberta "Birdie" Jo Hoaks, 47, and Becky Jo Hoaks, 47, grew up in Hoopeston but did not begin their lives of petty crime until they became adults and left their northern Vermilion County hometown.
The pair were sentenced Tuesday -- five years for Birdie Jo and four years for Becky Jo -- to federal prison for conspiring to steal U.S. postage stamps, according to Mark A. Yancey, U.S. attorney for the Western District of Oklahoma.
It's the first federal conviction for the pair who have a decades-long criminal history of fraud that stretches across the country.
Recently living in Choctaw, Okla., they were indicted in May on charges of conspiracy and theft of government property.
According to the indictment, from June 2016 through February, the sisters opened personal checking accounts at various banks, using small cash deposits ranging from $5 to $200, and working together, wrote dozens of bogus checks at U.S. post offices and contract postal units throughout western Oklahoma to obtain thousands of U.S. postage stamps. According to federal authorities in Oklahoma, there's an online market for stamps.
Both sisters pleaded guilty to conspiracy in June, agreeing to $61,993.38 in restitution, mostly to the U.S. Postal Service, and on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge David L. Russell sentenced Birdie Jo Hoaks, who has a son, to the statutory maximum five years in prison, and Becky Jo Hoaks to four years.
According to federal officials, even if the sisters earn the maximum credit for good behavior, each must serve at least 85 percent of their prison sentences, and both will serve three years of supervised release after their prison terms.
It's the longest prison sentence yet for the sisters who have extensive criminal histories of fraud spanning more than two decades in jurisdictions from New York to California.
For years, the sisters have used their 5-foot, 1-inch stature, androgynous appearance and childlike voices to pass themselves off as young, homeless boys to get medical and social services, food, shelter and money. Authorities say the pair, who have worked together and alone, have been involved in such incidents in South Dakota, Montana, Vermont, Utah, Maine, New York, New Jersey, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Texas, Idaho, Arizona, California, Alaska and Louisiana.
Their escapades have repeatedly made headlines, even television in 2012, when the twins were featured in a "Dateline" NBC investigative report.
One of their more infamous scams occurred in a small Kansas town in 2004, when 33-year-old Birdie Jo posed as an abused 13-year-old boy with Becky Jo posing as his aunt. They received assistance from a local church congregation, and after their hoax was discovered, they were charged with fraud. But local authorities eventually dropped the charges, and local church members forgave them and continued to help the sisters. Then two years later, the duo stole the congregation's safe.
And they first gained national notoriety in 1995, after Birdie Jo told child welfare workers in Salt Lake City that she was a 13-year-old boy abandoned at a bus stop by his father and stepmother before his Christmas birthday. The story prompted an outpouring of sympathy as well as Christmas and birthday gifts, money and offers of shelter.
The scam was discovered after a physical revealed the then-25-year-old woman's bound breasts and a scar from a Caesarean section. Birdie Jo Hoaks served only two months of an 18-month prison sentence after being found guilty of misdemeanor theft of services and making false statements in that case.
In this latest federal case, Birdie Jo's sentencing documents were sealed by the federal judge, but Becky Jo's were not. According to those documents, Becky Jo has been arrested 19 times and convicted 11 times, but has been incarcerated only once.
The Hoakses were born in 1970 and raised by their grandmother in Hoopeston, where they were known as loners. After graduating from Hoopeston-East Lynn High School in 1988, they entered the National Guard, completed basic training in New Jersey and were eventually discharged.
According to the federal sentencing documents, the sisters never knew their father, were abandoned as babies by their mother and were raised by their grandmother who was poor and did her best, keeping them out of trouble with the law until their adult years, when, a few years after their grandmother's passing, they committed their first crime.

Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski defend opposition to individual mandate

Texto completo: Republican Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski helped doom the GOP's efforts to repeal Obamacare over the summer by voting against a bill that would have repealed the law's individual mandate.
Now Alaska's Murkowski and Maine's Collins are backing a repeal of the mandate's penalties.
Murkowski said Wednesday she would support the overall tax reform bill that would repeal the penalties, while Collins still has some lingering demands that include adding a $10,000 property tax deduction. Collins has said she opposes the mandate but didn't want it to be included in tax reform, and has called for a commitment to bring up two Obamacare stabilization bills to buffer any impact on premiums from mandate repeal.
Both senators approved a procedural motion on Wednesday to start debate on the bill.
Collins and Murkowski said separately that the "skinny" repeal bill included more than just repeal of the individual mandate, which requires everyone to buy health insurance or pay a penalty. The senators joined Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who said Thursday he would back the tax legislation, and all Senate Democrats to defeat the measure in late July. They also opposed a last-ditch effort in September to repeal and replace Obamacare.
"The skinny repeal bill had many other provisions in it," Collins said. "It repealed the employer mandate, eliminated funding for Planned Parenthood and had many other provisions and so it is not comparable at all [to mandate repeal]."
Murkowski made similar remarks.
"It was far more than the individual mandate," she said.
Murkowski said in a statement outlining her support for the tax bill that it "removes the tax penalty for those who do not wish to purchase health insurance that they cannot afford or that offers little value to them."
Collins said the individual mandate fines individuals who choose not to have insurance, and said that 80 percent of the fines are paid by people who make less than $50,000 a year.
"So those fines are falling disproportionately on middle and low-income Americans,' she said.
Collins has pushed for the Senate to take up two Obamacare stabilization bills separately from tax reform to blunt higher premiums expected from repealing the mandate's penalties.
One bill from Sens. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Patty Murray, D-Wash., would make Obamacare insurer payments for two years in exchange for more flexibility for states to waive Obamacare regulations.
A second bill sponsored by Collins and Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., would provide $4.5 billion to states over two years to set up reinsurance programs that help Obamacare exchange insurers lower the cost of the highest medical claims. The intent is that insurers would lower premiums for everyone else as a result.
However, the Congressional Budget Office estimated Wednesday that the Alexander-Murray bill would not provide enough help to mitigate the impact of repealing the mandate. The estimate did not evaluate Collins and Nelson's bill.
The CBO previously estimated mandate repeal would raise premiums by 10 percent and lead to 13 million people foregoing insurance.
Alexander pushed back on the estimate. He said Wednesday that CBO said in August that not paying the insurer payments would cause a 25 percent spike in premiums by 2020.
"The Alexander-Murray bill pays cost-sharing reduction payments for two years, which should prevent that 25 percent increase," he said.

Texto completo: President Trump on Thursday blasted the New York Times for allowing its editorial board to lobby Twitter users and their lawmakers against the tax reform bill.
"The Failing @nytimes, the pipe organ for the Democrat Party, has become a virtual lobbyist for them with regard to our massive Tax Cut Bill. They are wrong so often that now I know we have a winner!" Trump tweeted Thursday morning.
On Wednesday, the @NYTOpinion account tweeted, "Contact @SenatorCollins, (202) 224-2523, particularly if you live in Maine, and ask her to oppose the Senate tax bill because it would repeal Obamacare's individual mandate, driving up the cost of health insurance. #thetaxbillhurts."
The tweet urged people to contact other Republican senators, including Lisa Murkowski, Bob Corker, Jeff Flake, and John McCain about the bill.
The NYT editorial board confirmed it was temporarily taking over the account in order "to urge the Senate to reject a tax bill that hurts the middle class and the nation's fiscal health."

Texto completo: A key moderate Republican senator on Thursday brushed aside a Washington Post reporter's question about President Trump's mental health.
Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who has spent hours with the president discussing and negotiating tax reform, said, "First of all, let me say, my conversations with the president recently have given me no reason to be concerned in that regard."
She was answering a question from the Post's Jonathan Capehart at a media breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor. "I'm wondering how concerned you are about the mental health of the president?" asked Capehart.
Collins did, however, said that Trump is wrong to raise conspiracy theories and to have tweeted questionable anti-Muslim videos this week.
"Do I think that it's helpful that he raises these conspiracy theories or puts out a tweet of an anti-Muslim video that turns out to not even be accurate? No. I don't," she said.

Trump insiders claim 'unstoppable momentum' despite media 'derision'

Texto completo: Nearly a year into the Trump presidency, top aides and allies feel good about their direction and achievements, crediting the president's "stamina" and "100 percent energy" to fight past critics, especially the media.
"If media coverage was fair, unbiased, down the the middle, there would be 100 stories about the unstoppable momentum and energy of the Oval Office," said senior adviser Stephen Miller.
"The critics did the very same thing with Ronald Reagan," added Christopher Ruddy, the president of Newsmax and a Trump ally. "And Donald Trump is 100 times more engaged than Ronald Reagan."
Allies have felt the need to push back on stories suggesting that Trump is a part-time president, even though the media has documented his 6 a.m. tweets and 1 a.m. phone calls to aides.
For example, instead of noting that he took no time off after an arduous 12-day trip to Asia and delivered a report card live to public, the media poked fun at his fumbling for a water bottle during the speech. And his ex-wife Ivana fanned the flames when she said, "I think he must be freaking exhausted. I would be too."
Aides and allies tell a different story.
White House chief of staff John Kelly expressed surprise that Trump wanted to talk about the Asia trip immediately after getting home. "After a 12-day trip to Asia, I encouraged the president to take a day off and recover. The president wouldn't hear of it. He insisted he wanted to report back to the American people on his trip to Asia," he said.
"Despite a huge time change and demanding schedule, the president spent the day working on and delivering a speech," Kelly added.
Ruddy, a member of Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida, has known the president a long time and said he has taken his corporate motto of outworking the other guy into the White House.
"I think the guy has bionic genes, I've never seen a guy with so much energy and I know he's working until late at night and making phone calls very early in the morning. He's on the go all the time," Ruddy said.
"People don't realize how engaged this president really is. He's involved," he added.

It's been noticed on Capitol Hill, especially among the lawmakers Trump calls several times a day.
Maine Sen. Susan Collins on Thursday said that she has held several meetings with the president to discuss the ongoing tax reform debate and added that he has adopted some of her ideas. Speaking at a media breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor, she added that the process to win support for the tax reform bill has been much different -- and better -- than the bid to repeal Obamacare. "So much more outreach. It's just night and day," Collins said.
Trump, said Sergio Gor, spokesman for Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, "is one of the most energetic and engaging individuals in Washington. Believe me, there are plenty of low energy elected officials, President Trump is not one of them."
Top aide Miller has a special perspective, having worked on Capitol Hill and then on the Trump campaign, always with the candidate on "Trump Force One," Trump's private jet that hit several cities a day near the end of the 2016 contest.
He recalled one stop in Redding, Calif., where it was so hot that staff hid under a tent and supporters were fainting. There, Trump spoke for an hour and then spent 30 minutes more meeting with first responders and ground support.
"I've never seen anybody work harder, put effort into anything in my entire life," Miller told Secrets, checking off achievements including slashing regulations, strangling ISIS, braking illegal immigration and working toward an historic win on tax reform and job creation.
Miller said the president has kept up the campaign pace inside the White House.
"If you get a call from the president it is not at all unusual that you get the call before you've even gotten up for the day. And you could be getting a call from him long after you've finished your work for the night. So he's the first one working in the morning and the last one in the evening," Miller said.
Papers dropped off at the White House residence at night, he added, are often delivered back the next morning with notes and comments written in by the president.
What's more, Trump often demands that staff add time for him to speak at simple meet-and-greets, felling if people made the time to come to a White House meeting, he should respect them with his time.
"His whole ethos is about success is just outworking your opponents and your opposition, and that was always something that is part of the Donald Trump manta, the Donald Trump ethos, part of the whole American success story," he said.
And it's impacted staff.
Cabinet secretaries say they feel compelled to work overtime pushing the president's agenda, be it tax reform or cutting regulations.
"They will be held accountable if they don't deliver," said Miller, adding, "That's a great example of how that energy and stamina at the top filters all the way down through and shakes the rust off of Washington and turns this White House into a lean, highly motivated machine of getting things done."
But so far they aren't getting much credit and some see the media as the reason.
"Unfortunately, we live in the era of hyper advocacy journalism and a lot of outlets that have branded themselves for a very long time as being impartial are in fact the worst offenders in the field of hyper advocacy journalism. And that's just the plain truth," Miller said.
'The tone of sarcasm or even the tone of derision, and you just think to yourself how out of touch the group of people that talk about these issues are from the people who are most affected by them," he added.

Texto completo: There's always one troublesome person on everyone's gift list who “has everything." But “thing" is the operative word. Your parent/sibling/BFF might be so burdened with possessions that a hoarding intervention is imminent, but there's no such thing as too many experiences. So this year keep your gift money circulating in the local economy while celebrating some of the things that are so great about New England. Unless otherwise noted, you can buy gift certificates in any dollar amount. You don't have to buy the whole windjammer cruise or B&B getaway, though siblings have been known to chip in on a once-in-a-lifetime biggie for Mom and Dad.
New England on two wheels
Bicycle touring is the perfect combination of speed and immersion in the environment. There's no need to roll down the windows to see things clearly, and the camaraderie of pedaling in a pack makes the excursion a social event. Massachusetts-based Great Freedom Adventures(508-545-1864, www.greatfreedom adventures.com) offers bike tours that touch all the New England states except Maine. They range from the upcountry challenges of the hills of New Hampshire and Vermont to the flatland farm-country pedaling of the Coastal New England Wine Trail in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. For Vacationland cycling, Portland-based Summer Feet Cycling (866-857-9544, www.summerfeet.net) is a Maine specialist. Weekend and week-long trips tend to focus on coastal routes. If your gift recipient is just getting into cycling, Summer Feet also offers several day trips, including one that visits five lighthouses.
Step by step
There's an art to walking. While cyclists zip through the landscape, walkers move at a more contemplative pace. Vermont Inn to Inn Walking Tours (802-875-4288, www.vermontinntoinnwalking.com) is exactly as described—a four-day adventure of self-guided walking from one property to the next in southern Vermont while someone else schleps the luggage. Also based in Vermont, Country Walkers (800-234-6900, www.countrywalkers .com) does group walking tours around the world. But the company doesn't forget its home base. Two popular options are Vermont: Fall Foliage and Maine: Acadia National Park. Both are 6-day, 5-night journeys into the heart of New England beauty.
Kitchen skills
For those who prefer cooking to mixology, the hands-on classes at King Arthur Flour (800-827-6836, www.kingarthurflour.com) in Norwich, Vt., range from decorated cakes and savory pierogi to flaky croissants and hearty whole grain breads. Gift cards are available in denominations of $25 to $200. Last-minute shoppers can score e-gift cards in denominations of $5 to $1,000. The demonstration classes at the York, Maine, cooking school of Stonewall Kitchen (800-826-1752, www.stonewallkitchen.com) almost always feature the menu for an entire meal — which students get to eat. Each class is themed around an ingredient, a cookbook signing, or a regional cuisine. Gift cards and e-gift cards range in denominations of $25 to $100.
Great escapes
If your recipient needs to — or maybe just deserves to — get away from it all for a few days, give the fresh perspective of a new location. The members of New England Inns & Resorts (603-964-6689, new englandinnsandresorts.com) run the gamut from intimate and rustic B&Bs to posh spa resorts in all six New England states. If the 280 choices might paralyze your recipient with indecision, try the 10 inns of Country Inns in the White Mountains (800-338-1356, www.countryinns inthewhitemountains.com). They line the Mount Washington Valley of New Hampshire (and nearby Fryeburg, Maine). Similarly, the eight properties of the Kennebunkport Resort Collection (800-573-7186, www.kennebunkportresortcollection .com) cluster around south coastal Maine's favorite destination. They range from waterfront inns to the glam cabins in the woods at Hidden Pond.
New adventures
Just being outdoors in New England can be pretty special, but the thrills increase when seen through the lens of a new outdoor skill. Ski Vermont (802-223-2439, www.skivermont.com) has a nifty $129 gift called the “Take 3 Beginner Package." Your recipient gets three beginner ski or snowboard lessons, rental equipment for the day, and lift access to the beginner terrain. The lessons can be redeemed at one or more participating slopes. Classes through the L.L. Bean Outdoor Discovery Schools (800-441-5713, www.llbean.com) run the gamut from basic map and compass skills to kayaking and stand-up paddleboarding. One popular option is the outdoor photography class, offered frequently in Freeport, Maine, and in Dedham. Gift and e-gift cards of $5-$500 can be applied to class fees. Vermont's own Orvis Fly-Fishing School (888-235-9763, www.orvis.com) addresses a range of skill levels with classes in Vermont, Rhode Island, and on Cape Cod. Gift certificates are available in any amount. (And if your recipient gets hooked, so to speak, you can buy fly-tying materials every holiday hereafter.)
Hint strongly if you want to tag along.

Texto completo: More than 15 packages, most of which are believed to have been Christmas presents, were stolen from the Howland Post Office sometime overnight Wednesday, police said.
When post office employees reported to work around 8:30 a.m. Thursday, they found package remnants strewn across the floor, the contents of which had been stolen, and noticed that other packages had been rummaged through, Maine State Trooper Adam Gould said.
Some of the open packages still had receipts inside for items that included shoes, clothes and a variety of electronics, Gould said, leading police to believe they were intended to be Christmas presents.
Police believe two burglars entered the lobby -- which is open 24 hours a day -- and broke into the storage room, where packages are kept, Gould said. Police are still working to identify the suspects.
Thefts of packages from post offices around the holidays are not uncommon, Gould said.
"Over the next month, it wouldn't be surprising if another [post office] was hit," he said.

AARP seeks tax measure that protects older Mainers

Texto completo: To the Editor:
On behalf of 230,000 AARP members in the state of Maine, I am writing with great concern regarding the latest version of the Senate Tax Bill. Congressional leaders are trying to rush this bill into law and there are several aspects of the bill which would have dire consequences for millions of Americans including thousands in the state of Maine.
First of all, the bill would slash billions of dollars from Medicare funding, starting as soon as next year. In fact, the bill would cut Medicare by $25 billion in 2018 alone and pave the way for more cuts down the road. These cuts mean that older Mainers could lose access to the doctors they know and trust. It means hospitals would be forced to make tough cuts. It means millions of Americans who've earned their Medicare benefits could be turned away from care.
Medicare is a promise made to the American people " not a trade-off for tax cuts. Efforts to make the tax code fairer should not come at the expense of Medicare.
The Senate bill would also eliminate the current health care coverage requirement or individual mandate. This would cause a spike in health insurance premiums by an estimated 10 percent. As a result, 13 million Americans, including thousands of Mainers, would lose their health insurance.
AARP opposes the tax bill in its current form because it is unfair to older adults and to people living on fixed incomes. All concerned Mainers should contact Sen. Susan Collins at 1-844-502-4371 and ask her to vote no. We urge both the Senate and the House to reach a bipartisan solution that protects older Americans and makes the tax code simpler and easier to understand.

UMaine freshman goalie, teammates seeking two wins this weekend

Texto completo: ORONO, Maine -- University of Maine freshman goaltender Jeremy Swayman has been a model of consistency of late and hopes to continue that trend or improved this weekend when the Black Bears entertain the University of Vermont for a two-game Hockey East series.
The Black Bears are 5-7 overall, 3-4 in Hockey East, while the Catamounts are 4-9-1 and 1-5-1, respectively. The games are at 7 p.m. on Friday and 5 on Saturday.
Swayman had allowed two goals in each of his last five starts and has an impressive .939 save percentage during that stretch.
His .921 save percentage on the season is 15th best in the country and third among the nation's freshmen. His overall goals-against average of 2.51 is seventh best among freshmen and 27th overall.
"He has been playing unbelievable," said UMaine sophomore center and co-captain Chase Pearson. "He has been the backbone of our team. When you have a goalie playing like that, it builds our confidence."
"He is definitely athletic and he is committed. He works hard every day and it has paid off for him," said sophomore right wing Patrick Shea. "He's definitely mentally prepared for every game."
Swayman said he has been happy with the way he has played "but I'm never satisfied."
The 6-foot-2, 187-pound native of Anchorage, Alaska, was a fourth-round draft pick of the Boston Bruins this past summer, the 111th overall selection.
He gave up four goals in his season's debut, a 5-1 loss to the University of Connecticut, and gave up three in the 6-3 win over Miami on Oct. 21.
He has allowed 10 goals in his last five starts with 155 saves.
Swayman said one of the things he has focused on is his off-ice preparedness with associate director of sports performance Matt Murray and assistant coach/goalie coach Alfie Michaud, a former UMaine goalie.
"Matt Murray has helped us out and working with Alfie Michaud has been really beneficial to my game. He helps me read shooters and read plays. I can't thank him enough," said Swayman.
Swayman said he gets a "little more comfortable" with each game after making the adjustment from junior hockey.
He played for the Sioux Falls Stampede in the United States Hockey League where he was 7-18-3 with a 2.90 GAA and a .914 save percentage last season.
He had been sharing the goaltending with junior Rob McGovern but has won the starting job and played in both games in the Friendship Four Tournament in Northern Ireland last weekend, making 52 saves and allowing four goals in a 3-0 loss to Providence and a 4-2 win over Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute of Troy, New York.
"I just want to keep getting better," said Swayman. "We're prepared for a tough battle this weekend. I'm going to do whatever it takes to win."
Vermont swept the Black Bears out of the Hockey East playoffs last season.
"We have a bone to pick with them," said Pearson, who will be looking to break out of a 14-game goal scoring drought.
"It kind of gets into your head but, at the same time, it's hockey and stuff like this happens. There are lots of ups and downs within the game," said Pearson, who has eight assists and is tied for second on the team in scoring.
"I'm not worried about my production. If I keep working hard and doing things the right way, the goals are going to come," added Pearson, who had 14 goals a year ago, second only to Blaine Byron's 18.

Texto completo: End sexual abuse
In our generous community, we pay it forward. Recently, I attended a community forum dedicated to this act. Community members and service providers shared their stories of individuals in need who received something with the hope that they pay it forward when they could. These touching stories brought many of us to tears, inspired us and garnered an overwhelming sense of good will.
While I listened to story after story, I couldn't help but think of the thousands of survivors who have recently come forward to share their stories of sexual abuse, assault and harassment. Famous perpetrators are being called out for their atrocious behavior -- only because brave and courageous women came forward to say #metoo. This is the greatest, most effective act of paying it forward I've seen in my lifetime.
What better way is there to help another person, to give them a safe space to use their voices to relay their experiences with sexual abuse, assault and harassment? Every woman who has spoken up has unknowingly paid it forward for the numerous survivors who have been silenced. The disclosures that we are witnessing shouldn't stop until the abuse does. As a nation, we need to keep listening and demand justice.

Trump gets pass on harassment
I watch on TV, day after day, prominent men being accused of sexual harassment toward women and being dismissed from their jobs. Yet, Donald Trump, the president of the United States, the highest office of our land, has the same accusations from many women and yet he gets a pass. Please will someone explain how that can be? I consider myself anaverage intelligent women but for the life of me I can't figure this one out.

Tax bill will cause harm
The Senate tax bill was rushed through without time for analysis or well-thought-out input. There was no real attempt to make the bill bipartisan. Economists overwhelmingly stated that the result will not be growth, but a massive deficit. It is wealthy corporations and individuals who will benefit, while everyone else likely will lose social benefits like Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare that will be cut to reduce the deficit.
As a physician working for many years in Maine, I was particularly concerned about ending the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate, which would lead to market instability, higher rates and millions unable to afford health insurance. Surely a "win" achieved by passing this bill is not worth the drastic consequences.
Philip Elkin
Stonington
Tax bills reveal GOP agenda
The tax bills revealed a lot about the Republican agenda. They would result in millions losing health insurance, reductions in Medicare funding, and increased taxes on college students, while doing little or nothing for low- and middle-income workers. Both would substantially reduce taxes paid by the wealthy and big business, and exempt the wealthiest from estate taxes. Both would greatly increase the nation's debt, leaving that burden to tomorrow's working people.
Like the Affordable Care Act repeal bills, the tax bills represent a completely partisan process -- produced by a small group of men, with no Democratic input, allowing little time for consideration, expecting all party members to fall in line.
The message could not be clearer -- the national Republican Party serves the interests of wealth and power, period. The goal seems to be to return to a plutocratic order, something like the class structure of the antebellum South. If you buy the ideology, there's no need to harden your heart, because those with little have all that they deserve. Increased income disparity is just and desirable because "haves" are inherently more valuable and important than "have nots."

Texto completo: Clark, Cyr finalists for Maine's top sports media honor
A quartet of northern Maine sportswriters and broadcasters, including two with ties to the Bangor Daily News, have been recognized as finalists for the Maine sportswriter and sportscaster of the year awards given by the National Sports Media Association.
Ernie Clark of the BDN is joined by Houlton Pioneer Times reporter Joseph Cyr as a finalists for the state's top sportswriter for 2017. Among the broadcasters, Rene Cloukey, the sports director at WAGM-TV in Presque Isle, and Rich Kimball of Black Bear Sports Properties/Learfield in Orono and the host of the "Downtown with Rich Kimball" radio show, are the the finalists.
The journalists received nominations by NSMA members to make the top two in their respective categories and reach the final ballot. That vote will take place among state members during December. The winners will be announced in January 2018.
State winners will be recognized as part of the 59th annual NSMA Awards Weekend, which will be held June 23-25, 2018, in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.Kaepernick wins Ali Legacy Award
Football player Colin Kaepernick was announced Thursday as the 2017 recipient of the Sports Illustrated Muhammad Ali Legacy Award.
The Legacy Award is given to sports figures who use their platform to initiate change.
Kaepernick hasn't been affiliated with an NFL team this season, likely related to his stance of kneeling for the national anthem for much of the 2016 season. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell has insisted on several occasions that the 30-year-old Kaepernick isn't being blackballed.
Regardless, Kaepernick's protest to draw attention to police brutality and social justice issues created change, and protests during the anthem picked up this season after players were criticized by President Donald Trump. Kaepernick also has donated upwards of $1 million to charities.
"The Muhammad Ali Legacy Award is given to those who make the world a better place," Sports Illustrated executive editor Steve Cannella told USA TODAY Sports. "The fact Colin hasn't played this year or been on the field doesn't disqualify him.
"That fact that he hasn't played in a game actually shows what he has sacrificed for standing up for what he believes. There will never be another Muhammad Ali, but you can see the echoes of (Ali) in what Colin has done over the last 12 to 15 months."Browns' Peppers fined $24,000
Cleveland Browns safety Jabrill Peppers was fined $24,000 by the NFL for an illegal hit on Cincinnati Bengals receiver Josh Malone.
The play occurred last Sunday, and Peppers was assessed a personal foul for the hit that prevented Malone from making a catch.
Peppers said he will appeal the fine, and doesn't understand what he did wrong.Raiders' top receivers sidelined
The Oakland Raiders may be without their top two wide receivers for Sunday's game against the visiting New York Giants.
Amari Cooper remained off the field while media members were allowed to watch Thursday's practice. The 23-year-old currently is in the league's concussion protocol and also is battling an ankle issue.
Cooper departed Sunday's game after taking a shot to the head from Broncos safety Darian Stewart. Definitely out is Michael Crabtree, who is set to serve a one-game suspension for last Sunday's fight with Denver Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib.
"Los Angeles Chargers cornerback Casey Hayward left the team to be with his family after his brother, Jecaives, was killed in a car accident.
Jecaives Hayward was killed Monday night in Macon, Ga., when he was ejected from a car in which he was a passenger. Casey Hayward's availability for the Chargers (5-6) in Sunday's game against the Cleveland Browns (0-11) is uncertain.
Hayward, who was named the AFC's Defensive Player of the Month on Thursday, has 30 tackles and four interceptions in 11 games this season.Misdemeanor assault charge dismissed against Johnny Manziel
DALLAS -- A 2016 domestic assault charge against Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Johnny Manziel has been dismissed.
The Dallas County District Attorney's Office on Thursday confirmed Manziel successfully completed requirements of a court agreement that included taking an anger management course and participating in the NFL's substance-abuse program. The case was dismissed Nov. 22.
The 24-year-old Manziel also had to stay away from former girlfriend Colleen Crowley, who accused him of hitting and threatening her during a January 2016 night out. Manziel faced a misdemeanor charge that carried a penalty of up to a year in jail and a $4,000 fine.
The allegations stem from a night out when Crowley said Manziel accosted her at a Dallas hotel, a confrontation that continued downstairs to the valet station. She said he forced her into a car and a valet disregarded her pleas for help. The two eventually drove to where her car was parked in front of a Dallas bar, she said in an affidavit. She said Manziel got into the driver's seat and began to drive. Crowley said Manziel stopped when she tried to jump out of the car, but then he dragged her back inside and hit her.
Cleveland chose Manziel 22nd overall in the 2014 draft. The Browns cut him in March 2016 after two seasons of inconsistent play and off-the-field issues. The former Texas A&M star was suspended four games for a substance-abuse violation even though he wasn't under contract.
Manziel looked north of the border recently and the Canadian Football League said in September that it would not approve a contract for him until next season, if he meets confidential conditions stipulated by the CFL commissioner.

Texto completo: AUGUSTA--Maine Department of Labor is launching a new unemployment benefits filing system in early December. Known as ReEmployME (ME is pronounced "Maine"), the new system is a faster, more efficient way to file for unemployment insurance benefits. Claimants will find it easier to access information about their claims, update their account, file Weekly Certifications for benefits and enter their required Work Searches.
"This new system is the result of years of work in collaboration with other states to create a modern, efficient unemployment system," stated Governor Paul LePage. "The focus of unemployment is to get people back to work quickly in a permanent or a temporary bridge job. This system will not only do just that, but it will also save taxpayer money over time because of the ReEmployUSA partnership with other states. ReEmployME is a national model."
The Bureau of Unemployment Compensation (BUC) has been communicating about the transition to current claimants and those who file cyclically this time of year. Claimants are advised of the upcoming timeline so they can prepare to access the new system after launch and plan for a slight delay in benefit payments.
The department anticipates ReEmployME will launch on December 6. Claimants must visit www.maine.gov/reemployme after launch to create an account with a valid email address. Do not use a shared or fake email account. Free email addresses are available online through Gmail, Outlook, and Yahoo! mail, to name a few.
Claimants who need help creating a ReEmployME account after launch can call a Technical Support Representative at 207-623-6765 between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday except state and federal holidays. Technical Support Representatives can only answer questions about creating a ReEmployME account.
Claimants who need help filing a claim or to get information about a current claim can call a Customer Service Representative at 1-800-593-7660 between 8:00 a.m. and 12:30 p.m., Monday through Friday except state and federal holidays.
Direct deposit and MAP/EPC card benefit payments should appear within three days of processing for claims filed within the first few weeks after ReEmployME's launch.
Claimants can watch for updates about the transition at www.maine.gov/labor/unemployment
"Unemployment insurance provides temporary, partial wage replacement to workers who are unemployed through no fault of their own," said Commissioner of Labor John Butera. "Support for claimants while they search for reemployment is the end goal of the unemployment insurance program. The new ReEmployME system will provide claimants with around-the-clock ability to file for benefits and provide more accurate information to reduce fraud."

Texto completo: Senior offensive lineman Jamil Demby and sophomore running back Josh Mack have been named to the All-New England Football Team.
Demby, a 6-foot-5, 335-pound offensive lineman, previously earned a spot on the All-Colonial Athletic Association first team. He started all 10 games at left tackle and led an offensive line that paved the way for the Football Championship Subdivision rushing leader Mack and allowed a league-low 19 sacks.
Mack, a 6-1, 198-pound running back, was also named to the All-CAA first team. His 1,335 rushing yards were tops in the FCS during the regular season and the fourth highest single-season total in UMaine history.
Mack, who earned his first All-CAA honor, also led the nation in rushing yards per game (133.5) and ranked third in all-purpose yards per game (161.5). He ran for 100-plus yards in seven of Maine's 10 games, including two 200-yard efforts. He was the CAA leader in rushing touchdowns (9) and yards per carry (5.49).Colby player recognized
Colby College sophomore Georgia Cassidy (Darien, Conn.) has claimed her second postseason award after being named to the National Field Hockey Coaches Association New England West Region Second Team.
Cassidy, a University of North Carolina transfer, had already been named to the New England Small College Athletic Conference All-Conference Second Team.
She tied the team's single-season goal scoring record and helped the Mules finish 9-6. Cassidy was sixth in the NESCAC in goals (15) and is tied with three-time All-American Wendy Bonner for Colby's single-season goal scoring record.
She also had three assists and ranked seventh in the league in points (33). She tallied three game-winning goals.Saint Joseph's staff feted
Saint Joseph's College men's soccer head coach Adrian Dubois and assistants Michael Sanfilippo, Kyle Shangraw and Will Pike have been selected as the 2017 United Soccer Coaches NCAA Division III New England Region Coaching Staff of the Year.
Dubois, who recently completed his fourth year with the Monks, is 50-24-9 (.676) with a 33-2-7 (.943) conference record since coming to Saint Joseph's in 2014. He has won two Great Northeast Athletic Conference Coach of the Year accolades and guided the Monks to the conference tournament in each of his four seasons.
All three of the Monks' assistant coaches are college alumni. Sanfilippo played four years and helped St. Joe's claim two GNAC titles. Pike, a Division I transfer from Mount St. Mary's, set numerous goalkeeping records in two seasons and Shangraw earned several postseason accolades in one season at Saint Joseph's.
Saint Joseph's posted the finest season in the 29-year history of the program this fall, going 19-0-2 with a 9-0-1 GNAC record. For the second consecutive year, the Monks captured the conference championship and advanced to the NCAA tournament.
St. Joe's clinched the first national tourney win in team history with a 2-1 triumph over Mitchell College and held defending national champion Tufts University scoreless before falling to the Jumbos in penalty kicks in the second round.

Texto completo: The true holiday spirit is about giving — and giving back. These hotels and restaurants in New England pay it forward with charitable events and holiday-themed programs. Here are eight festive, feel-good stays and events.
Edgartown's Harbor View Hotel invites visitors to view its Teddy Bear Suite — more than 120 stuffed toys are posed in settings like eating a holiday dinner and washing up before bedtime. The suite is open Dec. 8-10 and Dec. 15-17, and is sponsored by the island's Point B Realty; money raised supports the local Boys & Girls Club's after-school programs. There's no charge, but donations are suggested. www.harbor-view.com/discover/teddybearsuite2017special
The Lenox Hotel in Boston is hosting its second annual Room in Your Heart event through Dec. 20. A designated room is used for gift donations to Wonderfund, a private nonprofit that supports children receiving services from the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families. Hotel guests and Bostonians can drop off new and unwrapped gifts — the hope is that the room will overflow with gifts. www.lenox hotel.com
The Common Man Inns in Plymouth, N.H., and Claremont, N.H., host a Festival of Trees, decking the inns' halls with Christmas trees. Each tree is decorated by local nonprofits, and guests are issued a ballot to vote on their favorite tree. Prizes, including gift cards and a cocktail party for 50, are awarded to the top three winning charities. www.thecmaninn.com
For every December reservation made, The Inn by the Sea in Cape Elizabeth, Maine, will purchase a book for local schools, based on librarians' wish lists, as part of the inn's Books for a Booking campaign. And, through the inn's Giving Tree program, the students who receive the books will create handmade ornaments for the tree; guests and locals can trade the ornaments for a donation of warm outerwear. The clothing is delivered to food banks and shelters by Project Grace. www.innbythesea.com
Anna's Taqueria Harvard Street location (446 Harvard St. in Brookline) is hosting a holiday event on Dec. 12 from 6-8 p.m. to benefit Christmas in the City, a nonprofit that helps local families who have experienced homelessness and poverty. Santa Claus will roll burritos, and guests can purchase one of Santa's burritos, plus chips and salsa, for $10, with all proceeds going to the nonprofit. There are eight taqueria locations. www.annas taqueria.com
Gregg's Restaurants & Taverns , with four locations in Rhode Island, work with local nonprofits by collecting more than 4,500 names on a Giving Tree list. Employees and volunteers create the tags with the name of the person and wish list, and the tags are hung on Christmas trees. Customers grab a tag off the tree, purchase a gift and return it to the restaurants, and as the tags are removed, new ones are added. Gifts can be dropped off until Dec. 13, and donors get a coupon for a slice of Gregg's chocolate cake. www.greggsusa.com
Order a Kind Soul cocktail (white rum, house-made simple syrup made with rosemary, cranberries and limes) at the Boston Park Plaza's Off the Common restaurant and 50 percent of sales are donated. Also, guests who make a suggested $10 donation at check-in receive a $10 gift card to MJ O'Connor's Pub. The campaign runs through Jan. 5. www.bostonpark plaza.com/dining/off-the-common
This is the fifth year that the York Harbor Inn in York, Maine, celebrates The Giving Tree in a partnership with local schools. York School guidance counselors reach out to students and families and procure wish lists, and the inn sells gift tag ornaments for its Christmas tree in the pub — donations of $5 per ornament are suggested, and wish-list gifts are also donated. School counselors pick up the gifts, and the money is used to buy warm clothing. www.yorkharborinn.com

Baker to speak at police opioid recovery summit Governor Charlie Baker is due to give opening remarks at the first National Law Enforcement Summit organized by the Police Assisted Addiction and Recovery Initiative, according to a statement from the Gloucester organization, also known as PAARI. More than 200 law enforcement leaders from 27 states and the District of Columbia are scheduled to attend the two-day meeting that starts Tuesday at Boston University School of Medicine, the statement said. Participants will discuss strategies and approaches by public safety agencies across the country to respond to the nation's opioid crisis. Local agencies scheduled to participate include sheriff's departments in Essex and Plymouth counties, and advocates from the recovery communities in Burlington, Gloucester, and Lynn, the statement said.

Rowley paramedic sentenced for drug theft Joseph V. Amello, 50, a paramedic from Rowley, was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in federal prison for stealing fentanyl from ambulances, the US Attorney's office said Thursday. He was also sentenced to three years of supervised release, prosecutors said in a press release. Amello stole 650 vials of fentanyl, a potent opioid, for his own use, while working for an ambulance company from November 2014 to August 2015, the release stated. He pleaded guilty in June to one count of acquiring a controlled substance by deception, fraud and forgery, and one count of tampering with a consumer product.
Providence
State eyes Amtrak service at T.F. Green Rhode Island transportation officials and Amtrak have been discussing ways to add service to T.F. Green Airport, they said on Thursday. The state transportation director, Peter Alviti, told WPRO-AM that his agency did a study with Amtrak about adding airport service and he believes it's doable in the next few years, but it could cost more than $100 million. Currently, only the commuter rail to Boston stops at the airport. Amtrak has just three stops in Rhode Island, in Providence, South Kingstown, and Westerly. Amtrak said in a statement later Thursday that it's too early to make any commitments regarding future service but confirmed the study had been conducted. (AP)
Augusta, Maine
LePage seeks disaster declaration for Halloween storm Maine Governor Paul LePage has asked President Trump for a disaster declaration to help recover from a powerful wind storm that knocked out power for more than half of the state's homes and businesses. The storm on the day before Halloween toppled drought-weakened trees, left roads impassable, and knocked down more than 1,400 utility poles. The governor said the state documented $4.7 million in damage to public infrastructure, far surpassing the threshold for a declaration. (AP)
Montpelier
'Merci' for the misspelled soccer jerseys Vermont's capital city has said “merci" via Skype to a French city it's named after for some misspelled soccer jerseys that were sent its way. Montpelier, Vt., says Montpellier, France, ordered jerseys for its professional soccer team and fans, but they came in misspelled, with just one L instead of two. The city in southern France decided to send them to Montpelier, Vt., which is spelled with one L, not two. Montpelier Mayor John Hollar thanked Montpellier Mayor Philippe Saurel by Skype on Thursday. Student soccer players at Montpelier High School wore the donated jerseys for the event. (AP)

Texto completo: U.S. stocks gained, led by energy producers, as OPEC and Russia said they are ready to extend cuts to crude output.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed past 24,000, while the S&P 500 Index was poised for its longest monthly winning streak since 2007 as the Senate tax bill headed for a marathon debate.
The biggest technology stocks rebounded from their worst selloff in more than a year. The euro strengthened along with the British pound as Brexit negotiators moved closer to a divorce agreement. Treasury yields slipped, capping the least turbulent month for 10-year notes in almost four decades.
Progress over U.S. tax reform this week had prompted traders to rotate out of tech stocks, the year’s best performers, and switch to firms seen benefiting most from a potential reduction in the corporate tax rate such as banks. Technology companies are expected to see little boost, as the industry’s average effective tax rate of 18.5 percent is already lower than the new level of 20 percent proposed by Republicans.
An up-or-down vote in the Senate could happen before the end of this week. In a sign of the cloudy outlook for the bill, Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine said it “would be very difficult” to support the measure in its current form.
Data showed U.S. consumer spending settled back in October to a still-decent pace after the biggest increase since 2009, as a post-storm surge in auto sales cooled. Incomes remained robust and inflation showed progress toward the Federal Reserve’s goal.
The Stoxx Europe 600 was little changed. Earlier, Hong Kong and South Korean-listed shares tumbled, while Japanese stocks gained. South Korea’s won slid after its central bank said it would keep an accommodative policy stance after raising interest rates for the first time since 2011.
Here are some key events scheduled for the remainder of this week:
* OPEC meets in Vienna on Thursday.
* Japan’s CPI may show a sharp divergence between headline and core inflation, Bloomberg Intelligence said ahead of the releases on Friday.
* In China, the private Caixin manufacturing PMI is due on Friday.
These are the main moves in markets:
Stocks
* The S&P 500 Index rose 0.4 percent as of 9:55 a.m. in New York.
* The Stoxx Europe 600 Index was little changed.
* The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index dipped 0.4 percent.
* Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average jumped 0.6 percent to the highest in three weeks.
* The MSCI Emerging Market Index dipped 1.7 percent, the most since May.

Senate GOP Gets Signoff on Still Emerging Tax Overhaul

Texto completo: Senate Republican leaders continue to get support for their tax overhaul package, even though the details of what the chamber will vote on are still being worked out and despite the unlikelihood of significant changes before a potential conference with the House.
Three Republican senators continue to call for a higher corporate tax rate to offset greater benefits for individuals in the tax measure, but GOP leaders are casting doubts on whether any such changes would be made prior to a conference.
Still, despite the continued lobbying by some Republican members, the bill appears to be moving in a positive direction for the GOP.
Sen. John McCain came out in support of the measure Thursday, ending speculation that the Arizona Republican might once again buck party leadership as he did with the recent health care effort.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell predicted at a press conference earlier in the day that the chamber would have a final vote on the bill either Thursday evening or Friday morning. But there is still a ways to go, and members continue to advocate for inclusion of their own amendments.

Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Marco Rubio of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah are all pushing amendments to raise the corporate tax rate above the proposed 20 percent. The increase could help pay for an enhanced child tax credit or the inclusion of a provision to allow individuals to deduct up to $10,000 in property taxes.
But those changes appear unlikely, as GOP leaders say any increase in the corporate rate is better addressed in an expected policy conference with the House.
“There are some concerns about raising the corporate tax rate right out of the box,” Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas said. “The most appropriate place to deal with that is in a conference, where there is a little bit of certainty about where we need to move things around.”

Those thoughts were echoed by Senate Republican Conference Vice-Chairman Roy Blunt.
“If it’s raised, my guess would be it’s raised to accommodate the conference differences between the House and Senate,” the Missouri Republican said.
Whether those three members would choose to oppose the bill without their suggested changes is an open question. Collins told reporters at the Christian Science Monitor breakfast on Thursday she needs to see a final package before deciding, citing the uncertainty of the process for the fast-track budget procedure known as reconciliation.
“Who knows what’s going to happen on the Senate floor during the vote-a-rama,” Collins said. “I need to wait to see what happens.”
Republicans can afford to lose the support of only two members, assuming that Vice President Mike Pence casts the tie-breaking vote. But with McCain on board, they are breathing a little easier.

Texto completo: A violation of Senate budget rules sent Republicans searching for new solutions in their tax overhaul effort, Thursday night.
Sen. David Perdue said the GOP tax plan will not include any revenue “trigger” mechanism because it was found to violate Senate budget rules, but senators are instead discussing putting an automatic, future tax increase into the bill instead.
The Georgia Republican said the trigger mechanism, an idea pushed by Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., would have resulted in a “Byrd rule violation,” according to the Senate parliamentarian. The so-called Byrd rule is a part of the budget reconciliation process Republicans are using to pass a tax code overhaul.
The decision sent Senate Republicans scrambling to find a way to address concerns from several of their members over the bill’s possible impact on the federal deficit.
“They’re going to solve the problem another way,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said. “I feel confident that if there’s a shortfall in the projections that there’ll be a mechanism in the bill to deal with the deficit.”
Graham said Corker, R-Tenn., has a new proposal that “everybody seems to like.”
Sen. John Cornyn said the size of the future revenue increase Corker is seeking has grown from $350 billion, the previous number on the table. The Texas Republican said he thinks Corker has “latched on” to a new analysis this afternoon from the Joint Committee on Taxation that found the GOP tax plan would lose around $1 trillion in revenue over 10 years, even accounting for resulting economic growth.
Cornyn also said Corker and Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., another key member in the tax process so far, were negotiating a compromise.
“It’s no longer $350 billion but a higher number, and I think that’s what Sen. Toomey and Sen. Corker are trying to work out,” Cornyn said. “Sen. Corker’s been pretty clear he doesn’t want any deficit spending. And obviously, he’s latched onto the dynamic score from JCT, even though I believe it’s clearly wrong. But that’s just my opinion.”

Cornyn said he thought an automatic tax increase would work “something like six years out, it’d go up half a percent point. I’m not sure ... some sort of stair-step.”

Perdue outlined a similar mechanism.
“What’s being talked about right now is simply going on an automatic kick-in in some year in the future, with no trigger,” Perdue said. “It was basically, the parliamentarian saying this wasn’t going to work, so they worked on another way to go.”
Perdue said the automatic revenue increases would occur in a future year that hasn’t been decided yet. The amount of revenue, and where it would come from, are also still under discussion.
“It’s not a threshold anymore, it’s just a tax increase,” he said. “There’s no agreement on the time or the money. The only thing that’s come off the table is the trigger concept.”
The guidance by the parliamentarian added to the woes Republicans face as they try to get their first major legislative victory during President Donald Trump’s first year in office.
A macroeconomic report released Thursday by the Joint Committee on Taxation also had the GOP on defense.
The Senate tax overhaul bill, as reported out of the Senate Finance Committee, would grow GDP by about 0.8 percent per year on average over the 10-year budget window, according to JCT. Republicans have been hoping for growth around 0.4 percent or more per year.
That growth would result in $458 billion in increased revenues over 10 years, JCT said. Even factoring that economic growth, the bill would still cost $1.007 trillion over the 10-year period.
Republicans immediately attacked the study, which undercut their argument that the proposed tax cuts would pay for themselves.
“I think it’s pretty clear they’re wrong,” Cornyn said, adding that “it’s their opinion.”
A spokeswoman for the Senate Finance Committee argued the analysis did not take into effect any of the changes that were made — and could still be made — to the legislation.
“Given that leading economists have projected the Senate tax bill will deliver significantly higher amounts of economic growth and federal revenue than the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) reports, the findings of JCT are curious and deserve further scrutiny,” the spokeswoman said.
Republican leadership is also facing demands from other members whose support they need to advance the tax measure. The GOP can only afford to lose the support of two members, assuming Vice President Mike Pence would cast the deciding vote.
Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, among other things, is pushing for a deal to address health-related measures in a future vehicle, something viewed as necessary in order to win her support.
“We’re looking at the continuing resolution,” she told reporters. “I talked with the president’s people again just yesterday to make sure they were on board, and they are. I talked to General Kelly. I have witnesses with Lamar Alexander and Lindsey Graham being on the phone.”
Collins has called for passage of legislation from Alexander, who chair’s the Senate health panel, and Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the committee’s top Democrat, that aims to stabilize the insurance markets created by the 2010 health care law.
The Congressional Budget Office said earlier this week the Alexander-Murray measure combined with a repeal of the law’s individual mandate — which is currently included in the tax bill — would do little to impact the estimated coverage losses that could occur if the requirement to purchase insurance is removed.
Separately, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., is also calling for changes to provisions in the current bill that impact pass-through businesses.

Sen. Susan Collins said the question of expelling Roy Moore from the Senate is a complicated one.
The Republican from Maine noted she supported Sen. Luther Strange in the Alabama primary.
“I think that’s a really difficult question, and I don’t know the answer to that yet,” Collins said of whether Moore should face removal for pre-Senate conduct, if elected.
“We have to seat him,” she said, holding to the Constitutional and Supreme Court precedents on the qualifications for Senate election.
As for removing Moore, “I would obviously wait to see what the Ethics Committee recommends.”
Speaking at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast, Collins said the Ethics Committee would commence a review of Moore’s actions if he wins.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Lawmakers ripped into Department of Veterans Affairs officials Wednesday for failing for years to ensure potentially dangerous VA medical workers are reported to authorities who could stop them from endangering patients elsewhere.
House VA Committee Chairman Rep. Phil Roe, R-Tenn., called it "astonishing," Rep. Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, said it was "shameful," and Rep. Bruce Poliquin, R-Maine, accused them of engaging in a deliberate cover-up to conceal bad medical care provided to veterans.
"I think you're protecting your butts; that's what I think's happening," Poliquin said while grilling VA officials at a VA oversight committee hearing. "This mismanagement is breathtaking."
The proceeding followed the release this week of the results of a review by the Government Accountability Office that confirmed findings of a USA TODAY investigation published in October. That investigation found the VA for years has concealed mistakes and misconduct by medical workers entrusted with the care of veterans.
The GAO concluded the VA didn't report 90% of problem providers to a national database designed to stop them from crossing state lines to escape their pasts and practice elsewhere. And the VA didn't report any of them to state licensing authorities responsible for issuing, suspending or yanking medical licenses when warranted.
Poliquin recounted one of the cases profiled by USA TODAY, that of podiatrist Thomas Franchini, whom the VA found had harmed 88 veterans but didn't report him to state licensing boards or tell the veterans for years.
They included Iraq veteran Kenneth "Jake" Myrick, who endured years of debilitating pain after Franchini surgeries, and April Wood, who after two surgeries by the Maine VA podiatrist, chose to have her leg amputated rather then endure the ongoing pain.
"What do you tell April Wood who has one leg now?" Poliquin said. "You can't return that."
Gerard, Cox, a VA acting deputy under secretary for health, said he was "greatly troubled by the stories" and blamed VA officials in Maine for the delays in reporting Franchini and notifying his patients.
"The medical center didn't do the job they should have done," he said. "It took far too long ... and that's not acceptable.
He said the agency is taking "three major steps" to make improvements, including increasing oversight of hospitals responsible for reporting, ensuring those reports are made more quickly, and expanding the types of clinicians that are reported. "Were doing this because we feel it is the right thing to do for veterans," Cox said.
The VA made similar pledges in response to USA TODAY's findings, and repeated those intentions after the GAO report and said fixes would be implemented within a year.

Rep. Bruce Poliquin, R-Maine
WASHINGTON – Lawmakers ripped into Department of Veterans Affairs officials Wednesday for failing for years to ensure potentially dangerous VA medical workers are reported to authorities who could stop them from endangering patients elsewhere.
House VA Committee Chairman Rep. Phil Roe, R-Tenn., called it "astonishing," Rep. Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, said it was "shameful," and Rep. Bruce Poliquin, R-Maine, accused them of engaging in a deliberate cover-up to conceal bad medical care provided to veterans.
"I think you're protecting your butts; that's what I think's happening," Poliquin said while grilling VA officials at a VA oversight committee hearing. "This mismanagement is breathtaking."
The proceeding followed the release this week of the results of a review by the Government Accountability Office that confirmed findings of a USA TODAY investigation published in October. That investigation found the VA for years has concealed mistakes and misconduct by medical workers entrusted with the care of veterans.
The GAO concluded the VA didn't report 90% of problem providers to a national database designed to stop them from crossing state lines to escape their pasts and practice elsewhere. And the VA didn't report any of them to state licensing authorities responsible for issuing, suspending or yanking medical licenses when warranted.
Poliquin recounted one of the cases profiled by USA TODAY, that of podiatrist Thomas Franchini, whom the VA found had harmed 88 veterans but didn't report him to state licensing boards or tell the veterans for years.
They included Iraq veteran Kenneth "Jake" Myrick, who endured years of debilitating pain after Franchini surgeries, and April Wood, who after two surgeries by the Maine VA podiatrist, chose to have her leg amputated rather then endure the ongoing pain.
"What do you tell April Wood who has one leg now?" Poliquin said. "You can't return that."
Gerard, Cox, a VA acting deputy under secretary for health, said he was "greatly troubled by the stories" and blamed VA officials in Maine for the delays in reporting Franchini and notifying his patients.
"The medical center didn't do the job they should have done," he said. "It took far too long ... and that's not acceptable.
He said the agency is taking "three major steps" to make improvements, including increasing oversight of hospitals responsible for reporting, ensuring those reports are made more quickly, and expanding the types of clinicians that are reported. "Were doing this because we feel it is the right thing to do for veterans," Cox said.
The VA made similar pledges in response to USA TODAY's findings, and repeated those intentions after the GAO report and said fixes would be implemented within a year.
"I think you're protecting your butts; that's what I think's happening."

Texto completo: The Massachusetts Medical Society is poised to tackle one of the thorniest issues facing physicians: whether doctors should be allowed to prescribe lethal medications to terminally ill adults who want to choose when to die.
At a meeting Saturday, the society's governing board will vote on a resolution to end its longstanding opposition to physician-assisted suicide and instead take a neutral stance. Participants will also learn the results of a survey of Massachusetts physicians on the issue.
“I'm sure it will be lively and spirited discussion," said Dr. Henry Lawrence Dorkin, the society's president.
Supporters of ending the medical society's opposition say the move could clear the way for state legislation that would allow physicians, in limited circumstances, to provide lethal medications to dying patients who request it. California and Colorado were able to pass similar bills only after medical societies in those states dropped their opposition, according to Sean Crowley, spokesman for Compassion and Choices, a Denver-based advocacy group for medical aid in dying.
Medical societies in Vermont, Maryland, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, and Washington, D.C. have also ended their opposition to physician-assisted suicide. But most other medical societies — along with the American Medical Association — continue to disapprove of it. In 2012, Massachusetts voters narrowly defeated a “death with dignity" ballot referendum.
Dorkin said society members are split on the issue. “There is a lot of passion here," he said.
In a sign of the controversy's intensity, the society faced a challenge in merely deciding how to label the resolution, he said.
Proponents reject the phrase “physician-assisted suicide" and prefer “medical aid in dying," saying that terminally ill people are not suicidal but rather seeking more control over their final days. But those who oppose such practices object to “medical aid in dying," saying that doctors aid dying people all the time, without helping them to kill themselves.
The medical society is calling the issue “physician-assisted suicide/medical aid in dying."
Dr. Roger Kligler, a Falmouth physician suffering from metastatic prostate cancer and a long-time advocate for physician aid in dying, plans to speak in favor of ending the opposition to physician-assisted suicide.
“You have people of good will on both sides of this," said Kligler, an internist who stopped working three years ago because of his illness. “The medical society has to realize they're never going to convince people who are for it or who are against it to really change their view."
The solution, he said, is “engaged neutrality" in which the medical society would not take a position on the issue, but would help train physicians in end-of-life care in accordance with the law.
“No one has to violate their ethical principles," he said. Instead, a doctor unwilling to prescribe lethal medications could refer patients to someone else.
Kligler, who is 65 and has had cancer for 15 years, has filed suit seeking to allow his doctor to prescribe lethal medication that he could take when he wanted to.
In the past year his cancer improved with treatment, but now seems to be worsening, he said Thursday. He does not know how long he has to live. The cancer and its treatments have caused a decline in mental function, weakness, and sleep problems, among other symptoms, Kligler said, but he still enjoys walking with his dog, up to nine miles a day.
“I'm most concerned about having uncontrolled symptoms and not being able to enjoy the richness of life," he said. He knows that, as a physician, he could find a way to end his life — but said he is fighting for others to have that same opportunity. Two of his friends, he said, recently endured “very bad deaths" despite being in hospice care.
On the other side of the debate, Dr. Barbara Rockett, a surgeon at Newton-Wellesley Hospital, plans to argue in favor of maintaining the society's opposition to physician-assisted suicide. Reversing that stance would not be a “neutral" move, she said. It's considered a crime to help someone commit suicide, and remaining neutral on a crime condones it, she said.
The doctor's role is to find a solution to a patient's pain, not to look for a way out, Rockett said. “The doctor is not to be the executioner," she said.
Doctors can refer patients to palliative care or hospice, she said. If a person doesn't want to go on living, she said, “There are so many ways to commit suicide, we don't need a physician to assist in this."
But she added that many patients are depressed and stop making suicide requests once their depression is treated.
A state legislative committee is weighing a bill, modeled after laws in Washington, Oregon, and four other states, that would allow physicians to help terminally ill patients die. It includes several provisions intended to ensure that the patient is of sound mind, within six months of dying, and acting willingly.
The Massachusetts Medical Society represents 25,000 physicians and medical students. Its House of Delegates, meeting Friday and Saturday in Waltham, has nearly 500 members.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans on Thursday pushed ahead on a sweeping revamp of the nation's tax code, with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell expressing confidence of final passage by week's end and a key Republican getting on board.
The GOP had the momentum for delivering a major legislative and political win for President Donald Trump after the bill cleared a procedural hurdle on a 52-48 vote late Wednesday.
"We're heading down the homestretch," McConnell, R-Ky., told reporters on Thursday. McConnell said he expected a vote either late Thursday or early Friday.
Republican Sen. John McCain, who derailed the GOP effort to dismantle the Obama health care law last summer, said Thursday he would back the tax bill, a major boost for the legislation.
"It's clear this bill's net effect on our economy would be positive," McCain said in a statement. "This is not a perfect bill, but it is one that would deliver much-needed reform to our tax code, grow the economy, and help Americans keep more of their hard-earned money."
Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said he believed that all the major issues were resolved, and that leaders were just working out the details.
Under Senate rules, senators can offer unlimited amendments, setting up the possibility of dozens of votes that could stretch all night into Friday morning.
The overall package is a blend of generous tax cuts for businesses and more modest tax cuts for families and individuals. It would mark the first time in 31 years that Congress has overhauled the tax code.
The package would lower the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, and it would allow businesses owners to deduct up to 20 percent of their business income.
The plan would nearly double the standard deduction to around $12,000 for individuals and about $24,000 for married couples. The tax cuts for individuals would expire in 2026 while the corporate tax cuts would be permanent.
At least one Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine, said she still wasn't on board.
"I have a lot of concerns that I'm trying to fix," Collins told reporters Thursday at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast.
Collins opposes the bill's total elimination of the federal deduction for state and local taxes, and said it would be "very problematic for me" to vote for the bill.
The moderate Republican wants an exception to let homeowners deduct up to $10,000 in property taxes, similar to a provision in the House version of the tax bill. She would make up the estimated $146 billion in lost revenue by keeping the personal income tax rate for the wealthiest earners at 39.6 percent and making a smaller cut in the corporate tax rate.
Trump and other Republicans insist that the corporate tax rate must be reduced to 20 percent.

Susan Collins sees Trump ‘outreach’ as giving boost to Senate tax bill

Resumen: The Senator from Maine says the White House has engaged with her on tax reform, and her meetings with President Trump may result in changes that bring her closer to being a "yes" on the tax bill.

Texto completo: Tax reform is not health-care reform – not in substance, not in politics, and not in the White House wooing of Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, one of three swing votes that blocked her party’s plan to repeal and replace Obamacare in July.
Unlike last summer, Senator Collins has met three times with President Trump to talk taxes, and has gotten personal commitments from him on key measures in an effort to get her to “yes.” 
“There has been so much more outreach,” Collins said Thursday at a breakfast for reporters hosted by The Christian Science Monitor, as the Senate debated what could become the biggest tax-code overhaul since 1986. “It’s just night and day compared to the health bill.” 
Not only has the president paid her more mind, but so have White House officials and Senate leaders in her party. That shows her clout as a moderate Republican in a narrowly divided chamber, on an issue that instead of taking away a benefit attempts to revamp a tax code Americans dislike. Republicans consider the tax overhaul a must in a year of few legislative achievements for them.
Just before Thanksgiving, she and two other Republican senators went to the White House. Collins says she showed the president a chart to make her case that if Congress went ahead with his wishes and dropped Obamacare's individual insurance mandate as part of the GOP tax plan, then rising health-plan premiums would cancel out the tax cuts for some middle-income taxpayers. 
“He was obviously concerned about that,” she said of Mr. Trump. She met with him again privately on Tuesday in advance of the weekly party luncheon at the Capitol, where he backed two of her big asks: support for a bipartisan bill to help offset insurance premium increases and another one to give states funds to set up “high-risk” insurance pools, also meant to keep a lid on premiums. 
The president was also supportive of her aim to match the House bill by allowing a deduction of up to $10,000 on property taxes – a concern in high-tax states.
But, like some other GOP senators, she’s not a firm "yes" yet. She has other items on her wish list, including making a tax credit for child and adult dependent care refundable and keeping the top tax rate at 39.6 percent for millionaire filers. Collins sees no problem with a corporate tax rate of 21 percent, instead of the 20 percent in the House bill, as an offset – and indeed, other Republican senators also see a slightly higher corporate rate as a way to be more generous toward middle- and low-income earners.
The senator said she has pressed CEOs of large corporations with plants in Maine, and with one exception all said they would be “delighted” with a 22 percent rate. 
Still, she held firm to her red lines as the Senate seeks to finalize its bill, with a vote expected by the end of the week. Both the property-tax deduction and health-care legislation are “extremely” important, she said. “It would be very difficult for me to support the bill if I do not prevail on these two issues.” 
In response to other questions at the breakfast, she said that her recent conversations with the president have given her “no reason to be concerned” about his mental health, though she says it’s not helpful when he raises “conspiracy theories” or puts out tweets of anti-Muslim videos “that are not accurate.”  
She also said that Congress needs to resolve the “Dreamers” issue before the end of the year, so that young people who came to the US as children of unauthorized immigrants can stop living in fear. “It is imperative that we act,” she said, though she is not willing to block a government spending bill to force the issue, as some Democrats want.

House GOP to Propose Short-Term Spending Bill; Government would be funded through Dec. 22, while congressional leaders work on a two-year budget deal

Texto completo: WASHINGTON--House Republican leaders on Friday will propose a short-term bill to keep the government funded through Dec. 22, GOP aides and lawmakers said Thursday.
The government's current funding expires at 12:01 a.m. on Dec. 9, giving lawmakers about a week to avoid a shutdown. Congressional leaders are working on a two-year budget deal that would enable them to write a detailed spending bill for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. In the meantime, lawmakers would have to pass a short-term bill to avoid a partial government shutdown next weekend.
House GOP leaders had earlier this week considered passing a short-term spending bill to keep the government funded at current levels into January, but they ran into resistance from the Defense Department. Military officials want to see a long-term bill with higher military spending passed as soon as possible.
Since the short-term bill through Dec. 22 will be a must-pass piece of legislation, lawmakers are certain to try to cram other measures onto it.
Most prominently, Sen. Susan Collins (R., Maine) said this week that her support for the Senate GOP tax-overhaul bill --which repeals the Affordable Care Act requirement that most people have health insurance or pay a penalty--will depend on whether Congress also passes a bipartisan health-care bill aimed at offsetting any resulting increases in premiums. Ms. Collins said that bipartisan bill, from Sens. Lamar Alexander (R., Tenn.) and Patty Murray (D., Wash.), would likely be folded into the short-term spending bill.
But conservatives aren't happy about the Alexander-Murray bill, which would extend for two years payments to insurers to offset the cost of subsidies for low-income consumers. President Donald Trump ended those payments in October and has said at times since then that he opposed the Alexander-Murray bill. He told GOP senators this week that he would support it.
"That probably would run into some issues over here," said Rep. Mark Walker (R., N.C.), chairman of the Republican Study Committee, a group of about 150 House members.
Rep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio) said the idea of passing a provision he called a bailout for insurance companies, without having repealed the ACA, passed a tax package or made significant progress on the construction of a border wall, wouldn't go down well with members like him.
"I just don't think that flies," he said. "That just doesn't make sense to me."
GOP leaders in both chambers typically end up passing spending bills with a big chunk of Democratic votes, since many Republicans balk at funding levels they say are too high. But in this case, it isn't clear whether Democrats would supply the votes.
Senate Democratic leaders have said that they don't want the Alexander-Murray bill to be used to help mitigate some of the effects of repealing a core piece of President Barack Obama's 2010 health law.
"Murray-Alexander was never designed to be in a situation where there was a direct bomb thrown into the ACA," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) told reporters earlier this week.
In the House, Democrats might balk at passing a spending bill that doesn't include protections for immigrants brought to the U.S. at a young age by their parents, a group known as Dreamers. Mr. Trump ended those protections in September , but gave Congress until March to pass legislation preventing them from being deported.
The short-term spending bill might include other popular provisions, including a reauthorization of the children's health-insurance program , which would be hard for Democrats to oppose. Lawmakers have often been willing to pass short-term bills just to avoid a government shutdown.
House Democrats were discussing on the House floor on Thursday what their strategy would be on the short-term spending bill.

Texto completo: By
Wednesday's editorial criticizing GOP tax proposals misstated the provision regarding a deduction for local property taxes.
The editorial should have said that the House bill would get rid of the state and local tax deduction, but would allow homeowners a deduction for property tax bills up to $10,000. This week, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said leaders agreed to add a similar provision for property taxes to the Senate bill.
A deduction for local property taxes would be welcome for sure, but how many West Virginians are likely to benefit from it? A taxpayer must be wealthy enough to itemize to claim any additional deductions on their federal tax returns. Most West Virginians do not fall into that category. Thanks to West Virginia's lower cost of living and relatively low property taxes, the benefit here may not be that great. This provision would probably not help West Virginians as much as the rest of the provisions would hurt.

Texto completo: November is Native American Heritage Month, a time to celebrate the accomplishments of indigenous peoples in North Dakota and across the country. While there are numerous accomplishments to highlight, I want to focus on one that addresses a problem that significantly impacts many people across our state, including non-Natives: lack of access to dental care.
Across our state, seniors, children, rural residents, American Indians and those who work in jobs that don't provide dental coverage are particularly impacted by this lack of access. Nearly half of North Dakota counties have zero dentists or just one. Even in larger counties with more dentists, many parents of children insured by Medicaid are not able to find one who takes Medicaid. In fact, North Dakota is third worst in the nation at providing dental care to Medicaid-enrolled kids, with two-thirds not seeing a dentist in 2015.
It also can take up to six months to see a dentist for those living on reservations. And one in three seniors experience dental problems, the highest of any age group. It's clear that the residents of North Dakota have difficulty getting needed dental care, but there is a solution.
Dental therapists, similar to physician assistants, allow dentists to expand their care to more patients. While they had been successful around the world for decades, it was tribes in Alaska that brought these dental providers to our country in 2004. The Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium reports that dental therapists have expanded care to 40,000 Alaska Natives who previously were not able to get regular care.
The Alaska experience represents just the beginning for this proven and innovative solution. Since tribes there moved forward more than a decade ago, other states have followed their lead and adopted dental therapy to allow their dentists to extend their care to more people who need it. This includes Minnesota, where a law passed in 2009 and dental therapists have been practicing since 2011. Maine and Vermont have now followed suit, and tribes in Oregon and Washington have now hired dental therapists.
To provide more background, dental therapists are trained and skilled in routine care like filling cavities, placing temporary crowns and extracting some very loose and badly diseased baby teeth. This frees up the dentist to do more complex procedures and allows their entire team to treat more patients.
While dental therapists are working successfully in traditional dental offices, they also work outside the office just like some hygienists do here in North Dakota. This could allow dentists to extend their office hours or set up a satellite office in a rural county that doesn't have any dentists. It also could allow dentists or nonprofit programs to bring care to schools or places where people have difficulty moving, like nursing homes. In short, it allows for bringing care directly to the people who need it.
And it is working. A first-of-its-kind study from the University of Washington used 10 years of patient records to analyze how this has worked for tribes in Alaska. The study found that in just one decade, children and adults in communities with high access to a dental therapist experienced a significant increase in preventive dental care services and far fewer children needed traumatic tooth extractions.
Tribes and all the many others in North Dakota that suffer from lack of access to dental care deserve better. That is why the United Tribes of North Dakota, AARP, free market groups and many others representing the disabled, medical providers, rural residents and others all support allowing dental therapists to work in North Dakota. In honor of Native American Heritage Month, I hope we will all join together to support a proven, Native-pioneered solution that will improve lives across our state.
Dr. Donald Warne is chair of the North Dakota State University Department of Public Health.

Texto completo: “Most people think elevators just come with the building," says Gregg Laufersweiler, sales director at Stanley Elevator. But Laufersweiler, 59, knows there's a lot more to it. He can tell you exactly how many elevators there are in each of the buildings where the company has installed equipment: 110 at Boston College, 70 at Children's Hospital, and 15 at 100 High Street. Laufersweiler has experienced the ups and downs of the business — you knew that one was coming — as Stanley, once a small family business, grew into one of the largest elevator companies in New England.
Stanley Elevator does not manufacture elevators, but it represents ThyssenKrupp Elevator. The German company assembles the machines at plants in Tennessee and Mississippi, and ships them to Stanley, which has a 24,000-square-foot headquarters and warehouse building in Merrimack, N.H., and satellite offices in Portland, Maine, and Mansfield.
The installation of new elevators accounts for most of Stanley's business, with service contracts making up the rest. The Globe spoke with this longtime elevator salesman about the business.
“There are about 900,000 elevators in the United States. It's the safest form of transportation on the earth. You're more likely to be injured walking or riding in a car than in an elevator. Mile for mile, more people have been moved on elevators than any other vehicle, except maybe space travel. The first passenger elevator was designed in 1857 and demonstrated at the World's Fair in Paris in 1889. For many years, elevators had car switches and operators; it wasn't until [the] 1950s that automatic elevators became commonplace. The equipment today is similar to that used decades ago, but there are less electromechanical components and the control panel is computerized.
“Elevators are not a commodity or volume-based business like, say, cellphones, which are sold by the millions. Only thousands of elevators are sold every year. Elevators are preengineered, and architects design a building to fit them. Elevators are the reason that downtown office buildings can exist, keeping workforces concentrated instead of having sprawling corporate campuses.
“We maintain elevators dating back years, such as 10 High St., where the elevators were installed in 1923. It can be a tall order to get those parts, which are difficult to find.
“Destination elevators are the latest trend — they use the law of averages and Q theory to know what floor a person in the lobby might go to. The passenger goes to a lobby kiosk and is told what elevator to take; there's no push button in the elevator itself. In the future, we may be using linear drive elevators that use magnets for rails; almost a 'beam me up, Scotty' concept where passengers can travel both horizontally and vertically.
“One of the more unusual elevators that Stanley has installed is at Penobscot Observatory Bridge in Maine. It goes to an observation deck, and the height is equivalent to a 45-story building.
“Many people ask me, 'Are elevators safe?' Hollywood has created a phobia of being stuck in an elevator. But when I'm watching a movie where there's an elevator in free fall or some other sensational accident, I know that it's not possible the way it's portrayed. There are many redundant safety circuits to prevent the elevator from doing something that might hurt you. And this is not just an 'elevator pitch' on my part. I talk elevators every day of my life."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON--Sen. John McCain said he would support a $1.4 trillion tax cut that Republicans are advancing in the Senate, pushing the plan closer to passage though intense jockeying is still playing out among lawmakers as a critical vote on the Senate floor nears in the hours ahead.
The support of the Arizona Republican, who helped defeat GOP efforts to repeal major parts of the Affordable Care Act this year, gives Republicans momentum. Party leaders want to pass the bill this week. They still haven't locked down all the needed votes, but the list of those still undecided has shrunk to five: Sens. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.), Jeff Flake (R., Ariz.), Susan Collins (R., Maine), Steve Daines (R., Mont.) and Ron Johnson (R., Wis.).
"After careful thought and consideration, I have decided to support the Senate tax reform bill," Mr. McCain said in a statement. "I believe this legislation, though far from perfect, would enhance American competitiveness, boost the economy, and provide long-overdue tax relief for middle class families."
Republicans need 50 votes, with Vice President Mike Pence breaking a possible tie. The party controls 52 seats, compared with 48 for Democrats. No Democrat is expected to vote for the bill, meaning Republicans can afford to lose only two votes.
"We're going down the home stretch, headed toward the finish line either later tonight or early tomorrow," Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said Thursday. "Everyone is trying to get to yes. I'm optimistic."
They will soon turn to filing amendments on the Senate floor. Any senator can get a vote on any amendment. Republicans have filed amendments to expand charitable deductions, repeal the estate tax and change the tax rules for marijuana. They are constrained by their decision to limit the amount of tax cuts to $1.5 trillion over 10 years.
The core of the fast-moving GOP tax bill is a permanent corporate tax cut combined with tax reductions for individuals and pass-through businesses such as partnerships that expire after 2025. The bill would also repeal the mandate for individuals to have health insurance and allow drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Republicans say it will boost economic growth, though official estimates of the growth effects from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation haven't been released and the Treasury Department hasn't released a detailed analysis either.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average powered past 24000 for the first time Thursday. Shares of financial firms led the blue-chip index higher, as investors and analysts said they were closely following Republicans' progress on the tax overhaul plan. Banks are among the stocks that would benefit from the plan's proposed corporate tax cut since they tend to pay a relatively high tax rate, analysts said. Goldman Sachs led the Dow industrials higher, contributing about 56 points to the index's gain.
If the bill passes the Senate, Republicans must reach a House-Senate compromise, likely through a conference committee composed of lawmakers from both chambers. The House and Senate would each then have to vote again. An alternative would be for the House to vote up or down on the Senate bill, but House leaders have insisted that they won't do that.
Republicans are still trying to figure out how they could address Mr. Corker's concerns about budget deficits. They are attempting to design a "trigger" that would increase taxes automatically if the economy doesn't pick up and revenue undershoots expectations. Mr. Corker said Wednesday that lawmakers were having "difficulties" crafting a trigger; some Republicans are averse to any proposal that could reverse tax cuts down the road.
A focal point for Republicans on Thursday will be an amendment to make child tax credits more generous.
The current Senate bill doubles an existing tax credit to $2,000 per child, which helps offset the loss of other tax breaks. Sens. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) and Mike Lee (R., Utah) are proposing expanding the child tax credit to more low-income families. They want to pay for the measure with a 22% corporate tax rate, higher than the 20% rate pushed by President Donald Trump.
Messrs. Rubio and Lee say the party needs to focus more on families and mitigate the cost of raising children. The pro-business wing of the party says the 20% corporate tax rate is crucial to the bill. Groups such as Americans for Tax Reform, led by antitax activist Grover Norquist, were rallying conservatives against the amendment.
"I don't think it would pass," said Sen. Richard Burr (R., N.C.), saying he saw no reason to move from a 20% corporate-tax rate.
"I don't have a problem necessarily with 20%, but 22% would generate just as much growth," Mr. Rubio said.
Ms. Collins, a Republican who is a crucial swing senator, indicated Thursday morning that her support for the bill would depend on passage of an amendment she has offered to include a deduction for property taxes up to $10,000, as well as an agreement she struck with GOP leaders to separately pass two health-care bills designed to stabilize the individual insurance market.
Those bills are aimed at offsetting the impact of repealing the individual mandate in the Affordable Care Act, which says that most people must have health-care insurance or pay a penalty. Republicans added the mandate repeal to the tax bill because it reduces federal health-care spending and thus frees up money for deeper tax cuts.
"It would be very difficult for me to support the bill if I do not prevail on those two issues," Ms. Collins said Thursday morning at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. "The reason I'm more optimistic is the extensive discussion I've had with Senate leaders."
Ms. Collins also wants to lower a threshold for deducting the cost of medical expenses to 7.5% of income. The Affordable Care Act set a higher bar, limiting the medical-expense deduction to amounts that exceed 10% of income. The details of her amendment are still taking shape, but at a minimum the changes would apply to senior citizens starting next year.
Ms. Collins said she couldn't give a firm position on the tax bill until she sees the outcome of the long series of amendment votes that will lead up to the final passage vote.
"I need to wait to see what happens, but I am encouraged by the receptivity to the proposals I'm putting forth," she said.
Ms. Collins said she supported the amendment from Messrs. Rubio and Lee. With those three votes and support from Democrats, that proposal could pass. But Democrats have been circumspect about their votes on the amendment and whether they would do anything to improve a bill they intend to campaign against as fiscally irresponsible and hurtful to middle- and low-income households.
Ms. Collins said she planned to offer a slightly different amendment that would pay for expanding the tax credit for child and dependent care by changing the tax treatment for carried interest. Carried interest is the profit that some investment managers, such as at hedge funds, typically get. It is taxed at preferential long-term capital-gains rates, now 23.8%, compared with the current top ordinary income rate of 39.6%.
"I talked to the president about that and he had said he had no problem with closing the carried-interest loophole," Ms. Collins said.

Texto completo: Lisbon police are investigating an armed robbery Wednesday night during which a man allegedly showed a knife and demanded money from two employees of the Big Apple convenience store.
Just before 11 p.m., police were called to the store on Lisbon Road for a report that a white man entered the store. He allegedly brandished a knife and demanded money before leaving the store and fleeing on foot, according to a release from Lisbon police Chief Marc Hagan.
Citing an ongoing investigation, Hagan did not release the amount of money taken during the robbery.
Police arrived within minutes, Hagan said, and began a track with a police dog that ended a short distance away in the area of Davis Street, where the scent was lost.
The suspect is described as a white man, approximately 5 feet 8 inches tall, wearing a black hooded sweatshirt, black gloves, a black mask, black pants and dark shoes.
Police ask that anyone who may have seen someone matching this description or who may have seen a suspicious person or vehicle in the area call them at 353-2500.

Texto completo: AUGUSTA, Maine -- Republicans in the U.S. Senate pushed forward their tax proposal in a party-line procedural vote Wednesday with Sen. Susan Collins' support, but she's not saying how she'll vote ahead of a set of votes expected Thursday.
The moderate Maine Republican told reporters Wednesday she's going to float a series of amendments to the bill, but it's unclear how their fate will affect her final, key vote on the measure. Here's where she stands going into Thursday.
She brushed aside concerns about the package's changes to health care policy on Wednesday. The Senate Republican bill would repeal the "individual mandate" in the Affordable Care Act that makes Americans buy health insurance or face penalty. Collins has been wary of that, but President Donald Trump reportedly assured her he would back two bipartisan bills aimed at stabilizing the health care law if the tax plan passes.
However, the Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday that one of those bills -- which would resume cost-sharing reduction payments that Trump has stopped -- wouldn't offset the negative impacts of scrapping the mandate.
But Collins told reporters the CBO assumes that those payments will be made and they aren't now, so the finding "truly makes no sense whatsoever."
But she has also outlined a series of amendments that she wants in the final bill by tonight. On Wednesday, Collins took reporters through a list of amendments she's backing, according to a transcript provided by the senator's office.
It includes restoring the state and local tax deduction and protecting a medical expense deduction that is a priority of the AARP. But when asked if all those those needed to pass to get her vote, she demurred.
"We are doing this one step at a time," Collins said. "Some of these are higher priorities than others."

Texto completo: While political attention has been focused on a Republican tax cut plan that needlessly cuts taxes for the wealthy and big corporations that will balloon the deficit, the Trump administration continues its press to undo a major pollution reduction law.
The sole public hearing regarding the administration's plan to undo the Clean Power Plan was held this week in Charleston, West Virginia, the heart of coal country. The administration has convinced coal miners and coal companies that it will increase demand for the dirty fuel by easing environmental regulations, especially the Clean Power Plan, which called for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.
Here's the problem: Coal is not coming back, not matter what the Trump administration does. For one, coal-fired power plants are closing as energy producers switch to cheaper -- and cleaner -- natural gas. "At least six plants that relied on coal have closed or announced they will close since Trump's victory in November, including the main plant at the Navajo Generating Station in Arizona, the largest in the West. Another 40 are projected to close during the president's four-year term," The Washington Post reported in March.
The amount of coal used to generate electricity in the United States has dropped by more than half in the last decade. Easing environmental regulations is not going to change that reality.
Changes within the coal industry have led to reductions in employment that are not going to be reversed. Companies are switching from labor-intensive mining in Appalachia to mechanized strip mining in western states.
Given this reality, the two days of hearings in West Virginia were a sad display of playing on people's nostalgia and hopes to achieve a political "win." Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, made a career of fighting pollution reducing regulations from the Obama administration when he was the attorney general of Oklahoma. He also clearly favors business interests over the health and wellbeing of people. He found a welcome home in the Trump administration, which is intent on dismantling Obama administration rules and policies, even when they have improved the lives of Americans.
But, even in coal country, not everyone is on board with Pruitt's push to scrap environmental regulations. He announced the EPA's intention to rollback the Clean Power Plan in October, in Kentucky.
Stanley Sturgill is a former coal miner from Lynch, Kentucky, who suffers from black lung disease. He told the hearing committee he wanted the Clean Power Plan to remain in place, for the good of his children and grandchildren, The Weather Channel reported.
"Now to be realistic, do I really think that the administration cares what this old worn coal miner has to say?" Sturgill, 72, asked. "I don't know. I really doubt it. But I had to be here, and as long as I can draw a breath, I'm going to keep working to fight climate change and protect the land and country I love."
Sturgill is far from alone.
The EPA has received more than 77,000 online comments on the Clean Power Plan rollback. The vast majority of them favor keeping the rules, which were put on hold by a court order, in place. The comment period is open until Jan. 16.
When the pollution reduction rules were proposed by the Obama-era EPA in 2015, the agency held four public hearings -- in Atlanta, Denver, Pittsburgh and Washington, D.C. -- and heard from more than 1,600 speakers. Millions of written comments were filed in support of the plan.
Maine Attorney General Janet Mills has asked the EPA to hold a hearing in Maine. Attorneys general in Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon and Virginia have also asked for hearings in their states. The EPA has not responded to their requests.
Sadly, we don't expect to the EPA to listen to anyone other industry executives. Like Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke did with public comments about the administration's still vague plans to shrink national monuments, expect Pruitt to downplay opposition to undoing the Clean Power Plan as a concerted liberal effort, while touting industry input as genuine.
Worst of all, the EPA is making false promises to justify nullifying needed pollution reduction rules.

Texto completo: Maine's national monument will likely draw almost 15,000 visitors by the end of the year, more than four times the number of people who visited during its abbreviated first season.
Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument was visited by 7,162 vehicles for the year as of Saturday, the day its main Loop Road closed for the season.
Superintendent Tim Hudson said he conservatively assumes the vehicles, which registered on counters at three monument entrances, each carried two people, for a total of 14,324 visitors.
The monument drew 1,762 vehicles -- or 3,524 people, by Hudson's count -- last year, including 1,215 after then-President Barack Obama issued the executive order that designated the monument in August 2016.
Northern Maine's most controversial parcel since the designation, Katahdin Woods must draw swarms of tourists to live up to its billing and help the Katahdin region rebound from crushing paper mill closures.
Like virtually everything else about it, the monument's allure has been disputed. Critics claim that its 87,562 acres east of Baxter State Park are nondescript and will be ignored by tourists.
Proponents champion Burt's Bees entrepreneur Roxanne Quimby's gift to the nation as a showcase of Maine's forests that will need several years to become a significant tourist draw.
Reactions to the 2017's vehicle count were, predictably, mixed.
"It's exactly what we were all hoping for," Katahdin Area Chamber of Commerce President Jamie Brundrett, who owns Katahdin General Store, said. "We saw a pretty quick spike last year as soon as the designation happened. The forecast was good and that's what we were hoping for."
Monument foe and Maine Snowmobile Association Executive Director Bob Meyers called the turnout "pretty underwhelming."
"That's less people than came to our snowmobile show," Meyers added.
Andrew Bossie, executive director of Friends of Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument, said the monument has been "great for the economy and for the region."
"If we quadruple again, we will be at about 60,000 visitors next year," said Bossie, who started as the nonprofit group's director in September. "If you're in the region, you can see that some businesses have expanded and, at least on the ground, people are saying that the traffic is up."
Meyers compared Katahdin Woods' season to Maine's state parks, which according to counts provided by the Maine Bureau of Parks and Lands has averaged 63,148 visitors to each of its 41 properties so far this year.
Meyers predicted that the monument's absence from the federal budget under negotiation in Washington, D,C., will leave it without funding for additional staff and infrastructure development.
The Quimby family's foundation has funded improvements that include graded roads, new bridges, trails and other amenities. Volunteers have done much of the work, Hudson has said.
The 14,324 visitors is approximate to the population of the Katahdin region. The visitors came despite Gov. Paul LePage's decision to deny Katahdin Woods signage on state roads until President Donald Trump decides what to do with 27 monuments he ordered reviewed, including Maine's.
Trump has yet to act on recommendations made by Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke in late August. According to a leaked report, Zinke advised Trump to order Katahdin Woods opened to "active timber management," which typically refers to tree-cutting for commercial sale.

LBI Arts Foundation opens its Holiday Market

Texto completo: LOVELADIES – The LBI Foundation of the Arts and Sciences (LBIF) kicked off its annual month-long Holiday Market with a special event on Small Business Saturday (Nov. 25).
There was food, music, and fun mixed in with the exhibits of handmade crafts, art, and treasures by more than 15 local artists in a variety of mediums.
Inside there was a free hot cocoa bar and nearby the LBIF's resident potters hosted a bake sale with homemade cookies, brownies, and mini cupcakes. Side Door Donuts and Coffee in Beach Haven also donated dozens of their delicious circles.
One of the potters joked that dough or clay it all has to get baked.
Neptune Market in Harvey Cedars was serving its Turkey Vegetable Soup in ceramic bowls while the supply lasted and then in cardboard containers for a donation to the Foundation.
Across the hall, ReClam the Bay was ladling out clam chowder at its booth, along with pouring an Oyster Stout created by Pinelands Brewery in Little Harbor Township.
The dark, rich, malty brew actually has fresh local Graveling Point oysters in the recipe, according to its Website.
While there was no Pinelands representative present to share the recipe, according to Food Republic's website: " ... late in the 1800s, brewers discovered that oyster shells, rich in calcium carbonate, served as an effective clarifying agent for finished beer poured over heaps of the crushed, briny mash. Later still, some unknown brewer took things up another notch and added the shells to the boil, along with the barley and hops."
Later brewers began adding chopped oysters as well, according to the Food Republic.
For the more health conscious, PYour Pour Juice and Expresso Bar located in Surf City was serving up free samples of their "Berry Aide," an antioxidant smoothie, and a "Protein Tune Up" made with organic cocoa, fruit and Vegan proteins.
The Carolers from the Bellarine Theatre performed inside and out in the early afternoon, followed by Greg Warren playing outside by the fire pit.
Parents and kids sat around the pits, toasted marshmallows or made S'mores, including Audrey, 6, and Hazel, 4, Page down from Maine visiting their grandmother who lives in Barnegat Light.
When asked how she enjoyed the S'mores, Hazel had no comment other than a gooey, chocolaty smile.
High Point Volunteer Fire Company's Chief Engineer Rich Hathaway drove the company's original 1940 Ford Pumper over that the company had fully restored, including all the original equipment. Hathaway said one of the members had kept it when they sold the truck, which they later bought back.
The gleaming red engine was on display and many took advantage of getting a photo in front or sitting on the running board.
All of this served as the backdrop to the crafts and artwork throughout the LBIF's main hall.
Shoppers browsed through displays by Adraitic Jewelry, Jennifer Haley Handbags, Sue Pohanka Ceramics, Costal Cushions, and Artist/Illustrator Dawn Simon.
The walls held the creations of Tyler Stokes working with antique woods, Crow Nest and Chris Pfiel's photographs and the colorful creations of Glassy Lass Mosaics and Sara Fetzer's Feltworks among others.
All of the artists' works were selling briskly as shoppers lined up at the central register at the entrance to the building.
They had the option of keeping their purchase with them or were given a sticker to place on larger pieces to return for it later.
LBIF Gallery Director Bernadette Fitzgerald said the day was turning into a great success and by mid-afternoon she was already texting some of the artists to come and restock their displays.
The Holiday Market will run through Dec. 23 and be open daily. 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.
LBIF is located at 120 Long Beach Blvd, Loveladies, NJ 08008.
Call 609-494-1241 or visit them online at lbifoundation.org for more information.

Lawmakers rip VA for mismanagement

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Lawmakers ripped into Department of Veterans Affairs officials Wednesday for failing for years to ensure potentially dangerous VA medical workers are reported to authorities who could stop them from endangering patients elsewhere.
House VA Committee Chairman Rep. Phil Roe, R-Tenn., called it "astonishing," Rep. Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, said it was "shameful," and Rep. Bruce Poliquin, R-Maine, accused them of engaging in a deliberate cover-up to conceal bad medical care provided to veterans.
"I think you're protecting your butts; that's what I think's happening," Poliquin said while grilling VA officials at a VA oversight committee hearing. "This mismanagement is breathtaking."
The proceeding followed the release this week of the results of a review by the Government Accountability Office that confirmed findings of a USA TODAY investigation published in October. That investigation found the VA for years has concealed mistakes and misconduct by medical workers entrusted with the care of veterans.
The GAO concluded the VA didn't report 90% of problem providers to a national database designed to stop them from crossing state lines to escape their pasts and practice elsewhere. And the VA didn't report any of them to state licensing authorities responsible for issuing, suspending or yanking medical licenses when warranted.
Poliquin recounted one of the cases profiled by USA TODAY, that of podiatrist Thomas Franchini, whom the VA found had harmed 88 veterans but didn't report him to state licensing boards or tell the veterans for years.
They included Iraq veteran Kenneth "Jake" Myrick, who endured years of debilitating pain after Franchini surgeries, and April Wood, who after two surgeries by the Maine VA podiatrist, chose to have her leg amputated rather then endure the ongoing pain.
"What do you tell April Wood who has one leg now?" Poliquin said. "You can't return that."
Gerard, Cox, a VA acting deputy under secretary for health, said he was "greatly troubled by the stories" and blamed VA officials in Maine for the delays in reporting Franchini and notifying his patients.
"The medical center didn't do the job they should have done," he said. "It took far too long ... and that's not acceptable.
He said the agency is taking "three major steps" to make improvements, including increasing oversight of hospitals responsible for reporting, ensuring those reports are made more quickly, and expanding the types of clinicians that are reported. "Were doing this because we feel it is the right thing to do for veterans," Cox said.
The VA made similar pledges in response to USA TODAY's findings, and repeated those intentions after the GAO report and said fixes would be implemented within a year.

"American Made" -- Tom Cruise proves he still has star power in this fact-based thriller about a commercial airline pilot who's drafted into the CIA to do spy work and winds up involved in the Iran-Contra Affair, drug smuggling with Pablo Escobar and running guns for the U.S. government.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The Senate began debate on Republican legislation to slash corporate taxes and lower small business and individual rates Wednesday evening, with plans for a final vote by the end of this week, a big step toward achieving President Donald Trump's top priority.
The Senate began debate on the $1.4 trillion tax package after Senate Republican leaders succeeded in rounding up support among all of their wavering members for a 52-48 vote to move the bill ahead. The vote broke along party lines, with all Democrats opposed.
Trump tweeted before the vote: "This week, the Senate can join the House & take a strong stand for the Middle Class families who are the backbone of America. Together, we will give the American people a big, beautiful Christmas present-a massive tax cut that lets Americans keep more of their HARD-EARNED MONEY!"
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and his leadership team, offering fixes and home-state perks to the tax package, had leaned on about a half of dozen of their members who could have derailed the fast track-track consideration of the bill.
Changes suggested for the bill include triggers to raise taxes if the economy doesn't grow enough to cover deficits; an increase of the corporate tax rate to 22 percent from the current plan's 20 percent, to pay for refundable child tax credits or state and local tax deductions; and a lower tax on small business.
The potential Republican holdouts who in the end voted to move ahead with the debate included Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin; Steve Daines of Montana; Bob Corker of Tennessee; Jeff Flake and John McCain, both of Arizona; and Susan Collins of Maine, who helped block Obamacare repeal efforts earlier this year.
Democrats complained that they would be debating a legislative package filled with unknown new and omitted measures negotiated by McConnell and his team.
"I haven't actually seen the text of the bill we will actually be debating," said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, shortly before the vote. "The bill seems to have changed practically every half-hour."
After the procedural vote, Wyden's call for a vote to send the tax legislation to the Senate Finance Committee for three days of deliberations led to a two-hour debate and an expected defeat of the motion by the Republican majority.
If the Senate approves its tax bill on Thursday or Friday, the House either could approve that version or send the Senate bill and its own version, passed earlier this fall, to a conference of members from both chambers to reconcile the differences. That compromise legislation then would be voted on by the House and then the Senate.
House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) warned there might be a late Friday vote.
McConnell opened the Senate workday with a simple command to his caucus to vote to begin debate by saying, "It's time for us to deliver."
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) urged Republicans to vote against starting debate on a bill that their leaders are still reworking, and he invited them instead to work on a bipartisan bill that he said could win 60 to 70 votes, rather than a bare simple majority.
"We're are one day away, unfortunately, from a final vote on the bill to rewrite the entire U.S. tax code, and significant parts of the Republican bill are still up in the air," Schumer said. "By the time of the vote, no one will have a definitive analysis of how the bill would impact the economy."
Schumer and Democrats said studies by the Tax Policy Center and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimate the bill will raise taxes on 60 percent of the middle class and increase the deficit by $2.2 trillion over 10 years, not $1.4 trillion as the Republicans say.
McConnell and Republicans say the deep cuts in corporate tax rates on local and overseas profits, as well as lower rates for small businesses and individuals, will rev up the U.S. economic engine enough to cover the deficit and create bigger paychecks for all.

Monitor staff A quarterback taking his offensive line out to dinner is fairly common. It's smart to take care of the guys protecting you, and feeding the big fellas is a perfect way to show them some love.... [Derived Headline]

Resumen: Dean, Holt, Sosnak and the rest of the New Hampshire defense has been the driving force for the Wildcats this season, and they'll need to keep motoring in Arkansas, especially against the Bears power running attack. The defense led the way to the signature win of the regular season, a 16-6 decision against then-No. 7 Elon, and then blanked Central Connecticut State to open the playoffs. McDonnell saying “the guys that are playing now” is significant because the return of Jared Kuehl, the other linebacker in UNH's 4-2-5 scheme, has been one of the key's to UNH's second-half defensive success.

A quarterback taking his offensive line out to dinner is fairly common. It's smart to take care of the guys protecting you, and feeding the big fellas is a perfect way to show them some love.
Something similar is happening at the University of New Hampshire, except it's on the defensive side of the ball. UNH linebacker Quinlen Dean made a deal with tackles Rick Holt and Ryan Sosnak – if Dean reached 100 tackles, he would take those two big guys out to eat.
Holt (6-foot-4, 294 pounds) and Sosnak (6-2, 288) have done a great job of keeping the opposition's offensive line away from Dean, who has a team-leading 113 tackles and is more than happy to fulfill his promise.
“They want to go to Five Guys,” Dean said. “I thought they were going to hit me with like a steak place or something, but they said just get us burgers and fries. Those big guys, all right, we'll do that. That's great.”
The meal will come after the season, whenever that might be. The No. 21/20 Wildcats (8-4) are in the FCS playoffs for a 14th straight year, and they'll keep playing until they lose or win a national championship. UNH won its first-round game last week against Central Connecticut State, 14-0, and will now face No. 3/3 Central Arkansas (10-1) on Saturday in Conway, Ark.
Dean, Holt, Sosnak and the rest of the New Hampshire defense has been the driving force for the Wildcats this season, and they'll need to keep motoring in Arkansas, especially against the Bears power running attack.
“They're going to be challenged and right now that's probably the strength of our team – playing defense and stopping the run,” UNH Coach Sean McDonnell said. “If we can hang in there and do that, then we'll give ourselves a shot on Saturday.”
The Wildcat defenders were inconsistent to start the season. They were good enough to beat Maine in the opener, excelled in a 22-12 win against FBS Georgia Southern in Week 2 and then got torched in a 51-26 loss at Holy Cross the next week.
The up-and-down continued for the next three games, but then things started to fall into place. Over the last six contests, UNH is allowing just 12.5 points per game. The defense led the way to the signature win of the regular season, a 16-6 decision against then-No. 7 Elon, and then blanked Central Connecticut State to open the playoffs.
“The guys that are playing right now are feeling better about how they're playing, and I think we have a real good idea of how we want to fit the run, and I think our kids have a real good idea of fitting the run,” McDonnell said. “And then I think probably the most important thing of all this is we're tackling pretty well.”
McDonnell saying “the guys that are playing now” is significant because the return of Jared Kuehl, the other linebacker in UNH's 4-2-5 scheme, has been one of the key's to UNH's second-half defensive success. Kuehl (team-high 12 tackles for a loss and two fumble recoveries) missed four games with injury and when he came back is exactly when the Wildcats began to surge. But neither he nor Dean would be effective if it wasn't for the big guys in front of them.
“They're living off our defensive front filing their gaps and taking care of 'em, and both those kids are playing very effective football for us,” McDonnell said. “They run to the football, they tackle very well and our scheme helps them. It's designed to get our linebackers free to make plays.”
None of this will come as a surprise to Central Arkansas.
“They've got two outstanding defensive tackles and the defensive ends are great pass rushers and relentless,” UCA Coach Sam Campbell said. “The two inside backers (Kuehl and Dean), (Dean) is really, really good and (Kuehl) is a ball hawk … a lot of great athletes on defense and extremely well-coached.”
The Bears will first attack with a pair of running backs – speedster Kierre Crossley (146 carries, 770 yards) and power back Carlos Blackman (162 carries, 702 yards). If the 'Cats can contain them, UCA will turn to quarterback Hayden Hildebrand, who leads the FCS in passing efficiency (181.27) and is No. 2 in yards per pass attempt (10.29). Stopping the run may be UNH's strong suit, but the Wildcats are confident they can also defend the pass.
“We feel like if we stop the run then they'll have to come out and pass, and we believe that our secondary is very prepared for this game and I think we can win that way,” Dean said.
Just like Dean believes in the secondary, the UNH offense believes in the defense.
“I think we all are very confident in our defense and what they can do,” New Hampshire offensive lineman Matt Mascia said. “So if we give them a couple breaths, if we give them some time when they can come back on that field being re-juiced, that's going to be a big part of this game.”

Cut-your-own season begins at maine tree farms

Texto completo: FAYETTE -- When Leigh Stevens headed to Moose Hill Farm this week, he knew just what he was looking for - a short, fat balsam fir Christmas tree to sit in the bay window in the living room of his Livermore Falls home.
As the only one trekking up the hill and carrying a saw on Tuesday, he had his pick of trees. Less than 15 minutes later, Stevens was dragging his choice back down the hill on a tarp to get it wrapped in netting and to pay for it.
Stevens is one of hundreds of Maine residents who will choose and cut their own Christmas tree this year from one of dozens of operations across the state. From Westmanland to Wells and from Hiram to Calais, cut-your-own tree operations are now open for business.
"Our open house is (this) weekend, and it'll be busy," Art Young said. "From then, the next couple of weekends will be busy, and that will be it."
Young runs the Christmas tree operation at Moose Hill Farm with his wife Marilyn, his brother Joe and sister-in-law Ann, and his sister Jane Keene, although the work of growing and maintaining trees continues throughout the year.
He started the Christmas tree business about three decades go, after inheriting land from his parents. He started planting trees in 1987, and they were ready to be cut in 1994.
So for 30 years, the cycle has been the same. Planting across his 10 acres starts in mid-April along with a round of weed control. While there's not much demand for pines, Young grows some and they need to be trimmed in June before they harden off. Trimming the balsam fir starts in August, and that takes about three weeks. Summer also brings mowing and a second round of weed control.
About two weeks before Thanksgiving, he starts to clip greens for the 130 or so wreaths he makes for the Moose Hill Farm shop.
"I like to wait for a hard frost, because it sets the needles and they don't fall off so quickly," he said. "If you cut the brush while it's still warm out, they fall apart pretty quick."
The tree-care routine is familiar to Dave Higgins, who started planting Christmas trees a decade ago at Higgins Christmas Tree Farm, and started selling them four years ago on Albion Road in Winslow.
"It's something I have always wanted to do," Higgins said. "I started it so I will have something to do when I retire in three or four years. It's taken off far better than what I had expected."
This year, business started slowly for Higgins. He opened the day after Thanksgiving, which was a slow day for tree sales. Shoppers were more interested in buying gifts on that day than having the tree to put them under, but Higgins anticipates business will pick up this weekend.
People find cut-your-own farms in a variety of ways.
The Maine Christmas Tree Association maintains a listing of its choose-and-cut members as a part of its mission to promote real Christmas trees, but association Executive Secretary Joanne Bond said that not all Christmas tree producers in the state belong to the group.
Bond Mountain Acres - the operation Bond runs with her husband in West Newfield - and Moose Hill Farm are listed, but Higgins Christmas Tree Farm is not.
They all rely on a variety of methods to get the word out, including websites, social media and tried and true roadside signs.
Young said Moose Hill Farm has drawn customers off the interstate who have searched the internet for trees they can cut and have found him. This year, that included the people from Florida who wanted a fresh-cut tree to take back home with them.
Generally, people who find a Christmas tree farm they like come back year after year.
Stevens, who drove over to Fayette to pick his tree, has come back to Moose Hill every year for the last six or eight years. He was planning to put up the tree when he got home and to decorate it that evening with his wife, so it would be all ready for the gifts she had been buying online until the early hours of Tuesday.
"They have a wonderful selection of trees," Stevens said. "There's really no better place for us, as far as we're concerned."
Stevens was fortunate because Moose Hill Farm is open during the week, while many operations, like Higgins', is open only on the weekends.
From the accounts she's heard, Bond said this will be a good year for fresh tree sales.
Higgins, who has only about 2,500 trees planted, will cut only those that are ready to cut, he said. Last year, he was sold out of trees by Dec. 6.
Young, who has about 10,000 trees planted, will stay open through the middle of the month. He said he'll cut some to sell as cut trees, and if any are left, they'll set them by the side of the road.
"Someone always takes them," he said.
"All the farms I know are selling out," said his wife, Marilyn.
While there have been national reports of tree shortages, she said that's not the case for Maine.
"When people started this, the artificial tree was the big thing," she said. "They didn't realize it would take off."
Like many farm-based businesses, the industry is facing some change as older growers are retiring and selling their farms, Bond said. And when they do that, they often clear their fields to make the land more salable. Bond, who is 70, and her husband, who is 84, are considering retirement.
But she sees promise in the next generation of tree growers - young couples who want to be more connected to the land and are choosing to farm.

Woman pointed air rifle at dog walker, authorities say
A local woman is accused of pointing a high-powered air rifle at a man walking his dog next to her property, Franklin County Sheriff Scott Nichols Sr. said Wednesday.
Deputy Brad Scovil responded at 9:12 a.m. Tuesday to a report of a woman threatening the caller with a rifle.
The victim didn't know what type of weapon was being pointed at him at the time; all he saw was a black rifle, Nichols said.
Scovil arrested Marcia Higgins, 65, of Eustis on a felony charge of criminal threatening with a dangerous weapon, Nichols said.
A conviction on a class C charge is punishable by a maximum five years in prison and a $5,000 fine.
According to Scovil's report, Higgins came out on her porch, pointed the Crosman air rifle at the man and accused him of allowing his dog to get into her bird food with the implied threat of shooting him if they did not move away. She had thrown food items on the ground to feed some crows, Nichols said.
The air rifle can be loaded with either pellets or BBs. Higgins' was loaded with BBs, which would be shot at a lower velocity. However, she would still be able to kill squirrels with it, Scovil said.
Scovil confiscated the rifle.
Higgins was taken to the Franklin County Detention Center in Farmington and released Wednesday on $300 cash bail.
She is scheduled to appear Jan. 23 in a Farmington court, according to the arrest log.
Gorham
Man, 31, pleads guilty to possessing child porn
A Gorham man pleaded guilty this week to possession of child pornography.
Christopher Shepard, 31, pleaded guilty Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Portland, U.S. Attorney Halsey B. Frank said in a statement.
Gorham police obtained a warrant in April to search Shepard's apartment. Officers seized his cellphone, which was found to contain several images of a girl under 12 who was engaging in sexually explicit conduct.
Shepard faces up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000, Frank said. He also faces a supervised release term of five years to life. He will be sentenced after the U.S. Probation Office completes its investigation.
The investigation was conducted by the Gorham Police Department and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations.
baxter state park
Iconic signs go out to bid to benefit park programs
An online auction offers bidders a chance to own a piece of Maine's iconic 209,000-acre Baxter State Park.
The Friends of Baxter State Park and Baxter State Park are conducting an online auction featuring 15 retired trail signs as well as the historic dinner bell from Kidney Pond Camps.
Friends will donate 50 percent of auction proceeds to the park while the remaining 50 percent will support programs operated by the Friends of Baxter State Park.
Some of the signs being offered include the Appalachian Trail, Katahdin Lake Trail, Slaughter Pond Trail, North Peaks Trail and Saddle Trail. As of Wednesday, the most popular sign was Appalachian Trail with 10 bids, the highest being $1,700. A bid of $2,000 was made for the Kidney Pond dinner bell.
Bids can be entered by visiting the Friends of Baxter State Park Facebook page. The auction will end Dec. 6.
BUCKSPORT
Police investigate claims of sex crimes at high school
Maine police say they are investigating alleged sex crimes at a high school in Bucksport.
Police Chief Sean Geagan says school officials notified police of allegations involving a former employee of the district and high school students. Superintendent Jim Boothby tells WABI-TV that the former employee is a person of interest in the investigation. Further information was not released.

Maine gets federal grant to target illegal opioid sales
The Maine Drug Enforcement Agency has received a federal grant for $525,569 to target illegal opioid sales, according to a statement from U.S. Attorney Halsey B. Frank on Wednesday.
The money must be used to support the identification of or investigation into illicit activities related to the distribution of heroin or prescription opioids, the statement said.
The MDEA received the grant because Maine has high per capita levels of primary treatment admissions related to heroin and other opioids.

Texto completo: to nonprofits
If you've ever been involved with a tax-exempt, nonprofit organization, you know that the day begins and ends with one word: money.
Because you're not in the business of making it, your only alternative is to raise it.
It's a heavy lift even in the best of times. And thanks to the Republican-driven tax "reform" legislation now hurtling through Congress like a runaway freight train, these are far from the best of times.
"Overall, it's pretty scary to us," said Jennifer Burns Gray, director of advocacy and public relations for the Maine Association of Nonprofits, in an interview Wednesday. "Folks are feeling very anxious."
Why? Because the tax proposals both in the House and Senate could well throw a wet blanket on charitable giving here in Maine and beyond.
And as charitable giving goes, so goes what made America great long before Donald Trump moved into the White House.
Let's start with tax deductions.
Under the current federal tax code, donations to a bona fide charitable nonprofit, or 501(c)(3) in tax parlance, can be subtracted from taxable income by people who itemize their deductions.
Here in Maine, itemizers comprise about one-third of the population. These folks donate to their favorite causes with the expectation that when tax time comes the following April, their taxable income will be that much lower and thus they'll pay less in income taxes.
In other words, by rewarding them for their contribution to making the world a better place, the tax code actually encourages them to give more.
Not so under the House and Senate bills, both of which would raise the standard deduction and, in the process, drastically reduce the number of taxpayers who itemize.
It's simple logic: No tax deduction means less incentive to donate, which in turn means less money for the local church, soup kitchen, youth group or myriad other organizations that strengthen our social fabric.
"On average, Mainers give about $700 (per capita) a year to charity," noted the nonprofit association's Gray. "While not all of those are itemizing, certainly many folks are incentivized by the itemized deduction."
Gray doubts that those people, deprived of their tax break, would stop giving completely. Still, she said, evaporation of the charitable deduction would have a "depressive impact on giving."
How depressive? According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, the bill already approved by the House would shrink the number of American taxpayers who itemize their deductions from 46 million to 13 million.
In turn, the center projects, charitable giving nationwide would drop by somewhere between $12 billion and $20 billion.
This at a time when federal contracts with nonprofits to provide vital social services would also fast disappear via lost tax revenues. (It's a foregone conclusion on Capitol Hill that whatever tax bill comes out of Congress, the federal budget deficit will balloon by $1.5 trillion between now and 2027.)
Thus, nonprofits get hit coming and going: Lost income, whether it's from an individual donor or the state or federal budget, spells trouble ahead for a sector that employs one out of every six Mainers (more than any other industry) and contributes $11 billion annually to the state's economy.
An easy solution, Gray noted, would be for Congress to pass a "universal deduction" that allows everyone to deduct their charitable contributions without itemizing.
That makes a lot of sense. Which, in the current political climate, makes it about as likely to happen as President Trump surrendering his Twitter account.
Now let's turn to the other edge of the tax-reform sword.
Under the House bill, a 63-year-old prohibition against charitable nonprofits engaging in partisan politics would go up in smoke.
The so-called "Johnson amendment," authored in 1954 by then-U.S. Sen. Lyndon Johnson, has for decades served as a bulwark against using charitable nonprofits as front organizations for hard-to-trace political contributions and other partisan shenanigans.
Why is that important?
Well, for starters, repealing it would drag the nonprofit sector kicking and screaming into the already-murky world of political financing. If you think it's bad now, imagine a campaign pocketing massive cash infusions from, say, the Church of Freedom and Prosperity.
But equally distressing, from Gray's perspective, is the corrosive effect repeal of the Johnson amendment would have on nonprofits' credibility overall.
"A key part of our federal tax law is that nonprofits can't engage in partisan politics," Gray said, envisioning an explosion of "sham nonprofits that can just funnel money to partisan candidates and campaigns. It just would really damage the integrity of the (nonprofit) sector."
And for what?
Because a president and his majority party - and that includes you, Sen. Susan Collins - desperate to demonstrate that they can achieve anything legislatively over the course of an entire year, are hell bent on doing in a few days what would take thoughtful leaders weeks if not months?
Because we all know that at the core of this tax-reform charade, the rich will get richer and the rest of us be damned?
Or is it because, to the politicians pulling the levers and the deep pockets who direct them, accumulated wealth is a virtue and nonprofits are for suckers?
The painful truth is that after all the drama and dysfunction of the past 12 months, we have arrived at a crossroads in this country: The turn Congress takes in the coming days will define this nation for years to come - not only to ourselves, but to a world that looks on in ever-escalating disbelief.
That sobering realization was not lost on a group of Maine clergy who gathered Tuesday morning in front of Portland's Cathedral Church of St. Luke to decry the current tax proposals as "neither just nor moral."
The Rev. Ben Shambaugh, dean of St. Luke's, was among them, holding a sign that read "God Hates Greed."
I chatted with Shambaugh on Wednesday. He said the plight faced by nonprofits these days is but one symptom of a political climate fueled more by avarice than an appreciation for what he calls the "common good."
"I think we're going through this spiritual poverty in our culture when you don't give, when you don't share," Shambaugh said. "We've lost our moral compass."

Texto completo: Piper Shores Opens Doors on 43,000-Square-Foot Memory Care and Assisted Living Expansion
SCARBOROUGH -- Piper Shores has completed a $14 million expansion, adding a 43,000-square-foot memory care and assisted-living facility to its 138-acre campus between Higgins Beach and Prouts Neck.
The private nonprofit retirement community announced the opening of its Holbrook Memory Care and Assisted Living Residences on Wednesday.
The new building includes 14 memory care units and 16 assisted-living units. It also features common areas for exercise, arts and crafts, cooking and indoor gardening with certified recreational therapists on staff to manage daily activities.
"Dementia is a mounting concern nationally, and Maine lacks adequate care options to accommodate the growing need," said Piper Shores CEO Jim Adamowicz. "Maine is also the oldest state in the U.S., and with 10,000 baby boomers retiring every day in America, it is clear that the state and the nation must prepare for the needs of the older members of our community."
Located off Spurwink Road, Piper Shores was established in 2001 as Maine's first nonprofit, continuing-care retirement community, committed to accommodating residents' needs as they age, Adamowicz said.
Today, it has a two- to seven-year waiting list for independent-living cottages and apartments.

Texto completo: The Maine Mariners unveil their ECHL logo at Cross Insurance Arena.
Cora Schott of Lewiston wasted no time plunking down 16 bucks for a blue T-shirt bearing the logo of the Maine Mariners, the minor league hockey team scheduled to begin play in downtown Portland next fall.
"I like that they paid attention to small details," Schott, 28, said Wednesday following an unveiling of the logo at Cross Insurance Arena. "I was really impressed they had a lot of Maine."
The logo features a horizontal trident forming the vowel in the state abbreviation and, when examined closely, includes subtle nods to Maine's coastline, forests and state seal. The predominant colors are blue and green.
"It takes in a lot more of Maine than what most people would think," said Schott's companion, Jon Caldwell, also 28 and from Lewiston. "It's a new direction with an old feel."
The ECHL's Mariners will fill a void left by the Portland Pirates, an American Hockey League team that played at the arena from 1993 to 2016 before moving to Springfield, Massachusetts.
The Pirates were preceded in Portland by the original Maine Mariners, who began play at the arena in 1977. The original Mariners wore orange and black as an AHL affiliate of the Philadelphia Flyers and, later, the New Jersey Devils and Boston Bruins. Their logo featured a ship's spoked wheel in the middle of a rounded black M.
George Santos of Portland wore an orange Mariners jersey from the 1984 Calder Cup championship team to Wednesday's unveiling. The event was attended by about four dozen fans, who watched from the west stands as the logo appeared on the scoreboard's video screen.
"Fantastic," said Santos, 54. "I think their philosophy was to embrace the whole state. When the Pirates were here, I don't think they reached out far enough."
Not everyone embraced the new logo, particularly on social media. An informal Portland Press Herald poll on Twitter showed a little under half of respondents loved the new logo, and about a quarter were neutral. The rest were split between loathing it and still wishing the team had been named Puffins or Wild Blueberries, two of the five finalists in a name-the-team contest this summer.
Matt Taylor, 33, grew up in South Portland and now lives in Biddeford. He said a trident fails to represent the state's maritime culture of boat-building, lobstering and fishing.
"I don't really see many tridents in Maine," he said. "Maybe it would be a little different if I was a little younger and didn't have the memories of the old Mariners."
Taylor said he was disappointed the new design failed to include something of the ship's wheel from the old logo, but he does appreciate the hidden images of a lighthouse, pine tree and North star. Overall, he was lukewarm on the design.
"Could be better, could be worse," he said. "I do like the color scheme."
Justin Varberakis, creative director at Portland's Big Room Studios, led a team that worked on the design for six weeks after the Mariners selected his company over a half-dozen others who responded to the team's request for proposals. He said he also loved the original Mariners M and plans to incorporate it into at least one of the team's planned secondary logos.
"That will live on," said Varberakis, 36, who grew up in Topsham, "because everybody loves that thing."
The butt end of the trident is meant to resemble a hockey stick, with green bulges looking like wrapped athletic tape. A lighthouse appears in the shading of the second stanchion in the letter M. The pine tree appears in the middle prong of the trident, which also includes a stylized star similar to that above the Dirigo banner on Maine's state seal.
There were no hats or sweatshirts available after Wednesday's unveiling. Adam Goldberg, the Mariners' vice president of business development, said apparel can be ordered from the team's new website: MarinersOfMaine.com.
The site also includes information about season tickets. He said the team would be rolling out half-season packages within a few weeks and "as we progress toward October, we'll be introducing various other ticket packages for our fans."
Goldberg also invited fans to the first of a planned series of town hall-style meetings Dec. 12 at the arena.
"The earlier we can get your opinions and thoughts," he said, "the more we can get ahead of things by the time the puck drops in October." Glenn Jordan can be contacted at 791-6425 or: Gjordan@pressherald.com Twitter: GlennJordanPPH

Texto completo: A former Jesuit priest and Cheverus High School teacher who was indicted this week on charges of sexual abuse dating back to the late 1990s settled a civil lawsuit in June with a victim. The age of the victim, as well as the location and timing of the alleged assaults in the civil suit match those in the criminal indictment, which strongly suggests that the cases involve the same person. James Francis Talbot, 80, now living in Missouri, has been charged with one count of Class A gross sexual assault and one count of Class C unlawful sexual contact. He is being extradited from Missouri to Maine to face those charges in Cumberland County Unified Court on Friday.
A former Jesuit priest and Cheverus High School teacher who was indicted this month on charges of sexual abuse dating to the late 1990s settled a civil lawsuit in June with a man who claimed the priest sexually assaulted him in a Freeport church when he was 9 years old.
The name of the victim in the criminal case has not been released, but the age of the victim and the location and timing of the assaults align with facts revealed in the civil case.
The Nov. 9 indictment charged James Francis Talbot, 80, who had been living in Missouri, with one count of Class A gross sexual assault and one count of Class C unlawful sexual contact. Talbot was extradited from Missouri and arrived Wednesday in Maine. He was being held at the Cumberland County Jail on $50,000 cash bail and is scheduled to be arraigned on the charges Friday at 1 p.m.
The Freeport Police Department issued a statement Wednesday saying it sought the indictment after receiving a report about abuse and conducting an investigation. The department also confirmed that the victim in the criminal case was a resident and member at St. Jude Church in Freeport when he allegedly was molested by Talbot between May 1997 and June 1998.
There have been numerous allegations of child sexual abuse against Talbot, both from when he was at Cheverus and at Boston College High School in the 1970s, involving multiple victims. He already has spent six years in prison for a sexual abuse conviction in Massachusetts.
The most recent case, though, is the first time that Talbot has been accused in Maine of misconduct that did not occur at Cheverus High School.
It also serves as a reminder that the damage caused by a widespread culture of sexual abuse by Catholic priests - exposed by the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporting in the Boston Globe more than a decade ago - is still coming to light.
The Cumberland County District Attorney's Office did not return several calls for comment. Talbot's defense attorney, Walt McKee, also did not return calls for comment Wednesday.
According to the civil complaint filed last year, Talbot allegedly assaulted a 9-year-old boy on several occasions in early 1998 while acting as a priest at St. Jude Church in Freeport.
The complaint alleged that Talbot used his position in the church, and as a Jesuit and Cheverus teacher, to befriend the boy and his family. The Portland Press Herald does not identify victims of sexual abuse without their consent.
Talbot's accuser said the priest assaulted him while he was receiving religious instruction at the church.
The civil lawsuit named as defendants Talbot, the Roman Catholic bishop of Portland, Cheverus High School and the USA Northeast Province of the Society of Jesus.
The victim alleged that the institutions that were responsible for Talbot knew about his "propensity to sexually abuse boys" but did not adequately protect children who came into contact with him. The victim's attorney in the civil case, Mark Randall, did not return calls for comment Wednesday.
JESUITS AWARE OF NEW TALBOT CHARGES
Melissa Hewey, an attorney representing Cheverus, said she had no comment on the criminal charges involving Talbot because the alleged acts in this case did not involve a Cheverus student, nor did they occur on school grounds.
The Roman Catholic Diocese of Portland referred all questions to the USA Northeast Province of the Society of Jesus, also known as the Jesuits.
Jesuits are an order of the Catholic Church whose members focus on education and evangelization. They serve the universal church rather than any specific diocese or archdiocese, said Michael Benigno, a spokesman for the Northeast Province.
In a written statement, Benigno said the province was aware of the new charges against Talbot. He said that after Talbot's prison sentence in 2011, he was laicized by the Vatican, which means he is no longer a priest.
He has, however, remained a Jesuit, Benigno said, and has been living at the Vianney Renewal Center - a church-owned facility in Dittmer, Missouri, that provides housing and counseling to priests and former priests, including many who have been suspected or convicted of sexual abuse.
"We understand this to be a painful time, particularly for the individual who has raised these charges," the statement read. "We expect Mr. Talbot to cooperate with legal proceedings and hope that the ensuing trial will afford the victim justice.
"The USA Northeast Province has, and will continue to strive to extend a healing presence to all victims of sexual abuse, while working toward eradicating sexual abuse from the church and the wider society. We will continue to pray for and support this individual and anyone who has been a victim of abuse at the hands of those they should have been able to trust. Any violation of that trust is grave and deserving of justice."
A LONG HISTORY OF SEXUAL ABUSE
The latest allegations against Talbot come on top of his lengthy history of abuse dating to the 1970s, when he was a teacher and coach at Boston College High. Many of those allegations were reported by the Boston Globe's Spotlight investigative team, whose work was featured in the Academy Award-winning 2015 film "Spotlight." The movie includes references to Talbot's victims.
In a March 2002 article, the Globe reported that Talbot coached wrestling, as well as soccer, at Boston College High and that he engaged in a "bizarre habit" of wrestling with students who were in various stages of undress, including wearing only athletic supporters.
Those allegations led to additional victims coming forward. In 2003, 14 men reached a settlement of claims against Talbot totaling $5.2 million.
Two years later, Talbot pleaded guilty to criminal charges of raping and sexually assaulting two Boston College High School students in the 1970s. He was sentenced to five to seven years in prison and then released to the church's rehab facility in Illinois.
Long before the allegations at Boston College High became public, Talbot was transferred in 1980 to Cheverus High School, a Jesuit-run private school in Portland. He taught alongside former longtime track coach Charles Malia, who admitted in 2000 that he abused boys at the school.
The Rev. Steven Dawber, Cheverus' president when Talbot was transferred there, worked with Talbot at Boston College High and recommended that he join him at Cheverus. Dawber also was suspected of sexually abusing boys, according to the Globe. He died in 2010.
The Rev. John Keegan, a former president of Cheverus, has said the school was unaware of the incidents in Boston when Talbot and Dawber were hired.
AT LEAST TWO OTHER ALLEGED VICTIMS
It's not clear how widespread Talbot's abuse might have been in Maine, but there were at least two more alleged victims here.
Michael Doherty, a Freeport man, filed a lawsuit in 1997 alleging that Talbot molested him in the mid-1980s at Cheverus.
Doherty, who has spoken publicly about the abuse, was a teenager at the time and his family had become close with Talbot. They even let him come and go from their home as he pleased.
The case was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount in 2001.
A second Cheverus victim also settled a suit involving Talbot, although that accuser did not come forward publicly.
No criminal charges were filed because the alleged abuse fell outside the statute of limitations at that time. Talbot, however, was terminated by Cheverus the next year. Eric Russell can be contacted at 791-6344 or at: erussell@pressherald.com Twitter: PPHEricRussell

Texto completo: Dispatch about an upcoming TED-style event, Day of Hope, organized by students at Yarmouth High School.
YARMOUTH -- Sammy Potter wants to know where others find hope and how they use it to make a positive impact.
A desire to find answers to those questions led Potter to organize the first Day of Hope, at Yarmouth High School on Saturday. He believes that hope is a relevant theme in the current turbulent political and cultural climate.
"(Day of Hope) is definitely a result of these kinds of tumultuous times that we live in," said Potter, a senior at Yarmouth High.
The event will be held in the school's auditorium and will feature seven TED-style talks from 1-3:30 p.m., followed by a 30-minute reception where attendees can ask questions. TED is a media organization that focuses on "ideas worth spreading," by experts from many fields.
Potter began thinking of what hope means to varying mindsets and political viewpoints when he was interning for Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, in Washington, D.C., from January to June.
"I had a community of fellow interns who really represented a wide diversity of ideas and varying political opinions from across the country," Potter said. After returning from Washington, Potter traveled to Israel with a group of pluralistic Jews.
"I wanted to do something that brought this spirit of having an open marketplace for ideas home to Maine to try to share what I gained while I was in D.C. and Israel," he said.
Potter, who identifies politically as an independent, said he's found a sense of unity in what brings people hope - regardless of political views.
"The worst thing we can do is be comfortable living in a homogeneous society," he said.
As for himself, Potter finds hope in potential. "We have this awesome chunk of paradise with beautiful natural resources and hardworking people, but we've also got some really big problems," he said. "I get hope from the potential of solving those problems."
Potter said the purpose of the Day of Hope is to hear from innovators who are working toward a brighter future in Maine.
Speakers will include Maine immigration attorney Leslie Silverstein, former gubernatorial candidate Eliot Cutler, Maine Accelerates Growth CEO Jess Knox, musician Spencer Albee, state Sen. Cathy Breen, Portland Mayor Ethan Strimling and Maine Heritage Policy Center CEO Matthew Gagnon. Each will speak about where they find hope in turbulent times.
"These are speakers that represent very diverse ideas. Some of them have very conflicting ideas for how to improve the state," Potter said. "... One of the things I think is really dangerous in a community like Yarmouth, and in southern Maine too, is the potential to become echo chambers of our own ideas and opinions."
Admission to the Day of Hope is $7 for adults and $5 for ages 18 and under. Tickets can be purchased at the event's web page, dayofhopemaine.com.
All proceeds will be donated to Preble Street, which provides services for people experiencing homelessness and hunger.
Although Potter plans to attend college next year, he envisions Day of Hope continuing in his absence. Jocelyn Van Saun can be contacted at 781-3661, ext. 183 or at: jvansaun@theforecaster.net Twitter JocelynVanSaun.

Wiscasset sues state to block controversial Route 1 project

Texto completo: The Town of Wiscasset has filed suit against the Maine Department of Transportation seeking to block the start of work on a controversial project to improve traffic passing through its historic village.
The town of Wiscasset has sued the Maine Department of Transportation, seeking to block a controversial project aimed at improving the flow of traffic through its historic village.
At issue is the state's plan to widen the section of Route 1 - which is Main Street in Wiscasset - that passes through the village and gets clogged in the summer with motorists traveling up and down the coast. The project would eliminate parking places in front of local businesses, add traffic lights and turning lanes, and require the demolition of a 1916 building that once housed Maine's first Ford dealership.
The lawsuit, filed late Tuesday in Lincoln County Superior Court, says the project would "adversely affect the historic character and viability" of the village and does not comply with town ordinances or state law. The town wants the court to order the Department of Transportation to delay starting the project until it complies with local regulations and reaches an agreement with town officials on how to pay for long-term costs.
"The town looks forward to seeing the process through and is hopeful that MDOT will comply with the town's requests," Town Manager Marian Anderson said in a written statement. "We look forward to continuing to work positively with MDOT to resolve the issues." She did not respond to messages from the Portland Press Herald.
Opponents of the $5 million project - which will receive no federal funding - have argued that it would ruin the town center's character and drive out businesses without making any meaningful improvement to the traffic problems, which result in miles-long backups in both directions approaching the village and on the bridge over the Sheepscot River.
"At least we are headed toward a conclusion of this controversy one way or another," said Bill Sutter, a resident and vocal opponent of the plan. "They have been very intransigent about continuing the conversation."
A spokesman said the MDOT was disappointed to learn of the lawsuit. "The department recently met with town representatives and was continuing to work in good faith to address public concerns about certain project features when it was told of the lawsuit," Ted Talbot said via email.
The Portland attorney representing the town, Peter Murray, did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday.
Residents and elected officials in the midcoast town were initially supportive of the plan as originally presented by the state in April 2016. That plan would have removed most of the on-street parking on a two-block stretch of Main Street, would have been paid for mostly with federal funds and would have been subject to historic preservation requirements. Substitute parking was to be created on nearby Creamery Wharf. And, according to the town's court filing, the state would not use eminent domain.
But after residents approved the plan in a nonbinding referendum in June 2016, the department modified the project, dropping plans to use more than $4 million in federal funding and, with it, the requirement that it comply with historic preservation and certain environmental rules. The MDOT also announced that it would remove parking from the village's two principal cross-streets - Water and Middle - and make them both one-way.
The Haggett Garage, a brick building built in 1916 that now houses the nonprofit Midcoast Conservancy, was seized by eminent domain and is scheduled to be demolished as early as next week to make way for a relocated parking lot, according to the town.
Local merchants and commercial property owners fear the loss of on-street parking will hurt businesses. "There is definitely a traffic problem and some solution needs to be found, but this isn't going to work," said Ralph Doering, a seasonal resident of the area whose family owns several retail properties on the affected streets.
In a second referendum this June, Wiscasset voters withdrew support for the revised project. The town Select Board followed in a 3-2 vote.
The town's lawsuit claims MDOT is in violation of state laws requiring it to comply with local zoning by getting permission from the town's historic preservation commission before demolishing the Haggett Garage. It also alleges that the state broke its commitment with the town to draft an agreement that would spell out how ongoing costs associated with the project - like the maintenance of sidewalks, parking lots and landscaping - will be covered.
In his statement, Talbot said the department couldn't comment in detail because the matter is now in litigation. But he did say it is considering delaying the demolition of the former garage as it works on an agreement with the town. Colin Woodard can be contacted at: cwoodard@pressherald.com

Texto completo: Maine Forest Service releases parasitoid flies in South Portland as the city steps up response to winter moth invasion. Possibly with photos of release from MFS.
SOUTH PORTLAND -- City officials are developing a plan to fight destructive winter moth infestations that have begun to damage oaks, maples and other trees in neighborhoods near neighboring Cape Elizabeth.
They're working with entomologists with the Maine Forest Service, who were here Wednesday to release parasitoid flies as part of a regional project aimed at killing the small tan moths now seen flying around street lamps and porch lights.
The entomologists buried a cage filled with cocoons of the fly, Cyzenis albicans, on private property off Highland Avenue, near Hinckley Park, where winter moth caterpillars turned leafy canopies into lace last spring. The flies are expected to emerge next May and begin a months-long process of killing winter moths, their only prey.
"That's an area of South Portland that's experiencing a high rate of defoliation by winter moth," said Charlene Donahue, a state entomologist. "The population is starting to spread out from Cape Elizabeth."
Cape Elizabeth is ground zero in Maine for the invasive insect, which has damaged or killed thousands of trees from Kittery to Bar Harbor since 2011. An aerial survey last year found 300 acres of oak mortality in Cape Elizabeth - an area encompassing 2,000 to 3,000 dead trees - and the infestation has spread into South Portland and Scarborough.
"Hopefully, it won't get to that point in South Portland," Donahue said. "That's why we're expanding the biocontrol project."
A SPREADING PROBLEM
Winter moths came to North America from Europe in the early 1900s. Infestations were seen first in Nova Scotia in the 1930s and then in the Pacific Northwest in the 1970s, according to the forest service. The moths arrived in Massachusetts in the early 2000s, spreading south into Rhode Island and north into Maine, likely transplanted with perennial flowers and shrubs from infested gardens.
The Maine Forest Service, with help from the University of Massachusetts and the U.S. Forest Service, previously released the flies in Cape Elizabeth, Harpswell, Kittery Point, Vinalhaven and Peaks Island, hoping to repeat successful moth population reductions in Nova Scotia and the Pacific Northwest.
The flies emerge in the spring and lay eggs on leaves that are eaten by winter moth caterpillars. The fly eggs then hatch into maggots inside the moth caterpillars and lay dormant until late summer, when they eat and kill the moth larvae as they pupate underground.
Donahue said it's unclear how long it will take for the flies to have an effect on the local winter moth population, but it's expected to take years. A recent survey of winter moth caterpillars in Kittery showed that 11 percent were infected and killed by the flies. The flies also are having an impact in Massachusetts, where they've been released since 2005.
'ATTACKING FROM ALL ANGLES'
In the meantime, South Portland officials are taking steps to evaluate the extent of winter moth damage across the city, develop a program to prevent tree deaths and enlist the public to join the fight. Winter moths prefer oak, maple, ash, elm and fruit trees and shrubs.
"We're looking at attacking this from all angles," said Karl Coughlin, deputy director of the city's parks department. "We'll be conducting a tree inventory in the coming months, but we're really going to rely on the community to let us know where they see trees being affected."
Coughlin met Tuesday with Cape Elizabeth Tree Warden Todd Robbins to learn what that town has done to combat winter moths.
Cape Elizabeth has tripled its budget to care for trees in public parks and along roads - from $20,000 two years ago to $60,000 this year - because winter moth damage has exponentially increased the need for pest control, pruning, dead-tree removals and replacement plantings.
In recent weeks, volunteers helped Robbins band hundreds of tree trunks with sticky tape that captures the moths and is a key part of an integrated pest management plan.
Most trees can survive moderate winter moth infestations that destroy less than 50 percent of their foliage, Robbins said. If the moths do greater damage in the spring, a tree will immediately put out a second flush of leaves, diverting much-needed energy from the usual growth process.
Three or four years in a row with a second flush of leaves will kill a tree, Robbins said, especially under the recent drought conditions.
Winter moths are most visible now, between Thanksgiving and the start of the new year, when the insects emerge from the ground to mate when the temperature rises above freezing.
LESS COSTLY OPTION
While the male moths are most noticeable because they fly, the near-wingless female moths are the real culprits. They crawl up tree trunks and lay eggs that will hatch into larvae in the spring and gorge on new buds and leaves. Then the caterpillars drop and burrow into the ground, where they form cocoons and pupate from June through November.
That's when the moths can be spread unknowingly by gardeners who swap plants from infested soil or sell them at fundraisers, and through mulch made from contaminated leaves, lawn clippings and other garden debris. They also can be transported by cars, boats and other vehicles that happen to be where the caterpillars fall.
Coughlin said he hopes to interrupt the spread by educating South Portland residents about the problem and promoting an integrated pest management program similar to the one in Cape Elizabeth.
Coughlin said he's not sure how much it will cost, but he hopes residents help the city identify problem areas early. He'd rather spend the money on banding trees in the fall and applying horticultural oils in the spring that smother the caterpillars. If not, the city could face an even greater cost if it has to take down hundreds of dead trees.
"We know it's here and it could get worse," Coughlin said.

Texto completo: PPH toy fund daily story and donor list.
If reader donations are the lifeblood of the Portland Press Herald Toy Fund, then folks like Julie Pew are the muscle.
The gentle grandmother from Yarmouth is a faithful member of the army of volunteers who make sure readers' donations bring joy to thousands of children each Christmas. Not even Pew herself knows how long she's been on the job. "It's been so many years, I can't remember," she said.
Pew volunteers one day a week from early November until late December. The season begins as a big reunion for the volunteers, many of whom have worked together for years in the toy fund warehouse.
Volunteers start by unpacking huge piles of boxes filled with new toys, crafts and electronics and sorting the gifts by the ages and genders of the children who will receive them. Then the toys are gathered and packaged for families in need who apply for help so their children don't go without gifts to open at the holidays. Finally, Pew and the other volunteer "elves" get to hand out bags of gifts to mothers and fathers and grandparents. That's always a highlight.
"It's nice to meet them," Pew said. "Most of them are very thankful for what we do for them." Others are embarrassed that they have to come in, Pew said, although the volunteers do what they can to brighten the atmosphere. By the time the crews are distributing gifts, there are elf hats, reindeer antlers and lots of smiles.
"Toward the end, you get kind of silly," Pew said. "It's a very nice project."
The Portland Press Herald Toy Fund in the Spirit of Bruce Roberts is using donations from readers to provide toys to thousands of Maine children who might otherwise not receive holiday gifts because of hardships faced by their parents. Bruce Roberts was the original pen name of the newspaper columnist who co-founded the fund in 1949.
The fund - now in its 68th year - is accepting applications for toys from needy families in Cumberland, York, Sagadahoc, Lincoln, Androscoggin and Knox counties.
Applications can be downloaded at pressheraldtoyfund.org or picked up at the Press Herald's Welcome Center at 295 Gannett Drive in South Portland. Call 791-6672 to have one mailed to you.
Donations to help buy the toys can be made at pressheraldtoyfund.org or by writing checks to the Portland Press Herald Toy Fund and mailing them to the fund at P.O. Box 7310, Portland, ME 04112.

Once Solid, Barrier to Arctic Drilling Is on Brink of Falling

Texto completo: Want the latest climate news in your inbox? You can sign up here to receive Climate Fwd:, our new email newsletter. WASHINGTON -- Carl Portman remembers watching, heartbroken, from Anchorage in 2005 as a Senate effort to allow drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge lost by two votes. Now, 12 years later, another effort to open up the reserve to oil and gas drilling is working its way through Congress. And this time, the political winds have shifted.
Mr. Portman, now a top official of a pro-drilling group, has seen oil revenue improve the schools, roads and hospitals in Alaska, his home state. He said he was cautiously optimistic about the drilling measure, which is included in a sweeping bill to overhaul the tax code. Environmental activists and their allies in Congress, on the other hand, are on the cusp of forever losing the decades-long political battle over the refuge.
"It is critically important and I don't think anybody knows it is stuck in a tax bill," said Senator Maria Cantwell, the Washington Democrat who led the 2005 fight against drilling in the refuge. "It's been around for thousands of years, and for no good reason we're going to change it? Is there no such thing as a special place?"
The current effort to allow drilling, the latest in a long series, stands the best chance of success in years thanks to a rare alignment of the political stars: Republicans control the House, Senate and White House. The tax bill is critical to the political future of the president and the Republican Party. And, the linchpin: A key role belongs to Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, who has worked to allow drilling in the refuge her entire career.
The political landscape in Washington also has become more polarized since the last time Arctic drilling was a real possibility. When Senator Cantwell tried to strip the drilling provision out of the budget bill in October, it failed mostly along party line votes. Senator Susan Collins of Maine was the only Republican to support the effort.
The moment seems certain to be decisive on both sides of the battle.
Drilling proponents see the measure as one of responsible energy development for the good of Alaska and the nation. Oil and gas production in a portion of the refuge would generate $1.1 billion over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. And, proponents note, every barrel of oil from America is one not purchased from overseas.
For environmental activists, protecting the refuge is about preserving the fragile beauty of the Arctic wilderness -- where caribou herds calve, polar bears den and millions of migratory birds gather -- just as the effects of global warming are becoming more pronounced in the far north than almost anywhere else on earth.
At the heart of the debate, the opposing sides agree, is a clash of values. What is more important: the environment or economic development?
"Is this too sacred a ground to be disturbed by oil and gas drilling? It's a question of what we are willing to accept as a society," said Mark Myers, former director of the United States Geological Survey and a former Alaska Department of Natural Resources commissioner.
Mr. Myers said he believed that drilling could be achieved with strong environmental protections. But, he acknowledged, the choice of whether to open the Arctic is a visceral one.
"Is it painting a mustache on the Mona Lisa?" he said. "That's the fundamental question Congress has to wrestle with."
The origins of the battle over the refuge date back decades.
President Dwight D. Eisenhower placed the area under federal protection in 1960. Twenty years later, President Jimmy Carter expanded the refuge and set aside 1.5 million acres between the Brooks Range and the Beaufort Sea -- known as the 1002 area, after the provision that created it -- to be set aside for the possible study of oil and gas development.
The law left it to Congress to decide whether to allow drilling in the 1002 area, drawing the fault lines that would define the political battle. Since then, successive Republican efforts to open the refuge have failed in Congress or been killed by presidential vetoes.
The closest drilling advocates came to success was in 2005, but Senator Cantwell, who was a freshman at the time, mounted a filibuster that ultimately stopped a provision in a military spending authorization that would have opened the refuge.
This time, the decisive role could fall to Senator Murkowski, the chairwoman of the Senate's energy panel who has introduced legislation to open the Arctic wilderness every term she has served in the chamber.
"Right now, Lisa Murkowski may well represent the 50th vote, and that puts her in the driver seat to ask for whatever she wants. The things she seems to want most is opening the Arctic refuge," said Niel Lawrence, Alaska program director for the Natural Resources Defense Council.
Even the most ardent opponents of opening the Arctic refuge, often referred to by its acronym ANWR, say they realize this week could mark the moment they definitively lose the legislative battle over drilling. But neither side is ready yet to acknowledge defeat or declare victory.
Mr. Portman, who is deputy director of Alaska's Resource Development Council, said he wouldn't celebrate until a bill was signed into law. "I just don't want to get my hopes up so much and set myself up for another disappointment," he said. "I will not be standing up applauding until I see a vote that is in our favor and it goes to Congress and ends up on the president's desk."
To be sure, the tax bill could still collapse. Even if it passes, the Senate bill will have to be reconciled with a version that passed the House of Representatives that does not currently include the drilling provision. Moderate Republicans, some say, could still sink the effort.
"We've seen it before," said Byron L. Dorgan, a Democratic former senator from North Dakota who is now lobbying to block drilling. "The potential exists to have some people say, 'If ANWR is in, I'm out of it.' We'll see. Anything is possible."
Drilling supporters, for their part, say they are grateful that Congress appears poised to send a message that economic prosperity is the government's primary goal.
"It's a very strong message to the people of America that we are on a very different pathway now," said Gail Phillips, a former speaker of the Alaska House of Representatives. Ms. Phillips, who has called the refuge a "frozen wasteland," said allowing drilling there would send an important signal that "there are other big projects and we are open to doing these things."
For all the brave words of environmental activists, that's precisely the prospect that worries them most. If they lose the fight over the Arctic refuge, they say, there's no telling what could be lost next.
"This is one of the unique places on the planet," Mr. Dorgan said. "Is everything for sale?"

Texto completo: Action blocks widening of Main Street
The town of Wiscasset has sued the Maine Department of Transportation, seeking to block a controversial project aimed at improving the flow of traffic through its historic village.
At issue is the state's plan to widen the section of U.S. Route 1 -- which is Main Street in Wiscasset -- that passes through the village and gets clogged in the summer with motorists traveling up and down the coast. The project would eliminate parking places in front of local businesses, add traffic lights and turning lanes, and require the demolition of a 1916 building that once housed Maine's first Ford dealership.
The lawsuit, filed late Tuesday in Lincoln County Superior Court, says the project would "adversely affect the historic character and viability" of the village and does not comply with town ordinances or state law. The town wants the court to order the transportation department to delay starting the project until it complies with local regulations and reaches an agreement with town officials on how to pay long-term costs.
"The Town looks forward to seeing the process through and is hopeful that MDOT will comply with the Town's requests," said Town Manager Marian Anderson in a written statement. "We look forward to continuing to work positively with MDOT to resolve the issues." She did not respond to messages from the Portland Press Herald.
Opponents of the $5 million project -- which will receive no federal funding -- have argued it would ruin the town center's character and drive out businesses without making any meaningful improvement to the traffic problems, which result in miles-long backups in both directions approaching the village and on the bridge over the Sheepscot River.
"At least we are headed toward a conclusion of this controversy one way or another," said Bill Sutter, a resident and vocal opponent of the plan. "They have been very intransigent about continuing the conversation."
A spokesman said the transportation department was disappointed to learn of the lawsuit.
"The Department recently met with town representatives and was continuing to work in good faith to address public concerns about certain project features when it was told of the lawsuit," Ted Talbot said via email.
The Portland attorney representing the town, Peter Murray, did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday.
Residents and elected officials in the midcoast town were initially supportive of the plan as originally presented by the state in April 2016. That plan would have removed most of the on-street parking on a two-block stretch of Main Street, would have been paid for mostly with federal funds and would have been subject to historic preservation requirements. Substitute parking was to be created on nearby Creamery Wharf. And according to the town's court filing, the state would not use eminent domain.
But after residents approved the plan in a nonbinding referendum in June 2016, the department modified the project, dropping plans to use more than $4 million in federal funding and, with it, the requirement that it comply with historic preservation and certain environmental rules. It also announced that it would remove parking from the village's two principal cross streets -- Water and Middle -- and make them both one-way.
The Haggett Garage, a brick building built in 1916 that now houses the nonprofit Midcoast Conservancy, was seized by eminent domain and is scheduled to be demolished as early as next week to make way for a relocated parking lot, according to the town.
Local merchants and commercial property owners fear the loss of on-street parking will hurt businesses. "There is definitely a traffic problem and some solution needs to be found, but this isn't going to work," said Ralph Doering, a seasonal resident of the area whose family owns several retail properties on the affected streets.
In a second referendum this June, Wiscasset voters withdrew support for the revised project. The town's Select Board followed in a 3-2 vote.
The town's lawsuit claims the Department of Transportation is in violation of state laws requiring it comply with local zoning, which requires it get permission from the town's historic preservation commission before demolishing the Haggett Garage. It also alleges that the state broke its commitment with the town to draft an agreement that would spell out how ongoing costs associated with the project -- such as maintenance of sidewalks, parking lots and landscaping -- will be covered.
In his statement, Talbot said the department couldn't comment in detail because the matter is now in litigation. But he did say it is considering delaying the demolition of the former garage as it works on an agreement with the town.

Texto completo: Man claims James Talbot assaulted him when he was 9 at Freeport church
A former Jesuit priest and Cheverus High School teacher who was indicted this week on charges of sexual abuse dating to the late 1990s settled a civil lawsuit in June with a man who claimed the priest sexually assaulted him in a Freeport church when he was 9 years old.
The name of the victim in the criminal case has not been released, but the victim's age and the location and timing of the assaults align with facts revealed in the civil case.
James Francis Talbot, 80, now living in Missouri, has been charged with one count of class A gross sexual assault and one count of class C unlawful sexual contact. He is being extradited from Missouri to Maine to face those charges Friday in Cumberland County Unified Court.
The Freeport Police Department issued a statement Wednesday saying it sought the indictment after receiving a report about abuse and conducting an investigation. The department also confirmed that the victim in the criminal case was a resident and member at St. Jude Church in Freeport when Talbot allegedly molested him between May 1997 and June 1998.
There have been numerous allegations of child sexual abuse against Talbot, both from when he was at Cheverus and when he was at Boston College High School in the 1970s, involving multiple victims. He already has spent six years in prison for a sexual abuse conviction in Massachusetts.
The most recent case, though, is the first time that Talbot has been accused in Maine of misconduct that did not occur at Cheverus High School.
It also serves as a reminder that the damage caused by a widespread culture of sexual abuse by Catholic priests -- exposed by the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporting in the Boston Globe more than a decade ago -- is still coming to light.
The Cumberland County District Attorney's Office did not return several calls for comment. Talbot's defense attorney, Walter McKee, also did not return calls for comment Wednesday.
According to the civil complaint filed last year, Talbot allegedly assaulted a 9-year-old boy on several occasions in early 1998 while acting as a priest at St. Jude Church in Freeport.
The complaint alleged that Talbot used his position in the church, and as a Jesuit and Cheverus teacher, to befriend the boy and his family. The Press Herald does not identify victims of sexual abuse without their consent.
Talbot's accuser said the priest assaulted him while he was receiving religious instruction at the church.
The civil lawsuit named as defendants Talbot, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Portland, Cheverus High School and the Northeast Province of the Society of Jesus.
The victim alleged that the institutions that were responsible for Talbot knew about his "propensity to sexually abuse boys" but did not adequately protect children who came into contact with him. The victim's attorney in the civil case, Mark Randall, did not return calls for comment Wednesday.
Melissa Hewey, an attorney representing Cheverus, said she had no comment on the criminal charges involving Talbot because the alleged acts in this case did not involve a Cheverus student, nor did they occur on school grounds.
The Roman Catholic Diocese of Portland referred all questions to the USA Northeast Province of the Society of Jesus, also known as the Jesuits.
Jesuits are an order of the Catholic Church whose members focus on education and evangelization. They serve the universal church rather than any specific diocese or archdiocese, according to Michael Benigno, a spokesman for the Northeast Province.
In a statement, Benigno said the province was aware of the new charges against Talbot. He said that after Talbot's prison sentence in 2011, he was laicized by the Vatican, which means he is no longer a priest.
He has remained a Jesuit, however, Benigno said, and has been living at the Vianney Renewal Center in Dittmer, Missouri -- a Church-owned facility that provides housing and counseling to priests and former priests, including many who have been suspected or convicted of sexual abuse.
"We understand this to be a painful time, particularly for the individual who has raised these charges," the statement read. "We expect Mr. Talbot to cooperate with legal proceedings and hope that the ensuing trial will afford the victim justice.
"The USA Northeast Province has, and will continue to strive to extend a healing presence to all victims of sexual abuse, while working toward eradicating sexual abuse from the church and the wider society. We will continue to pray for and support this individual and anyone who has been a victim of abuse at the hands of those they should have been able to trust. Any violation of that trust is grave and deserving of justice."
The latest allegations against Talbot come on top of his lengthy history of abuse dating to the 1970s, when he was a teacher and coach at Boston College High. Many of those allegations were reported by the Boston Globe's Spotlight investigative team, whose work was featured in the Academy Award-winning 2015 film "Spotlight." The movie includes references to Talbot's victims.
In a March 2002 article, the Globe report that Talbot coached wrestling and soccer at Boston College High School and that he engaged in a "bizarre habit" of wrestling with students who were in various stages of undress, including wearing only athletic supporters.
Those allegations led to additional victims coming forward. In 2003, 14 men reached a settlement of claims against Talbot totaling $5.2 million.
Two years later, Talbot pleaded guilty to criminal charges of raping and sexually assaulting two Boston College High School students in the 1970s. He was sentenced to five to seven years in prison and then released to the church's rehabilitation facility in Illinois.
Long before the allegations at Boston College High became public, Talbot was transferred in 1980 to Cheverus High School, a Jesuit-run private school in Portland. He taught alongside former longtime track coach Charles Malia, who admitted in 2000 that he had abused boys at the school. Malia has since died.
The Rev. Steven Dawber, Cheverus' president when Talbot was transferred there, worked with Talbot at Boston College High and recommended that he join him at Cheverus. Dawber also was suspected of sexually abusing boys, according to the Globe. He died in 2010.
The Rev. John Keegan, current president of Cheverus High School, has said that the school was unaware of the incidents in Boston when Talbot and Dawber were hired.
It's not clear how widespread Talbot's abuse might have been in Maine, but there were at least two more alleged victims here.
Michael Doherty, a Freeport man, filed a lawsuit in 1997 alleging that Talbot had molested him in the mid-1980s at Cheverus.
Doherty, who has spoken publicly about the abuse, was a teenager at the time and his family had become close with Talbot. They even let him come and go from their home as he pleased.
The case was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount in 2001. A second Cheverus victim also settled a suit involving Talbot, although that accuser did not come forward publicly.
No criminal charges were filed because the alleged abuse fell outside the statute of limitations at that time. Talbot, however, was terminated by Cheverus the next year.

Texto completo: About 79% of High Hopes Clubhouse members trained for jobs, employed
WATERVILLE -- The local branch of an international organization that helps people with mental illness train for, get and hold down jobs not only has met its international standard, it has exceeded them.
The High Hopes Clubhouse, at 26 College Ave., recently was recognized by Clubhouse International as a chapter of distinction among the more than 320 such clubhouses in 34 countries for having 79 percent of its active members employed.
The Waterville club was formed 20 years ago to provide training, education, jobs and social connections to those with severe and persistent mental illness. While the standard set for the clubs internationally is that at least 20 percent of average daily membership work, 79 percent of High Hopes' 150 active members are employed.
A program of Kennebec Behavioral Health, High Hopes will celebrate that distinction -- and its 20th anniversary -- from 3 to 6 p.m. Friday at an open house. The public is encouraged to attend.
Informational tours, a slideshow, hors d'oeuvres and welcome gifts will be on tap, and visitors will have an opportunity to meet staff and clubhouse members.
The international clubhouse's recent accreditation report says High Hopes is an exceptional clubhouse community, excelling in its compliance with all standards internationally, according to a release from Tina Chapman, development and communications director for Kennebec Behavioral Health.
"The Clubhouse is dedicated to providing a community where members are treated with dignity and respect and (has) given everyone opportunity to be valuable members of their community," the report says.
High Hopes Director Lisa Soucie said Wednesday that she believes the distinction comes as a result of so many employers and others in the community believing in and helping to make the club successful.
"Of course, we were thrilled," she said of the honor. "We always strive to do the best service for our members."
When Soucie travels around the world, people ask why the Waterville club is so strong, she said. She tries to explain that it's about the Maine way of "taking care of our own."
"I tell them it's really about the community and the partnerships," she said. "If we didn't have employers or community folks supporting us, we wouldn't be that strong."
The clubhouse partners with employers to provide transitional employment sites and independent employment sites.
Club staff help train members for jobs at transitional sites including Joseph's Fireside Steakhouse, Mainely Brews, Wendy's, Applebee's and Humane Society Waterville Area. Staff members learn those jobs as well so that if for any reason the club member cannot go to work on a particular day, a staff member goes in his or her place to ensure job coverage.
Transitional sites are located in Waterville and Winslow, so staff members can be there in five minutes, according to Soucie.
Other club members work at independent job sites. In addition to the 150 active club members, 20 or 30 more are new referrals to the Waterville clubhouse, Soucie said.
At the clubhouse itself, members work every day, all day, learning database entry, accounting, lawn care, kitchen work, driving a van and other skills. While some jobs they take in the community are part-time, high-turnover, entry-level jobs, the clubhouse seeks to expand their skills to try to ensure full-time, long-term employment.
"We really want to focus on career goals and livable wages," Soucie said.
There are club members who are working as certified nurse assistants, hospital sterilization technicians and store employees, for instance.
Club members come from as far away as North New Portland, Jay, Skowhegan and Rockland.
Having a job makes a big difference in helping to boost self-esteem and confidence, according to Soucie. Having a job, she said, means being part of the larger community.
"It's really about being a contributing part of the community -- the self-value," she said. "You can see people grow right in front of your eyes"
The recovery that occurs when people go to work and feel wanted, needed and important is transformative, Soucie said.
Soucie started working at High Hopes as a unit coordinator when it opened 20 years ago. The late Jim Schmidt, who helped to develop similar clubhouses all over the world, was her mentor and helped develop the local club. Schmidt, who retired to Rome in 1992 from New York City, was one of the world's leading proponents of the clubhouse model for rehabilitation in the mental health field and was an international expert in employment for people with mental illness.
About 10 years ago, Soucie became director of High Hopes.
Gov. Paul LePage was a member of the club's advisory board when the club opened and also was general manager of Marden's Surplus & Salvage stores at the time. Marden's became the first employer to partner with High Hopes. Since then, 47 club members have gone through the transitional employment program with Marden's, according to Soucie. She said the governor has been invited to Friday's open house, and police Chief Joseph Massey is expected to be there.
High Hopes receives funding from MaineCare, the state Department of Labor's vocational rehabilitation program and grants.
High Hopes has sister clubhouses, Capitol Clubhouse in Augusta and Looking Ahead in Lewiston, which are known to be among the most effective clubhouses in the world, according to Chapman. The three clubhouses serve more than 600 members every year. According to Chapman, statewide organizations recognize the value the clubhouses provide.
NAMI Maine, for instance, presented the clubhouses with the Outstanding Partner Award this month at NAMI's annual meeting. NAMI executive director Jenna Mehnert said the organization was honored to work with the clubhouse staff, adding, "Not only do we respect the work clubhouses accomplish in partnership with peers, we appreciate how willing they are to engage with NAMI Maine staff on various projects."
High Hopes works with government and church officials, police and others to help ensure its success. Those wanting more information about the clubhouses may call 873-2136, extension 2136, or 888-322-2136, or go to the website www.kbhmaine.org.
Founded in 1960, Kennebec Behavioral Health operates clinics in Waterville, Augusta, Winthrop and Skowhegan.

Texto completo: Cora Schott of Lewiston wasted no time after plunking down 16 bucks for a blue T-shirt bearing the logo of the new Maine Mariners, the minor league hockey team scheduled to being ECHL play next fall in the Cross Insurance Arena.
Pulling the shirt over her head Wednesday afternoon, Schott beamed with pride for the team that will fill the void left by the departure in May 2016 of the Portland Pirates, an American Hockey League affiliate that was sold and moved to Massachusetts to become the Springfield Thunderbirds.
"I like that they paid attention to small details," Schott, 28, said following the formal unveiling of the logo at CIA. "I was really impressed they had a lot of Maine."
The new logo features a horizontal trident forming the vowel in the state abbreviation ME and, when examined closely, includes subtle nods to Maine's coastline, forests and state seal. The predominant colors are blue and green.
"It takes in a lot more of Maine than what most people would think," said Schott's companion, Jon Caldwell, also 28 and from Lewiston. "It's a new direction with an old feel."
The original Maine Mariners wore orange and black as an AHL affiliate of the Philadelphia Flyers and became the only team in league history to win the Calder Cup in each of their first two seasons, 1977-78 and 1978-79. Their logo featured a ship's spoked wheel in the middle of a rounded black M.
George Santos of Portland wore an orange Mariners jersey from the 1984 Calder Cup championship team to Wednesday's unveiling, attended by about four dozen fans, who watched from the west stands as the logo appeared on the scoreboard's video screen.
"Fantastic," said Santos, 54, who also sported a black-and-gold Mariners hat from their time at a Boston Bruins affiliate. "I think their philosophy was to embrace the whole state. When the Pirates were here, I don't think they reached out far enough."
Not everyone embraced the new logo, particularly on social media. An informal Press Herald poll on Twitter showed a little under half of respondents loved the new logo, about a quarter were neutral and the rest were split between loathing it and still wishing the team had been named either Puffins or Wild Blueberries, two of the five finalists.
Matt Taylor, 33, grew up in South Portland and now lives in Biddeford. He said a trident fails to represent the state's maritime culture of boat-building, lobstering and fishing.
"I don't really see many tridents in Maine," he said. "Maybe it would be a little different if I was a little younger and didn't have the memories of the old Mariners."
Taylor said he was disappointed the new design failed to include something of the ship's wheel from the old logo, but he does appreciate the hidden images of a lighthouse, pine tree and North star.
"Some people didn't even get that until it was pointed out," he said of discussing the logo with friends and co-workers. "People do like that aspect of it."
Overall, Taylor said he is lukewarm on the design.
"Could be better, could be worse," he said. "I do like the color scheme."
Justin Varberakis, creative director at Portland's Big Room Studios, led a team that worked on the design for six weeks after the Mariners selected his company over half a dozen others who responded to the team's request for proposals. He said he also loved the original Mariners M and plans to incorporate it into at least one of the team's planned secondary logos.
"That will live on," said Varberakis, 36, who grew up in Topsham, "because everybody loves that thing."
The butt end of the trident is meant to resemble a hockey stick, with green bulges looking like wrapped athletic tape. A lighthouse appears in the shading of the second stanchion in the letter M. The pine tree appears in the middle prong of the trident, which also includes a stylized star similar to that above the Dirigo banner on Maine's state seal.
There were no hats or sweatshirts available at Wednesday's announcement. Adam Goldberg, the Mariners vice president of business development, said apparel can be ordered from the team's new website: MarinersOfMaine.com.
The site also includes information about season-ticket packages. He said the team would be rolling out half-season packages within a few weeks and "as we progress toward October, we'll be introducing various other ticket packages for our fans."
Goldberg also invited fans to the first of what he plans on a series of Town Hall-style meetings Dec. 12 at the civic center.
"The earlier we can get your opinions and thoughts," he said, "the more we can get ahead of things by the time the puck drops in October."

Another tax bill target: nonprofits

Texto completo: If you've ever been involved with a tax-exempt, nonprofit organization, you know that the day begins and ends with one word: money.
Because you're not in the business of making it, your only alternative is to raise it.
It's a heavy lift even in the best of times. And thanks to the Republican-driven tax "reform" legislation now hurtling through Congress like a runaway freight train, these are far from the best of times.
"Overall, it's pretty scary to us," said Jennifer Burns Gray, director of advocacy and public relations for the Maine Association of Nonprofits, in an interview Wednesday. "Folks are feeling very anxious."
Why? Because the tax proposals both in the House and Senate could well throw a wet blanket on charitable giving here in Maine and beyond.
And as charitable giving goes, so goes what made America great long before Donald Trump moved into the White House.
Let's start with tax deductions.
Under the current federal tax code, donations to a bona fide charitable nonprofit, or 501(c)(3) in tax parlance, can be subtracted from taxable income by people who itemize their deductions.
Here in Maine, itemizers comprise about one-third of the population. These folks donate to their favorite causes with the expectation that when tax time comes the following April, their taxable income will be that much lower and thus they'll pay less in income taxes.
In other words, by rewarding them for their contribution to making the world a better place, the tax code actually encourages them to give more.
Not so under the House and Senate bills, both of which would raise the standard deduction and, in the process, drastically reduce the number of taxpayers who itemize.
It's simple logic: No tax deduction means less incentive to donate, which in turn means less money for the local church, soup kitchen, youth group or myriad other organizations that strengthen our social fabric.
"On average, Mainers give about $700 (per capita) a year to charity," noted the nonprofit association's Gray. "While not all of those are itemizing, certainly many folks are incentivized by the itemized deduction."
Gray doubts that those people, deprived of their tax break, would stop giving completely. Still, she said, evaporation of the charitable deduction would have a "depressive impact on giving."
How depressive? According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, the bill already approved by the House would shrink the number of American taxpayers who itemize their deductions from 46 million to 13 million.
In turn, the center projects, charitable giving nationwide would drop by somewhere between $12 billion and $20 billion.
This at a time when federal contracts with nonprofits to provide vital social services would also disappear fast via lost tax revenue. (It's a foregone conclusion on Capitol Hill that whatever tax bill comes out of Congress, the federal budget deficit will balloon by $1.5 trillion between now and 2027.)
Thus, nonprofits get hit coming and going: Lost income, whether it's from an individual donor or the state or federal budget, spells trouble ahead for a sector that employs one out of every six Mainers (more than any other industry) and contributes $11 billion annually to the state's economy.
An easy solution, Gray noted, would be for Congress to pass a "universal deduction" that allows everyone to deduct their charitable contributions without itemizing.
That makes a lot of sense. Which, in the current political climate, makes it about as likely to happen as President Trump surrendering his Twitter account.
Now let's turn to the other edge of the tax-reform sword.
Under the House bill, a 63-year-old prohibition against charitable nonprofits engaging in partisan politics would go up in smoke.
The so-called "Johnson amendment," authored in 1954 by then-U.S. Sen. Lyndon Johnson, has for decades served as a bulwark against using charitable nonprofits as front organizations for hard-to-trace political contributions and other partisan shenanigans.
Why is that important?
Well, for starters, repealing it would drag the nonprofit sector kicking and screaming into the already-murky world of political financing. If you think it's bad now, imagine a campaign pocketing massive cash infusions from, say, the Church of Freedom and Prosperity.
But equally distressing, from Gray's perspective, is the corrosive effect repeal of the Johnson amendment would have on nonprofits' credibility overall.
"A key part of our federal tax law is that nonprofits can't engage in partisan politics," Gray said, envisioning an explosion of "sham nonprofits that can just funnel money to partisan candidates and campaigns. It just would really damage the integrity of the (nonprofit) sector."
And for what?
Because a president and his majority party -- and that includes you, U.S. Sen. Susan Collins -- are desperate to demonstrate that they can achieve anything legislatively over the course of an entire year, are hell-bent on doing in a few days what would take thoughtful leaders weeks if not months?
Because we all know that at the core of this tax-reform charade, the rich will get richer and the rest of us be damned?
Or is it because, to the politicians pulling the levers and the deep pockets who direct them, accumulated wealth is a virtue and nonprofits are for suckers?
The painful truth is that after all the drama and dysfunction of the past 12 months, we have arrived at a crossroads in this country. The turn Congress takes in the coming days will define this nation for years to come -- not only to ourselves, but to a world that looks on in ever-escalating disbelief.
That sobering realization was not lost on a group of Maine clergy who gathered Tuesday morning in front of Portland's Cathedral Church of St. Luke to decry the current tax proposals as "neither just nor moral."
The Rev. Ben Shambaugh, dean of St. Luke's, was among them, holding a sign that read "God Hates Greed."
I chatted with Shambaugh on Wednesday. He said the plight faced by nonprofits these days is but one symptom of a political climate fueled more by avarice than an appreciation for what he calls the "common good."
"I think we're going through this spiritual poverty in our culture when you don't give, when you don't share," Shambaugh said. "We've lost our moral compass."
Amen.

Texto completo: A handful of young women in Roxbury received new holiday dresses Wednesday at the Boys & Girls Clubs of Boston: Yawkey Club of Roxbury.
The girls selected to participate in the event are actively involved in the club's Girls Group, which meets Wednesdays and emphasizes self-esteem. The holiday dresses are rewards for their participation, according to Jennifer Medina, teen advocate at the Roxbury club.
The dresses were donated by local entrepreneur Sam Sisakhti.
“The fact that he's giving away free dresses is amazing," Medina said. “I love the whole idea of it."
Sisakhti has previously made similar donations to Boys and Girls Clubs elsewhere, including Chicago and Bangor, Maine.
He has launched what he calls the “Believe in Yourself" project, intended to build confidence and empower young people.
“I ask each of them what their goal is," Sisakhti said. “Then I say, 'If that's your goal, what's your plan to reach that?"'
Longtime member of the Yawkey Club Nia Simpson, 16, says she needs a dress for a Sweet 16 party. She said she was excited to see the dresses and ask the entrepreneur about what inspired him.
“I think it's great that he's giving back," Simpson said. “I also want to be a fashion designer. It's cool because you get to express yourself in your work and have kids wear it."
Rachel Rodgers, an associate professor in the Department of Applied Psychology at Northeastern University, attended the Yawkey Club event as a mentor and to speak to the girls about social media and body image.
“One of the reasons that Sam started 'Believe in Yourself' was in response to the rates of body shaming and bullying online," Rodgers wrote in an e-mail. “Social media is highly visual and image-based, and rates of these harmful types of interactions are high."

Texto completo: Opening lucrative season with deal to sell tariff-free to the EU, Nova Scotia has edge that 'is going to hurt'
More than 1,700 fishing boats raced out of Nova Scotia ports before first light Tuesday morning on what is known as Dumping Day -- the opening of Canada's biggest and most lucrative lobster fishery.
It also signals when their U.S. rivals in Maine and Massachusetts will begin to feel the sting of the 8 percent tariff differential created when Canada signed a new trade deal with Europe, leaving American lobstermen to wonder just how much of that valuable market they are about to lose.
During their last six-month season, the two inshore fishing territories off the southwestern coast of Nova Scotia, labeled No. 33 and 34 out of Canada's 45 lobster zones, landed about 33,500 metric tons of lobster that raked in about $493 million in Canadian dollars. To get a sense of scope, the 1,500-boat fleet between Halifax and Digby caught as much lobster during its half-year run as Maine fishermen did in all of 2016.
The powerhouse was closed in September when Canada inked a new trade deal with Europe allowing its exporters to sell tariff-free lobsters to the 28-member European Union, which is still the largest importer of North American lobster in the world despite stiff competition from the lobster-obsessed Chinese. That gives them a huge price advantage over their American counterparts, who must charge EU buyers an 8 percent tariff.
"We know the trade deal is going to hurt, but we don't know how bad," said Annie Tselikis, the executive director of the Maine Lobster Dealers' Association and the head of marketing for Maine Coast, a York lobster wholesaler. "We haven't lost Europe. There are still a lot of relationships at play. Maine companies have been selling lobster to our European friends for years. But there's no way around it; the tariff is going to hurt."
The sting hasn't been felt yet. The trade deal has been in effect for three months, but at the time, the only Canadian lobsters available for sale to Europe were hard-shells that had been in storage. They are pricier than the softer-shelled lobsters that U.S. fishermen land in summer and fall, even with a tariff in place. Now that molting season is over and Maine fishermen are catching lobster as hard-shelled as Nova Scotia's, Canada is poised to cash in on the benefits of its trade deal.
While the Maritimes region reveled in the tradition known as Dumping Day -- when the 5,200 fishermen who haul lobsters in No. 33 and 34 race out of their ports on the first day of the fishing season to "dump" all their traps overboard and lay claim to the best fishing grounds for the rest of the season -- Canadian officials don't yet know how much Canada stands to gain from its new trade deal.
"It is too early to determine its impact on Canada's lobster exports to Europe," said Carole Saindon, of the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans. "That said, this agreement allows for Canadian fish and seafood exports to gain increased access through reduced tariffs."
We do know there is a lot of money to be made. In 2016, the EU imported almost $300 million worth of lobsters from North America, with a little more than half of imports coming from the U.S., according to United Nations trade statistics. The southwest Nova Scotia fishery is opening up just in time to exploit Christmas sales, EU's busiest lobster season. Last December, the U.S. sold $28.3 million in live lobster to Europe, more than twice as much as any other month.
American dealers still are filling airplane cargo holds bound for London, Paris and Madrid with lobster they are buying from both American and Canadian fishermen, Tselikis said. That is something that many outsiders forget, she said -- the Canadian and U.S. lobster markets are closely intertwined, not just by the species of lobster hauled from shared waters, but by a complex network of cross-border sales and shipping.
Despite that price differential, Canada alone could never fill the global demand for lobster, especially around a busy time such as Christmas, when everybody wants to buy lobster over the same two-week period, she said. The demand for lobster to fill sales orders around Chinese New Year also requires the combined harvest of both of the national lobster fleets, and the logistical networks of their dealer networks, Tselikis said.
The effect of the trade deal will be felt beyond the European market, Tselikis said. American lobster dealers who might be losing ground in Europe probably will seek to sell into the Asian market, increasing the supply of American lobsters there and possibly driving down prices -- even in a market where American lobsters don't face any extra trade hurdles, she said. But even there, the weak Canadian dollar makes it tough for U.S. sellers to compete. On Tuesday, $1 Canadian equalled 78 cents U.S.
Dealers such as Tselikis are loathe to speculate about how a new wrinkle in a market as complicated as international lobster sales may play out. With so many variables to factor in, including weather, the size of the U.S. and Canadian harvest and international events that can drive consumer taste for what is still a celebratory meal, it can be really hard for even a player such as Tselikis to calculate the effect of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, or CETA.
"It is definitely going to have an impact on the supply chain, but how that will manifest itself is hard to say," Tselikis said. "But I know we are only just now going to feel it."

Texto completo: 79% of chapter's members trained for jobs, employed
WATERVILLE -- The local branch of an international organization that helps people with mental illness train for, get and hold down jobs not only has met its international standard, it has exceeded them.
The High Hopes Clubhouse, at 26 College Ave., recently was recognized by Clubhouse International as a chapter of distinction among the more than 320 such clubhouses in 34 countries for having 79 percent of its active members employed.
The Waterville club was formed 20 years ago to provide training, education, jobs and social connections to those with severe and persistent mental illness. While the standard set for the clubs internationally is that at least 20 percent of average daily membership work, 79 percent of High Hopes' 150 active members are employed.
A program of Kennebec Behavioral Health, High Hopes will celebrate that distinction -- and its 20th anniversary -- from 3 to 6 p.m. Friday at an open house. The public is encouraged to attend.
Informational tours, a slideshow, hors d'oeuvres and welcome gifts will be on tap, and visitors will have an opportunity to meet staff and clubhouse members.
The international clubhouse's recent accreditation report says High Hopes is an exceptional clubhouse community, excelling in its compliance with all standards internationally, according to a release from Tina Chapman, development and communications director for Kennebec Behavioral Health.
"The Clubhouse is dedicated to providing a community where members are treated with dignity and respect and (has) given everyone opportunity to be valuable members of their community," the report says.
High Hopes Director Lisa Soucie said Wednesday that she believes the distinction comes as a result of so many employers and others in the community believing in and helping to make the club successful.
"Of course, we were thrilled," she said of the honor. "We always strive to do the best service for our members."
When Soucie travels around the world, people ask why the Waterville club is so strong, she said. She tries to explain that it's about the Maine way of "taking care of our own."
"I tell them it's really about the community and the partnerships," she said. "If we didn't have employers or community folks supporting us, we wouldn't be that strong."
The clubhouse partners with employers to provide transitional employment sites and independent employment sites.
Club staff help train members for jobs at transitional sites including Joseph's Fireside Steakhouse, Mainely Brews, Wendy's, Applebee's and Humane Society Waterville Area. Staff members learn those jobs as well so that if for any reason the club member cannot go to work on a particular day, a staff member goes in his or her place to ensure job coverage.
Transitional sites are located in Waterville and Winslow, so staff members can be there in five minutes, according to Soucie.
Other club members work at independent job sites. In addition to the 150 active club members, 20 or 30 more are new referrals to the Waterville clubhouse, Soucie said.
At the clubhouse itself, members work every day, all day, learning database entry, accounting, lawn care, kitchen work, driving a van and other skills. While some jobs they take in the community are part-time, high-turnover, entry-level jobs, the clubhouse seeks to expand their skills to try to ensure full-time, long-term employment.
"We really want to focus on career goals and livable wages," Soucie said.
There are club members who are working as certified nurse assistants, hospital sterilization technicians and store employees, for instance.
Club members come from as far away as North New Portland, Jay, Skowhegan and Rockland.
Having a job makes a big difference in helping to boost self-esteem and confidence, according to Soucie. Having a job, she said, means being part of the larger community.
"It's really about being a contributing part of the community -- the self-value," she said. "You can see people grow right in front of your eyes"
The recovery that occurs when people go to work and feel wanted, needed and important is transformative, Soucie said.
Soucie started working at High Hopes as a unit coordinator when it opened 20 years ago. The late Jim Schmidt, who helped to develop similar clubhouses all over the world, was her mentor and helped develop the local club. Schmidt, who retired to Rome in 1992 from New York City, was one of the world's leading proponents of the clubhouse model for rehabilitation in the mental health field and was an international expert in employment for people with mental illness.
About 10 years ago, Soucie became director of High Hopes.
Gov. Paul LePage was a member of the club's advisory board when the club opened and also was general manager of Marden's Surplus & Salvage stores at the time. Marden's became the first employer to partner with High Hopes. Since then, 47 club members have gone through the transitional employment program with Marden's, according to Soucie. She said the governor has been invited to Friday's open house, and police Chief Joseph Massey is expected to be there.
High Hopes receives funding from MaineCare, the state Department of Labor's vocational rehabilitation program and grants.
High Hopes has sister clubhouses, Capitol Clubhouse in Augusta and Looking Ahead in Lewiston, which are known to be among the most effective clubhouses in the world, according to Chapman. The three clubhouses serve more than 600 members every year. According to Chapman, statewide organizations recognize the value the clubhouses provide.
NAMI Maine, for instance, presented the clubhouses with the Outstanding Partner Award this month at NAMI's annual meeting. NAMI executive director Jenna Mehnert said the organization was honored to work with the clubhouse staff, adding, "Not only do we respect the work clubhouses accomplish in partnership with peers, we appreciate how willing they are to engage with NAMI Maine staff on various projects."
High Hopes works with government and church officials, police and others to help ensure its success. Those wanting more information about the clubhouses may call 873-2136, extension 2136, or 888-322-2136, or go to the website www.kbhmaine.org.
Founded in 1960, Kennebec Behavioral Health operates clinics in Waterville, Augusta, Winthrop and Skowhegan.

Texto completo: Man claims James Talbot assaulted him when he was 9 in Freeport church
A former Jesuit priest and Cheverus High School teacher who was indicted this week on charges of sexual abuse dating to the late 1990s settled a civil lawsuit in June with a man who claimed the priest sexually assaulted him in a Freeport church when he was 9 years old.
The name of the victim in the criminal case has not been released, but the victim's age and the location and timing of the assaults align with facts revealed in the civil case.
James Francis Talbot, 80, now living in Missouri, has been charged with one count of class A gross sexual assault and one count of class C unlawful sexual contact. He is being extradited from Missouri to Maine to face those charges Friday in Cumberland County Unified Court.
The Freeport Police Department issued a statement Wednesday saying it sought the indictment after receiving a report about abuse and conducting an investigation. The department also confirmed that the victim in the criminal case was a resident and member at St. Jude Church in Freeport when Talbot allegedly molested him between May 1997 and June 1998.
There have been numerous allegations of child sexual abuse against Talbot, both from when he was at Cheverus and when he was at Boston College High School in the 1970s, involving multiple victims. He already has spent six years in prison for a sexual abuse conviction in Massachusetts.
The most recent case, though, is the first time that Talbot has been accused in Maine of misconduct that did not occur at Cheverus High School.
It also serves as a reminder that the damage caused by a widespread culture of sexual abuse by Catholic priests -- exposed by the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporting in the Boston Globe more than a decade ago -- is still coming to light.
The Cumberland County District Attorney's Office did not return several calls for comment. Talbot's defense attorney, Walter McKee, also did not return calls for comment Wednesday.
According to the civil complaint filed last year, Talbot allegedly assaulted a 9-year-old boy on several occasions in early 1998 while acting as a priest at St. Jude Church in Freeport.
The complaint alleged that Talbot used his position in the church, and as a Jesuit and Cheverus teacher, to befriend the boy and his family. The Press Herald does not identify victims of sexual abuse without their consent.
Talbot's accuser said the priest assaulted him while he was receiving religious instruction at the church.
The civil lawsuit named as defendants Talbot, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Portland, Cheverus High School and the Northeast Province of the Society of Jesus.
The victim alleged that the institutions that were responsible for Talbot knew about his "propensity to sexually abuse boys" but did not adequately protect children who came into contact with him. The victim's attorney in the civil case, Mark Randall, did not return calls for comment Wednesday.
Melissa Hewey, an attorney representing Cheverus, said she had no comment on the criminal charges involving Talbot because the alleged acts in this case did not involve a Cheverus student, nor did they occur on school grounds.
The Roman Catholic Diocese of Portland referred all questions to the USA Northeast Province of the Society of Jesus, also known as the Jesuits.
Jesuits are an order of the Catholic Church whose members focus on education and evangelization. They serve the universal church rather than any specific diocese or archdiocese, according to Michael Benigno, a spokesman for the Northeast Province.
In a statement, Benigno said the province was aware of the new charges against Talbot. He said that after Talbot's prison sentence in 2011, he was laicized by the Vatican, which means he is no longer a priest.
He has remained a Jesuit, however, Benigno said, and has been living at the Vianney Renewal Center in Dittmer, Missouri -- a Church-owned facility that provides housing and counseling to priests and former priests, including many who have been suspected or convicted of sexual abuse.
"We understand this to be a painful time, particularly for the individual who has raised these charges," the statement read. "We expect Mr. Talbot to cooperate with legal proceedings and hope that the ensuing trial will afford the victim justice.
"The USA Northeast Province has, and will continue to strive to extend a healing presence to all victims of sexual abuse, while working toward eradicating sexual abuse from the church and the wider society. We will continue to pray for and support this individual and anyone who has been a victim of abuse at the hands of those they should have been able to trust. Any violation of that trust is grave and deserving of justice."
The latest allegations against Talbot come on top of his lengthy history of abuse dating to the 1970s, when he was a teacher and coach at Boston College High. Many of those allegations were reported by the Boston Globe's Spotlight investigative team, whose work was featured in the Academy Award-winning 2015 film "Spotlight." The movie includes references to Talbot's victims.
In a March 2002 article, the Globe report that Talbot coached wrestling and soccer at Boston College High School and that he engaged in a "bizarre habit" of wrestling with students who were in various stages of undress, including wearing only athletic supporters.
Those allegations led to additional victims coming forward. In 2003, 14 men reached a settlement of claims against Talbot totaling $5.2 million.
Two years later, Talbot pleaded guilty to criminal charges of raping and sexually assaulting two Boston College High School students in the 1970s. He was sentenced to five to seven years in prison and then released to the church's rehabilitation facility in Illinois.
Long before the allegations at Boston College High became public, Talbot was transferred in 1980 to Cheverus High School, a Jesuit-run private school in Portland. He taught alongside former longtime track coach Charles Malia, who admitted in 2000 that he had abused boys at the school. Malia has since died.
The Rev. Steven Dawber, Cheverus' president when Talbot was transferred there, worked with Talbot at Boston College High and recommended that he join him at Cheverus. Dawber also was suspected of sexually abusing boys, according to the Globe. He died in 2010.
The Rev. John Keegan, current president of Cheverus High School, has said that the school was unaware of the incidents in Boston when Talbot and Dawber were hired.
It's not clear how widespread Talbot's abuse might have been in Maine, but there were at least two more alleged victims here.
Michael Doherty, a Freeport man, filed a lawsuit in 1997 alleging that Talbot had molested him in the mid-1980s at Cheverus.
Doherty, who has spoken publicly about the abuse, was a teenager at the time and his family had become close with Talbot. They even let him come and go from their home as he pleased.
The case was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount in 2001. A second Cheverus victim also settled a suit involving Talbot, although that accuser did not come forward publicly.
No criminal charges were filed because the alleged abuse fell outside the statute of limitations at that time. Talbot, however, was terminated by Cheverus the next year.

"This is a great opportunity for paddlers of any level to have a cool afternoon on the water followed by a terrific view of the sunset and a Supermoon rising over the river," Roberson said in a press release. "There are few things better than a relaxing float, following the tide, and finishing it off with a great meal with a beautiful view. We're lucky to live in an area where we can enjoy these thing in succession."
Participants should bring headlamps due to the paddle concluding at sunset. Paddlers will need to pay $6 to put in at the Savannah-Ogeechee Canal. Registration for non-members for this special paddle costs $35 per person while Ogeechee Riverkeeper members are invited to join these paddles at no cost. Ogeechee Riverkeeper memberships begin at $35 for individuals.

Fall shrimp harvest
down in South Carolina
CHARLESTON, S.C. - Wildlife officials in South Carolina say the fall white shrimp harvest is down this year.
Grace Edwards with Shem Creek Fisheries told The Post and Courier of Charleston there just aren't many shrimp in the water this fall.
The South Carolina Department of Natural Resources Department said its monitoring of the shrimp catch is hundreds of thousands of pounds below normal.
Jimmy Bagwell with Save Shem Creek Corp. says many trawlers have gone to Georgia and Florida to try to catch shrimp. Others have headed to North Carolina.
The Natural Resources Department said the spring and summer harvest were well above recent averages. Mel Bell directs the Office of Fisheries Management and says warmer than usual water may be the reason for the poor fall harvest.
New England shrimp fishing closed 1 more year
PORTLAND, Maine - New England shrimp will be unavailable to seafood consumers for at least another year as the fishery struggles with environmental changes, regulators decided on Wednesday.
An arm of the regulatory Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission made the decision at a meeting in Portland. New England shrimp fishing historically has been based in Maine and has been shut down since 2013. Scientists have said the shrimp are suffering from warming ocean temperatures and poor survival of young, and prospects for recovery in the immediate future are poor. The Atlantic States panel was tasked with determining if the shrimp population has recovered enough during the moratorium to withstand commercial fishing pressure, and decided that is has not.
"Are we ever going back? I don't know," said Mike Armstrong, a member of the shrimp panel. "Mother nature has a remarkable ability, if we leave some spawning stock in the water, to recover."
The shrimp fishery has traditionally taken place in winter months. An advisory board had recommended reopening the fishery to a limited amount of harvest, but a technical committee wanted to keep shrimp fishing closed.

Texto completo: Men's Basketball
MAINE at GEORGETOWN
Time, site: Tuesday, 8:30 p.m.; Capital One Arena, Washington, D.C.
Records: UMaine 1-5, Georgetown 4-0
Series: First meeting
Key players: Maine -- 5-11 G Aaron Calixte (14.7 ppg, 3.5 rpg, 2.5 apg), 6-6 G Ilker Er (9.7 ppg, 4.8 rpg), 6-7 F Andrew Fleming (8.8 ppg, 4.0 rpg), 6-7 F Ilija Stojiljkovic (6.7 ppg, 6.2 rpg); Georgetown -- 6-10 C Jesse Govan (19.3 ppg, 12.3 rpg), 6-7 F Marcus Derrickson (14.8 ppg, 8.0 rpg), 6-6 G-F Kaleb Johnson (12.8 ppg, 4.3 rpg), 6-4 G Jonathan Mulmore (8.8 ppg, 5.4 apg)
Game notes: UMaine is coming off its most efficient offensive performance of the year, shooting 53 percent from the field and 61 percent from beyond the 3-point arc in Sunday's 78-72 victory at Quinnipiac. Vernon Lowndes Jr., a 6-5 junior guard, saw his first significant action in a Black Bear uniform and paced his team's first win of the winter with 20 points -- on 7-of-7 shooting, including 5-of-5 on 3-point tries -- and nine rebounds. But Georgetown is not Quinnipiac. The Hoyas, now being coached by legendary alumnus Patrick Ewing, are off to an undefeated start sparked by strong play from their big men. Derrickson had 16 points and nine rebounds to lead Georgetown to its most recent win, an 82-76 decision at Richmond. This doesn't loom as a good physical matchup for the undersized Black Bears, as Georgetown as outrebounded its first four foes by an average of 42.8 to 28.3 per game. UMaine is being outrebounded 41.2 to 35.0 through its first six games. This is another "guarantee game" for the Black Bears, who are being paid $85,000 for making the trip to the nation's capital.

Lockwood School to host community health clinic — the former Ronald McDonald Care Mobile

Texto completo: Lockwood School will become the newest option for school-based health care in the Billings area.
St. Vincent Healthcare will convert a former mobile unit into a permanent primary care clinic in the school's parking lot, aiming for a February opening.
The clinic will be open to all, not just students. Officials are still working out hours and operation procedures, but it will likely operate Monday through Friday.
"It's been about six years of trying to find the right approach," said Don Christman, Lockwood's director of special programs.
The school approached several health care providers this year, and talks quickly heated up with St. Vincent.
“With no medical services currently available in Lockwood, as we assessed this, we just felt like it was something that could be a good partnership and was aligned with our mission,” said Director of Operations for St. Vincent Physicians Tim Pellandini. “One thing that we saw with the school is that it’s a great access point.”
The school-based health center model has been lauded by national health groups. Research has shown that in-school care improves attendance, which in turn improves academic performance. One study found that students using in-school clinics were more likely to graduate than their peers who didn't use an available clinic.
Another study found that students with asthma who attended a school with a health center were in class more than students with asthma who attended a school without a health center.
"We're hoping that it cuts down on (students) being gone all day," Christman said.
St. Vincent is still assessing exactly what services will be offered, but Pellandini expected basic primary care services and perhaps limited lab services, like the ability to analyze a strep throat test. More complicated problems would be referred to other medical facilities.
The vehicle was previously the Ronald McDonald Care Mobile, which provided free, mobile dental services to low-income and uninsured children. St. Vincent pulled out of a partnership with the Ronald McDonald House in 2016. The two sides are still negotiating on the vehicle, but Pellandini didn't expect it to be a hurdle to the Lockwood clinic.
He said St. Vincent's experience running the dental unit would help in operating the Lockwood clinic.
“We know how to greet the patient and how to manage the flow of patients in and out of a unit like this from that experience,” he said.
The clinic will be located away from the school's main traffic flow with ample parking space, Christman said. A $75,000 grant from the Montana Healthcare Foundation will help renovate the clinic vehicle.
School-based clinics
Billings Public Schools recently added a second school-based clinic at Medicine Crow Middle School, partnering with RiverStone Health. Billings partnered with RiverStone and Billings Clinic for its first clinic at Orchard Elementary in 2015.
School-based health clinics are a common model in several other states, but have been slow to catch on in Montana.
Missoula established a health center in 2012, and the first of four school-based health centers opened on the Fort Peck Reservation in 2007. Libby schools also have a partnership offering health services in school. The 2013-2014 census from the School-based Health Alliance shows an additional health center in northeast Montana.
States like West Virginia, New York and Maine all have expansive school-based health center networks, and 15 states have competitive grant programs to fund clinics. About half of health centers are in urban areas, but more than a quarter are in rural areas — and a higher percentage of rural students use health centers.
St. Vincent isn't currently looking at more school-based health centers, Pellandini said.
Lockwood hopes to add more on-site mental health care options for students in the future, Christman said.
"We kind of view the school as the center of the community," he said. "We just see this as another extension of what we do."

Texto completo: LEWISTON — Father and son suspects in an Auburn robbery are in the process of being brought back to Maine, authorities said.
Locals John Michaud Sr., 50, and his son, John Michaud Jr., 19, were identified by Auburn detectives as primary suspects in the robbery of a single-family home on Park Avenue on Oct. 12. The homeowner, who apparently interrupted the afternoon robbery, was tied up by two masked men who stole her motorcycle and SUV. The woman, who freed herself, suffered minor injuries, police said.
Warrants were issued for the arrests of the two Michauds on charges of robbery, burglary, criminal threatening with a dangerous weapon, theft, theft-unauthorized use of property and obstructing the report of a crime. Four of the charges are felonies, the most serious punishable by up to 30 years in prison.
Assistant District Attorney Andrew Matulis said Wednesday that the father and son are in the extradition process. He said he didn’t have an estimate on when they were likely to arrive in Maine to answer to those charges.
John Michaud Jr. was arrested in Florida and is in the custody of Jacksonville County Jail, where he faces charges in that state of carrying a concealed weapon, possessing a firearm with an altered or removed serial number and loitering. Matulis said Florida may opt to prosecute him on charges in that state first, which likely would delay his return to Maine.
John Michaud Sr. was arrested by federal officers as a fugitive from justice as well as Maine’s warrant and has been held at Woodford County Jail in Eureka, Illinois, according to Auburn police.
The motorcycle was recovered shortly after the robbery near the victim’s home. The SUV was later found burned.

Lewiston High students win grant to reduce detention

Texto completo: LEWISTON — A group of Lewiston High School students has won a $113,000 grant to create a new position at the high school to decrease detentions and turn discipline into “teaching moments.”
The students, leaders for the 21st Century after-school program, have been awarded the restorative practices grant from the John T. Gorman Foundation, the foundation said Wednesday.
“When I first heard we got the grant, we did a little dance. We’re excited,” said Fadimatou Katou, 18, a senior.
The students started the project two years ago after attending a restorative practices event in Bangor offered by the Maine Youth Action Network. The Lewiston students discovered not all high schools discipline the way their school does.
“We wanted to change our school, to make a difference,” said Bisharo Odowa, 17, a senior. “We never thought it would be this big.”
Fadimatou Katou said she hopes the grant will help change how students are disciplined. “Talk to them more, punish them less, build relationships,” she said.
Restorative practices is a growing trend that involves finding ways to have students learn from their mistakes rather than just receiving punishment.
Odowa said she’s been given detention for being late for school.
“You just sit there. Then nothing happens … you don’t learn anything from what you did,” she said.
Students who are late may have a good reason, she said, but students aren’t heard. “The disciplinary system needs work.”
Lewiston High School Principal Jake Langlais said the grant will allow a restorative practices coordinator to be hired, possibly in the spring, and money for student leadership and staff training.
“We are in a planning year,” he said. “I’m really excited,” he said. “We will take a look at our policies and practices.”
Like a lot of schools, detention is a long tradition at Lewiston High, but it doesn’t work, said Langlais, who was middle school principal last year and started as high school principal this fall.
As he came to the high school “one thing I’ve struggled with is how detention can escalate,” he said. A student gets detention for being late or skipping class. If they skip that detention, they get another detention. It can snowball until the student has an in-school suspension.
“That sequence doesn’t make a lot of sense,” he said. And the student has learned nothing. Students get detention for unexcused tardiness, skipping class, academic dishonesty, classroom disruptions or misuse of hall passes.
Restorative practices is an approach of “how do we instill good decision-making with the kids.” Bad behavior is treated more like a “teaching moment” with guidance to help students understand how to make the right decisions, and will come to it on their own in the future, Langlais said.
A coordinator will bring a different set of eyes to the school, looking at policies and ways things could be done differently to support students, Langlais said.
It’s effective, but time-consuming, which is why a coordinator is needed, he said.
The 21st century students last year researched their school culture and surveyed students. They were invited by the Gorman Foundation to apply for a grant.
Langlais helped them apply for the grant. Jenn Carter, director of the 21st Century program, said students received support from Langlais, Superintendent Bill Webster and Assistant Superintendent and former principal Shawn Chabot.
The John T. Gorman Foundation is committed to improving school performance in Maine, Senior Associate Sara Gagne Homes said in a statement emailed to the Sun Journal.
The foundation has supported similar restorative practice models at Longley and Montello elementary schools in Lewiston, “which has since shown impressive results,” she said. The foundation is thrilled to help restorative practices expand to the high school, she said.
“Sometimes you have to look outside the box to find the solution that works,” Gagne Homes said.

Texto completo: LEWISTON — Oxford County Sheriff Wayne Gallant “absolutely” denies any suggestion that he sexually harassed employees or threatened anyone with termination in connection with any solicitation for sex, his attorney said Wednesday.
And, he is not considering stepping down from office, according to his legal counsel.
On Wednesday Gallant’s attorney, Jim Martemucci of Portland, said his client “absolutely” denies sexually harassing any employees of the Oxford County Sheriff’s Office. “He certainly absolutely denies threatening termination of any employee with respect to any type of sexual allegation or solicitation.”
Martemucci said Gallant, of Bethel, is eager to set up a meeting with county commissioners and their attorney, Bryan Dench, as soon as possible to “talk about this openly and make a joint decision about what is to be done about these allegations.”
The sheriff is under investigation by the Oxford County Commission after reports of two separate complaints of misconduct were made to the county, according to Ray Cote, business agent for Teamsters Local 340, a union that represents 23 sworn officers of the Oxford County Sheriff’s Department.
In one, Gallant is alleged to have sent multiple sexually explicit photographs of himself to a male deputy’s girlfriend and asked that Gallant, the deputy and the woman have sex. When the deputy rebuffed the offer, Gallant is accused of threatening his job, the business agent, Cote said.
In the second, Gallant is alleged to have a typed a message on a cellphone indicating he wanted to perform oral sex on a male employee, and then showed the person what he had typed, Cote said.
The sheriff has admitted to several news outlets that he sent sexually explicit photographs of himself — including one of him in uniform — several years ago to a woman, who he has refused to identify, and acknowledged the same to Oxford County commissioners during a budget meeting last week. He told commissioners sending the photograph “was an adult thing that happened two years ago.”
Martemucci said the photographs sent on Gallant’s private cellphone had nothing to do with subordinates in the Sheriff’s Office, and that the sheriff disclosed information about the photographs to commissioners himself so they wouldn’t be surprised by media reports.
At the time he disclosed the information to commissioners, the county had already begun its investigation, but Gallant has said he was not aware of the investigation.
When word broke of the sexting on Nov. 21, Gallant resigned as president of the Maine Sheriffs’ Association but has maintained his role as sheriff, working regular hours and performing duties as usual.
According to Martemucci, no one on the commission or in county administration has asked Gallant to resign from his post as sheriff, nor is the sheriff considering making that move now.
“He’s considering all his options,” Martemucci said, and “is anxious to find out the status of the investigation.” The attorney said Gallant will need to gather much more information about the investigation before he makes a decision about his status as sheriff.
First elected in 2006, Gallant, who is in his late 60s, is in his third four-year term as Oxford County sheriff and had served as president of the Sheriffs’ Association since January.
Cote said Wednesday that he brought the accusations of misconduct to the commission in early November and then “became so frustrated with the lack of action and lack of cooperation on this issue that I went to the media” last week.
“I was compelled to go public with what I knew, which is what I did,” he said.
Cote, who called Gallant’s actions “reprehensible,” said he’s aware of more instances of sexual misconduct than have been publicly reported, but declined to say how many or what they may involve.
“I’m afraid that too much news coming out about the investigation may dampen any inclination that somebody who has been involved in this will come forward,” Cote said. “It’s extremely embarrassing for someone to come forward and admit that they were sexually harassed. Who wants to admit that?”
Cote said he first learned of the allegations around the first of the month, and started asking around before making a formal complaint with the commission because “I just didn’t believe it.” Two weeks later, “somebody came forward and showed me these pictures,” and he contacted the union’s attorney to formalize action.
Under union rules, Cote has been present with employees as they are being interviewed as part of the investigation, but he declined to say what was discussed and could not say how much longer the investigation may continue.
As the process moves forward, Cote said, “I am hopeful there will be enough people who will step forward to bring forth a recommendation to the governor to remove the sheriff from office, because I don’t think he’ll step down voluntarily.”
Removal would be possible, under Maine law, if the commissioners filed a complaint with Gov. Paul LePage that details how the sheriff is not faithfully or efficiently performing his duties, and it would then be up to LePage whether to remove him from office.
Cote said, “There is no way to justify (Gallant’s behavior). I think he would be doing everybody a favor, himself included, if he stepped down. But I don’t expect that to happen.”
According to Martemucci, Gallant “respects Oxford County and he very much respects the Oxford County Sheriff’s Department and feels very badly that there is current negative publicity happening because of the allegations against him.”

It's not unethical or even 'media bias' for the New York Times to tweet senator's office numbers

Texto completo: It feels strange, and it appears unseemly, but the New York Times did not act unethically when it tweeted multiple Republican senators' office phone numbers Wednesday, urging readers to call in protest of the GOP tax reform bill.
It's not even an act of "media bias," as many on the right have come to understand the term. That is, this isn't a clearly partisan act, cloaked carefully in the thin veneer of "objective journalism."
Tweeting the phone numbers is partisan. It's certainly politically biased. However, this political act didn't come from the paper's news side. Rather, the paper tweeted the phone numbers from its official opinion account, which had been taken over for the day by the editorial board.
"The NYT Editorial Board is temporarily taking over this acct. to urge the Senate to reject a tax bill that hurts the middle class and the nation's fiscal health," the board, which has long been just a bit left of Lenin, announced in a note posted to the opinion account's biography page.
Though it's a departure from the regular order of things for the Times' board to tweet from their opinion account, what they wrote was the normal sort of partisan stuff that opinion sections have been printing for decades.
"Contact [Senator Collins], (202) 224-2523, particularly if you live in Maine, and ask her to oppose the Senate tax bill because it would repeal Obamacare's individual mandate, driving up the cost of health insurance," read the first tweet.
Though this cartoonish characterization of the tax bill deserves a hard eye-roll, it doesn't quite amount to unethical journalistic behavior. The Times followed up with a second note that included a passage from the paper's most recent editorial, which reads, "Senator Susan Collins of Maine has correctly noted that any temporary tax cuts for the middle class would be more than offset by the higher cost of health insurance -- a good reason for her to vote against the bill."
At first blush, this patently political act by the editorial board feels unethical, and even slightly immoral. But it's difficult to articulate a good argument for what, exactly, the paper did wrong. In fact, the more one thinks about it, the less strange it seems.
First, editorial pages engage in political activism all the time. This is not a new development, and it certainly shouldn't come as a surprise for anyone who has been around a newsroom. Every four years, for example, major newspapers endorse presidential candidates. Most aren't shy about it. There's rarely a coy suggestion that the readers ought to support a certain candidate. Most papers come right out and say, "vote for this person."
One could argue that the routine act of endorsing presidential candidates is far more consequential than urging readers to ask that some senators reconsider their respective positions on a looming vote.
This brings us to the second reason as to why the New York Times is in the clear, ethically speaking, when it comes to tweeting Senate phone numbers.
The numbers that the Times highlighted Wednesday are public, as they should be. Senators are answerable to the electorate, and they should be readily accessible. And as it turns out, their office phone numbers are easy to find online. If anything, someone should criticize the Times for assuming its readers are too stupid to find this public information on their own.
More seriously, though, the paper didn't publish anything Wednesday that wasn't already public information.
Where does that leave us?
We can't accuse the Times of sharing private information. We also can't say the editorial board crossed a line by exhorting its readers to engage in political behavior (calling their senators). That's basically what editorial boards do. Sure, the Times pushed the envelope Wednesday, but that's the most that can be said.
What the Times did feels unseemly, and the board likely made things more difficult for its straight news reporters, many of whom are struggling to combat charges they're biased in favor of Democrats. That said, the Times didn't do anything here that can be categorized as journalistically unethical.

Grover Norquist: Tax reform will 'pass,' warns of GOP 'hissy fit'

Texto completo: Washington tax czar Grover Norquist is confident that Republican tax reform legislation will pass in the Senate and eventually be signed into law by President Trump.
The president of Americans for Tax Reform said "it's going to pass. We need 50 votes plus the vice president and I checked with him, he's OK."
And as a result, he warned Republican senators holding out for a better deal to not dig their heels in too deep because they might get left behind.
"Two people can stand over in the corner and go, 'I'm too cool for school. I'm a maverick,'" he said during a panel discussion Tuesday night at Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service the McCourt School of Public Policy.
"When we get to 50 we stop talking to the two guys who are over there. It's like duck duck goose," he said, "and somebody gets left out of the game." Adding he said, "So two people will be left out and saying, 'Hey I thought we were negotiating.' And the answer is, 'We were, but we were also negotiating with the other people and we don't need your votes at this point.'"
Norquist checked through some of the holdouts and said that it appears Maine Sen. Susan Collins and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who voted against Obamacare repeal, will be on board.
Then he turned to the two senators pushing for better rates for small business owners, Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson and Montana Sen. Steve Daines.
He criticized them for making late demands on the negotiators. "They should have turned their homework in on time," he said, noting that the GOP has been talking about tax reform for years.
Norquist then said that the bills provide better rates than currently offered, and not moving on the changes would be a big letdown for some 30 million Americans and voters.
"What we have is awful. The bill, House and Senate, is much better. What they want is much, much better. But to kill better because you didn't get much better leaves you with the worst possible thing. No one going to thank them when they walk down Main Street in any of the towns in their states. The pizzaria will throw stuff at them if they are the guys who got in the way," said Norquist.
He concluded by again predicting victory, even if it's a close one in which some senators decide to throw a "hissy fit and stomping off."

Texto completo: VILLAGE OF MAINE – Marathon County Crime Stoppers is asking for information to determine who struck a power pole guy wire in the village of Maine.
At about 12:35 a.m. on Nov. 22, a pick-up truck was traveling north in the 9900 block of Highway K, when it left the roadway and struck a power pole guy wire on the west side of the roadway.
The truck was described as a late 1990s General Motors regular cab pick-up truck, with an 8 foot box.
The truck was a dark color, and had a lift kit and loud exhaust. It was able to leave the area, going north and sparking.
As a result of the guy wire being hit, the top of the power pole was broke, causing a power outage in the area, and the pole had to be replaced.

Senate to test White House on 20 percent corporate tax rate

Texto completo: The Senate is set to test the White House's commitment to lowering the corporate tax rate to no higher than 20 percent in the next few days, with multiple Republicans planning to offer amendments to the tax bill that would trade a slightly higher rate for bigger tax breaks for families.
Republican Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah announced Wednesday that they planned to offer an amendment that would set the corporate tax rate slightly higher, at 22 percent, in exchange for making the child tax credit refundable against payroll taxes and available to more lower-income families.
Republican Maine Sen. Susan Collins also said she would offer an amendment raising the rate to 21 percent in order to restore some deductions for state and local property taxes.
Such amendments would test what administration officials have long said is one of Trump's few "red lines" regarding the tax bill, namely the 20 percent rate. Trump himself originally favored a corporate rate of 15 percent.
Asked Wednesday at the Capitol about the Rubio-Lee proposal, White House legislative director Marc Short replied, "We like 20 percent corporate." He then downplayed the conflict, saying "it's not a veto question."
Speaking to the Washington Examiner, Rubio said he doesn't believe that Trump would veto a bill with a 22 percent corporate rate.
"I don't think he would veto a tax cut because we're giving tax cuts to working families," the Florida senator said.
In fact, Trump himself appeared to take the threat of a veto off the table in a speech in Missouri Wednesday, telling the crowd that he would sign tax cut legislation that Congress put on his desk.
"I promise you, I will sign it," Trump said. "I will not veto that bill."
Collins suggested to reporters off the Senate floor Wednesday evening that Senate Republicans were not tied to 20 percent.
"I think it's significant that many members believe that we don't need to go all the way to 20 percent in order to spur investment and job creation," she said. She added that CEOs who have lobbied her on taxes have said that there would not be a big difference between a rate of 20 percent and one a few percentage points higher.
Rubio justified settling for a 22 percent rate in a speech on the Senate floor Wednesday afternoon, noting that it would put the U.S. in the same position, relative to its peers, that the 20 percent rate would. And 22 percent would still be lower than the average of developed nations, he argued.
"It's just as pro-growth, it makes us just as competitive -- but it allows us to do the pro-worker reform we so desperately need," he said of trading the slightly higher corporate rate for the child tax credit provision.
Lee and Rubio argued that, by making the credit refundable against payroll taxes as well as income taxes, it would benefit waitresses, truck drivers, and other working people.
"This is not a handout, this is not a welfare benefit," Lee said. "This is money that they're making."
Rubio declined to say directly that he would not vote for the tax bill unless it included his amendment.
"We're working on getting the amendment done," he said. "We'll see what the bill looks like when we're done working on it."
While Rubio said that he hoped that Democrats would support his amendment, even if they voted against the underlying bill, he has only heard expressions of general support for it, not any vote commitments.

Susan Collins will support GOP tax bill in first procedural vote

Texto completo: Sen. Susan Collins, a key centrist Republican from Maine, will vote Wednesday in favor of advancing a bill that would overhaul the tax code, despite the problems she still has with the bill.
Collins told reporters that she is still concerned about the bill's provision to repeal Obamacare's individual mandate penalty, but that she has received assurances from leadership that the Senate will take up a bipartisan healthcare bill known as Alexander-Murray, as well as a bill she introduced that would fund a reinsurance program to reduce premiums.
Republicans think those provisions would help offset the effects of language in the tax bill that would repeal the individual mandate penalty.
"I still would prefer that the individual mandate [repeal] were not in the bill," Collins said. "It's not that I'm a fan of the individual mandate. I don't think we should be fining people who choose not to buy insurance, but it complicates this whole issue and when you pull one piece of the Affordable Care Act out it has an impact on premiums and that's why Alexander-Murray and Collins-Nelson are so important."
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has committed to hold a vote on Alexander-Murray, Collins said, though the way it receives a vote has still not yet been decided. One possible idea was for it to be part of a continuing resolution, she said, adding that the commitment was it would be put on a must-pass bill.
The House has not yet committed to supporting the Alexander-Murray deal that would appropriate funding for two years for cost-sharing reduction subsidies and give states more flexibility on how to implement Obamacare. President Trump has said he would support the measure in exchange for the tax bill including the repeal of the individual mandate penalties that obligate Americans buy health insurance or pay a fine.
A Congressional Budget Office report published Wednesday found that even if Congress passes Alexander-Murray while repealing the individual mandate penalties, 13 million more people will still become uninsured. Republicans have disputed the findings and CBO officials have been working on ways to evaluate how they measure the impact of the individual mandate, though it will not change ahead of the tax vote.
Collins said she had glanced at the CBO report but noted it assumed a baseline with the cost-sharing reduction payments included.
"They're not being paid. They've been suspended by the president," she said. "That's the whole point of the Alexander-Murray bill is to ensure that the cost-sharing reductions are paid. So the CBO letter really truly makes no sense whatsoever."
Collins did not yet say whether she planned to support the passage of the tax bill, and said she had filed several amendments, including an amendment that fixes a provision of the bill that would prohibit public employees from making catch-up contributions to their retirement accounts.
Asked whether she would support the bill only if they included her amendments, Collins replied: "We're doing this one step at a time. Some of these are higher priorities than others."
During the debate over healthcare legislation this summer, Collins joined Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, to vote against a motion to proceed on a bill that would have repealed and replaced portions of Obamacare. She subsequently voted against a "clean repeal" bill that Congress passed previously in 2015 without her support, which former President Barack Obama vetoed at the time.
She voted against the "repeal and replace" bill that Senate Republicans wrote, and voted against a "skinny repeal" bill that included the repeal of the individual mandate. The "skinny repeal" bill ultimately sank when two other Republicans, Murkowski and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, sided with all Senate Democrats to vote against it.
Neither McCain nor Murkowski have publicly indicated whether they will support the motion to proceed on the tax bill.

Texto completo: A Twitter account run by the New York Times urged followers to contact Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and urge her to vote against a tax bill that will get a procedural vote on Wednesday.
The account, @NYTOpinion, said, "Contact @SenatorCollins, (202) 224-2523, particularly if you live in Maine, and ask her to oppose the Senate tax bill because it would repeal Obamacare's individual mandate, driving up the cost of health insurance. #thetaxbillhurts."
Attached were the phone numbers to Collins' offices in her home state and her office in Washington, D.C.
Another tweet sent by the account linked to an editorial printed in the paper Tuesday night. The editorial referred to the bill as "terrible" and urged both Collins and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., to vote against it.
The editorial and subsequent tweets also said readers should attempt to sway some other senators, including Lisa Murkowski, Bob Corker and Jeff Flake, all Republicans, to vote note.
Neither Collins nor McCain have confirmed whether they plan to support the current bill, though after meeting with President Trump on Tuesday, she reportedly said many of her concerns with it are being "addressed."
The biography on the @NYTOpinion account notified followers that the paper's editorial board had taken it over explicitly to advocate against the tax bill.
"The NYT Editorial Board is temporarily taking over this acct," it said. "to urge the Senate to reject a tax bill that hurts the middle class and the nation's fiscal health."
The Washington Examiner requested comment Wednesday from a Times spokeswoman.

Senate votes to advance $1.4 trillion tax cut bill

Texto completo: The Senate voted Wednesday to open debate on a $1.4 trillion tax bill after Republican leaders worked out preliminary deals to the smooth over the concerns of several Republican lawmakers.
The final tally was 52-48, passing strictly along party lines. The vote means the bill is now open to debate and unlimited amendments, several of which are expected to win approval and become part of the base bill.
Debate began shortly after President Trump promoted the GOP tax reform plan in St. Charles, Missouri.
"As President Trump made clear today, fixing our broken tax code is about two things, helping hardworking Missouri families keep more of what they earn and ensuring there are more opportunities and better-paying jobs for every American," Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said after the speech.
The base legislation lowers corporate and individual tax rates while ending many deductions. It also effectively repeals Obamacare's mandate to purchase health insurance by eliminating the fine for not having coverage.
Senate Republicans hope to pass the bill this week.
House Republicans passed their own tax reform bill earlier this year and said Wednesday they plan to go to conference with the Senate to work out a compromise plan between the two chambers, rather than simply endorse the Senate plan.
"We'll pick the best of the provisions when we go to conference," House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, who authored the House bill, told the Washington Examiner.
Final passage in the Senate is not yet assured. Several Republicans remain undecided, including Sens. John McCain and Jeff Flake, both of Arizona.
Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., a staunch deficit hawk, said he is seeking a language that would raise taxes or impose spending cuts if the tax reductions that are part of the legislation lead to an increase in the deficit.
Sens. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., and Steve Daines, R-Mont., are seeking an expansion of tax cuts for small businesses in exchange for their support.
Some of the issues are expected to be resolved with amendments. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said she has filed a list of amendments, including one that would restore a deduction for state and local property taxes but install a $10,000 cap.
One would pay for the restoration of the property tax deduction by raising the proposed 20 percent corporate tax rate to 21 percent. Another would repeal for two years an Obamacare provision that raises the threshold for deducting catastrophic health expenses from 7.5 percent of income to 10 percent of income.
Collins said she will also introduce an amendment that would make the child and dependent tax credit refundable, paying for it with a repeal of the carried interest allowance. And another would restore the ability of public and non-profit employees to make catch-up contributions to their retirement accounts.
"Some of these are higher priorities than others," Collins said.
Collins is among three Republicans who last summer refused to support a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare. But Republican leaders have so far been able to keep Collins on board with tax reform.
In this instance, they offered a healthcare sweetener, promising a vote by the end of the year on a a measure to add additional funding for Obamacare insurers to help cover the most expensive customers in an effort to lower premiums.
"We are working out the details of that," Collins said.
No Democrats voted to begin debate and none are expected to support final passage. Democrats argued Wednesday the bill would explode the debt and provide only temporary tax relief to individuals while providing a large and permanent corporate tax cut.
"This is a disgraceful bait and switch," said Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo.
Democrats contend they would have been willing to negotiate with Republicans but that the GOP cuts were too steep.
Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., called the bill "an affront to fiscal responsibility.

The US's best moguls skier is from Maine, and his sights are set on the Olympics

Texto completo: At the first World Cup moguls skiing event last season in Ruka, Finland, Troy Murphy wore bib No. 27. The top competitors at each event get the low numbers, so 27 put him in the middle of the 56-skier field.
At the last event of the season, he wore bib No. 6. A season of consistent performances helped Murphy, who is from Bethel, Maine, and learned to ski in New England, rocket up the leaderboard.
He is now the top-ranked moguls skier in the United States, and as the qualifying season begins this weekend ahead of the Olympics in PyeongChang, his coach expects even better things.
“I would say he's probably our No. 1 hope right now as we load the plane right after Thanksgiving to head over to Finland," said US moguls coach Matt Gnoza.
Murphy, 25, did not hit the podium last season, but had six top-10 finishes and three more just outside the top 10 in what he called his best season yet.
“We kind of had a mission of cutting that bib number in half each week, and by the end of the season he was No. 6 in the world. And to do that without a podium is pretty phenomenal," Gnoza said. “He didn't quite achieve the podium that we had been working toward, but to become No. 6 in the world without getting one is pretty much next to impossible."
Murphy got into mogul skiing when he was 10 years old after he was spotted riding dirt bikes by Jeff Yingling, who was the head coach of a freestyle skiing team at Murphy's “home" mountain, Sunday River.
“He was riding dirt bikes with us one day, and he figured if you were riding dirt bikes and hitting jumps and stuff like that, you might be a good fit for freestyle, so he kind of suggested I try it," Murphy said.
He progressed from weekend programs to a competitive program at Gould Academy, where his father, Matthew Murphy, worked as an information technology specialist and his mother, Nancy Coleman-Murphy, worked as a nurse. After high school at Gould, he decided he wanted to see how far he could go with freestyle skiing.
“When I started training full-time, I realized how much ground I had to cover, but I made that up very quickly, and I went from not qualifying for the Nor-Am tour one year to qualifying for the North American World Cups the next year, so that was a pretty rapid progression," he said.
He moved his base of operations to Park City, Utah, to work out full time at the US Ski Team's main training center as well as the Utah Olympic Park, where he can practice the jumps that are a hallmark of his moguls skiing even in the offseason on the water ramps.
Jumping accounts for 20 percent of a moguls skier's score — there are two ramps on each run — and it's an aspect of the competition that can distinguish a skier from the field. Murphy takes pride in having two high-level jumps — a back flip with two twists off the top ramp, and a corkscrew 1080 at the bottom jump.
“If you're doing difficult jumps and doing them well, that gives you a huge advantage," he said.
Gnoza said in a judged sport, big jumps make a big difference.
“When Troy enters the course out of the start gate there's only a small section of moguls, and then he kind of announces his presence when he hits that top air. He has one of the biggest jumps in the world that he performs off that top air," Gnoza said.
But a big reason for Murphy's ascension in the world rankings is he has worked to improve every aspect of his skiing.
“His mogul skiing has also improved immensely. His strength has always been his jumps, and now his skiing has caught up to his jumps, and we've kind of got the whole package — the speed, the air, and the turns for sure," Gnoza said.
When he's not skiing or training for skiing, Murphy's interests don't stray far.
“Outside of mogul skiing, my biggest interest is still skiing," he said. “Every year I link up with buddies, and a teammate [Hunter Bailey], and my best friend forever [Blake Wilson], he's like a big-mountain skier, and my buddy Jannick [Fjeldsoe], who is a former mogul skier and now is like a filmer, and we go up to Alaska, in Valdez, and we stay there for like a month. We rent an RV and live in an RV on the side of the road and just rent some snowmobiles and go backcountry ski and have a blast for like a month and we make a little [video] edit out of that."
Punching a ticket to PyeongChang, though, is top priority. He spent the summer and fall training, and said he's skiing the best he ever has.
“I missed Sochi by a spot, so this one for sure, it would be huge. That has been my goal forever, so definitely have my sights set on it and I'm feeling good," he said.

\ Ocwen enters mortgage settlement with 10 states \
\ Embattled mortgage company Ocwen Financial said Friday that it has entered into a settlement agreement with 10 states, including Illinois, Michigan, Georgia, Wisconsin and South Carolina.
Among other things, Ocwen will not take on the servicing of any loans in those states until April 30. It also will hire a third-party auditor to examine its collection practices.
West Palm Beach-based Ocwen (NYSE: OCN) will pay no fines, and it neither admitted nor denied liability. The mortgage servicer continues to negotiate with other states, including Florida.
The five other states involved in the new settlement are Idaho, Maine, Mississippi, Montana and Rhode Island. Indiana and Nevada, meanwhile, are dropping their cases against Ocwen.
In April, Ocwen shares plunged 50 percent after federal and state regulators sued the company.
In a particularly devastating blow, North Carolina led a group of 20 states in barring Ocwen from taking on new business until it proves that it accurately records escrow payments. Meanwhile, echoing years of gripes from borrowers, the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau slammed Ocwen's practices.
While the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an Obama-era creation, is a favorite target of Republicans pointing to regulatory overreach, Ocwen ran afoul of overseers on both sides of the political aisle: Pam Bondi, Florida's staunchly Republican attorney general, also sued Ocwen.
Bondi said at the time that Ocwen fleeced Florida borrowers by "filing illegal foreclosures, mishandling loan modifications, misapplying mortgage payments, failing to pay insurance premiums from escrow and collecting excessive fees."

Bridge project brings noise

Texto completo: kj.calumetpaint.0930: Calumet Bridge at Old Fort Western, Augusta's low bridge, is getting a costly and at some points likely to be noisey repainting job. Should take a couple months, with about 2 weeks of load sandblasting work coming up soon as contractor crew removes the old paint. One lane will be closed but there are 3 on the bridge so not likely to be major traffic tie-ups. Work taking place mostly on underside of the bridge.
Official says new coat of paint will extend life of structure in Augusta
AUGUSTA ï¿½ The steady, pervasive humming noise of large pieces of equipment at work filled the air in all directions Friday around the Calumet Bridge at Old Fort Western.
Workers, out of sight inside a plastic-walled enclosure, blasted steel pellets at the underside of the bridge, removing old paint, probably lead-based.
The crew on the $750,000 project is blasting the worn paint off the 45-year-old bridge, the lowest of the three bridges that cross the Kennebec River in Maineï¿½s capital city, so new ï¿½federal greenï¿½ paint can take its place and help preserve the steel structure.
The paint job is meant to help preserve and protect the steel bridge from the elements and keep it from rusting and wearing our prematurely, according to Devin Anderson, senior project manager of the state Department of Transportationï¿½s bridge program. He said the department anticipates it gets an additional 25 to 30 years out of a bridge when it is painted.
The project is expected to be complete by mid-November, but the noisy part of it ï¿½ taking place right now ï¿½ is expected to wrap up by Wednesday, after which the work is expected to be less noisy.
That timing is fine for Linda Novak, director and curator of Old Fort Western. The historic fort property is just a few feet from the bridge and the work taking place above and below it.
However, Novak said the noise emanating from the nearby work site really hasnï¿½t affected the fort, because this time of year is typically a slow period there. The summer tourist season has passed, and the fort is open only on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays in September. And itï¿½s not yet time for the anticipated influx of leaf-peeping tourists into central Maine, some of whom boost the number of visitors who come to the fort for tours in the fall.
ï¿½If theyï¿½re getting done (with the noisy part of the project) next week, then itï¿½s not going to impact us at all,ï¿½ Novak said.
That doesnï¿½t mean the noise canï¿½t be heard at the fort ï¿½ it can ï¿½ but that hasnï¿½t affected its operations.
ï¿½It sounds like an annoying lawn mower from here,ï¿½ Novak said of the steady hum coming from the work on the bridge.
Anderson said the noise is significant and comes in low tones that tend to vibrate through structures, but the contractor is using roughly 15-foot-high sound wall barriers to help lessen the noise and prevent it from bothering residents of the Inn at City Hall, which sits only feet from the worksite.
ï¿½Itï¿½s a pretty significant noise, but not enough if youï¿½re standing next to it with somebody, you canï¿½t talk to each other,ï¿½ Anderson said. ï¿½We havenï¿½t heard any complaints about the noise, so thatï¿½s a good sign. I was down there the other day and I was happy with the noise. It sounded like the sound wall was pushing the noise away from the housing complex.ï¿½
The noise is from the combination of steel shot that is blasted against the underside of the bridge to remove the old paint, rust and anything else that shouldnï¿½t remain there; and the large vacuum system and air-filtering equipment sitting atop the bridge deck that collects the debris that is blasted off the bridge.
Tarps are hung below the work area to catch any paint that falls off. Because it probably contains lead, an environmental hazard, the old paint and other debris is vacuumed into a recycling system and put into drums that, once filled, are taken to a site that takes hazardous waste for disposal.
Dust and fine particles from the work also is collected and filtered, with an air quality monitoring device on site to make sure the filtered air stays within allowable thresholds.
The new paint to be put on the bridge wonï¿½t be lead-based, which is no longer used. Instead the new paint will be zinc-based, according to Ted Talbot, spokesman for the state Department of Transportation.
Two-way traffic is expected to be maintained throughout the project. The Calumet Bridge has three lanes, and the equipment for the project is in the lane on the upstream side of the bridge, which is closed, as is the sidewalk on that side. That leaves the other two lanes, and the sidewalk on the downstream side, open to traffic and pedestrians crossing the bridge.
When department officials presented information on the project to the Augusta City Council in March, they said they expected the work to start in August.
However, the contractor of the job, Spartan Contracting LLC of Ohio, didnï¿½t start until September.
Novak said that was fortunate timing for the fort, as well. If the work had started in August, it would have been ongoing during the fortï¿½s peak summer season.
Anderson said the contractor could start the job anytime in August or later. The contract specifies the firm will be penalized financially if the work is not completed by Nov. 17.
He said this year the state had about $8 million worth of painting preservation projects done, on 17 bridges.
All but one of them, he said, were painted in the same ï¿½federal greenï¿½ paint color prevalent on bridges. One bridge in Bath was painted more of a blue-gray color, at the request of local officials, Anderson said, so it would be less visible.
Anderson said heï¿½s not sure why most bridges are painted that shade of green.
The contract for the job allows crews to work on the bridge between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m., Monday through Saturday, though Anderson said the company hasnï¿½t been working that late at night.
The much larger Memorial Bridge, just downriver from the Calumet Bridge, was painted in 2012.

Texto completo: kj.calumetpaint.0930: Calumet Bridge at Old Fort Western, Augusta's low bridge, is getting a costly and at some points likely to be noisey repainting job. Should take a couple months, with about 2 weeks of load sandblasting work coming up soon as contractor crew removes the old paint. One lane will be closed but there are 3 on the bridge so not likely to be major traffic tie-ups. Work taking place mostly on underside of the bridge.
AUGUSTA ï¿½ The steady, pervasive humming noise of large pieces of equipment at work filled the air in all directions Friday around the Calumet Bridge at Old Fort Western.
Workers, out of sight inside a plastic-walled enclosure, blasted steel pellets at the underside of the bridge, removing old paint, probably lead-based.
The crew on the $750,000 project is blasting the worn paint off the 45-year-old bridge, the lowest of the three bridges that cross the Kennebec River in Maineï¿½s capital city, so new ï¿½federal greenï¿½ paint can take its place and help preserve the steel structure.
The paint job is meant to help preserve and protect the steel bridge from the elements and keep it from rusting and wearing our prematurely, according to Devin Anderson, senior project manager of the state Department of Transportationï¿½s bridge program. He said the department anticipates it gets an additional 25 to 30 years of life from a bridge when it is painted.
The project is expected to be complete by mid-November, but the noisy part of it ï¿½ taking place right now ï¿½ is expected to wrap up by Wednesday, after which the work is expected to be less noisy.
That timing is fine for Linda Novak, director and curator of Old Fort Western. The historic fort property is just a few feet from the bridge and the work taking place above and below it.
However, Novak said the noise emanating from the nearby work site really hasnï¿½t affected the fort, because this time of year is typically a slow period there. The summer tourist season has passed, and the fort is open only on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays in September. And itï¿½s not yet time for the anticipated influx of leaf-peeping tourists into central Maine, some of whom boost the number of visitors who come to the fort for tours in the fall.
ï¿½If theyï¿½re getting done (with the noisy part of the project) next week, then itï¿½s not going to impact us at all,ï¿½ Novak said.
That doesnï¿½t mean the noise canï¿½t be heard at the fort ï¿½ it can ï¿½ but that hasnï¿½t affected its operations.
ï¿½It sounds like an annoying lawn mower from here,ï¿½ Novak said of the steady hum coming from the work on the bridge.
Anderson said the noise is significant and comes in low tones that tend to vibrate through structures, but the contractor is using roughly 15-foot-high sound wall barriers to help lessen the noise and prevent it from bothering residents of the Inn at City Hall, which sits only feet from the worksite.
ï¿½Itï¿½s a pretty significant noise, but not enough if youï¿½re standing next to it with somebody, you canï¿½t talk to each other,ï¿½ Anderson said. ï¿½We havenï¿½t heard any complaints about the noise, so thatï¿½s a good sign. I was down there the other day and I was happy with the noise. It sounded like the sound wall was pushing the noise away from the housing complex.ï¿½
The noise is from the combination of steel shot that is blasted against the underside of the bridge to remove the old paint, rust and anything else that shouldnï¿½t remain there; and the large vacuum system and air-filtering equipment sitting atop the bridge deck that collects the debris that is blasted off the bridge.
Tarps are hung below the work area to catch any paint that falls off. Because it probably contains lead, an environmental hazard, the old paint and other debris is vacuumed into a recycling system and put into drums that, once filled, are taken to a site that takes hazardous waste for disposal.
Dust and fine particles from the work also is collected and filtered, with an air quality monitoring device on site to make sure the filtered air stays within allowable thresholds.
The new paint to be put on the bridge wonï¿½t be lead-based, which is no longer used. Instead the new paint will be zinc-based, according to Ted Talbot, spokesman for the state Department of Transportation.
Two-way traffic is expected to be maintained throughout the project. The Calumet Bridge has three lanes, and the equipment for the project is in the lane on the upstream side of the bridge, which is closed, as is the sidewalk on that side. That leaves the other two lanes, and the sidewalk on the downstream side, open to traffic and pedestrians crossing the bridge.
When department officials presented information on the project to the Augusta City Council in March, they said they expected the work to start in August.
However, the contractor of the job, Spartan Contracting LLC of Ohio, didnï¿½t start until September.
Novak said that was fortunate timing for the fort, as well. If the work had started in August, it would have been ongoing during the fortï¿½s peak summer season.

Anderson said heï¿½s not sure why most bridges are painted that shade of green.
The contract for the job allows crews to work on the bridge between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m., Monday through Saturday, though Anderson said the company hasnï¿½t been working that late at night.
The much larger Memorial Bridge, just downriver from the Calumet Bridge, was painted in 2012.

Texto completo: LAS CRUCES - Every month, more than 800 animals are dropped off at the front door of the Animal Services Center of the Mesilla Valley. Overcrowding at the shelter — which leads to euthanasia of healthy, savable animals — is of great concern to many animal lovers and advocates in the area.
For more than six weeks, the city-county organization has been without an executive director after Beth Vesco-Mock resigned Aug. 10. As part of the effort to fill the position, a public forum was held Thursday night at the Doña Ana County Government Center, allowing the community to meet and interview the five remaining candidates for executive director.
Over Vesco-Mock's nine-year tenure, the shelter increased the live release rate from 20 percent to 80 percent, still shy of Doña Ana County's goal of achieving no-kill status by the year 2019.
Vesco-Mock has said, and it was stated during the forum, that ASCMV has the highest intake of animals per capita in the nation. Battling that rate while becoming a no-kill shelter is a challenge.
One effort the shelter engages in is rescuing animals, which is moving them to another shelter that can more easily adopt the pet. ASCMV is transporting animals to places as far as Maine, Delaware and Oregon, said Paul Richardson, kennel supervisor, and co-interim director of operations.
However, Richardson noted the organizing, scheduling and maintaining of relationships with rescues is a full-time job often given to shelter workers are already attending to intake and overcroweding concerns.
At Thursday's forum, most of the candidates believe it is possible to reduce the overflow of animals and ultimately make the shelter no-kill by 2019. Three things they agreed on: increase spay and neutering, educate the community on proper pet ownership and reduce the allowed number of intakes by holding pet owners accountable.
Executive director candidate Eduardo Davila, of El Paso, said he believes that goal can be achieved "with an aggressive increase in educating the public, and increasing the spay and neutering" of animals.
Davila, who received his veterinary degree in Mexico, said he believes community involvement would reduce the number of intakes. He said advocates, in volunteer roles, would be in charge of their own neighborhood, knowing owners and pets and to whom to return lost animals.
"If the community and the rescue (efforts) are not involved, and we don't work together, it will be very hard to achieve," he said.
Candidate Scott Halloway from Comfort, Texas, believes he can reach the no-kill goal because he has done it in the past in a shorter period of time. But he said the achievement goes beyond the director but is done by the community.
"We have to increase adoptions and have them in the most unexpected places," Halloway said.
Halloway, who used to be a kennel supervisor, added that the current rescue structure is great, but could be refined. He also said when animal control finds an animal, they won't charge owners but give them a warning and mention that a second offense will cost the owner.
Michel Meunier, a Las Cruces resident and founder of ACTion Programs for Animals, said she believes in a managed intake approach.
To help reach the no-kill goal, the candidate suggests making it less easy for animals to be dropped off at the shelter, encouraging owners to foster the unwanted animal until a permanent home can be found and providing counseling to new pet owners.
"We can save all the savable, treatable animals," she said.
Reducing the convenience of animal drop off is something candidate Jess Montgomery, of New Braunfels, Texas, said she would also do.
Montgomery, who served in Iraq as a vet nurse, said shortening the drop-off times to minimal hours is something that she has seen work.
She said she would also push for massive spay and neuter events. Previously, she's coordinated a monthly event, housed in a warehouse, with volunteer vets fixing animals in large numbers.
These things, Montgomery believes, will help the shelter reach its no-kill goal.
Candidate Clint Thacker, of Layton, Utah, told the audience of about 50 — as well as those who streamed the forum online — that he did not think the no-kill goal would be reached by 2019, but said that would not stop him from trying to reach it.
Thacker, who has a background in animal control, said the biggest obstacle is money.
He said he would apply for a 501 (c) (3) that would allow for ASCMV to apply for grants they are not currently eligible for. He said this would allow for money to come in to fund the initiatives he had in mind.
Some of those include increasing fixings. He also said that animal control officers would return the animal to its home and charge the owner the amount it would be to retrieve the dog at the shelter. This, he said, would save space at the shelter while enforcing owner responsibility.
If the animal is picked up a second time, it would have to be sterilized or a sterilization voucher would have to be purchased, he said.
The candidates, who beat out a pool of 30, were interviewed Friday by the ASCMV Board of Directors.

License suspension rules blasted

Texto completo: Michigan is especially tough when it comes to suspending the driver's licenses of residents unable to pay off court fees and fines, according to a report released this week.
The Legal Aid Justice Center analyzed the driver's license suspension polices of 50 states. Michigan's were among the five harshest.
The report, "Driven by Dollars: A State-By-State Analysis of Driver's License Suspension Laws for Failure to Pay Court Debt," comes a few months after a lawsuit was filed by a separate group against the state, alleging its suspension policies are hurting poor people.
The report looked at various ways that states suspend driver's licenses and found that Michigan had restrictions on multiple levels:
In Michigan, suspending driver's licenses of those who owe courts is mandatory instead of discretionary.
Suspensions are indefinite.
The state doesn't take into consideration financial ability to pay the debt in suspending licenses.
Suspensions apply to traffic infractions and to criminal cases that have nothing to do with driving.
Only four other states have those restrictions: Delaware, Virginia, Maine and Florida, said the report's co-author.
Michigan "has one of the harshest systems," said Angela Ciolfi, director of litigation and advocacy at the Legal Aid Justice Center in Virginia. "Driver's license suspension sets up a vicious cycle.... Those who can't pay lose their licenses and consequently suffer a neverending cycle of debt and incarceration."
She said "the law forces them to choose between driving illegally and forsaking the needs of their families."
In addition to regular fees and fines from courts, Michigan has Driver Responsibility Fees that have brought criticism. On Thursday, state legislators announced a package of bills to discontinue those fees.
"As a (former) prosecutor in Genesee County, I saw every day the awful impact these unfair fees had on Michigan families," Speaker of the House Tom Leonard, R-DeWitt, said in a statement. "Far too many working people who received a ticket and paid their fine were hit with new, impossible surcharges, often costing them their licenses, and then their jobs, and then their ability to ever pay off the mountain of debt.
"These are good people who just want ... to do the right thing, but the government has them trapped in a cycle of failure from which they can never escape. That is not right, and it is well past time we repealed this unjust mistake."
Given that metro Detroit has the largest job sprawl among big metro areas, according to a Brookings Institution report, and limited public transportation, an inability to drive with a valid license can hurt employment prospects.
Adrian Fowler, 31, of Detroit, whose her license was suspended and who was unable to pay her court debt, told the Free Press in May that she was unable to work in a better-paying job in the suburbs to help pay her debts because of unpaid fees. Fowler is part of the lawsuit that Equal Justice Under Law filed in May against Michigan.
The report released this week said that 43 states suspend driver's licenses because of unpaid court debt. Only four require first making an ability-to-pay determination first.
And 14 states, like Michigan, suspend licenses not only for court debt on traffic cases, but for criminal cases. The report found that in just five states, including Michigan, there were 4.2 million people who have their licenses suspended. Texas had the most, with 1.8 million, followed by 1.2 million in North Carolina, 977,000 in Virginia, 146,000 in Tennessee, and 100,000 in Michigan.
A spokesman for Secretary of State Ruth Johnson, Fred Woodhams, told the Free Press on Thursday that "motorists in Michigan who have been ticketed receive multiple notices and opportunities to work with the court to resolve the ticket and any fines prior to license suspension. Courts have wide discretion to work with a ticketed motorist to resolve fines or set up payment plans."
Woodhams added: "Only after a person fails to appear in court or fails to pay a court judgment after repeated notices is the Secretary of State's Office notified and then required by law to suspend a driver's license. According to the study, 43 states and the District of Columbia suspend a license due to unpaid court debt so Michigan is hardly off by itself."
Also, "Secretary Johnson has consistently pushed the Legislature to address the issue of Driver Responsibility Fees (DRF) and long-term DRF debt owed by Michigan motorists."
In a statement Thursday on Driver Responsibility Fees, Johnson said: "I look forward to working with lawmakers to close this painful chapter from Michigan's lost decade. Driver Responsibility Fees are over and above traffic tickets and fines imposed by a court.
"The fees are a costly, double penalty on working families added automatically, without the opportunity for a court to review the circumstances as with normal tickets. Too many Michigan residents now can't drive because of these automatic fees, limiting their ability to find work, and it's starting to hurt local businesses who can't find enough qualified employees."

Texto completo: Schools, sporting teams and other groups looking for a way to raise money have a new fundraising option: Hoffman's Chocolate bars.
The 40-year-old company announced Tuesday that it now sells fundraising boxes of its chocolates.
The boxes contain 36 chocolate bars (1.5 ounces per bar) in three different flavors: milk chocolate, dark chocolate and milk chocolate with almonds.
Each box costs $36 ($1 per bar). The suggested re sale price is $2 per bar.
The boxes can be purchased at all nine of Hoffman's South Florida locations.
Organizations interested in bulk purchases can place orders online at hoffmans.com. Hoffman's is headquartered in Greenacres, where it has a manufacturing facility. The company also has nine South Florida stores and a mobile food truck.

Embattled mortgage company Ocwen Financial said Friday that it has entered into a settlement agreement with 10 states, including Illinois, Michigan, Georgia, Wisconsin and South Carolina.
Among other things, Ocwen will not take on the servicing of any loans in those states until April 30. It also will hire a third-party auditor to examine its collection practices.
West Palm Beach-based Ocwen (NYSE: OCN) will pay no fines, and it neither admitted nor denied liability. The mortgage servicer continues to negotiate with other states, including Florida.
The five other states involved in the new settlement are Idaho, Maine, Mississippi, Montana and Rhode Island. Indiana and Nevada, meanwhile, are dropping their cases against Ocwen.
In April, Ocwen shares plunged 50 percent after federal and state regulators sued the company.
In a particularly devastating blow, North Carolina led a group of 20 states in barring Ocwen from taking on new business until it proves that it accurately records escrow payments. Meanwhile, echoing years of gripes from borrowers, the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau slammed Ocwen's practices.
While the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an Obama-era creation, is a favorite target of Republicans pointing to regulatory overreach, Ocwen ran afoul of overseers on both sides of the political aisle: Pam Bondi, Florida's staunchly Republican attorney general, also sued Ocwen.
Bondi said at the time that Ocwen fleeced Florida borrowers by "filing illegal foreclosures, mishandling loan modifications, misapplying mortgage payments, failing to pay insurance premiums from escrow and collecting excessive fees."

House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy lamented Saturday the Senate's inability to pass a bill overhauling Obamacare, and placed the blame for its failure to do so on "one or two" senators who want to "hold everything up."
"Leadership has done all the battle going in there," McCarthy, R-Calif., told MSNBC of Senate leadership. "To me, it seems one or two individuals wants to hold everything up, and that's the frustration I've had with the history of the Senate, where one individual can hold everything up."
The Senate revived its attempts to overhaul the 2010 healthcare law earlier this month with legislation from Sens. Bill Cassidy, R-La., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. But those efforts collapsed earlier this week when it became clear there was not enough support from Republican senators for the bill to pass.
Republican Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, John McCain of Arizona, and Susan Collins of Maine all came out against the Graham-Cassidy proposal ahead of an expected vote, and others were skeptical of it.
Host Hugh Hewitt asked McCarthy if he thought Trump should replace former Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, who resigned Friday, with someone such as former Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., to "bridge the Susan Collins-Rand Paul gap" at the agency.
But the majority leader suggested that the Senate's inability to pass a healthcare bill lies with the senators serving, not with the Department of Health and Human Services.
"Maybe changing someone in the Senate gets it through the Senate," he said. "It just seems to become a difficulty over in the Senate not just with healthcare, with so many other items as well."
"I think they, I would bring the Senate together and not just about healthcare, but start looking at what America needs, and I'd bring maybe an expert in and know how to build a team," he said of a new leader at the agency.

Texto completo: STORRS -- Remember the Maine? Not quite.
For UConn, it's Remember Wagner. Or Remember Northeastern.
The story of the Huskies' 2016-17 season was all about injuries and a depleted roster. We all know that Mamadou Diarra sat out the entire season with knee issues, while Alterique Gilbert and Terry Larrier suffered season-ending injuries in the third and fourth games of the season, respectively, leading to a 16-17 campaign.
Before Gilbert and Larrier went down, however, the Huskies managed to lose their first two games of the season, both at home, to low majors Wagner and Northeastern.
Can't blame injuries for those losses.
UConn looked disconnected, tentative, a bit rudderless in those two games. So what have the Huskies done this preseason to make sure they are more prepared once the lights go on six weeks from now?
"I think last year, we just never really established who was the leader," said Jalen Adams. "We didn't really have a leader out there. We were all out there on the court, deferring to each other. When things got down, we kind of just folded. This year, we're communicating, figuring out who's who. It's just all building leadership and being able to direct people on the court."
Adams, a junior guard who led the Huskies in scoring and the American Conference in assists last season, certainly looked like one of the team's vocal leaders in its first official practice on Saturday morning. At one point during a drill, Adams castigated his teammates, shouting "This is how you lose games!"
The team seemed to shape up soon after those words.
"Just because of what happened last year," Adams said afterwards, "everybody's working together that much more to not let that happen again."
The Huskies began their season-opening practice Saturday morning the way they have since Jim Calhoun took over the program more than 30 years ago. They began at about 10 a.m. in Guyer Gym, where coach Kevin Ollie put them through a brutal conditioning regimen. Last year, freshman Vance Jackson couldn't even make it through the first practice, physically. This year, there were no such casualties, although sophomore Christian Vital had to go through concussion protocol after taking an elbow to the head on a screen, and freshman Isaiah Whaley sat out the last half of practice with a shoulder injury.
Gilbert, meanwhile, sat out the entire practice. The team is being careful with him and is waiting to get a better brace for his surgically-repaired left shoulder.
Around noon, the practice moved over to the Werth Family Center practice facility, where rebounding was a prime focus, via the program's notorious box-out drill, where teams of three players must get three defensive rebounds in a row or stay on the floor until they do.
"You've got to be pretty tough to get out of that one," Ollie said, before adding with a wry smile, "That was just a little baby one."
UConn lost three frontcourt players -- Steve Enoch, Juwan Durham and Vance Jackson -- to transfer last spring and has replaced them with a group that's got some bulk and muscle but is preciously short on experience -- at least at the high-major, Division 1 level.
Diarra, a redshirt sophomore, as well as Eric Cobb, a 6-foot-9, 280-pound JUCO transfer who began his career at South Carolina, and 6-9, 249-pound David Onuorah, a grad transfer who sat out almost all of last season at Cornell, looked pretty strong off the boards on Saturday morning.
"I feel like rebounding's my niche, so, I've got to be the best in the gym," said Diarra. "That's why I was going so hard. All-around, we have a bunch of athletes. Jump Man (Kwintin Williams), he's pretty athletic. Isaiah's athletic. All-around, I feel like we're good at rebounding."
That's one way to avoid another disastrous start to the season, something the Huskies have been gearing to avoid throughout the summer and will continue to do until their season-opener on Nov. 10 against Colgate.
"I think this preseason, we got together a lot more, we played a lot more pick-up games on our own, not when the coaches scheduled it," Larrier reported. "Just playing with each other, knowing each other's tendencies, I think we're doing a good job with that now and we'll be ready when the season starts."
SPANISH TEST
Diarra said his knees feel great and, in fact, he feels a bit refreshed after not playing at all last season.
He was helped greatly by an eight-day sojourn over to Spain in August, where he played with a collection of fellow college players called Global Sports Academy.
The team, which also featured West Virginia's James Bolden and Wake Forest's Rich Washington, among others, played teams from Barcelona and Madrid.
"I felt like going out there helped me more coming back here, because I had confidence in myself again," he reported. "The first game I was like, 'Alright, I'm in a game again, I've got to get used to it.' In the second game, I was like, 'I'm back now.'"
"It was a great experience," Diarra added. "I really enjoyed it."
CORNELL CONNECTION
Shonn Miller, who played a season for the Huskies in 2015-16 as a grad transfer from Cornell, has been at the past few practices. He's rehabbing a shoulder injury with trainer James Doran.
Miller was a teammate of Onuorah's for two years at Cornell.
"He's got a lot of energy. He'll do whatever it takes for the team to win," Miller said. "That's how it was at Cornell, and that's how it's carrying over so far here."
Miller said he helped advise Onuorah when he was considering transferring to other schools.
"He was kind of like a little brother to me," Miller said. "Watching him grow from where he was when he first came in to now, he made a lot of progress. He bounced a couple of questions off me, wanting to know what it was like and everything. I just told him what my experience was like."
RIM RATTLINGS
UConn is taking it slow with Gilbert, who was also held out of Wednesday's Husky Run (along with Larrier and Diarra).
"We're trying to get a sturdier brace for him right now," said Ollie. "We didn't want him to practice today."
Ollie added that there is no current update on Sidney Wilson's appeal to the NCAAA. Wilson transferred to UConn last month after having taken summer courses at St. John's. At this point, he is considered a transfer and must sit out the entire season, pending his appeal.

Yarmouth senior challenges meet record in winning Festival boys race

Texto completo: BELFAST, Maine -- Luke Laverdiere was speechless in more ways than one after breaking the tape at Saturday's Maine Cross Country Festival of Champions at the Troy Howard Middle School.
The Yarmouth High School senior came agonizingly close to breaking a course and meet record held by Josef-Holt Andrews (15 minutes, 6 seconds), who is now running at Iowa State University.
Laverdiere put down a fast time, pulling away from a tight pack early in the race to win going away in 15:10.86 on the 5-kilometer course.
Laverdiere said he heard public address announcer and meet director Glendon Rand announcing where the race clock was when he approached the finish line and gave everything he had to attempt to break the record.
"I was feeling it the last mile," said a visibly exhausted Laverdiere, who explained that he broke away from the field after a long straightaway a little more than 800 meters into the race.
A record field featured 86 teams, including contingents from every New England state and two Canadian provinces. There were 933 individual finishers and 68 scoring teams.
The runners got a gander at the layout on which the New England championship meet will be held in November.
The out-of-state entries dominated the team competition. The contingent from Concord, New Hampshire, placed three runners in the top 10 and five scoring runners among the top 20 overall to win with 58 points.
East Greenwich High of Rhode Island finished second with 123 points, while another Granite State entry, Nashua North, was third with 139 points. Falmouth was the top Maine team, finishing fourth (156), while Greely of Cumberland Center (246) rounded out the top five.
Bangor was the top northern Maine finisher in ninth place, and Hampden Academy was 10th.
The Rams were powered by the 12th-place finish of junior Gabe Coffey, who completed the race in 16:08.93 in spite of some early trouble.
"I fell at the beginning so I had to regain position," said Coffey, who didn't let the early tumble deter him.
Coffey said another runner fell right in front of him just after runners crested the first hill, and he had no time to react, but was otherwise OK.
"It knocked 10 seconds off my time," estimated Coffey, who set the standard for his North brethren, while Hampden's Wyatt Lord finished three spots behind in 15th.
"I didn't really know where Wyatt was for half of the race until I caught up to him," Coffey said.
As is typically the case at this midseason invitational, the Festival gave teams and individuals alike a barometer of where they're at as they head toward the homestretch of the season and championship meets in mid-October.
"Unlike other regular-season races I didn't have to think that often, I just looked at the back of their feet and kept on running," said Coffey, who enjoyed competing with the out-of-state runners.
"It just shows you how great [the running community] is," he said.
Coffey added Saturday's field was the fastest with which he's ever run.
Forest Mackenzie and Nate Nichols finished third and eighth, respectively, for Concord, while Oliver Spencer was ninth.
Counting all of the boys and girls races, approximately 1,682 runners finished the race. The first Festival of Champions in 2002 featured 410 combined finishers.
Brendan Penfold of Deer Isle-Stonington was the other North runner to crack the top 20 with his 20th-place effort.

Texto completo: BELFAST, Maine -- For coaches and runners alike, the Maine Cross Country Festival of Champions not only provides Maine schools a taste of out of state competition, but a midseason barometer as postseason races beckon in October.
If Saturday's day of fast running is any indication, the final three weeks of October are going to be fun to watch.
The girls from Camden Hills High School of Rockport proved they are going to be one of the teams to beat in Maine, as the Windjammers placed second and were the state's top entry at the Troy Howard Middle School 5-kilometer course.
Glastonbury High School in Connecticut drove back to the Constitution State as winners, accumulating 115 points while the Windjammers finished with 228.
Cumberland, Rhode Island, which has attended every Festival of Champions since its 2002 inception, was third with 240 points followed by East Greenwich, Rhode Island (278) and Yarmouth (284) rounded out the top five.
Falmouth High School freshman Sofie Matson, who opted to run in the seeded section as opposed to the freshman race, was the only 9th-grader in the seeded field.
She led wire to wire, breaking the tape in 18 minutes, 17.37 seconds.
"I wasn't sure if people were going to go out fast in the beginning or if they were going to run more conservatively," said Matson.
It wasn't exactly a clean start for Matson, who got boxed coming off the line. But she churned to the front of the pack shortly after cresting a small hill shortly after the start of the race and never trailed again.
"The point is just to enjoy racing and have fun," said Matson, who was unwavered by the large field that included runners from 86 high schools from New England and two Canadian provinces.
Camden Hills was powered by sophomore Grace Iltis, who finished fourth overall in the seeded girls race. She ran a personal best in the process.
"It felt really good, this was my first time breaking 19 [minutes] so I was really excited," said Iltis, who was clocked in 18:46.3 and was the top Northern Maine finisher in the deep field.
"I felt really good the whole race."
Iltis and Matson agreed that it was great to get an early peek at the course on which November's New England championship meet will be contested.
Matson cranked through the first mile in about 5:34, and maintained a controlled, strong pace throughout the race.
"I knew I wanted to be out in at least the front of the pack so I just went for it," she said. "At the beginning I was worried [the pack] was going to try to make a move and catch up to me."
Iltis was part of that chase group which also included Sophia Laukli of Yarmouth, who wound up second, Carolyn Todd of Greely, who claimed third, and Kathryn Miller of York, who finished right behind Iltis.
Camden Hills was the lone Northern Maine school represented in the top 10 of the seeded section. Augusta Stockman finished 10th and she and Iltis enabled the Windjammers to take home the runner-up plaque.
"I think it really pushed me and it just really good to be with those girls," said Iltis, who feels her best times are ahead of her.
"I'm really excited, I think I'm going to try to go for a PR at [regionals and states]," she said.
In the freshman section, Karley Piers of Falmouth won going away in 18:57.76.
Piers is the daughter of former Beach to Beacon Maine champion and Maine running standout Sheri Piers.
The unseeded section was won by Haley Labossiere, a sophomore from Burrillville, Rhode Island, in 22:05.40.

Americans enjoying the great outdoors in record numbers

Texto completo: A new report by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service shows that 101.6 million Americans -- 40 percent of the U.S. population 16 years old and older -- participated in wildlife-related activities such as hunting, fishing, and wildlife watching in 2016.
The survey illustrates gains in wildlife watching -- particularly around the home -- and fishing, with moderate declines in the number of hunters nationally. The findings reflect a continued interest in engaging in the outdoors. These activities are drivers behind an economic powerhouse, where participants spent $156 billion, the most in the last 25 years, adjusted for inflation.
The survey, which has been conducted nearly every five years since 1955, shows that the most substantial increases in participation involve wildlife watching -- observing and photographing wildlife. The report indicates that these activities surged 20 percent from 2011 to 2016, from 71.8 million to 86 million participants during that time.
More Americans also went fishing. The report indicates an 8 percent increase in angling participation since 2011, from 33.1 million anglers to 35.8 million in 2016.
Hunting participation dropped by about 2 million participants, but still remained strong at 11.5 million hunters.
Conducted by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, the survey is based on a 22,416-household sample surveyed through computer-assisted telephone and in-person interviews.
The bottom line: Time spent in the great outdoors, whether it be engaging in a sport or simply observing wildlife, just keeps getting more and more popular.
Outdoor news & notes
Mass Wildlife starts stocking 65,000 trout this week in lakes and ponds. If we get some decent rain a few rivers could get a token stocking also. Some 10,000 will be stocked in each district of which Greater Lowell is one. The fish will all be 12-plus inch rainbows .
Bob Simard III of Lowell went to Maine in hopes of bringing home some bear meat. The hunter was more than successful, taking down a 408-pound black bear with his rifle.
Ryan Collins reported on in his blog on Cape Cod that the striped bass fishing is still tremendous there with huge numbers of mostly small fish. These are the 8- to 18-inch bass which tells you the future of the fishery is looking great.
The big cows are outside just waiting for your offering of live lined pogies and mackerel. The fall run has begun and now is the time for a fast 40-pound bass to add to your summer memories.
New Hampshire pheasant hunters were happy to open the season this weekend to the news the state will stock almost 12,000 birds this year. They will stock birds during the season as well. There are some new rules so make sure you check the web before you go.

Outdoors in Maine: Leeman's the name, outdoors writing has been the game

Texto completo: Maine fishing writer Bob Leeman, alias "Mr. Trout," has decided to put away his pen.
Leeman has been writing a fishing column for the Northwoods Sporting Journal for almost two decades. His debut as an outdoor writer was a half century ago, he recalls, when he started writing an outdoor column called Wildlife Corner for a Bangor paper. He thinks that it was the Penobscot Observer.
Over the years, Bob and I have cultivated a friendship. We were just acquaintances before he, a widower, married my son's mother-in-law. Since he and Alice tied the bow, Bob and I have fished together, shared family times together, and hosted a weekly Sunday night radio program together. I also helped him produce his three wonderful fishing books.
No, this is not a eulogy, even if it sounds like one. Bob is still very much alive and, at 87, still fishes his favorite trout streams from his old Radisson canoe with his buddy Bob Cusk.
When he is not on the water, there is nothing, I mean nothing, that Bob would rather do than talk about fishing. He places great value on the fishing heritage and has promoted it by teaching fly tying at church, helping both friends and strangers find the right fly fishing gear, and organizing an annual group pilgrimage to his cherished Grand Lake Stream. I named the group the Wooly Bugger Gang and it stuck.
This non-eulogy is simply a public acknowledgement of a good fishing writer who is still here after all these years, and who still walks with a bounce in his shoes. Through his thoughtful writing and fishing fellowship, Bob Leeman has left his mark in the Maine angling community and now, by his own choice, has elected to quit while he's ahead.
If you meet Bob for the first time, he will smile, shake your hand and invariably say, "Hello, Leeman's the name, fishin's my game." And he is not kidding. Fishing has been his life. Chasing trout is his thing. As a young traveling seed salesman, his spare time away from home on the road was spent -- not in bars -- but on trout streams from Calais to Fort Kent.
He is a consummate fly tier. He has almost as many fly rods and reels as he does new shirts. When Bob was not looking, his wife Alice has given me some of his surplus shirts, which I often wear and flaunt around him intentionally. So far, he hasn't even noticed.
As an editor for dozens of outdoor writers for the Northwoods Sporting Journal, I have learned one thing: we all run out of steam, some before others. Try as I might, I had no success in convincing Bob to give it another year with his fishing column in the Journal, or write an occasional piece when he was inspired.
"Nope," he said, not looking conflicted at all. "It's time to call it a day."
Tight lines always, Mr. Leeman. Column or no column, those of us who know you know that fishing will always be your game. Always.
The author is editor of the "Northwoods Sporting Journal." He is also a Maine guide and host of a weekly radio program -- "Maine Outdoors" -- heard Sundays at 7 p.m. on "The Voice of Maine News - Talk Network." He has authored three books; online purchase information is available at www.maineoutdoorpublications.com.

Catholic Rural Life Festival celebrates gifts of nature

Texto completo: FARMINGTON -- Fermentation increases the health benefits of foods, and everything can be fermented.
A student learns how to ferment during a culinary class presented during the Catholic Rural Life Festival in Farmington.
Those were among the messages shared during a workshop on "The Lost Culinary Arts: Ferments, Tonics and Tinctures," which kicked off the Catholic Rural Life Festival being presented by St. Joseph Parish in Farmington and St. Rose of Lima Parish in Jay.
"This is a carrot. This is the healthiest thing. How could this be more healthy for you? Through the process of fermentation," Daja Gombojav told a group, as they sipped elderberry tea in the St. Joseph Parish Hall.
The festival on Sept. 13 to 17 included workshops, dinners and liturgies designed to highlight the beauty and grace of rural life, and to bring awareness to the call to be stewards of creation.
"I really think it's about showing our presence in the community," said Kathleen Pike, a parishioner from Jay. "It addresses rural life in Maine, and I'm a little bit passionate about that because I think we have a lot to offer in these towns, and I think that church life is part of that, and we can have a better presence."
The festival featured a healthy combination of food and faith. It offered demonstrations on how to make pies, cheese and wood-fired rye bread. It also included benediction, night prayer and special Masses. On Saturday there was a solemn procession and a blessing of the fields at noon and in the evening, a farm-to-table dinner featuring foods from many local farms was served.
Some of the vegetables fermented during the opening day workshop were shared during the dinner. Gombojav, who led the workshop along with KelLee Gray, said people don't realize the health benefits that come with eating fermented foods.
In addition to learning about fermentation, the group tried their hand at it. While they were cutting carrots, celery and other vegetables in the hall, around the corner in the kitchen another group was stirring and straining, as they learned how to make blackberry jelly. The workshop was led by Annamaria Beal, a parishioner from Avon, who learned how to make jelly from her mother and has been doing it for 60 years. She said the keys to success are using fresh berries and getting the timing just right, something she accomplishes by mixing in a little prayer.

Presenters from around the country will offer workshops, addresses and new ideas, many with a special focus on the conference's theme: A Family of Families.
Earlier this year, the Diocese of Portland launched the Joy of the Family initiative to help protect, promote and strengthen marriage and families (www.portlanddiocese.org/joy-of-family).

[bullet] "Do What Matters: Creating Faith Forming Culture for the 21st Century" -- Leif Kehrwald, who has over 30 years of experience in local, regional and national family ministry, will explore five key factors that matter for effective faith formation today: relationships, generations, adults, family/home and digital enablement.
[bullet] "Welcoming the Stranger to Maine" -- Hannah DeAngelis, director of refugee and immigration services for Catholic Charities Maine, will cover a range of topics, including personal stories of refugees in Maine, the refugee resettlement process and how communities can help.
[bullet] "Connecting this Generation with the Eucharist as Source & Summit" -- Kevin Down, doctoral candidate in theology and education at Boston College, will discuss how evangelization works best when we pay attention to this generation's commitment to justice, service, equality and human rights, and make an explicit link between good works and participation in the Eucharist.
[bullet] "Adolescent Thriving ... Not Just Surviving" -- Leif Kehrwald will present a session on exploring the power of developmental relationships in kids' lives and how they can empower youth to thrive, not just survive the turbulent years of adolescence.
[bullet] "The RCIA with Children & Youth: Keeping the Vision" -- Mary Malloy will host a workshop reminding participants of the vision that guides them as they welcome, mentor and celebrate children and youth on the journey to becoming Catholic.
[bullet] "Leading for Change" -- In addition to delivering one of the keynote addresses, Leila Anslinger will host a session exploring the principles of leading and managing change in parishes.
[bullet] "Turn Around and Believe in the Gospel" -- Rory Cooney, a keynote speaker, will use song and Scripture to illustrate the spirituality of liturgy.

Texto completo: Friday night, Jersey Shore pulled away from the L/A Nordiques and spoiled the team's home opener. Saturday the Nordiques returned the favor, posting a 6-1 victory in front of 759 fans at the Androscoggin Bank Colisee.
The offense was sparked by Buxton native Shayne Plummer, who added his fourth and fifth goals of the year in the second period. His nine total points in five games puts him one behind Caleb Labrie for the team lead.
"This year I wanted to have more of a presence from Maine," coach Cam Robichaud said. "I think we have seven or eight right now and there are guys from Lewiston, Greene, Houlton, Jay and Buxton. It's nice we can have kids from all over the state that can play at this level. They are definitely being seen on the score sheet."
It was a faster start for the Nordiques on Saturday. They jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the first ten minutes of the opening frame.
Armand O'Keefe broke the scoreless tied 3:18 into the game for his second goal of the season. Kyle Secor and Lewiston native Cole Ouellette each recorded their second assists of the year. Just past the nine-minute mark, Crewz Berry found the back of the net for the second straight night. Both Connor Kennedy and Lucas Perry each picked up their first assists in a Nordiques uniform.
The Wildcats cut the deficit midway through the period when RC Randall found the back of the cage with Tim O'Connor and Jacob Bennett notching the assists.
Plummer stretched the Nordiques' lead in the second period to 4-1. His first goal of the contest came at the 4:20 mark and his second goal at the 6:40 mark. Ouellette assisted on the first goal which was a power play marker. Patrick Romano notched the assist on Plummer's second goal.
"We talk a lot with our players about shifts after scoring a goal or being scored on," Robinson said. "It can be shift that swings the momentum. So, if you score a goal, you want to maintain that momentum of having a good shift after, and if you are scored on, you must have a good shift to gain the momentum back in your favor."
With 1:19 remaining in the middle frame Andrew McCormick scored on the man advantage for his first goal of the season. Joshua Malone and Clifford Ogle set the goal up.
The Nordiques were 2-for-4 on the power play while Jersey Shore was 1-for-6.
Kyle Secor capped the scoring in the final minute of the contest.
Jay St. Pierre of Jay stopped 19 shots in his second start of the season for the Nordiques while Nick Anastasia and Nicholas Secock combined to make 28 shots on the evening for Jersey Shore.
The Nordiques head back on the road for a matinee contest against the Maine Wild in Biddeford on Wednesday at noon. They travel to Jersey Shore for a pair of games Friday night and Saturday afternoon.

Texto completo: HARRISON -- Boxberry School students have been delving into their new geology learning expedition focusing on rocks and minerals.
Recently the students took a field trip to Maine Mineral Adventures in Woodstock where they sifted through mine buckets on the search for gemstones. Afterward, they headed to Tamminen Quarry in Greenwood to dig on their own.
Students returned with many little treasures including tourmaline, purple lepidolite, and cookeite. Students have also been learning about the rock cycle and how different sedimentary, igneous and metamorphic rocks are formed.
Perrin Gill and Alison Graves sift through material in search of treasure at Maine Mineral Adventures.

Texto completo: The University of Florida and Purdue are among four schools whose football programs could face significant legal scrutiny concerning their handling of head injuries, according to a document filed with a federal court in Chicago on Friday night.
Lawsuits naming the schools’ respective conferences and the NCAA as defendants have been offered as the sample cases for a group of nearly 100 actions seeking monetary damages on behalf of former players who claim they suffered, or are suffering, from the effects of concussions.  Weber State and Pittsburg State, a Division II school in Kansas, are the other universities that may have to go through detailed pre-trial evidence gathering.
The cases stem from a national class-action concussions suit against the NCAA now set to be largely covered by a $75 million settlement that would fund a medical monitoring program for college athletes, as well as research.
However, when U. S. District Judge John Z. Lee gave preliminary approval to the settlement, he allowed plaintiffs to pursue personal-injury claims on a class-action basis as long as those suits didn’t seek a nationwide class or a class consisting of athletes from more than one NCAA school.
MORE: Ex-players sue NCAA, conferences, schools over concussions
MORE: Judge OKs $75M class-action concussions settlement against NCAA
That so far has led to the filing of 96 lawsuits involving schools and conferences from coast to coast in all three of the NCAA’s membership divisions. Nearly all of the cases name the NCAA and a conference as a defendant. When plaintiffs played at a private school or certain public schools in Pennsylvania, the school also was named. When the plaintiffs played at a public school, the school was not named as a defendant because of the potential difficulties related to suing state institutions - but putative classes were based players at the specific school.
For pretrial purposes, all of these cases were assigned to Lee, who also is handling separate and longer-standing individual damages claims that have been made against the NCAA by former Central Arkansas football player Derek Owens and former Maine hockey player Kyle Solomon.  
The prospect of the other 96 cases going forward separately could cause legal chaos. To avoid that while maintaining his intent to not have a nationwide damages class, Lee ordered attorneys representing both plaintiffs and defendants to select sample cases from the 96.  Two chosen by each side would be allowed to proceed while the others were placed on hold.
The idea is to use the sample cases to test the viability of the remaining cases.  The depth of pretrial evidence gathering that could occur will depend on a variety legal maneuvering by the NCAA and the conferences, as well as rulings by Lee.  A status hearing before Lee is scheduled for Oct. 19, court documents say.     
Lawyers for the NCAA and the conferences chose suits filed on behalf of:
►Florida wide receiver Jamie Richardson, who played from 1994 to 1996. The case names the Southeastern Conference as the other defendant, and seeks to represent Florida players from 1952 through 2010.
►Purdue linebacker Mike Rose and tight end Tim Stratton. Rose played from 1996 through 1999; Stratton played from 1998 through 2001, was twice named first-team all-Big Ten Conference and won the 2000 John Mackey Award as the nation’s top tight end. The case names the Big Ten as the other defendant and seeks to represent Purdue players from 1952 through 2010.
Lawyers for the plaintiffs chose suits filed on behalf of:
►The estate and family of Zack Langston, who played linebacker at Pittsburg State, a Division II school in Kansas, from 2007 to 2010. Langston committed suicide in 2014, shooting himself in the chest, according to court filings. The filings also say his brain was sent to researchers at Boston University who found he was suffering from CTE. The case names the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association as the other defendant and seeks to represent former Pittsburg State players, as well as a class of legal dependents of those players.
►Weber State defensive lineman Eric Weston, who played in 1996 and ’97. The case names the Big Sky Conference as the other defendant and seeks to represent Weber State players between 1952 and 2010. According the document filed Friday night, Weston has been diagnosed with “major depressive disorder and a major neurocognitive disorder, frontal lobe impairment. ”
While the plaintiffs said in Friday night’s filing that the four cases selected were representative of the 96 cases as a whole “and not, for example, the best possible case for either side,” the defendants saidthat they believe Weston and Langston “allegedly suffered some of the most severe injuries of any of the named plaintiffs in any of” the 96 cases.
Although Lee’s order in the nationwide case set the stage for the 96 lawsuits to be filed, the order also indicated it will not be easy for the plaintiffs to have their cases certified as class actions. Absent that designation, the cases would apply only to their named plaintiffs.
The record in the nationwide case “does not provide sufficient facts from which the Court can conclude that a class that is much more narrowly defined in terms of size, type of sport, and/or time period could never be certified against a particular school,” Lee wrote. “Nor can the Court conclude from the present record that a very narrowly defined, single-school personal injury class could never be certified against the NCAA. This is not to say that such efforts to certify personal injury claims against even individual schools and the NCAA would not face significant, perhaps insurmountable, hurdles. ”

In a new collection, poet Wesley McNair celebrates a life that arcs toward openness

Texto completo: One day, when he was about 8 years old, Wesley McNair fashioned a "wanted" poster modeled after the ones he observed hanging in the post office in Claremont, the small New Hampshire town where he lived with his mother and two brothers. It featured a childish drawing of his absent father, who had recently abandoned the young family and taken up with another woman. In big block letters below the drawing, he wrote the word "WANTED."
"As soon as I wrote it, I could see how resonant the word was," McNair recalled in a recent phone conversation. "It was my first use of a word with a double meaning. On one hand, I could represent him as a bad guy and please my mother. But it also expressed my grief for him, and my desire for him."
That moment of illumination was long ago, but it kindled a quiet fire that has burned steadily through the decades of McNair's creative life as a respected writer and poet. Now 76 and living in the western Maine town of Mercer, McNair's roots are still deep in his hardscrabble youth. And he still revels in the richness of words and respect for the power and the playfulness of their meanings.
His latest book of poems, "The Unfastening," released earlier this year, maps an emotional adult journey from despair to acceptance. The title itself carries multiple meanings in these short poems, from the loss of deep connection and belongingness through a kind of ecstatic openness to the mystery of life's transitions.
"An unfastening is a kind of opening and a kind of letting go," McNair said. "These are poems about grief and about restoring yourself. These are poems about what life means to me at this age."
As he reflects on the accomplishments of his long career, McNair has plenty of material to work with. "The Unfastening" is his 12th book of poems. He has also published three volumes on the craft of writing poetry and has edited a half dozen anthologies of Maine poetry, short fiction and essays. He has received numerous literary awards and has held fellowships from the Fulbright Program, the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts and the Rockefeller Foundation.
McNair founded and led the highly regarded creative writing program at the University of Maine at Farmington from 1987 until his retirement in 2004. He has taught as visiting faculty at Colby College, Dartmouth College and other campuses, read his poetry twice at the Library of Congress and served five times on the jury for the Pulitzer Prize in Poetry.
And, from 2011 to 2016, McNair was Maine's poet laureate. In this role, and as an extension of his commitment to teaching high school and college students from all backgrounds, McNair sought to demystify poetry and make it more relevant and more accessible to all Maine people, and all people generally -- what he calls "the whole freckled mass of humanity."
"The best poems are after insights into the shared human life. They tell us what life is about, what's in it, what matters in it and how to live our lives," he said. But in order for poems to speak clearly, they should be "so transparent they don't even feel like a poem," even as they speak with a kind of urgency that summons "deep-down, intuitive life. That's the smartest part of you, the truest part."
One way McNair raised the visibility of poetry in Maine was through a weekly poetry column that was published in more than two dozen Maine newspapers from 2011 to 2015. It was called "Take Heart" and featured poems written by poets who lived in or had ties to Maine. The poems from "Take Heart" have been collected into bound anthologies and offered for sale.
McNair's other signature activity during his tenure as poet laureate was the Maine Poetry Express, a statewide schedule of community poetry readings that convened in local churches, Grange halls, schools and other public spaces. McNair hosted the informal events, joined by other established poets and townspeople for readings and discussions of Maine-themed poetry.
"To be a true teacher, you have to find a way of intriguing and enticing everybody," he said. "And it opens your own heart when you do that."
Today, he continues to reach out with the message and the medium of poetry, working with public school teachers in his area to bring the experience of reading and writing poetry to students at every level, making it an integral part of their language arts curriculum. And, with the recent release of "The Unfastening," he's collaborating with faculty and archivists at Colby College, which acquired his papers in 2006, to create an online resource for teachers and others who want a deeper experience of the poems in the book. He expects the website to launch at the end of October.
But McNair, married since his early 20s to his wife, Diane, also continues to mine the richness of his life for new insights and new poems. He finds his inspiration all around him -- in his interactions with his immediate family, as father and stepfather to four adult children and grandfather to five youngsters, his memories of lost loved ones, the dailiness of the community he calls home, the wild and rural landscapes that speak to his heart and the public conversations that spark his imagination and rile his convictions.
McNair feels poets and other artists have an obligation to speak out in times of social and political turmoil.
"Today, more than at any time I can remember, the politicians and the advertisers manipulate the language, using it to lie," he said in an email. "But to write a poem you have to say exactly what's in your heart, come what may. So writing poetry, particularly in the culture we have, is a subversive activity, whether your subject matter is politics or not.
"I worry that I might run out of poems some day -- this is a one-way train, right? -- but it hasn't happened yet," he said. "As long as there are things that are urgent and necessary to say, I'm still in the game."

'The tip of the iceberg:' Bangor field hockey team surging after winless 2016 season

Texto completo: BANGOR, Maine -- Lexi Cunningham and Kahia Maheux have good reason to smile this fall.
The wins had been few and far between for the Bangor High School field hockey team during the seniors' careers. The Rams went 0-14 a year ago.
On Thursday, Bangor pushed its 2017 record to 6-3 with a 2-1 win over Lewiston.
Cunningham and Maheux said they hadn't won six games in their three previous seasons combined.
"It's absolutely amazing. It has been so much fun this year, winning more games. It has been a lot different," said fullback Cunningham.
"I've always loved our teams. Even when we weren't winning, we were still a team and we were still sisters. But it feels amazing to win," said goaltender Maheux. "We're not the bottom of the food chain at the school any more and that feels good. We have worked so hard to get to this point."
"It's very exciting," said seventh-year head coach Kasey (Spencer) Danforth, a former Old Town High School and University of Maine standout.
It has been a work in progress for Danforth and assistant Diann Ramsey.
"Four years ago, we began working with the (Bangor Recreation Department) as well as doing summer camps on our own," explained Danforth. "We did strength and conditioning and skills training for six weeks before the preseason for kids in sixth grade up through high school.
"In winter, they've started to play indoors a little more and we're getting younger kids with sticks in their hands," added Danforth, who pointed out that girls can begin playing field hockey when they are 4 or 5 years old. "We've also gotten it in physical education classes."
As a result, participation has increased.
There are 34 girls in the Bangor High School program, counting varsity and junior varsity. The numbers are also up at the middle school level.
More athletes have meant healthy competition for playing time.
"That has been a piece (to our success). Everybody had had to work really hard to earn a spot," said Danforth.
It also means they are able to play full 11 vs. 11 JV games instead of 7 vs. 7 games. That gives more girls playing time.
Danforth noted that Bangor has more girls playing year-round for the Black Bear Elite club program under the direction and ownership of her former Old Town and UMaine teammate Shaunessy Saucier.
"That has been really helpful," said Danforth.
The nice thing for Danforth and Ramsey is there are only four seniors on the roster. In addition to Cunningham and Maheux, Lily Waddell starts at back and Gina Vo is a reserve.
Maheux shares the goaltending with junior Sabrina Stern and they have combined to hold opponents to one goal or less in six of their nine games.
"We have two great goaltenders," said Cunningham.
Danforth said the pair compete in practice for the next game's start.
Another important ingredient in their turnaround has been the addition of John Bapst High of Bangor transfer Gabby Gonzales. The junior forward is one of the Rams' leading scorers.
Gonzales stamped her arrival in dramatic fashion, scoring the overtime game-winner in the season-opening, 1-0 win over Camden Hills of Rockport.
"She is an amazing forward. She has helped us out so much. It's scary when she takes shots at me," said Maheux.
"They have all been so welcoming. It is a great team to be on," said Gonzales. "It has been a whole new experience for me. And Coach (Danforth) has been awesome. She helps us so much. She really inspires us to play a great game."
Gonzales and freshman forward Meaghan Caron, another of the team's top scorers, work really well together, said Danforth of the speedy duo.
Sophomore Kaylee Perkins also plays up front.
Freshman Kate Ruhlin and sophomore Madison Arno are starting midfielders and sophomore Libby Colley and freshman Rebecca Kull join Waddell and Cunningham in the back.
Danforth said Bangor does a lot of team bonding and that her team always plays hard and stays engaged in the game until the final whistle. That includes the players on the sidelines.
"Even in the Mt. Blue game, no one ever gave up," said Danforth, referring to a lopsided early-season loss to the Cougars from Farmington. "I wouldn't trade that for anything."
The wins have instilled more confidence in the players.
"We have our own personal goals for every game. We want intensity, we want to compete, connect, communicate and we want togetherness," said Danforth.
The Rams have had a more favorable schedule than in recent years and Danforth knows her team is still a ways away from going head-to-head with juggernauts Skowhegan, Messalonskee of Oakland and Mt. Blue.
But they are definitely trending upward.
"There is a lot more work to do," said the 33-year-old coach. "This is just the tip of the iceberg."

Texto completo: A Penobscot County jury on Friday deliberated just 10 minutes before ruling against Ashland's award-winning girls soccer coach in his medical malpractice lawsuit against a Bangor eye doctor.
Peter Belskis of Ashland sued Dr. Curt Young of Bangor in Penobscot County Superior Court in 2014, about 2 1/2 years after Young performed cataract surgery on Belskis' left eye.
Attorneys for Belskis claimed that Young failed to dilate the coach's eye in a follow-up visit on June 15, 2011, so he could not see that the coach was experiencing complications from the surgery. By July 2 of that year, Belskis' retina had become detached. Because of that, Belskis underwent a successful surgical procedure in Portland on July 7, 2011, to repair his retina.
Belskis can still drive and coach soccer, but he does not see as well as he did before his retina became detached, his attorney, David Kreisler, said. Due to his diminished eyesight, Belskis had to quit coaching basketball and now relies more heavily on his assistant soccer coach Holly Chasse to know what is happening on the field during games.
In his closing argument, the coach's attorney asked the jury of five men and four women to award Belskis medical expenses, as well as damages, but did not suggest a dollar amount.
"You must consider how impacted Peter's life has been," Kreisler said.
But Young's attorney, Mark Lavoie of Portland, told jurors Friday that the coach's eye was dilated at the follow-up appointment, according to a notation on Belskis' chart. The coach also signed a consent form containing a warning that a detached retina was a possible side effect of cataract surgery.
Lavoie said that Belskis' sight in his left eye now is 20/40, good enough for him to pass the eye test to obtain a driver's license.
"This gentleman got a good result," Lavoie said of Belskis. "This is a guy who continues to this day to coach and to umpire games. If his sight was that bad, somebody would have fired him by now."
Belskis was "disappointed" but "appreciated the opportunity to tell his story," Kreisler said after the verdict.
In December, Belskis was named New England high school girls soccer coach of the year in the small school division by the National Soccer Coaches Association of America.
Under Belskis, the Hornets went 14-0 during the regular season last year and won the state championship. The Hornets' record this season is nine wins and no losses.

Texto completo: The trip to Stutzman's Farm on a recent balmy fall day was picturesque. Just outside of Dover-Foxcroft on a long stretch of road lined with a newly changing canopy of leaves, the farm which is more than 100 years old appears on the left.
The red farm store was lined with pumpkins, and within ten minutes of opening for the day, customers were filing in, enticed by the aroma of freshly baked bread and piles of corn and squash.
Generation to generation, the farm has changed, morphing to meet the needs of the family at the helm and the customers they serve. From a wholesale potato operation to it's present state as a diversified vegetable farm and cafe, the farm has had many lives.
"Like everything that has happened with this farm, it has always morphed into what someone needs and what someone wants and we've always kind of let it do that," Rainie Stutzman said. "Every season, we're seeing something different happen."
Rainie Stutzman and her husband Sid Stutzman have owned the farm since 1979, when they purchased the farm from Sid Stutzman's mother after his father passed away. As the third generation to own the farm, they revel in having their own children and grandchildren come back during the summers to work and share in the farm life.
But the story of how the farm got its start is also something the Stutzman's are eager to share, with their own family as well as their patrons. Old photos and documents hang proudly on the walls of their cafe.
The first Stutzmans arrived on the farm in the 1920s, by way of lonely hearts correspondence club. John Miller, a widowed Maine farmer, had been running the farm now known as Stutzmans as a dairy farm since the turn of the 20th century. But when he was widowed, he needed to find a wife to help him raise his nine children and run the farm.
Enter Sid Stutzman's grandmother, Mary. A widow herself, Mary Stutzman was living in Franklin, Louisiana, at the time with her five-year-old son, Otto, Sid Stutzman's father. Miller and Mary Stutzman began writing letters to each other after getting in touch through a correspondence club, something Sid and Rainie Stutzman openly call a mail order bride scenario.
Miller, who was 54, sent Mary Stutzman his high school photo and a proposition to come be his wife and share in what he touted as a "huge" farm.
"You think they lie over the internet," Rainie Stutzman said laughing. "This was big time."
Having never traveled before, Mary Stutzman accepted the offer, leaving her house in Louisiana and boarding a northbound train with her son.
She took over as the woman of the farm, and never talked about the circumstances that brought her to Maine.
It was only through neighborly chatter and piecing together documents that they found in her trunk after she died that Sid Stutzman learned how his grandmother and father came to become Maine farmers.
"The funny part about it is, no one ever spoke out about it in our family," Sid Stutzman said. "I was in my 20s before I heard about it and that was from the neighbors. This is a really old neighborhood. It goes back three generations of families all living in the same houses. So everyone knows what your grandfather did and all that stuff."
Despite Miller having nine children of his own, it would be Otto Stutzman who continued the farm for a second generation. Otto Stutzman was the youngest of the children, and upon graduating high school he was the only one who was around to take over the farm after discovering that the his stepfather was considerably behind on the mortgage.
"He was it. If he didn't take over the farm there would have been no one to take over the farm," Sid Stutzman said.
Despite ambitions to become a lawyer, Otto Stutzman stayed in Sangerville and saved the farm his mother had brought him to in 1925. In his time at the helm of the farm, he moved it away from dairy operations, and began growing potatoes for a wholesale market.
It was also during this era, that Stutzman's original roadside stand opened. Sid Stutzman's brother wanted to make money to go the agricultural fairs in the area so he went through the family's garden and stripped vegetables to sell. After a few days, Otto Stutzman realized his son had a pretty good idea and converted a small roadside building into a retail farmstand.
In 1978, Sid Stutzman would find himself in a similar position as his father did when he took over the farm. On the second day of what Sid Stutzman called his dream job, Otto Stutzman passed away.
"It had a pretty good job, but I wanted to see the farm continue," Sid Stutzman said. "[Taking over the farm] was pretty scary. There was a lot of money to foot out, and there's no job security."
Sid and Rainie Stutzman had always worked a lot on the farm, but had never managed it. So before committing to buying the farm outright, they leased it from Sid Stutzman's mother. In 1979, they formally purchased the farm, ensuring that the farm continued in the family for a third generation.
Having grown up just down the road on her family's dairy farm, Rainie Stutzman said she always loved the idea of raising a family on a farm.
"I was always pushing for the farm. I really wanted to raise my kids on a farm," she said. "Whether we know it at the time or not, things made sense."
For nearly 20 years, Stutzman's continued primarily as a wholesale potato farm, selling some diversified vegetables at the small roadside stand the previous generation began. But around the turn of the 21st century, things started changing in Dover-Foxcroft.
The retail stores that Stutzman's had sold its potatoes to for decades had also changed ownership, and demand for a copious potato crop began to decline. Sid Stutzman said orders changed from 2,000 pounds per week to 200.
To protect the farm, the Stutzman's gradually started backing off from the wholesale potato operation, and expanding the other crops they grew. However, customers who had purchased Stutzman's potatoes for years at local stores were still looking to purchase them. So in 2000, the original farmstand was replaced with the larger red building that stands today.
Instead of focusing on solely potatoes, they began adding new crops that were becoming popular with customers such as kale and other greens. They also continued to sell crops that had always been popular with their older customer base, such as turnips, carrots and beet greens.
"In diversifying, we tried to introduce what we thought was going to be the next thing," Rainie Stutzman said. "Tastes change and you have to realize that."
The Stutzman's have two adult sons, one lives in Portland with his family working as a teacher, and the other is a game designer who lives in Seattle, Washington, with a family of his own. Despite not being on the farm, the latest addition to Stutzman's came from the fourth generation.
Prior to moving to Portland with his family, the oldest son pitched the idea of adding a farm cafe to existing farmstand where they could make fresh breads, pizzas and other from-scratch style farm to table offerings. Having a degree in design, he created the design for the structure.
While ultimately it was more financially stable for their son to pursue a career in Portland, the cafe came to life about four years ago and its popularity ever since has exceeded all expectations.
"We really didn't have a lot of experience in that. We just knew what we liked and we were just hoping that people wanted wholesome, made from scratch food," Rainie Stutzman said. "It's been filled up ever since [we opened]."
The cafe is open through November, with a popular brunch featuring live music held on Sundays. This summer, Rainie Stutzman had some additional help running the show, when three of their grandchildren came to stay on the farm.
In talking about the fifth generation of Stutzman's finding secret ponds in the woods and taking pride in their farm-work, Rainie Stutzman's face lights up. She's a proud grandmother and delighted to see that her grandchildren have found their own love for a farm that generations before them have worked to build.
While the grandchildren joke that they'll never let anything happen to the farm, right now, the future of Stutzman's is still up in the air.
With their sons not quite ready to take over the farm, Rainie and Sid Stutzman are trying to figure out how they can age in place and still run the farm while the family works out a more long term plan.
"We see a lot of people retire and do nothing," Rainie Stutzman said. "I don't think farmers do that."

Monday, Oct. 2, 2017: Give workers paid sick leave, smears silence immigration debate, organize relief for Puerto Rico

Texto completo: Give workers paid sick leave
While Sen. Rebecca Millett's bill -- LD 1159 -- requiring employers to provide paid sick days to their employees failed to pass in the Legislature, she helped to jumpstart a conversation throughout the state about the importance of providing the benefit to working people. In Portland, city councilors are considering an earned paid sick leave ordinance in Maine's largest city.
The proposal -- brought forward by the Southern Maine Workers' Center and Maine Women's Lobby -- has already gained the support of Mayor Ethan Strimling and several councilors.
The ordinance would allow workers to earn at least one hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours worked up to six days per year. Employers would not be required to pay employees for their unused time when they leave their jobs.
Nearly 200,000 Maine workers are unable to take a paid sick day, according the National Partnership for Women & Families, and they are forced to choose between coming to work sick or losing their pay -- something that many of them simply can't afford to do. For the rest of us, paid sick days are a public health issue, as we're exposed to the germs of workers in restaurants and other workplaces who are forced to come to work sick.
Earned paid sick leave is already the law in three New England states and more than 20 cities around the country. Portland should be next, leading the way for the rest of Maine to follow.

Smears used to silence debate
In 1966, when President Lyndon Baines Johnson and the Vietnam War enjoyed overwhelming public support, I read Bernard Falls book " Street Without Joy: Indochina at War." Overnight, I became an anti-war activist. My father, a college professor, insisted I had swallowed communist propaganda.
In his autobiography, Colin Powell writes: "I recently reread Bernard Fall's book, 'Street Without Joy' I cannot help thinking that if President Kennedy or President Johnson had spent a quiet weekend at Camp David reading that perceptive book, they would have returned to the White House Monday morning and immediately started to figure out a way to extricate ourselves from the quicksand of Vietnam."
Temporarily ignoring headlines that agitate us, and immersing ourselves in a transforming book, is like dunking your head in a barrel of ice water: it clarifies thoughts and calms emotions.
Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think-tank focused on fiscal and economic analysis of immigration policy, has written an equally profound book, " The New Case Against Immigration: Both Legal and Illegal." It's not a white nationalist rant, and it doesn't provoke animus. It's a thoughtful book that left me stunned by the information missing in our news, not unlike Vietnam.
Trigger warning: The Southern Poverty Law Center, a self-appointed authority on racism, recently smeared the center as a "hate" group. In the 1950s and 1960s, the words "commie" and "pinko" would silence your political opponent without any debate. Today, it's the word "hate."
Don't be deterred. Read the book. And make up your own mind.

Time to organize aid for Puerto Rico
It is my view that the U.S. government should activate every Air Force and National Guard unit on the mainland, while states may be prompted to organize drives of food, potable water and medicine to be taken to air bases in their states.
The donations could be organized by FEMA. The needed supplies could easily be airlifted to Puerto Rico and parachuted into every inaccessible region of the island. This must be done now while there is still time and hope.
We did this during the Berlin airlift of 1948-1949, and today's aircraft are far better than what we then dispatched. Also, we have fleets of KC-135s to refuel these aircraft over open water. What is the delay? The need is imminent and clear. May God bless Puerto Rico and its suffering people.

Put aside politics
Politics is a game the U.S. cannot afford to play, whatever the issues on that particular game board may be (health care, the North Korean nuclear program, immigration, education, employment, and so on). It doesn't matter the issues because just too much is at stake, with the bottom line in all these issues being people, the human element whose value cannot be quantified.
So, senators and representatives, let's get out of the game playing and start rolling up your sleeves to work together, regardless of who is on your team, what label they may bring to the table, or on which side of the table they may be. We need you to work as one team to tackle and come up with some real solutions to the very real problems we all are facing.
That's why we the people elected you and put our faith in you.

Stop sabotaging Obamacare
President Donald Trump and the GOP are playing politics with people's health care. By shutting down the enrollment website 12 hours a week during open enrollment, cutting back the advertising budget and reducing the enrollment period, they are making an effort to sabotage the Affordable Care Act.
As a veteran and a nurse, I find this to be shameful. Mainers shouldn't have to suffer because the GOP's mission is to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
There is always a political side to what is going on, but when you're deployed into a combat zone, you're not thinking about politics, you're trying to do your job and stay alive. I need Rep. Bruce Poliquin to do his job in Washington, D.C., representing Maine veterans like me.
When I joined the military, I swore to protect my fellow Americans. Poliquin took an oath of office to ensure the general welfare of those he represents. That's why I'm demanding that Poliquin represent Maine people and and make bipartisan efforts to stabilize rather than sabotage the Affordable Care Act. These are fixable problems.
If you aren't coming up with a solution you are a part of the problem. Right now, Poliquin is a part of the problem.

'It's sad:' UMaine basketball coach weighs in on NCAA fraud scandal

Texto completo: The federal fraud and bribery investigation that stunned the major college basketball world earlier this week did not come as a shock to Maine's lone NCAA Division I men's basketball head coach.
"I was sad, I was not surprised," said fourth-year University of Maine coach Bob Walsh. "I think you'd have a hard time finding anyone involved in college basketball who could honestly say they were surprised.
"It's been talked about openly, the influence of the sneaker companies over the last 10 years or so. That influence was out in the open, and as far as the money side of it I think people naturally thought that there was money flowing somewhere."
Federal prosecutors announced Tuesday that 10 men -- including shoe company executives, sports agents and four assistant coaches at high-profile NCAA Division I schools -- were charged with using hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes to influence the choice of top recruits' schools, agents and shoe sponsors.
Assistant coaches arrested were from Auburn, Oklahoma State, Southern California, and Arizona, while South Carolina, while the University of Miami and Louisville also have been mentioned in relation to the case and several other schools have started internal investigations.
The most well-known casualty to date is Louisville coach Rick Pitino, who was placed on unpaid leave in the aftermath of the federal announcement and said by his attorney to have been "essentially fired."
Louisville athletic director Tom Jurich also finds his job in jeopardy after having been placed on paid leave by the school.
"I think it's just the tip of the iceberg," Walsh said. "I think when you look at what has been uncovered and hear what has been said, it's natural to think that (federal investigators) have a lot more information and that there's probably more players, coaches and schools involved.
"It's exposing an underbelly that is sad and unfortunate."
Walsh expects little if any direct impact from the case on low- and mid-major basketball programs such UMaine and its America East brethren.
"I don't think what's going on at Louisville or Arizona trickles down to where we are at the University of Maine," said Walsh, whose team next Tuesday opens formal practices for the 2017-2018 season. "I just think there's a huge gap, and the divide has only grown bigger with all the money there is in college athletics between the big schools that want to spend a lot of money on it and the smaller schools that maybe don't have as much invested.
"Fans of college basketball realize that that's the elite level and that and the low- to mid-majors are pretty far apart."
In the latest investigation, federal prosecutors say at least three top high school recruits were promised payments of as much as $150,000, using money supplied by athletic footwear and apparel company Adidas, to attend two universities sponsored by the athletic shoe company. Court papers didn't name the schools but contained enough details to identify one of them as Louisville, the other was Miami.
UMaine's arrangement with New Balance is different than the deals between big-time schools and other companies, according to UMaine athletic media relations spokesman Tyson McHatten.
He explained that New Balance provides UMaine with some of its athletic footwear and apparel, but that the university purchases most of those items from the company out of their respective budgets.
What impact there might be on low- and mid-major programs, Walsh suggested, may have more to do with the public's general perception of college basketball and the recruiting process.
"It affects us in that it's bad for the sport and it's sad," he said. "There are a lot of people you have to get involved with and get to know in recruiting that may not have the best interests of the kids in mind or may be looking for something personal, and I don't mean money but it could be standing or possibly being considered for a job down the road in college, whatever it is.
"Recruiting is filled with a lot of different people. It's not just mom, dad and the high school coach anymore."

The victory, which marked the River Hawks' first win ever against the Great Danes, was also UMass Lowell's first win against a nationally-ranked opponent since moving to Division I. In addition, it was the program's first win in its America East opener since joining the league in 2013.
Lowell is 6-5 overall. Albany is 4-5.
UML freshman Katie Lynes scored the first goal as the River Hawks led 1-0 at the break.
The River Hawks will return to action on Sunday, when they host Maine in an America East contest at 1 p.m. at Wicked Blue Field.

License suspension rules for Michigan blasted

Texto completo: Michigan is especially tough when it comes to suspending the driver's licenses of residents unable to pay off court fees and fines, according to a report released this week.
The Legal Aid Justice Center analyzed the driver's license suspension polices of 50 states. Michigan's were among the five harshest.
The report, "Driven by Dollars: A State-By-State Analysis of Driver's License Suspension Laws for Failure to Pay Court Debt," comes a few months after a lawsuit was filed by a separate group against the state, alleging its suspension policies are hurting poor people.
The report looked at various ways that states suspend driver's licenses and found that Michigan had restrictions on multiple levels:
In Michigan, suspending driver's licenses of those who owe courts is mandatory instead of discretionary, as in some other states.
Suspensions are indefinite instead of time-limited.
The state doesn't take into consideration financial ability to pay the debt in suspending licenses.
Suspensions apply to traffic infractions and to criminal cases that have nothing to do with driving.
Only four other states have those restrictions: Delaware, Virginia, Maine and Florida, said the report's co-author.
Michigan "has one of the harshest systems," said Angela Ciolfi, director of litigation and advocacy at the Legal Aid Justice Center in Virginia. "Driver's license suspension sets up a vicious cycle.... Those who can't pay, lose their licenses and consequently suffer a neverending cycle of debt and incarceration."
She said "the law forces them to choose between driving illegally and forsaking the needs of their families."
In addition to regular fees and fines from courts, Michigan has Driver Responsibility Fees that have brought criticism. On Thursday, state legislators announced a package of bills to discontinue those fees.
"As a (former) prosecutor in Genesee County, I saw every day the awful impact these unfair fees had on Michigan families," Speaker of the House Tom Leonard, R-DeWitt, said in a statement. "Far too many working people who received a ticket and paid their fine were hit with new, impossible surcharges, often costing them their licenses, and then their jobs, and then their ability to ever pay off the mountain of debt.
"These are good people who just want to get to work and drive to school to pick up their children. They want to do the right thing, but the government has them trapped in a cycle of failure from which they can never escape. That is not right, and it is well past time we repealed this unjust mistake."
Given that metro Detroit has the largest job sprawl among big metro areas, according to a Brookings Institution report, and limited public transportation, an inability to drive with a valid license can hurt employment prospects.
Adrian Fowler, 31, of Detroit, whose her license was suspended and who was unable to pay her court debt, told the Free Press in May that she was unable to work in a better-paying job in the suburbs to help pay her debts because of unpaid fees. Fowler is part of the lawsuit that Equal Justice Under Law filed in May against Michigan.
The report released this week said that 43 states suspend driver's licenses because of unpaid court debt. Only four require first making an ability-to-pay determination first.
And 14 states, like Michigan, suspend licenses not only for court debt on traffic cases, but for criminal cases. The report found that in just five states, including Michigan, there were 4.2 million people who have their licenses suspended. Texas had the most, with 1.8 million, followed by 1.2 million in North Carolina, 977,000 in Virginia, 146,000 in Tennessee, and 100,000 in Michigan.
A spokesman for Secretary of State Ruth Johnson, Fred Woodhams, told the Free Press on Thursday that "motorists in Michigan who have been ticketed receive multiple notices and opportunities to work with the court to resolve the ticket and any fines prior to license suspension. Courts have wide discretion to work with a ticketed motorist to resolve fines or set up payment plans."
Woodhams added: "Only after a person fails to appear in court or fails to pay a court judgment after repeated notices is the Secretary of State's Office notified and then required by law to suspend a driver's license. According to the study, 43 states and the District of Columbia suspend a license due to unpaid court debt so Michigan is hardly off by itself."
Also, "Secretary Johnson has consistently pushed the Legislature to address the issue of Driver Responsibility Fees (DRF) and long-term DRF debt owed by Michigan motorists."
In a statement Thursday on Driver Responsibility Fees, Johnson said: "I look forward to working with lawmakers to close this painful chapter from Michigan's lost decade. Driver Responsibility Fees are over and above traffic tickets and fines imposed by a court.
"The fees are a costly, double penalty on working families added automatically, without the opportunity for a court to review the circumstances as with normal tickets. Too many Michigan residents now can't drive because of these automatic fees, limiting their ability to find work, and it's starting to hurt local businesses who can't find enough qualified employees."

DURHAM – The University of New Hampshire football coaches knew the offensive line was going to be a work in progress this season. That's only natural when you lose four talented seniors, return only two guys with significant starting experience, rely on redshirt freshmen and make position changes, including one from the defensive line to the offensive.
There certainly has been progress for the offensive line, although it hasn't been consistent. The line was leaky in the season-opening win against Maine, but played much better the next week at Georgia Southern. After that, however, there was a step back in UNH's 51-26 loss at Holy Cross in Week 3, a game that saw quarterback Trevor Knight running for his life when he dropped back to pass.
The big boys up front bounced back last week against Rhode Island. The Wildcats struggled to run the ball against a URI defense that was determined to stop the ground game, but Knight had enough time to throw for a career-high 420 yards and New Hampshire claimed a 28-14 win.
“They got better, and that's what's got to happen throughout (this season),” UNH Coach Sean McDonnell said. “The kids are working their tails off and they're getting better. They took it personally what happened two weeks ago (at Holy Cross).”
The No. 15/14 Wildcats (3-1) will try to keep getting better on Saturday when they host Bryant (2-2) at 6 p.m.
“We're just trying to find that mesh, that sweet spot, and we're going week to week,” UNH offensive line coach Alex Miller said. “The kids are working hard, but there's never really a perfect time to figure things out because this is New Hampshire and the CAA, so you're either getting everybody's best shot or you're playing a CAA team.”
The two offensive linemen with the most starting experience are senior right tackle Will McInerny (6-foot-7, 299 pounds) and junior left tackle Dane Herron (6-4, 300).
McInerny, who is from Bedford, started 11 games last season and five as a sophomore, although the majority of his playing time before this year was on the interior of the line. Herron started 10 games in 2016, but all of those were at right tackle, and now he's moved to the left side.
Senior Jake Kennedy (6-3, 303) has changed positions as well and is UNH's starting center. The Amherst native played in 16 games over the last two years, but he started just one, so not only is he adjusting to a new spot, he's also adjusting to a starter's weekly grind.
“The week-to-week preparation at that position (center) is very mentally taxing, but he's starting to figure it out,” Miller said of Kennedy. “He's done a great job taking ownership and knowing that it was a big task going into his senior year.”
Redshirt freshman Jack Carroll (6-2, 287) was a defensive lineman last year, but now he's the Wildcats left guard.
“(Carroll) keeps getting better with more reps,” Miller said. “He still hasn't even played a full year of offensive line, so I think he's doing really well.”
Sophomore Nick Velte (6-3, 280) started five games last year and began this season as the starting right guard, but he was injured on the first offensive play of the first game. Redshirt freshman Matt Mascia (6-2, 295) took his place and performed well, but he was injured at the end of the Holy Cross game, so Velte was back in action last week against URI. Those two will continue to compete for a starting spot.
“We're just trying to find a little more consistency, figure out the right guard situation and just continue to get more reps together,” Miller said. “Once we settled on a lineup last year, I thought we got better, so we're hoping the same thing happens this year, even though potentially two of our starters are redshirt freshman. So, that takes a little bit of time, but those kids are playing hard, so it usually works itself out.”
Scouting Bryant
The UNH defense will be challenged on Saturday by a Bryant offense that likes to play up-tempo and uses a wide variety of personnel groupings and formations. The Bulldogs are averaging 32.3 points per game and quarterback Price Wilson, a transfer from Louisiana Tech, ranks third in the FCS in passing yards with 1,419.
Wilson has completed passes to 16 different receivers, underscoring Bryant's offensive depth. Senior wide receiver Matt Sewall has a team-high 21 catches for 268 yards and senior Tom Kennedy has a team-high 304 yards on 15 catches. True freshman Isaac McCray leads the team with 239 rushing yards on 46 carries.
Defensively, Bryant is giving up 42.3 points per game. Maine gashed the Bulldogs, 60-12, one week after UNH had beaten the Black Bears. Bryant is not big on the defensive line (they average 248.3 pounds), so this might be a good week for UNH to work on its running game.
Injury report
The Wildcats will be without linebacker Jared Kuehl (knee) and defensive end Josh Kania (shoulder) for a third straight week. But defensive end Kyle Reisert may see his first action of the season, Mascia will be back and receiver Rory Donovan, who had to leave the Rhode Island game, is expected to return as well. The Wildcats can really take care of some injuries after this game with their bye week coming up.
“It's a huge week for us to get through and get healthy and get to the next level,” McDonnell said. “More importantly, to play to the level that we played in the first two games and the fourth game, play at that level. That's important for us.”

PBA returning to Portland for league event in April
The PBA League will return to Bayside Bowl in Portland next April for the Xtra Frame Maine Shootout and Elias Cup finals.
It will be the fourth straight season that Bayside Bowl has hosted a Professional Bowlers Association event.
The Maine Shootout will be held April 17-19, with a PBA Tour title on the line in the open-entry individual event.
The PBA League's Elias Cup playoffs will be held April 20-22, with qualifying for the team event on Friday, quarterfinals Saturday, and the semifinals and final on Sunday.
The Elias Cup playoffs will be live streamed on ESPN3 and telecast on ESPN over four Sundays.
COLLEGES
FIELD HOCKEY: Olivia Madore and Vonde Saunders scored in the first 10 minutes, and the University of New England downed the Nichols 3-1 in a Commonwealth Coast Conference field hockey game at Dudley, Massachusetts.
Sydney Liptak rounded out the scoring for the the Nor'easters (7-3, 4-1) in the 39th minute, on a feed from Saunders. Erin Jillson scored for the Bison (3-7, 0-6) in the 57th minute.
WOMEN'S HOCKEY: Abby Cleary and Randi Marcon scored second-period goals and ninth-ranked Quinnipiac sent Maine to a 2-1 loss in a season opener at Orono.
Anna Zikova scored for the Black Bears with 1:37 remaining in the first period on a feed from Michelle Weis.
Cleary answered at 3:38 of the second, then helped set up Marcon for the go-ahead goal at 18:13.
Carly Jackson had 20 saves for Maine. Abbie Ives stoped 16 shots for Quinnipiac.
BASKETBALL

Texto completo: LePage calls lawmakers back to Augusta for Oct. 23.
AUGUSTA -- Gov. Paul Le- Page announced Friday that he is calling the Legislature back to the State House for a special lawmaking session set to start Oct. 23.
"I am calling a special legislative session to address two time-sensitive issues," LePage said in a prepared statement. "First we must amend the recently passed 'food sovereignty' law to ensure compliance with federal requirements. The second critical issue is the need to fund the Maine Office of Geographic Information Systems, which was left out of the final version of the budget by the Legislature."
LePage, however, did not mention two high-profile issues: consideration of a bill that allows the state to tax and regulate the recreational sale of marijuana as approved by voters last fall, and legislation that would either repeal or modify another voter-approved law to move Maine to ranked-choice voting.
While the governor can call lawmakers back for specific reasons, he cannot control what State House leaders decide they want lawmakers to work on once they reconvene.
LePage said the state's recently enacted food sovereignty law needs to be amended to make it clear that local food sales subject to inspection under federal jurisdiction remain so, and that any food products intended for wholesale or retail distribution outside of the local municipality must be in compliance with all food safety laws. According to LePage, the changes would allow the state to continue local inspection, rather than compelling federal inspectors to take over.
"We will not be able to continue growing the local food sector of our rural economy by subjecting Maine farms and businesses to inspectors and regulations based in Washington. If the state program is eliminated, small farms will lose the most," Le- Page said.
LePage also contends that the Legislature failed to restore funding to operate the Maine Office of Geographic Information Systems. MEGIS is operating on funds that were carried forward from the previous fiscal year. Some State House leaders have said they believe the office is covered in another portion of the state budget recently enacted.
"If the Legislature does not appropriate money to state agencies to properly fund MEGIS, funding will dry up before November. If this happens, the future of MEGIS and the state's ability to adequately provide GIS services will be in extreme jeopardy," LePage said.

Texto completo: An 18-year-old Biddeford man was killed in a car crash late Thursday night.
An accomplished young bass fisherman died in a single-car crash late Thursday in Biddeford.
Thomas Behen, 18, of Biddeford was driving a 2001 Nissan that crashed in the area of 85 Guinea Road around 11:30 p.m., according to police. Police said it appears speed may have been a factor in the accident, which they are reconstructing to determine the cause.
Behen was alone in his car and no other vehicles were involved, police said.
Jeremie Sirois, the principal at Biddeford High School, said he has known the Behen family for many years and described Thomas Behen as a good student who was "friendly with just about everybody."
"I'd characterize him as a world-class fisherman," Sirois said. "That was his passion."
Behen started fishing at age 2, according to an article about his fishing accomplishments published in 2014 in The Roar, the high school's newspaper. At the time, his biggest catch was a 7-pound largemouth bass. Behen also founded the Bass Fishing Club at the high school.
"You get nervous," Behen told The Roar about his big catches. "Sometimes, you get the cold sweats."
Behen won state fishing championships in 2012, 2013 and 2014. When he was a junior in 2016, he was selected to attend the B.A.S.S. Eastern Regional Fishing Championships on Douglas Lake in Tennessee.
He was the first youth ever on the Maine state team as a youth and non-boater competing in the adult field, according to the Biddeford Center of Technology, where Behen attended the Engineering and Architectural Design program.
Behen graduated from Biddeford High School last June and was attending Southern Maine Community College in South Portland. Sirois said Behen had talked about transferring to a school in a Southern state so he could join a competitive fishing team.
Friends posted remembrances of Behen online, describing him as the type of guy who often cracked jokes to make everyone around him laugh.
Behen was the oldest son of Sean and Erin Behen. He also is survived by two younger siblings. Gillian Graham can be contacted at 791-6315 or at: ggraham@pressherald.com Twitter: grahamgillian

Texto completo: Fishermen and others who make their living from the sea were warned Friday about the increasing threat to some marine life from a large algae bloom in Casco Bay.
Officials at the Maine Department of Marine Resources, which first announced discovery of the bloom Tuesday, said Friday that the risk to immobile marine life from the bloom may be at its peak. The bloom, made up of the phytoplankton Karenia mikimotoi, was first announced to the public Tuesday.
Marine Resources staff members have been monitoring water samples this week and have observed that the bloom's smells and brown-green color are dissipating. But as a phytoplankton bloom degrades, there is more likelihood that the bloom will suck up available oxygen in the water, said Kohl Kanwit, director of the public health bureau of the Department of Marine Resources.
"We wanted people to know about this, to have a backup plan in place," said Kanwit. "A lobster dealer who uses water from the bay could lose all their lobsters."
Such a bloom is not hazardous to humans, but has been associated with fish deaths in Asia, Europe and Alaska. Kohl said that if the bloom does deplete oxygen in the water - known as an anoxic event - fish and other mobile marine life could possibly swim out of the bloom to safety. But immobile marine life, like clams, could be in danger.
An email sent out by Marine Resources Friday to interested parties said that the bloom appears to extend from Cape Elizabeth to the New Meadows River, east of Harpswell. The email also said that large patches of dead soft-shelled clams had been found around Maquoit Bay in Brunswick, and could have been caused by low oxygen.
The die-off of clams in Maquoit Bay could mean a loss of up to about $250,000 for local harvesters, Brunswick Marine Resources Officer Dan Devereaux said Tuesday.
Maine's commercial fisheries were worth $721 million last year, and any threat to marine life could have serious consequences for the state's economy.
Marine Resources officials said this is the first time that a bloom of Karenia mikimotoi had been identified in Maine waters. Ray Routhier can be contacted at 791-6454 or at: rrouthier@pressherald.com

Republican opposition could imperil pot bill

Texto completo: Will LePage be able to hold up the implementation of recreational marijuana with rulemaking delays? We try to figure this out.
Despite months of work by lawmakers on a special committee, a bill that would set in motion the legal sale of recreational marijuana in Maine faces an uncertain future, with a top State House leader who could hold the key to the bill's final passage expressing serious concerns about the legislation Friday.
It's also unclear what action Gov. Paul LePage will take. His office would not comment on whether he will veto the bill, but LePage has repeatedly said he wished U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions would crack down on states that have ignored federal law and voted to legalize recreational marijuana use.
House Minority Leader Ken Fredette, R-Newport, said he's likely to oppose the adult-use marijuana bill, which received a 13-2 endorsement Thursday from a special select committee of the Legislature after nine months of work.
Fredette said the bill lacks flexibility and bundles too many issues into a single law.
"This is an all-or-nothing bill, which makes me uncomfortable," Fredette said. "When you have a bill like this, it makes it easy to find the one, two or three things in the bill you don't like and makes it more likely you will vote against the bill."
Fredette, who leads a conservative House Republican caucus, has been a key player in the Legislature and a staunch LePage ally. If LePage vetoes the bill, the votes in Fredette's caucus likely would be the difference between whether the veto is sustained or overridden. A two-thirds majority of lawmakers is needed to both pass the measure as an emergency bill that would go into effect before January, and to overcome a LePage veto.
If the bill developed by the special committee doesn't pass, then the marijuana ballot question voters approved last November would become law. Advocates for regulation, who supported the bill, say Maine will then be opening itself up for an unfettered black market of marijuana sales that will be unregulated but not necessarily fully illegal.
"It will be the wild, wild West," said state Senate President Michael Thibodeau, R-Winterport.
Thibodeau said he hoped the Legislature would respect the work of the committee and support the bill.
The bill sets up licensing and product safety testing requirements, labeling and packaging rules and other standards designed to create an orderly and regulated market that would also allow the state to collect tax revenue from marijuana sales. While the state's current $7.1 billion two-year budget is not dependent on marijuana revenue, there is little doubt the Legislature, which struggles every two years to create a balanced budget, would welcome the tax revenue generated by marijuana sales, which could reach $220 million by 2020, according to one estimate.
LePage announced Friday that he was calling lawmakers back to Augusta for a special legislative session on Oct. 23. The governor said the reason for that special session was to deal with two issues unrelated to marijuana, but leaders in both the House and the Senate indicated they also intend to move the marijuana bill to their respective floors for debate and possible revision.
A spokesman for LePage would not say whether the governor will veto the bill.
"When a bill hits his desk, the governor will have 10 days to sign it, veto it or let it go into law without his signature," Peter Steele, LePage's communications director, said in an email.
Fredette was more forthcoming.
"Being against recreational marijuana, it's going to be difficult for this bill to find my support," he said. Fredette added that if the underlying ballot box law stands, the Legislature could try to make changes to it "in a more surgical kind of way."
Fredette holds significant sway with his caucus, but not all House Republicans are going to follow his marching orders and some will support the committee's bill.
The Legislature could conceivably pass a bill that would force LePage's hand on rulemaking, but if he then vetoed that bill, it's unlikely that two-thirds of the Legislature would vote to override him.
Republican Rep. Lance Harvell of Farmington, who voted for the marijuana bill Thursday as a committee member, said he would remind his colleagues of the parts of the law passed at the ballot box in November that are most concerning .
"If you don't pass this it's not as if you are repealing marijuana legalization," he said. "Whether you like it or not, if you don't vote for this, you are in effect voting for internet sales, drive-through sales, the age problem that's in the law," among other things. The age problem is a reference to language that allows people under 21 to purchase marijuana.
While an outright repeal of the law passed at the ballot box is possible, it's not clear whether lawmakers are prepared to reverse the will of the voters for a second time in a single year. During the legislative session, they overturned a voter-approved measure that added a 3-percent surcharge to high-income households to help fund education.
Harvell said even Republicans like Fredette could face bruising criticism for eschewing the will of the voters again.
House Speaker Sara Gideon, D-Freeport, said lawmakers should respect and support the work of the committee, which sought to erase some of the largest pitfalls in the ballot-box law.
"I hope my colleagues in the Legislature will support this bill," she said in a statement. "Failing to do so would be irresponsible, as the legislation addresses numerous issues within the existing law."
Assistant House Minority Leader Ellie Espling, R-New Gloucester, said she believed her caucus would be divided on the committee bill, but noted that it was designed to balance a variety of competing industry interests.
"Half of the state hates this," Espling said. "I think we really need to balance the interest of the voters at the ballot box - and that includes those who were adamantly opposed and those who were very much in favor - and those are the two interests we can't forget as we work to balance this thing out."
In November 2016, voters passed the ballot measure by a razor-thin margin (50.2 percent in favor and 49.8 percent opposed), with a recount showing the margin of victory was only 4,400 votes.
Delayed implementation of the law also would delay economic benefits to many business sectors, from construction and real estate to lawyers and other professionals who are preparing to usher an entirely new industry into Maine.
Hannah King, an attorney who sits on the advisory board for Maine Professionals for Regulating Marijuana, a coalition of professionals that supports vigorous regulation of marijuana, said in a statement she's hopeful the Legislature will enact the committee's bill, which she characterized as a "significant improvement" to the law passed by voters.
"Delaying rule-making and the roll-out of a legal commercial market, including legal points of sale for consumers to purchase adult use marijuana, is not only contrary to the will of the majority of voters, it creates a space for the illicit marijuana market to thrive," King said.

Texto completo: Navy Secretary Richard Spencer to visit Bath Iron Works
BATH -- The secretary of the Navy reaffirmed the federal government's commitment to Bath Iron Works on Friday and said the military must work with shipyards to expand capacity as the Navy seeks to grow its fleet.
"We have great faith in Bath - Bath built, best built - and we look forward to this relationship growing and even becoming stronger from a base that is historically monumental," Navy Secretary Richard Spencer said.
Spencer toured BIW for the first time Friday, one day after the Navy announced contracts for two additional destroyers at the shipyard. The contracts provide funding for the fifth Arleigh Burke-class destroyer as part of a five-ship contract awarded to BIW in 2013, as well as for a sixth ship negotiated by the Navy, BIW parent company General Dynamics and Maine's congressional delegation.
Speaking with reporters before his tour, Spencer said the Navy "definitely" needs a larger fleet given the threats facing the nation and the importance of having ships deployed around the globe. With their powerful radar and armament systems, Arleigh Burke-class destroyers provide both offensive capabilities but can also track and destroy short- to intermediate-range ballistic missiles.
"We are not at war because that is a technical (decision) that Congress has to demand, but I will tell you that we are in combat around the globe," Spencer said. "Our uniformed service members and their civilian teammates are fighting on many fronts. These threats, we don't see them diminishing in any way. The Navy-Marine Corps team needs to have these platforms prepared for power projection."
The Navy and Trump administration have called for building toward a 355-ship fleet, up from fewer than 300 ships today. Such an expansion would be costly, however. A recent analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service estimated that a 350-ship Navy would require $3.5 billion to $4 billion in additional funding every year over the 30-year build-out period.
BIW and its competitor shipyard for building Navy destroyers, Huntington Ingalls in Mississippi, are both under intense pressure to hold down costs on Arleigh Burke destroyers that each carry a cost estimated at $1.8 billion. But Spencer said the Navy has a responsibility "to work with our suppliers as a partnership" to reduce costs and ensure the industrial base has the capacity to build more ships.
There are currently six destroyers at various stages of construction in Bath - four Arleigh Burke-class ships and two Zumwalt-class stealth destroyers.
"This is where we are going to be working alongside Bath and General Dynamics ... to see how, in fact, we grow going forward," Spencer said. "We can't simply sit here and mandate, 'We want ships built.' We have to understand what the actual industrial base can support and where capacity is. Where we can help to expand capacity in lockstep with our suppliers, our contractors, we will do so."
Two destroyers built at BIW, the USS Fitzgerald and the USS John S. McCain, were recently involved in collisions that killed 17 sailors. The incidents prompted a systemwide review of culture, training and maintenance in a Navy fleet that experts say is increasingly stretched thin. Spencer said reviews of those incidents are ongoing but that the Navy also is reaching out to the maritime community and private companies for ideas on improving safety.
The Navy awarded the contract to repair the Fitzgerald to BIW's competitor, Huntington Ingalls, a decision that disappointed BIW officials and members of Maine's congressional delegation. Spencer said the Navy is still analyzing where to repair the McCain, which sustained less damage than the Fitzgerald.
"We have not come to a conclusion," Spencer said. "The primary driver though is how can we get it back into the fleet as soon as possible. This is a critical part of the ballistic missile defense system."
With roughly 6,000 workers, BIW is one of Maine's largest private employers and is one of two shipyards that build the guided-missile destroyers that are considered the "workhorses" of the Navy fleet. Spencer addressed members of BIW's workforce later Friday.
All four members of Maine's congressional delegation - Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King and Reps. Chellie Pingree and Bruce Poliquin - joined Spencer at BIW on Friday along with BIW President Dirk Lesko. The delegation members each worked on different aspects of securing authorization or funding for the two additional destroyer awards announced Thursday and thanked Spencer for his personal commitment to finalizing the two contracts.
"That demonstrates the Navy's commitment to BIW and its confidence in its highly skilled workforce," said Collins, a Republican member of the Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee that earmarks money for shipbuilding. "You noticed that the secretary already knows that 'Bath built is best built.' The contracts will help to strengthen our fleet and allow the Navy to promote civility and security in the face of proliferating threats around the globe."
King, an independent who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee, told Spencer that he is always welcome to visit Bath.
"And now that you've established the precedent, bring a couple of destroyers with you," King said. "We'd love to have you." Kevin Miller can be contacted at 791-6312 or at: kmiller@mainetoday.com Twitter: KevinMillerPPH

Texto completo: Natasha Fields arraigned in fatal hit-and-run in Westbrook
Bail was set at $2,500 cash Friday for a woman accused in a fatal hit-and-run in Westbrook on Tuesday.
Superior Court Justice Andrew Horton also ordered that Natasha D. Field, 32, of Standish not be allowed to drive or have car keys in her possession. She is also subject to random searches for the car keys.
Field, who has a history of driving violations, is accused of failing to stop after hitting Sharon E. Crawford, 51, of Westbrook at the intersection of William Clarke Drive and Stroudwater Street. She is charged with leaving the scene of an accident and violating conditions of her release.
Field did not speak during a hearing Friday at the Cumberland County Courthouse in Portland, only nodding yes when asked if she understood the charges against her. During the brief hearing, she leaned with both hands on the railing in front of her and appeared to be chewing gum.
About a dozen relatives of Crawford attended Field's initial court appearance and voiced anger at the low amount of bail.
"Is that for real?" Jennifer Libby, Crawford's niece, said after the hearing. "They should have made the stakes a lot higher for her. She took my aunt's life."
In most cases, $2,500 bail would be considered "substantial" for a charge of leaving the scene of an accident, said David Weyrens, a Portland defense attorney with 16 years of experience. Often someone who is charged with leaving the scene of an accident is released on personal recognizance, or bail is set in the hundreds of dollars, he said.
Weyrens said he believes that the bail set in Field's case, considering the charges against her, "reflect the gravity of the accident." He said there are no legal guidelines on the amount of bail for specific charges and that the judge in each case has wide discretion. The prosecution agreed to the bail.
Field was released on bail early Friday evening, according to staff at the Cumberland County Jail.
Libby said her aunt was going to the market for cigarettes when the crash occurred about 7:15 p.m. Tuesday. She said her aunt always used the crosswalks - although Westbrook police said they are still trying to determine where Crawford was when she was struck - and was familiar with the route.
Libby described her aunt as kind to the point where Libby sometimes had to step in to prevent others from taking advantage of her. Crawford also had mental disabilities that made it hard for those who didn't know her to understand her, Libby said.
Prosecutors said authorities are still waiting for the results of a blood test that Field submitted to after her arrest Tuesday night at a home in Standish.
Police have not said what led them to arrest Field, but Libby said her ex-husband, who lives next to the intersection and heard the crash, said police were interviewing witnesses at the scene Tuesday evening.
Field has no publicly available criminal history in Maine, according to the State Bureau of Identification, but she does have 12 driving infractions, nine of them for speeding, spanning 2006 to 2015.
None involved criminal speeding, which under Maine law is driving 30 mph or more over the speed limit.
Witnesses told police that Field slowed down after striking Crawford, but then sped away.
A 10-year driver history report, which was obtained from the Bureau of Motor Vehicles, shows that Field's driver's license was temporarily suspended in early 2007 and then restored later that year in connection with a 2005 incident that involved leaving the scene of a property damage accident. She was also convicted in 2006 of violating the state's seat belt law and failure to display a valid inspection sticker in 2016.

Two Biddeford men charged with trafficking crack cocaine
Two Biddeford men were charged Friday morning with allegedly selling crack cocaine in the Biddeford area.
Quinton L. Smith, 38, and Courtney Skipworth, 38, were arrested when Maine Drug Enforcement Agency officers served a search warrant on their room at the Sleepy Hollfow Motel around 6 a.m. The MDEA York District Task Force spent the past month investigating Smith.
During the investigation, officials said undercover agents bought crack cocaine from both men on several occasions while they were staying at the Biddeford motel. A search of the room and Smith's 2008 Dodge Charger resulted in the seizure of cocaine, items related to drug trafficking and approximately $16,000 in cash, according to the MDEA.
Smith was convicted of drug trafficking in 2014 and was released from the Maine State Prison earlier this year after serving three years of an eight-year sentence.
Smith was charged with aggravated trafficking in scheduled drugs (crack cocaine), a Class A crime punishable by up to 30 years in prison. Skipworth was charged with unlawful trafficking in scheduled drugs, a Class B crime punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
Smith and Skipworth were arrested without incident and taken to the York County Jail. Bail was set for Skipworth at $50,000 cash. No bail was allowed for Smith.

Five-vehicle crash ties up Casco Bay Bridge traffic
Traffic flow returned to normal on the Casco Bay Bridge late Friday afternoon after a five-vehicle crash tied things up just before the afternoon rush hour.
Police said no one was hurt in the crash, which occurred on the northbound span around 3:30 p.m.
Traffic on the bridge northbound was stopped until about 3:45 p.m., South Portland police said, when one lane was reopened. The second lane reopened about 15 minutes later.
Police said they're not sure what caused the crash. They said the bridge opened around the same time as the crash, but they aren't sure if it occurred just before it opened or just after the span closed and traffic started flowing across the bridge again.

Hannaford announces recall because of listeria threat
Hannaford supermarkets announced Friday a manufacturer's recall of two types of sandwiches and a seafood stuffing because of a risk of listeria.
The items were recalled by Greencore USA, a convenience foods manufacturer based in Illinois, according to a statement from Hannaford. The products being recalled are:
n Hannaford Seafood Stuffing, 10 ounces, with a use or sell by date of Oct. 2 to Oct. 18. The UPC number is 41268-20509.
n Hannaford Egg Salad Club Sandwich, 5.10 ounces, with a use or sell by date of Sept. 28 to Oct. 2. The UPC number is 41268-16587.
n Hannaford Ham Salad Club Sandwich, 5.10 ounces, with a use or sell by date of Sept. 28 to Oct. 2. The UPC number is 41268-16589.
Customers who bought the recalled products should return them, or proof of purchase, to a Hannaford store for a full refund. No illnesses have been reported in connection with the recall, Hannaford said.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, listeria is a serious infection usually caused by eating food contaminated with listeria monocytogenes, a type of bacteria. An estimated 1,600 people get listeria each year and about 260 die. The infection is most likely to sicken pregnant women, adults over 65 and people with weakened immune systems.
Falmouth
Moratorium planned on certain developments
The Town Council will hold a special meeting Monday to introduce a moratorium on residential developments with two- and multi-family units in certain residential districts.
Councilors also are scheduled to discuss the impact of a 2016 zoning amendment that increased residential density in some parts of town.
The meeting begins at 5:30 p.m. at Town Hall and will include time for public comment. Councilors are expected to set a date for a formal public hearing on the proposal.
Falmouth and other communities surrounding Portland have seen new development pressures in the past few years as a shortage of rental housing in Portland has pushed some renters to move to the suburbs.

Maine-born astronaut biking Trans Amazon highway
NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy is keeping his exploration impulses down to earth, biking 600 miles across the Amazon to raise awareness about climate change and record its effects.
Cassidy, who grew up in Maine, told WCSH-TV that the world is affected by every action humans take. He is traversing the South American jungle with a team of environmental scientists as part of a documentary.
Scientists say as deforestation destroys more of the massive jungle, there's less vegetation to absorb carbon. Greenhouse gases that would normally be absorbed are released directly into the atmosphere instead.
The team is biking across the Trans Amazon highway and posting their travels on Twitter under the handle @TransAmazon25.
TREMONT
Couple rescued after wrong turn takes them into Atlantic
Volunteer firefighters in Tremont say they rescued a couple who took a wrong turn and accidentally drove into the Atlantic Ocean.
Firefighters were called to the docks in Tremont around 8 p.m. Tuesday after there were reports of two people trapped in a car in the water. Officials said the couple's SUV was in 8 to 10 feet of water after they traveled down a boat ramp into the harbor.
The car was floating over 100 feet from the ramp, resting next to some skiffs. Emergency workers with the help of a lobsterman were able to pull the couple - from New York, according to WMTW-TV - through the driver's open window and into a skiff. The couple then climbed over the skiffs to the boat ramp.
The SUV, still floating with its lights on, was then winched up the boat ramp and towed.
AUBURN
Search launched for snake that escaped from its crate
The Maine Warden Service said Friday that a snake, possibly from China, is still at large after it escaped from a crate at the former Pioneer Plastics.
Cpl. John MacDonald said a worker at Panolam Surface Systems on Pionite Road was opening a shipping crate from China at 5:30 a.m. Thursday. When the worker sliced open an exterior bag, a snake measuring 2 inches by 20 inches slithered out. The snake was described as green with yellow eyes.
Workers searched for the snake for roughly three hours before calling the Maine Warden Service for help.
Wardens arrived about 9:30 a.m. Thursday and helped search, MacDonald said. Roughly 50 crates were moved around, but no snake was found, he said.
If workers are able to find the snake, wardens have an expert who can help identify it, MacDonald said.

Trooper, dog track down lost 3-year-old in brook
A Lewiston police officer and his tracking dog on Thursday were credited with finding a young autistic boy who had wandered away from his home.
The 3-year-old boy was found chest-deep in the water of a brook, according to the Maine Police Canine Association.
It happened at about 2:15 p.m. when police were sent out to the area around Heather Avenue, off Stetson Road, for a report of a child who had wandered away.
"The grandmother who was watching the boy had heard the back door shut," according to the MPCA Facebook post, "and found that the boy was missing."
Officer Nate Hood responded to the area with his dog, Ice.
Ice began tracking across a field near the home, according to the report, and into the woods. Once in the woods, Ice continued tracking down a small trail along the edge of a swamp where he began to pick up a scent, indicating to Hood that the boy was nearby.
"Minutes later the team heard a noise and found the boy chest deep in the water," according to the MPCA. "The boy was safely returned home, where the mother wanted to buy K9 Ice an ice cream for finding her son."

Texto completo: A fly-in on Old Orchard Beach to commemorate the 90th anniversary of Lindbergh's surprise landing on the beach has been postponed until Sunday because of wind issues.
A fly-in to commemorate the 90th anniversary of Charles Lindbergh's surprise landing on Old Orchard Beach has been postponed until Sunday because of high wind.
The decision to delay the event by one day was made because the wind could make landing unsafe, according to organizers. More than 30 planes are expected to participate in the event to raise money for Make-A-Wish Foundation of Maine.
It will be the first time in decades that Old Orchard Beach has been used as a landing strip for small planes. The fly-in, organized by 15-year-old Chase Walker, commemorates the 90th anniversary of Lindbergh's unexpected landing on the beach in the Spirit of St. Louis.
On July 24, 1927, Lindbergh left Concord, New Hampshire, bound for the Portland airport as part of his victory tour following his historic trans-Atlantic flight. But when Lindbergh and the pilot of the guide plane accompanying him arrived over Maine, they were disoriented by heavy fog. The guide plane pilot landed in an open field in Dayton. The Portland airport - which back then was near the marsh in Scarborough - wasn't visible to Lindbergh.
Planes will land on the beach between noon and 1 p.m. Sunday and depart several hours later. While the planes are on the beach, visitors can talk to the pilots and have their portraits taken with the planes to raise money for Make-A-Wish. The Downeasters Chorus barbershop quartet will play on the beach after the planes take off. Gillian Graham can be contacted at 791-6315 or at: ggraham@pressherald.com Twitter: grahamgillian

Maine law school makes list of 'ugliest' college buildings

Texto completo: USM's law school building was named one of the 8 ugliest college buildings in the country by Architectural Digest
The University of Maine School of Law may have three former governors and four Maine Supreme Court justices among its alumni, but its dingy, off-white round, blocky home off Brighton Avenue in Portland is a real stinker, according to Architectural Digest.
"This university building may look like a futuristic version of the Roman Colosseum, but the only battles happening within these walls are with the bar exam," the magazine wrote in a recent article declaring the building one of the eight ugliest university buildings in America.
Associate Dean for Academic Affairs Dmitry Bam isn't arguing the point.
"You've seen the building," Bam said with a smile.
The eight-story structure at the intersection of Brighton Avenue, Deering Avenue and Falmouth Street looks like a silo, only wider and with columns of windows spaced between sheets of gray-white concrete. Bristles of cellphone towers and antennae rise off the roof, and a squat, square brick addition looks like a child's block placed next to a sand castle tower.
Bam, who has worked at the law school for six years, said there are days when he thinks it would be nice to have an office in a traditional brick building overlooking the water, but he doesn't worry too much about it.
"I think everyone here has just sort of accepted it," he said. "It's a joke but also a badge."
Nicole Vinal, assistant dean for finance and administration at the law school, has worked there since 2005. She called the building "rather unfortunate."
"But my kids think I work in a castle," Vinal said. The building was not originally built for the law school. It was commissioned by the University of Southern Maine and housed mostly administrative offices until the law school moved there in 1972 from its former location on High Street.
The building, which cost $2.7 million to construct, has been described as an example of modernism. The "brutalist" style of architecture seen in the building became especially popular for educational institutions, typically seen in large buildings that predominantly featured exposed concrete construction.
The building was designed by the Portland architectural firm of Wadsworth, Boston, Dimick, Mercer and Weatherill, although it's not clear which architect actually designed it. That same firm, it turns out, had the honor of being involved in the design of Deering High School - which Architectural Digest just named the most beautiful high school in Maine. The firm designed an addition to Deering in 1981.
The law school building isn't much better on the inside. The basement tends to flood, Vinal said, and visitors tend to get lost in the looping hallways.
Then there's the actual work space: "Everyone's office is shaped like a slice of pie," she said. "You can't find furniture that fits appropriately."
Vinal said the law school's founding dean, Edward Godfrey, is universally revered, except for one thing: moving the law school.
"Most people say that was the only mistake he made," she said.
The building's architect apparently was fond of his work. Vinal said the story goes that he used to set up a folding chair out front and just stare at it some days.
Others, though, find it hideous.
"We get hate mail," Vinal said.
Dean Bingham, an architect who now operates Dean's Sweets, wasn't surprised to hear the law school building made Architectural Digest's list of ugliest university buildings.
"I think it's well-deserved," said Bingham, who lives about four blocks away and passes the building every day.
Back in 2000 when Bingham was considering buying his house, he told the real estate agent he wouldn't buy it if he could see the law school building from any of the windows. Turns out the building can be spotted from the back window of his attic, but Bingham bought the house anyway.
Bam said a newer, shiny building might help in recruiting students, but he said most Maine Law students are attracted to the smaller class size or to Maine in general. It's the only law school in the Pine Tree State.
"There has always been talk about a new building and that may happen, but we're happy to put money into academics," he said.
Other university buildings on the ugliest list, and the magazine's commentary:
n Stony Brook Hospital, Stony Brook University: "The black cylindrical glass building paired with a drab stone box looks as if the two were built as separate entities and connected by two throughways as an afterthought."
n Crosley Tower, University of Cincinnati: "Crafted from a single pour of concrete, this 16-story building looks more like a Disney villain's lair than a part of the University of Cincinnati's campus."
n John C. Hodges Library, University of Tennessee: "Though it was ranked among the top research libraries in the country in 2011, the library's odd boxy exterior begs for a modern update."
n Health Sciences Center, Louisiana State University: "The microscopic windows dotting this boxlike structure give this educational hospital a prisonlike appearance."
n One Western Avenue, Harvard University: "In stark contrast to the rest of its stunning campus, Harvard's One Western Avenue is a futuristic departure from the norm, highlighting a geometric construction and jagged brick details."
n Boyd Law Building, University of Iowa College of Law: "Completed in the late 1980s, this shining example of late modernist architecture is reminiscent of another 1970s design: the Death Star."
n John and Frances Angelos Law Center, University of Baltimore School of Law: "While this building is one of the most environmentally conscious university buildings in use today, its checkerboard design and Tetris-esque exterior earns the John and Frances Angelos Law Center a prime spot on our list."

Texto completo: Bloobs? Puffins? Watchmen? Lumberjacks? Mariners? We finally find out the choice for Maine's new ECHL hockey franchise.
What was old is new again.
Portland's newest professional hockey franchise will be known as the Maine Mariners, the same name given the American Hockey League team based in Portland from 1977 to 1992.
The team made the announcement Friday at the Boys & Girls Club of Portland.
The Mariners will begin play in the ECHL - considered one step below the AHL in hockey's minor leagues - in October 2018 at Cross Insurance Arena. Mariners was chosen over four other finalists from a contest that received more than 18,000 votes.
"We're just going to relight the fire, so to speak, and march on with what we think is a cool and iconic name," said Paul Holmgren, the president of the Philadelphia Flyers and Maine Mariners. "We're looking forward to restarting what once was, and more good hockey to come."
Adam Goldberg, vice president of business operations for the Mariners, said of the more than 18,000 votes cast, most went to Mariners, but Wild Blueberries was not far behind. Watchmen was a distant third followed by Puffins and Lumberjacks.
"Wild Blueberries was something that took us all by surprise," Holmgren said. "We had some interesting conversations."
Goldberg, who has a background in marketing, had chosen a juicy mascot if the Wild Blueberries had been chosen: Chuck. As in, Chuck Berry.
He said the team will decide on a logo and colors by November, but they won't be the same as the original ship's wheel with the orange circle inside the tall rounded 'm.'
A Mariners mascot likely will take longer to develop. Goldberg said he's open to suggestions, and promised town hall-style meetings with fans starting this fall to address questions and concerns.
The team's new director of sales starts work Monday. Goldberg said 150 fans have put down $50 deposits for season tickets. Prices have yet to be determined but Goldberg said they would be comparable or less expensive than those of the Portland Pirates, the American Hockey League franchise that relocated in 2016 to Springfield, Massachusetts.
Single-game tickets cost as much as $18 during the Pirates' final season.
Two original members of the Maine Mariners, Wayne Schaab and Frank Bathe, attended the unveiling. Schaab, 68, played six years in Portland and, like Bathe, remained in the area after his playing days.
"A bunch of people I know in their 30s and 40s all wanted the Mariners back," Schaab said. "I was curious about that. They said they grew up with Mariners and they missed the old name."
Andrew Hart, a longtime Portland Pirates fan from South Portland who was in line for season tickets, said he would have preferred a fresh start with a new name, but pressure from older fans to revive the Mariners, the ties with Comcast Spectacor to both the Flyers and the original franchise, and the fact that the team had not bothered to trademark any of the other four finalists made the outcome appear inevitable.
"Unlike those that go back to the '70s, '80s and '90s when the Mariners played, I wasn't in Maine," Hart said. "Many people weren't. So the name has no resonance with us. So to the extent that the organization (chooses) something that a recent and younger generation has no tie to is somewhat disappointing."
Hart said he's happy that pro hockey is coming back to the city and is approaching the franchise with an open mind.
"As long as they're willing to brand themselves as being unique," he said, "instead of a carbon copy of the Flyers or Bruins like the prior Mariner teams."
Danny Briere, the vice president of hockey operations for the Mariners, said even more important than the name and the crest is the people who will wear the jersey.
"We want to bring players and coaches that are going to be great in the community as well," he said. "That's something we're going to be looking for."
The Mariners will be the 28th franchise in the ECHL, which began as the East Coast Hockey League but expanded across the country and into Canada. Each current ECHL club is affiliated with one of the 31 National Hockey League clubs. The four NHL clubs without ECHL affiliates are Columbus, Florida, Ottawa and Tampa Bay.
Briere said hiring coaches and signing players will come later. Under ECHL rules, players operate under one-year contracts and teams are allowed to protect eight players for the next season. The rest become free agents.
The ECHL also has a salary cap and teams are required to provide housing for players.
Briere and Holmgren are former Flyers players.
Briere said he expected the Puffins and Blueberries "to be tossed aside and the other three strong names would make a push" in the fan voting.
"I was totally wrong," he said. "The Blueberries took off. You had to start opening your mind to it. What can we do with it? But at the end of the day I'm very excited about the Mariners."
Goldberg hinted at promotions that could include a Throwback Night with the original Mariners logo on jerseys and a What If Night with players wearing Maine Wild Blueberries jerseys.
In July, the Hartford Yard Goats of baseball's Eastern League held such a promotion by becoming the Hartford Praying Mantis for one game.
"That was their second most-popular team name," Goldberg said. "They had jerseys. They had merchandise."
So there might be a juicy night for the Bloobs after all?
"I think we would be silly not to," Goldberg said.
"I anticipate us being very creative with our promotions. Nothing is really off limits for us." Glenn Jordan can be contacted at 791-6425 or Gjordan@pressherald.com Twitter: GlennJordanPPH

Meetings with Hitler's spokesman were confrontations of good and evil

Texto completo: In July 1935, a young American, Varian Fry, the editor of Living Age magazine, witnessed an anti-Jewish riot in Berlin. A few days later, seeking information about the causes of the riot, he paid a visit to the office of Ernst Franz Sedgwick Hanfstaengl, nicknamed "Putzi," Adolf Hitler's official liaison to the American press, among others. Both men had attended Harvard University, although at different times.
Perhaps that was why Hanfstaengl was so open with Fry about the "Jewish Question" and how Hitler and the Nazis were going to solve it.
Some days later, the New York Times published an article quoting Fry and what Hanfstaengl had to say about the future of German Jewry. "Mr. Fry," the article read, "said that in his talk with Mr. Hanfstaengl he was told that there were two anti-Semitic groups in the Nazi Party, one the radical section that desired to solve the Jewish Question with bloodshed and the other a moderate group that wishes to segregate the Jews by law into a specified area."
That may have been one reason why Varian Fry went to France in 1940 and helped more than 2,000 Jewish refugees escape the clutches of the occupying Nazi forces, including famous names such as Marc Chagall and Hannah Arendt.
In 1994, Fry was given the title Righteous Among the Nations by the Israeli Holocaust museum Yad Vashem. He is the only Amercan to have been honored for his actions in saving Jewish lives during the Holocaust.
But a year earlier, at Harvard's graduation in June 1934, another confrontation of sorts took place between two graduates of the Harvard class of 1909. One was Maine's second Jewish judge, sitting on Portland's municipal court, and the same Putzi Hanfstaengl who a year later would deliver his assessment of German Jewry's fate under the Nazis.
In a sense, as with the meeting between Fry and Hanfstaengl, it was a confrontation between good and evil.
Judge Max Pinansky (1887-1951) has largely been forgotten except for a few brief mentions in studies dealing with Portland Jewry. But in the first decades of the 20th century, he played important roles not only in the religious life of Portland's Jewish community but also in the political, legal, interreligious and interracial histories of Maine's largest city.
Max L. Pinansky was born in East Boston. He graduated from Harvard College in 1909 and in 1913, after becoming a member of the Massachusetts bar, moved to Portland to set up his legal practice and to marry a local woman, Annie R. Bernstein.
Immediately after arriving, Pinansky formed an organization known as the Modern Synagogue Society, later called Temple Israel. It was an effort to introduce a form of religious modernization to a Jewish community that was strictly traditional in its religious observance. The religious services in this congregation were held mainly in English and most notably allowed men and women to sit together.
By 1919, in the face of fierce opposition from the Orthodox Jewish community, Temple Israel was forced to dissolve.
Pinansky was also a member of the Portland School Board for nine years and served one term as a Republican member of the Maine Senate, where he pursued a moderate to liberal agenda with a focus on education, especially the effort to create a policy of equal funding for all public school students in Maine which, unfortunately, failed to gain majority support.
Finally, Pinansky was the founder and president of an organization that was extraordinarily progressive for its time. The Inter-Racial Fellowship of America was made up of representatives of Portland's Christian and Jewish communities as well as the religious leaders of its African American community. In a meeting of the group in 1937, a visiting speaker, Bishop W.J. Walls of the A.M.E. Zion Church, angrily declared that African Americans "were still slaves in an economic sense." Part of that anger may have been heightened by the fact that Bishop Walls, as an African American, had been denied accommodations at several Portland hotels. He only found a hotel room after Judge Pinansky personally intervened on his behalf.
Putzi Hanfstaengl's decision to attend his 25th Harvard reunion was the beginning of his fall from grace within the Nazi Party. An early and intimate adviser to Hitler from the 1920s, Hanfstaengl (1887-1975), who was descended from an old and wealthy German family known for their art publishing business, was literally a giant of a man, standing 6-feet-4 with a massive head and jaw.
At Harvard, he was a popular member of the class of 1909, regaling his classmates with his piano playing and his "good old boy" manner.
After graduation, he ran part of the family business in Manhattan until America entered World War I and he was forced to return to Germany after the end of the war.
In 1922, he met Hitler and soon became Hitler's closest confidant. Putzi maintained that his description to Hitler of the cheers that accompanied the traditional Harvard-Yale football game resulted in the creation of the massive crowd demonstrations held by the Nazis and their shouts of "Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil." - Hail Victory.
But for the most part, he functioned as Hitler's piano player and spokesperson for the Nazi Party's relationships with the foreign, but especially the American, press corps.
In June 1934, Hanfstaengl was greeted upon his arrival in New York by demonstrators protesting the Nazi persecution of its political opponents, especially the arrest and jailing of Ernst Thaelmann, the head of the German Communist Party.
But he managed to avoid direct confrontations until he was approached during the reunion by Rabbi Joseph Schubow, a Harvard graduate of the class of 1920, who asked Hanfstaengl if his comments to the American press that the Jewish problem would soon be restored to normal meant "by extermination." Putzi refused to answer and joined his classmates who cheered and threw confetti at him as they marched in the alumni procession.
Suddenly, Hanfstaengl was marching next to a member of his class, a man he claimed he could not remember from his undergraduate days. It was Max Pinanksy, who as a Jewish student at Harvard, most likely one of the "grinds" who commuted to the campus, lived at home and excelled in his academic subjects, would not have been a part of Putzi's crowd.
According to newspaper reports, Judge Pinansky asked Putzi if he would issue a statement regarding the condition of the Jews in Germany, but Hanfstaengl refused the request as he had done with Rabbi Schubow.
"If Hitler Could See Hanfy (Hanfstaengl's nickname among his Harvard classmates) Now," a newspaper headline read, displaying a photo of Putzi marching with Pinansky.
In fact, after Hanfstaengl returned to Germany, Hitler did see such a photo, one which Putzi claimed had him shaking hands with Judge Pinansky. It led to a sharp rebuke by the Nazi leader and perhaps the beginning of Putzi's fall from grace as an apologist for the Nazi regime. Ultimately, he would flee Nazi Germany, be interned as an enemy alien in Great Britain and return to the United States to work for the American government analyzing Hitler's potential political and military decisions.
It was a brief confrontation, but one which highlighted the human incarnations of good and evil: The Jewish judge and humanitarian concerned with the welfare of his Jewish and wider communities, and the racist and vicious anti-Semite who would tell the future American ambassador to Germany, James G. McDonald, in 1933 that "the Jews are the vampire sucking German blood. We shall not be strong until we free ourselves of them."
Abraham J. Peck is research professor of history at the University of Southern Maine. He is extremely grateful to Paul Mills, Farmington attorney and a well-known analyst and historian of Maine politics, for his pioneering work on the meeting between Pinansky and Hanfstaengl.

The event includes a social and dinner before the induction and plaque unveiling.
As the 10th-leading scorer in NCAA women's basketball history, Blodgett completed her career at the University of Maine with 3,005 points and a total of 20 program records. She led the Black Bears to four America East tournament championships and the school's first four NCAA tournament appearances in program history.
The four-time All-American was the second woman in NCAA Division I history to lead the nation in scoring for two consecutive seasons as she averaged more than 27 points per game her sophomore and junior campaigns. She was a two-time America East Player of the Year and was a preseason candidate for the Naismith Player of the Year award in 1997 and 1998.
Blodgett led Lawrence High School to four straight Class A State Championships and is Maine's all-time leading high school scorer with 2,596 points. She was a three-time Maine Gatorade Player of the Year and named Miss Basketball in Maine in 1994.
Brawn joined the Thomas Baseball program after graduating from Cony High School. Brawn holds the record for most home runs (34), runs batted in (147), and total bases (309) in Thomas history. He was part of the 2004 NAC Championship team and the 2003 Sunrise Conference Champion team. Brawn earned First-Team All-Conference honors in 2003, and Second-Team in 2005. He was also named 2003 Sunrise Conference Player of the Year and 2003 Sunrise All-Conference First Team. Brawn also was honored with the 2003 NAIA All-American Honorable Mention. In 2002, he also was named to the Maine Athletic Conference First Team.
Brawn graduated from Thomas with a degree in management in 2005 and now resides in Arizona.

Navy head has 'great faith' in BIW

Texto completo: BATH -- The secretary of the Navy reaffirmed the federal government's commitment to Bath Iron Works on Friday and said the military must work with shipyards to expand capacity as the Navy seeks to grow its fleet.
"We have great faith in Bath -- Bath-built, best built -- and we look forward to this relationship growing and even becoming stronger from a base that is historically monumental," Navy Secretary Richard Spencer said.
Spencer toured BIW for the first time Friday, one day after the Navy announced contracts for two additional destroyers at the shipyard. The contracts provide funding for the fifth Arleigh Burke-class destroyer as part of a five-ship contract awarded to BIW in 2013, as well as for a sixth ship negotiated by the Navy, BIW parent company General Dynamics and Maine's congressional delegation.
Speaking with reporters before his tour, Spencer said the Navy "definitely" needs a larger fleet, given the threats facing the nation and the importance of having ships deployed around the globe. With their powerful radar and armament systems, Arleigh Burke-class destroyers provide both offensive capabilities and the ability to track and destroy short- to intermediate-range ballistic missiles.
"We are not at war, because that is a technical (decision) that Congress has to demand; but I will tell you that we are in combat around the globe," Spencer said. "Our uniformed service members and their civilian teammates are fighting on many fronts. These threats, we don't see them diminishing in any way. The Navy-Marine Corps team needs to have these platforms prepared for power projection."
The Navy and the Trump administration have called for building toward a 355-ship fleet, up from fewer than 300 ships today. Such an expansion would be costly, however. A recent analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service estimated that a 350-ship Navy would require $3.5 billion to $4 billion in additional funding every year over the 30-year build-out period. BIW and its competitor shipyard for building Navy destroyers, Huntington Ingalls in Mississippi, are both under intense pressure to hold down costs on Arleigh Burke destroyers that each carry a price tag estimated at $1.8 billion. But Spencer said the Navy has a responsibility "to work with our suppliers as a partnership" to reduce costs and ensure the industrial base has the capacity to build additional ships.
Six destroyers are in various stages of construction in Bath -- four Arleigh Burke-class ships and two Zumwalt-class stealth destroyers.
"This is where we are going to be working alongside Bath and General Dynamics ... to see how, in fact, we grow going forward," Spencer said. "We can't simply sit here and mandate, 'We want ships built.' We have to understand what the actual industrial base can support and where capacity is. Where we can help to expand capacity in lockstep with our suppliers, our contractors, we will do so."
Two destroyers built at BIW, the USS Fitzgerald and the USS John S. McCain, were involved recently in collisions that killed 17 sailors. The incidents prompted a systemwide review of culture, training and maintenance in a Navy fleet that experts say is increasingly stretched thin. Spencer said reviews of those incidents are ongoing but that the Navy also is reaching out to the maritime community and private companies for ideas on improving safety.
The Navy awarded the contract to repair the Fitzgerald to BIW's competitor, Huntington Ingalls, a decision that disappointed BIW officials and members of Maine's congressional delegation. Spencer said the Navy still is analyzing where to repair the McCain, which sustained less damage than the Fitzgerald.
"We have not come to a conclusion," Spencer said. "The primary driver, though, is how can we get it back into the fleet as soon as possible. This is a critical part of the ballistic missile defense system."
With roughly 6,000 workers, BIW is one of Maine's largest private employers and is one of two shipyards that build the guided-missile destroyers that are considered the workhorses of the Navy fleet. Spencer addressed members of BIW's workforce later Friday.
All four members of Maine's congressional delegation -- Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King and Reps. Chellie Pingree and Bruce Poliquin -- joined Spencer at BIW on Friday, along with BIW President Dirk Lesko. The delegation members each had worked on different aspects of securing authorization or funding for the two additional destroyer awards announced Thursday, and they thanked Spencer for his personal commitment to finalizing the two contracts.
"That demonstrates the Navy's commitment to BIW and its confidence in its highly skilled workforce," said Collins, a Republican member of the Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, which earmarks money for shipbuilding. "You noticed that the secretary already knows that 'Bath-built is best built.' The contracts will help to strengthen our fleet and allow the Navy to promote civility and security in the face of proliferating threats around the globe."
King, an independent who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee, told Spencer that he is always welcome to visit Bath.

Texto completo: Two people arrested Wednesday on drug charges in Waterville were scheduled to see judge on Friday, but only one of them made it. Jail officers told Justice Donald Marden that Toni Juliano was too sick to appear for an initial appearance via video.
Ambrose Wan made it in front of judge, but Toni Juliano too sick to appear at hearing
Two people arrested Wednesday on drug charges in Waterville were scheduled to see a judge on Friday, but only one of them made it.
Jail officers told Justice Donald Marden that Toni D. Juliano, 30, of Canaan, was too sick to appear for an initial appearance via video link. Medical personnel told them she apparently was going through detoxification.
Ambrose Wan, 32, also known as Bruno, of New York City, and Juliano were charged with numerous felony drug charges and both told police they needed to go to the hospital.
Wan complained of chest pains and Juliano indicated she had swallowed an unknown amount of heroin and fentanyl, according to affidavits filed in the case at the Capital Judicial Center.
Both defendants were taken to the Kennebec County jail after being examined at a hospital.
On Friday, Marden read aloud the charges against Wan: three counts of aggravated trafficking and one count each of conspiracy to commit trafficking, unlawful possession of drugs and operating without a license, all dated Wednesday.
Marden noted that because the trafficking charges were felonies and would have to go through the grand jury process, he was not asking for any plea to be entered.
Marden ordered $150,000 bail for Wan, with a number of conditions, including one that requires him to remain in Maine.
That was the amount requested by the prosecutor, Assistant District Attorney Tyler LeClair, who said the allegations were "extremely serious," involving heroin, cocaine and fentanyl.
LeClair detailed the amounts reported by police, saying they located 109 grams of fentanyl, 97.2 grams of cocaine, 75.9 grams of heroin and suboxone strips, drug paraphernalia and $38,000 in cash when they searched the couple's Waterville hotel room Sept. 27.
LeClair said Wan served six years in prison in New York on a conviction for criminal sale of a controlled substance and has a pending charge there involving possession of a weapon.
Because Juliano was unable to make an initial appearance, LeClair asked the judge to review the affidavits supporting the charges against her to find probable cause to hold her until she could be seen at a video hearing on Monday.
Marden did so, noting Juliano's absence for the record.
He also noted that records showed Juliano had pleaded guilty July 27 in Augusta to a charge of unlawful trafficking in scheduled drugs and was scheduled for a sentencing hearing on Nov. 6.
She had been free on postconviction bail with a condition prohibiting her from possessing drugs.
The new offenses are alleged to have occurred Sept. 6 and Sept. 27 in Waterville.
She is charged with three counts of aggravated trafficking in scheduled drugs and one count of violation of condition of release, all Sept. 6.
A separate complaint charges her with four counts of aggravated trafficking in scheduled drugs, and one count each of conspiracy to commit trafficking, unlawful possession of drugs and violation of condition of release, all Sept. 27.
Both of those complaints list a Portland address for her.

Texto completo: for Blaine House
Maine Senate Majority Leader Garrett Mason announced Thursday he will be the third Republican to enter the 2018 race for governor.
Mason, R-Lisbon, previously had planned to announce his bid to replace outgoing Republican Gov. Paul LePage but delayed it after the unexpected death of his mother, Rep. Gina Mason. LePage is finishing his second term and cannot run again because of term limits.
Mason was to make the announcement official during an event Thursday night in Lewiston but told Portland-based WGAN talk radio hosts Matt Gagnon and Ken Altshuler his campaign is underway. Mason, 32, is the youngest candidate to join the race so far and would be the youngest governor in state history by five months if he is elected in November 2018.
In all, 16 candidates are now running -- eight Democrats and three Republicans.
Mason will face off against former Maine Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Mary Mayhew and House Minority Leader Ken Fredette in the June 2018 primary.
U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, also has said she might run for governor and is expected to make a decision soon.
Mason said he believed Collins could serve Maine best by staying in the Senate, but he also voiced his "respect" for the senior member of the state's congressional delegation.
Mason said his campaign would focus on a "Maine first" agenda, echoing President Donald Trump's inaugural address, which focused on an "America first" theme.
"I'm a lifelong conservative," Mason said. "That's who I am. It's not something I came to." He also cited his record in the Senate as a lawmaker who can broker bipartisan deals. "I have a proven record of success and of being able to collaborate with the other side, when I need to, to get the job done."
But Mason also took aim at the large field of potential Democratic opponents, saying, "What you see in that field is a party that is grasping for the same thing, basically socialist ideologies."

Legal pot bill faces uncertain future

Texto completo: GOP leader likely to oppose measure passed in committee
Despite months of work by lawmakers on a special committee, a bill that would set in motion the legal sale of recreational marijuana in Maine faces an uncertain future, with a top State House leader who could hold the key to the bill's final passage expressing serious concerns about the legislation Friday.
It's also unclear what action Gov. Paul LePage will take. His office would not comment on whether he will veto the bill, but LePage repeatedly has said he wished U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions would crack down on states that have ignored federal law and voted to legalize recreational marijuana use.
House Minority Leader Ken Fredette, R-Newport, said he's likely to oppose the adult-use marijuana bill, which received a 13-2 endorsement Thursday from a special select committee of the Legislature after nine months of work.
Fredette said the bill lacks flexibility and bundles too many issues into a single law.
"This is an all-or-nothing bill, which makes me uncomfortable," Fredette said. "When you have a bill like this, it makes it easy to find the one, two or three things in the bill you don't like and makes it more likely you will vote against the bill."
Fredette, who leads a conservative House Republican caucus, has been a key player in the Legislature and a staunch LePage ally.
If LePage vetoes the bill, the votes in Fredette's caucus likely would be the difference between whether the veto is sustained or overridden. A two-thirds majority of lawmakers is needed to both pass the measure as an emergency bill that would go into effect before January, and to overcome a LePage veto.
If the bill developed by the special committee doesn't pass, then the marijuana ballot question voters approved last November would become law. Advocates for regulation, who supported the bill, say Maine then would be opening itself up for an unfettered black market of marijuana sales that will be unregulated but not necessarily fully illegal.
"It will be the wild, wild West," said Senate President Michael Thibodeau, R-Winterport.
Thibodeau said he hoped the Legislature would respect the work of the committee and support the bill.
The bill sets up licensing and product safety testing requirements, labeling and packaging rules and other standards designed to create an orderly and regulated market that also would allow the state to collect tax revenue from marijuana sales. While the state's current $7.1 billion two-year budget is not dependent on marijuana revenue, there is little doubt the Legislature, which struggles every two years to create a balanced budget, would welcome the tax revenue generated by marijuana sales, which could reach $220 million by 2020, according to one estimate.
LePage announced Friday that he was calling lawmakers back to Augusta for a special legislative session on Oct. 23. The governor said the reason for that special session was to deal with two issues unrelated to marijuana, but leaders in both the House and the Senate indicated they also intend to move the marijuana bill to their respective floors for debate.
A spokesman for LePage would not say whether the governor will veto the bill.
"When a bill hits his desk, the governor will have 10 days to sign it, veto it or let it go into law without his signature," Peter Steele, LePage's communications director, said in an email.
Fredette was more forthcoming. "Being against recreational marijuana, it's going to difficult for this bill to find my support," he said. Fredette added that if the underlying ballot box law stands, the Legislature could attempt to make changes to it, "in a more surgical kind of way."
Fredette holds significant sway with his caucus, but not all House Republicans are going to follow his marching orders, and some will support the committee's bill.
Rep. Lance Harvell, R-Farmington, a member of the Marijuana Legalization Implementation Committee, which included eight Democrats, eight Republicans and one independent lawmaker, said Friday that he expects legal adult-use marijuana won't be fully implemented until LePage leaves office in early 2019. Even if the committee's bill goes into effect, LePage could slow down or halt the rule-making process that sets the final regulatory framework for things such as retail licenses to sell recreational marijuana, and delay implementation for as long as 18 months, or until his successor takes office.
The Legislature conceivably could pass a bill that would force LePage's hand on rulemaking, but if he then vetoed that bill, it's unlikely that two-thirds of the Legislature would vote to override him.
Harvell, who voted for the marijuana bill Thursday as a committee member, said he would remind his colleagues of the parts of the law passed at the ballot box in November that are most concerning.
"If you don't pass this, it's not as if you are repealing marijuana legalization," he said. "Whether you like it or not, if you don't vote for this, you are in effect voting for internet sales, drive-through sales, the age problem that's in the law," among other things. The age problem is a reference to language that allows people under 21 to purchase marijuana.
While an outright repeal of the law passed at the ballot box is possible, it's not clear whether lawmakers are prepared to reverse the will of the voters for a second time in a single year. During the legislative session, they overturned a voter-approved measure that added a 3 percent surcharge to high-income households to help fund education.
Harvell said even Republicans such as Fredette could face bruising criticism for eschewing the will of the voters again.
House Speaker Sara Gideon, D-Freeport, said lawmakers should respect and support the work of the committee, which worked to erase some of the largest pitfalls in the ballot-box law.
"I hope my colleagues in the Legislature will support this bill," she said in a statement. "Failing to do so would be irresponsible, as the legislation addresses numerous issues within the existing law."
Assistant House Minority Leader Ellie Espling, R-New Gloucester, said she thought her caucus would be divided on the committee bill, but noted that it was designed to balance a variety of competing industry interests.
"Half of the state hates this," Espling said. "I think we really need to balance the interest of the voters at the ballot box -- and that includes those who were adamantly opposed and those who were very much in favor -- and those are the two interests we can't forget as we work to balance this thing out."
In November 2016, voters passed the ballot measure by a razor-thin margin (50.2 percent in favor and 49.8 percent opposed), with a recount showing the margin of victory was only 4,400 votes.
Delayed implementation of the law also would delay economic benefits to many business sectors, from construction and real estate to lawyers and other professionals who are preparing to usher an entirely new industry into Maine.
Hannah King, an attorney who sits on the advisory board for Maine Professionals for Regulating Marijuana, a coalition of professionals that supports vigorous regulation of marijuana, said in a statement she's hopeful the Legislature will enact the committee's bill, which she characterized as a "significant improvement" to the law passed by voters.
"Delaying ruling-making and the roll-out of a legal commercial market, including legal points of sale for consumers to purchase adult use marijuana, is not only contrary to the will of the majority of voters, it creates a space for the illicit marijuana market to thrive," King said.

This year's inductees include Scott Brawn '05, Jeremy Cliff '11, Megan (Denby) Pomerleau '11 and Karin Bird '12.
The event includes a social and dinner before the induction and plaque unveiling.
As the 10th-leading scorer in NCAA women's basketball history, Blodgett completed her career at the University of Maine with 3,005 points and a total of 20 program records. She led the Black Bears to four America East tournament championships and the school's first four NCAA tournament appearances in program history.
The four-time All-American was the second woman in NCAA Division I history to lead the nation in scoring for two consecutive seasons as she averaged more than 27 points per game her sophomore and junior campaigns. She was a two-time America East Player of the Year and was a preseason candidate for the Naismith Player of the Year award in 1997 and 1998.
Blodgett led Lawrence High School to four straight Class A State Championships and is Maine's all-time leading high school scorer with 2,596 points. She was a three-time Maine Gatorade Player of the Year and named Miss Basketball in Maine in 1994.
Brawn joined the Thomas Baseball program after graduating from Cony High School. Brawn holds the record for most home runs (34), runs batted in (147), and total bases (309) in Thomas history.

In 2002, he also was named to the Maine Athletic Conference First Team.
Brawn graduated from Thomas with a degree in management in 2005 and now resides in Arizona.
Cliff made his mark early, ending his first tennis season at Thomas by achieving NAC Rookie and Player of the Year in 2008. He was named to the NAC-All Conference First Team Singles and Doubles in 2009, and NAC All-Conference First Team Singles in 2010 and '11. Cliff finished his four-year career with a 27-11 record in singles play along with a 24-17 record in doubles.
Cliff graduated in 2011 with a degree in accounting and now resides in Virginia.
Pomerleau was the first Thomas women's lacrosse player to achieve the 100-goal mark, and sits second in school history for goals (108). In 2009, Pomerleau was named to the NAC East All-Conference Team and to the NAC First Team in 2010 and '11. While at Thomas, Pomerleau also had a career as a goalie for the field hockey team, recording 433 saves throughout her career.
Pomerleau, originally from New York, graduated in 2011 with a bachelor's degree in criminal justice and an accelerated master's in business administration, and now resides in Virginia.
Bird was a member of the Terriers Basketball team for three years, and in 2011-12 led the nation in scoring for NCCA Division 3, averaging 24.5 points per game. She also led the conference in scoring in the 2010-11 season.

Texto completo: GOP leader likely to oppose measure passed in committee
Despite months of work by lawmakers on a special committee, a bill that would set in motion the legal sale of recreational marijuana in Maine faces an uncertain future, with a top State House leader who could hold the key to the bill's final passage expressing serious concerns about the legislation Friday.
It's also unclear what action Gov. Paul LePage will take. His office would not comment on whether he will veto the bill, but LePage repeatedly has said he wished U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions would crack down on states that have ignored federal law and voted to legalize recreational marijuana use.
House Minority Leader Ken Fredette, R-Newport, said he's likely to oppose the adult-use marijuana bill, which received a 13-2 endorsement Thursday from a special select committee of the Legislature after nine months of work.
Fredette said the bill lacks flexibility and bundles too many issues into a single law.
"This is an all-or-nothing bill, which makes me uncomfortable," Fredette said. "When you have a bill like this, it makes it easy to find the one, two or three things in the bill you don't like and makes it more likely you will vote against the bill."
Fredette, who leads a conservative House Republican caucus, has been a key player in the Legislature and a staunch LePage ally.
If LePage vetoes the bill, the votes in Fredette's caucus likely would be the difference between whether the veto is sustained or overridden. A two-thirds majority of lawmakers is needed to both pass the measure as an emergency bill that would go into effect before January, and to overcome a LePage veto.
If the bill developed by the special committee doesn't pass, then the marijuana ballot question voters approved last November would become law. Advocates for regulation, who supported the bill, say Maine then would be opening itself up for an unfettered black market of marijuana sales that will be unregulated but not necessarily fully illegal.
"It will be the wild, wild West," said Senate President Michael Thibodeau, R-Winterport.
Thibodeau said he hoped the Legislature would respect the work of the committee and support the bill.
The bill sets up licensing and product safety testing requirements, labeling and packaging rules and other standards designed to create an orderly and regulated market that also would allow the state to collect tax revenue from marijuana sales. While the state's current $7.1 billion two-year budget is not dependent on marijuana revenue, there is little doubt the Legislature, which struggles every two years to create a balanced budget, would welcome the tax revenue generated by marijuana sales, which could reach $220 million by 2020, according to one estimate.
LePage announced Friday that he was calling lawmakers back to Augusta for a special legislative session on Oct. 23. The governor said the reason for that special session was to deal with two issues unrelated to marijuana, but leaders in both the House and the Senate indicated they also intend to move the marijuana bill to their respective floors for debate.
A spokesman for LePage would not say whether the governor will veto the bill.
"When a bill hits his desk, the governor will have 10 days to sign it, veto it or let it go into law without his signature," Peter Steele, LePage's communications director, said in an email.
Fredette was more forthcoming.
"Being against recreational marijuana, it's going to (be) difficult for this bill to find my support," he said. Fredette added that if the underlying ballot box law stands, the Legislature could attempt to make changes to it, "in a more surgical kind of way."
Fredette holds significant sway with his caucus, but not all House Republicans are going to follow his marching orders, and some will support the committee's bill.
Rep. Lance Harvell, R-Farmington, a member of the Marijuana Legalization Implementation Committee, which included eight Democrats, eight Republicans and one independent lawmaker, said Friday that he expects legal adult-use marijuana won't be fully implemented until LePage leaves office in early 2019. Even if the committee's bill goes into effect, LePage could slow down or halt the rule-making process that sets the final regulatory framework for things such as retail licenses to sell recreational marijuana, and delay implementation for as long as 18 months, or until his successor takes office.
The Legislature conceivably could pass a bill that would force LePage's hand on rulemaking, but if he then vetoed that bill, it's unlikely that two-thirds of the Legislature would vote to override him.
Harvell, who voted for the marijuana bill Thursday as a committee member, said he would remind his colleagues of the parts of the law passed at the ballot box in November that are most concerning.
"If you don't pass this, it's not as if you are repealing marijuana legalization," he said. "Whether you like it or not, if you don't vote for this, you are in effect voting for internet sales, drive-through sales, the age problem that's in the law," among other things. The age problem is a reference to language that allows people under 21 to purchase marijuana.
While an outright repeal of the law passed at the ballot box is possible, it's not clear whether lawmakers are prepared to reverse the will of the voters for a second time in a single year. During the legislative session, they overturned a voter-approved measure that added a 3 percent surcharge to high-income households to help fund education.
Harvell said even Republicans such as Fredette could face bruising criticism for eschewing the will of the voters again.
House Speaker Sara Gideon, D-Freeport, said lawmakers should respect and support the work of the committee, which worked to erase some of the largest pitfalls in the ballot-box law.
"I hope my colleagues in the Legislature will support this bill," she said in a statement. "Failing to do so would be irresponsible, as the legislation addresses numerous issues within the existing law."
Assistant House Minority Leader Ellie Espling, R-New Gloucester, said she thought her caucus would be divided on the committee bill, but noted that it was designed to balance a variety of competing industry interests.
"Half of the state hates this," Espling said. "I think we really need to balance the interest of the voters at the ballot box -- and that includes those who were adamantly opposed and those who were very much in favor -- and those are the two interests we can't forget as we work to balance this thing out."
In November 2016, voters passed the ballot measure by a razor-thin margin (50.2 percent in favor and 49.8 percent opposed), with a recount showing the margin of victory was only 4,400 votes.
Delayed implementation of the law also would delay economic benefits to many business sectors, from construction and real estate to lawyers and other professionals who are preparing to usher an entirely new industry into Maine.
Hannah King, an attorney who sits on the advisory board for Maine Professionals for Regulating Marijuana, a coalition of professionals that supports vigorous regulation of marijuana, said in a statement she's hopeful the Legislature will enact the committee's bill, which she characterized as a "significant improvement" to the law passed by voters.
"Delaying ruling-making and the roll-out of a legal commercial market, including legal points of sale for consumers to purchase adult use marijuana, is not only contrary to the will of the majority of voters, it creates a space for the illicit marijuana market to thrive," King said.

Texto completo: Two people arrested Wednesday on drug charges in Waterville were scheduled to see judge on Friday, but only one of them made it. Jail officers told Justice Donald Marden that Toni Juliano was too sick to appear for an initial appearance via video.
Ambrose Wan made it in front of judge, but Toni Juliano too sick to appear at hearing
Two people arrested Wednesday on drug charges in Waterville were scheduled to see a judge on Friday, but only one of them made it.
Jail officers told Justice Donald Marden that Toni D. Juliano, 30, of Canaan, was too sick to appear for an initial appearance via video link. Medical personnel told them she apparently was going through detoxification.
Ambrose Wan, 32, also known as Bruno, of New York City, and Juliano were charged with numerous felony drug charges and both told police they needed to go to the hospital.
Wan complained of chest pains and Juliano indicated she had swallowed an unknown amount of heroin and fentanyl, according to affidavits filed in the case at the Capital Judicial Center.
Both defendants were taken to the Kennebec County jail after being examined at a hospital.
On Friday, Marden read aloud the charges against Wan: three counts of aggravated trafficking and one count each of conspiracy to commit trafficking, unlawful possession of drugs and operating without a license, all dated Wednesday.
Marden noted that because the trafficking charges were felonies and would have to go through the grand jury process, he was not asking for any plea to be entered.
Marden ordered $150,000 bail for Wan, with a number of conditions, including one that requires him to remain in Maine.
That was the amount requested by the prosecutor, Assistant District Attorney Tyler LeClair, who said the allegations were "extremely serious," involving heroin, cocaine and fentanyl.
LeClair detailed the amounts reported by police, saying they located 109 grams of fentanyl, 97.2 grams of cocaine, 75.9 grams of heroin and suboxone strips, drug paraphernalia and $38,000 in cash when they searched the couple's Waterville hotel room Sept. 27.
LeClair said Wan served six years in prison in New York on a conviction for criminal sale of a controlled substance and has a pending charge there involving possession of a weapon.
Because Juliano was unable to make an initial appearance, LeClair asked the judge to review the affidavits supporting the charges against her to find probable cause to hold her until she could be seen at a video hearing on Monday.
Marden did so, noting Juliano's absence for the record.
He also noted that records showed Juliano had pleaded guilty July 27 in Augusta to a charge of unlawful trafficking in scheduled drugs and was scheduled for a sentencing hearing on Nov. 6.
She had been free on postconviction bail with a condition prohibiting her from possessing drugs.
The new offenses are alleged to have occurred Sept. 6 and Sept. 27 in Waterville.
She is charged with three counts of aggravated trafficking in scheduled drugs and one count of violation of condition of release, all Sept. 6.
A separate complaint charges her with four counts of aggravated trafficking in scheduled drugs, and one count each of conspiracy to commit trafficking, unlawful possession of drugs and violation of condition of release, all Sept. 27.
Both of those complaints list a Portland address for her.

Sen. Collins answers grandma's life-or-death questions

Texto completo: She could have simply waved. Maybe hollered out a few words of encouragement.
Instead, way back on July Fourth, as the annual holiday parade wound its way down Water Street in Eastport, Dianne Morrison made a beeline for Maine's senior U.S. senator.
"Do you have time for a couple of questions?" Morrison asked Sen. Susan Collins, whom she'd known and supported all the way back to Collins' run for governor in 1994.
"Walk with me," replied Collins. "We'll talk."
"And so I did," recalled Morrison in an interview Tuesday from her home in Yarmouth. "I wish more politicians were like her, to be honest."
They talked about -- what else? -- health care. And the strong possibility that coverage for pre-existing conditions would be weakened, if not rendered completely unaffordable, under various Republican-led schemes to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
But mostly they talked about Morrison's grandson, Zachary, who turned 12 at the end of August and has lived all his young life with cystic fibrosis.
Collins had last met Zachary as an infant. Now here he was with his grandmother and his mother, Stacey Morrison, his future entirely dependent on the coverage he receives through his mother's insurance policy.
"Without insurance, nobody (with cystic fibrosis) would survive," Morrison said this week. "They just wouldn't."
Two months ago in this space, Collins recalled how the same meeting with Morrison loomed large in her decision to vote against repeal on July 29.
Now Collins has done it again. And while it would be a colossal overstatement to suggest that Morrison's sidewalk lobbying alone put the steel in Collins' spine as she headed back to Capitol Hill, it nonetheless illustrates, now more than ever, the value in speaking up.
Truth be told, Morrison, who grew up in Eastport and returns there for its annual Independence Day celebration, is no fan of Obamacare.
She and her semi-retired husband, Eldon, saw the premiums on his employer-provided health insurance go up 34 percent in one year under Harvard Pilgrim -- with individual deductibles of $10,000 -- before they finally switched to something more affordable and hoped for the best.
That said, Morrison knows a thing or two about pre-existing conditions -- not only with grandson Zachary's daily regimen to stay one step ahead of his illness, but with other family members who have confronted prostate cancer, breast cancer and thyroid cancer.
"There's hardly a household that doesn't have a member in it who doesn't have a pre-existing condition," she noted.
Morrison also has followed politics long enough to know when our leaders in Washington, D.C., are truly representing the people -- and when they're not.
She still bristles even now, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reels from the outright collapse of the latest health bill and other fissures in his political pedestal, at the "disgusting" notion that he and a small group of fellow Republican senators -- all men -- thought they could ram through health "reform" with no real hearings, no involvement of the opposition party, no due process whatsoever.
"Mitch McConnell is 75," mused Morrison. "He's one year older than me. He should be home doing something else."
To watch McConnell and Collins in juxtaposition this week -- one descendant in his recent defeats, the other ascendant in her self-assurance -- is to appreciate what a pivotal time this is not just for the Republican Party, but for the entire body politic.
Uncertainty still swirls around the future of health care -- witness Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield's announcement Wednesday that it's pulling out almost completely from Maine's Affordable Care Act marketplace.
The daily news cycle pinballs from collusion with the Russians and confusion over tax reform to the delusion that "the swamp" is being drained when in fact it threatens to suck down the whole republic.
Yet even now, life goes on.
People still stand along a parade route, waving flags, hopeful that out of this simple act of patriotism, something good still might blossom.
Some elected leaders -- we're looking at you, Sen. Collins -- see their stock rise not because they followed the orders handed down by their political bosses, but precisely because they didn't.
And a Maine grandmother, worried about what will happen long after she's gone, steps forward to ask the simple question: What about my grandson? Who will be there for him?
Zachary, his grandmother happily reports, is doing fine these days -- thanks in no small part to his mother's diligence, since the day he was born, in ensuring that he takes his medication, keeps his lungs as clear as possible and gets the nutrition he needs to keep active and ward off the ever-present threat of infections.
"To see him, you wouldn't think there's a thing wrong," Morrison said. "He loves sports. He's tried them all. Basketball. Soccer, lacrosse -- lacrosse is his favorite. And this year, he decided not to do soccer. He said he was going to do cross country."
Proud of him? You bet she is.
But she also knows that many of the 30,000-plus Americans with cystic fibrosis are far worse off than Zachary and that recent strides in research and treatment, while promising, come with a huge price tag attached.
Call me cynical, but I'll bet that whatever discussion took place behind those back doors, as McConnell and his minions tried all summer to jury-rig a repeal bill, had precious little to do with the real struggles countless Americans face each day just trying to stay alive.
I also suspect that as they counted noses, cut sweetheart deals and desperately tried to keep their deep-pocketed donors happy, they failed to fully gauge the anger that this week finally stopped them in their tracks.
"I think America is really fed up, obviously," Morrison said. "People just want things done right. And these politicians aren't God."
Let's hear it for the grandmothers.

LePage calls back lawmakers for special session

Texto completo: AUGUSTA -- Gov. Paul LePage announced Friday that he is calling the Legislature back to the State House for a special lawmaking session scheduled to start Oct. 23.
"I am calling a special legislative session to address two time-sensitive issues," LePage said in a prepared statement. "First we must amend the recently passed 'food sovereignty' law to ensure compliance with federal requirements. The second critical issue is the need to fund the Maine Office of Geographic Information Systems, which was left out of the final version of the budget by the Legislature."
LePage, however, did not mention two high-profile issues: consideration of a bill that allows the state to tax and regulate the recreational sale of marijuana as approved by voters last fall, and legislation that would either repeal or modify a voter-approved law to move Maine to a ranked-choice voting system.
While the governor can call lawmakers back for specific reasons, he cannot control what State House leaders decide they want lawmakers to work on once they reconvene.
LePage said the state's recently enacted food sovereignty law needs to be amended to make it clear that local food sales subject to inspection under federal jurisdiction remain so, and that any food products intended for wholesale or retail distribution outside of the local municipality must be in compliance with all food safety laws. According to LePage, the changes would permit the state to continue its system of local inspection, rather than compelling federal inspectors to take over.
"We will not be able to continue growing the local food sector of our rural economy by subjecting Maine farms and businesses to inspectors and regulations based in Washington. If the state program is eliminated, small farms will lose the most," LePage said.
LePage also contends that the Legislature failed to restore funding to operate the Maine Office of Geographic Information Systems. MEGIS currently is operating on money that was carried forward from the previous fiscal year. Some State House leaders have said they believe the office is covered in another portion of the state budget recently enacted.
"If the Legislature does not appropriate money to state agencies to properly fund MEGIS, funding will dry up before November. If this happens, the future of MEGIS and the state's ability to adequately provide GIS services will be in extreme jeopardy," LePage said.

Texto completo: A progress update on the West Gardiner rod and gun club.
WEST GARDINER -- The shooting range is quiet for now, but as the calendar ticks closer to the opening day of deer season, the members of the West Gardiner Rod & Gun Club expect that to change.
For years, members came to the shooting range behind the club in the fall to test their guns for the coming hunting season in a field with a couple of bunkers and some aging shooting stations.
This year, they'll see the results of weeks of summertime labor -- a 60-foot wide shooting range enclosed on three sides by concrete block walls that are 2 feet thick and 8 feet high. Each of the blocks, made by Auburn Concrete, weighs 3,600 pounds, and they made to interlock, like huge LEGO blocks.
The fourth side is a 20-foot-tall berm covered with a layer of ballistic sand. Access to the facility behind the clubhouse on Collins Mills Road is controlled by gates in a chain-link fence for either people or heavy equipment. "A tremendous amount of work went into this," club President Scott Farnum said on Friday. "There's 2 feet of crushed stone under the walls."
"We had to dig a trench for the crushed stone, and we put in some drainage tiles," club Treasurer Paul Okerholm said.
"It looks like a shooting range now, rather than an open field," Farnum said.
The work is not quite done yet. A soundproofed building that will house shooting stations is expected to be built next year; the slab for the building was poured just last week.
And the security and surveillance system has yet to be installed. Money for that comes from an NRA Foundation grant, funded by events held in Maine and sponsored by the Maine Friends of the NRA.
The Maine Department of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife was awarded a five-year Range Access Improvement Grant in 2012 from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to support efforts to develop or improve recreational firearm and archery shooting opportunities and promote accessibility to those facilities. The West Gardiner club also took advantage of that money.
Club members embarked on the project after securing $70,000 from the state and the foundation. To meet the match requirements of the grants, club members donated labor to complete the project.
David Trahan, executive director of the Sportsman's Alliance of Maine, said some clubs are dying out and others have become more active. Fish and game clubs across Maine vary in size from a couple dozen members to a couple thousand members.
Some clubs are old, established long before modern technology and regulation, he said. Many of those clubs are making improvements, thanks to the Pitman-Robertson Funds, which are excise taxes collected on guns, ammunition and hunting gear and funneled back to states to fund conservation efforts.
Mark Latti, spokesman for Inland Fisheries & Wildlife, said states receive those funds on a per capita and per license basis.
"We've dedicated a portion of those funds for range access grants and improvement projects," Latti said. "We started those in 2013 and awarded grants through 2017."
Next year, he said, the department will allocate a portion of grant money to the state's own shooting range in the Summerhaven gravel pits for a large-scale improvement project.
Trahan said the funds have made significant improvements in safety. He has not heard whether the state will continue the grant program.
"If that money dries up, our organization will be seeking state money to do the same thing," he said.
The goal of all of this work, Farnum said, is to gain more members to help support the club and its operations. The club now has about 200 members.
He and other club members have visited other ranges, which may have set apart their shooting ranges from the land around them with wires strung on poles, and he thinks West Gardiner has a lot to offer.
One way to get people onto the range is during public access events, required by Inland Fisheries & Wildlife, when the public may use the facility.
The club has both a Facebook page and a website, wgrg.org, where information on public access times will be posted. It also will post a sign in a visible location on the grounds to let people know.
In the meantime, the club will rely on its annual hunters' breakfast, scheduled for 4 a.m. to 9 a.m. on Oct. 28 to raise money and bring people through the door.

Texto completo: BATH -- The secretary of the Navy reaffirmed the federal government's commitment to Bath Iron Works on Friday and said the military must work with shipyards to expand capacity as the Navy seeks to grow its fleet.
"We have great faith in Bath -- Bath-built, best built -- and we look forward to this relationship growing and even becoming stronger from a base that is historically monumental," Navy Secretary Richard Spencer said.
Spencer toured BIW for the first time Friday, one day after the Navy announced contracts for two additional destroyers at the shipyard. The contracts provide funding for the fifth Arleigh Burke-class destroyer as part of a five-ship contract awarded to BIW in 2013, as well as for a sixth ship negotiated by the Navy, BIW parent company General Dynamics and Maine's congressional delegation.
Speaking with reporters before his tour, Spencer said the Navy "definitely" needs a larger fleet, given the threats facing the nation and the importance of having ships deployed around the globe. With their powerful radar and armament systems, Arleigh Burke-class destroyers provide both offensive capabilities and the ability to track and destroy short- to intermediate-range ballistic missiles.
"We are not at war, because that is a technical (decision) that Congress has to demand; but I will tell you that we are in combat around the globe," Spencer said. "Our uniformed service members and their civilian teammates are fighting on many fronts. These threats, we don't see them diminishing in any way. The Navy-Marine Corps team needs to have these platforms prepared for power projection."
The Navy and the Trump administration have called for building toward a 355-ship fleet, up from fewer than 300 ships today. Such an expansion would be costly, however. A recent analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service estimated that a 350-ship Navy would require $3.5 billion to $4 billion in additional funding every year over the 30-year build-out period.
BIW and its competitor shipyard for building Navy destroyers, Huntington Ingalls in Mississippi, are both under intense pressure to hold down costs on Arleigh Burke destroyers that each carry a price tag estimated at $1.8 billion. But Spencer said the Navy has a responsibility "to work with our suppliers as a partnership" to reduce costs and ensure the industrial base has the capacity to build additional ships.
Six destroyers are in various stages of construction in Bath -- four Arleigh Burke-class ships and two Zumwalt-class stealth destroyers.
"This is where we are going to be working alongside Bath and General Dynamics ... to see how, in fact, we grow going forward," Spencer said. "We can't simply sit here and mandate, 'We want ships built.' We have to understand what the actual industrial base can support and where capacity is. Where we can help to expand capacity in lockstep with our suppliers, our contractors, we will do so."
Two destroyers built at BIW, the USS Fitzgerald and the USS John S. McCain, were involved recently in collisions that killed 17 sailors. The incidents prompted a systemwide review of culture, training and maintenance in a Navy fleet that experts say is increasingly stretched thin. Spencer said reviews of those incidents are ongoing but that the Navy also is reaching out to the maritime community and private companies for ideas on improving safety.
The Navy awarded the contract to repair the Fitzgerald to BIW's competitor, Huntington Ingalls, a decision that disappointed BIW officials and members of Maine's congressional delegation. Spencer said the Navy still is analyzing where to repair the McCain, which sustained less damage than the Fitzgerald.
"We have not come to a conclusion," Spencer said. "The primary driver, though, is how can we get it back into the fleet as soon as possible. This is a critical part of the ballistic missile defense system."
With roughly 6,000 workers, BIW is one of Maine's largest private employers and is one of two shipyards that build the guided-missile destroyers that are considered the workhorses of the Navy fleet. Spencer addressed members of BIW's workforce later Friday.
All four members of Maine's congressional delegation -- Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King and Reps. Chellie Pingree and Bruce Poliquin -- joined Spencer at BIW on Friday, along with BIW President Dirk Lesko. The delegation members each had worked on different aspects of securing authorization or funding for the two additional destroyer awards announced Thursday, and they thanked Spencer for his personal commitment to finalizing the two contracts.
"That demonstrates the Navy's commitment to BIW and its confidence in its highly skilled workforce," said Collins, a Republican member of the Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, which earmarks money for shipbuilding. "You noticed that the secretary already knows that 'Bath-built is best built.' The contracts will help to strengthen our fleet and allow the Navy to promote civility and security in the face of proliferating threats around the globe."
King, an independent who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee, told Spencer that he is always welcome to visit Bath.
"And now that you've established the precedent, bring a couple of destroyers with you," King said. "We'd love to have you."

Texto completo: Governor says Maine needs project to cut energy costs, but observers question idea
FALMOUTH -- Frustrated by failed attempts to expand natural gas capacity greatly in New England, Gov. Paul LePage said Thursday that he wants to develop a new pipeline from Quebec into Maine in an effort to lower energy prices for homes and businesses.
"We cannot move forward as a state without more pipeline capacity," LePage told a meeting of industry professionals and other business people at the fifth annual Natural Gas Conference, held at The Woodlands Club in Falmouth.
LePage told the group he plans to meet with officials in Quebec in the next month or so. In subsequent comments to the Portland Press Herald, LePage said the province is interested in a new gas line that could bring supply from western Canada through Maine.
"The Canadians want to help," he said.
Attempts to reach the Canadian Consulate General in Boston were unsuccessful Thursday.
LePage's energy office is in contact with the consulate, which is led by David Alward, a former New Brunswick premier. LePage supported Alward's attempts to bring a proposed crude oil pipeline from western Canada to New Brunswick.
Maine officials have been trying for years to expand pipeline capacity in an effort to ease the hefty price differential that the state's manufacturers pay for energy, compared to their competitors in the Southeast and Midwest.
Those efforts largely have been stalled by public and political opposition to building new pipelines to the south, notably in Massachusetts.
Maine is affected because the lines that bring lower-cost natural gas from Pennsylvania and New York first must pass through Massachusetts, supplying homes, businesses and power plants along the way. On the coldest days, there's not enough gas to meet all the region's demand, causing prices to spike.
At the same time, environmental groups in Maine have been fighting pipeline expansions, favoring investments in efficiency, wind and solar power.
LePage provided no details about his proposal. But any new pipeline would take hundreds of millions of dollars in investment, commitments from end users and years of studies and permits, leading some experts at the conference to say the governor's idea is unrealistic. They also noted that a pipeline from Quebec through Maine already exists -- the 18-year-old Portland Natural Gas Transmission System, or PNGTS, which runs 143 miles from the border to Westbrook.
Representatives from PNGTS at the conference declined to comment. But Scott Castleman, a natural gas spokesman for part-owner TransCanada, said that while his company is always looking for ways to meet demand in the United States, he wasn't aware of TransCanada's participation in meetings with LePage.
PNGTS is completing a smaller expansion, called Continent to Coast, which is set to go into service this fall.
Whatever its validity, LePage's vision reflects a growing resignation among some Maine officials that opposition to new pipelines in southern New England will continue to block access to greater quantities of low-cost gas from Appalachian shale deposits.
In his remarks to the gas group, LePage blamed "liberals" who have pushed policies to subsidize wind and solar energy for Maine's above-average electric costs, noting that nearly half of the state's electricity is generated by gas.
LePage also acknowledged the transition in the forest products industry that has led to five paper mill closings in three years. But he suggested the paper industry can reinvent itself and make other goods, such as packaging, if natural gas costs could be lowered.
If a new pipeline from Quebec has a role in that, it wasn't clear to some experts who gave presentations at the conference.
"You wouldn't build a new pipeline. It wouldn't make sense," said Rich Silkman, a founder and partner at Competitive Energy Services.
Silkman was a principal in the group that extended gas pipelines to the Kennebec Valley in 2010, which were later taken over by Summit Natural Gas of Maine. Silkman also said lower oil prices would make it hard to raise capital for any large natural gas expansion.
"The world is different today than it was five years ago," Silkman said.
Stephen Leahy, vice president of policy and analysis at the Northeast Gas Association, said LePage was "thinking outside the box" on gas supply to the region, but that businesses would have to sign contracts to underwrite costs.
"It's interesting and encouraging that the governor is looking to bring new capacity into the state," he said.

Texto completo: Defense rested Thursday after defendant Timothy Danforth chose not to testify
FARMINGTON -- Murder defendant Timothy Danforth chose not to take the stand Thursday on the fourth day of his trial.
Danforth, 25, of Farmington, formerly of Wilton, is accused of shooting Michael Reis, 24, of New Sharon three times with a shotgun June 1, 2016, when payment for a bag of marijuana and a barrage of text messages escalated into a deadly confrontation at the home of Danforth's father, Robert Danforth, at 259 Weld Road in Wilton.
After the state rested its case Thursday against Danforth, defense attorney Sarah Glynn asked Justice William Stokes for a Rule 29 judgment of acquittal, a motion based on the evidence being insufficient to sustain a conviction, according to Maine law.
Stokes denied the request, saying it was a question for the jury of whether the state had met the burden of proving Danforth had intentionally or unknowingly caused the death of Michael Reis.
The defense rested and called no witnesses.
Assistant Attorney General Robert "Bud" Ellis, prosecuting for the state, and Danforth's co-counsels, Glynn and Jeffrey Wilson, were expected to give their closing arguments Friday morning before the case goes to the jury.
During her testimony Thursday, Detective Jennifer King, of the Maine State Police Major Crimes Unit, identified several items and photographs from the scene as evidence.
A 12-gauge Savage model 320-pump shotgun was found in a bedroom and two handguns were on a bed in the room. Photos showed two bats, a baton and a box of shotgun shells in the living area; Twisted Tea and beer cans in the kitchen; and expelled shells and red stains on the porch.
Also admitted as evidence were photographs of the space where Kayla Gordon's Subaru was believed to have been parked on Weld Road; a wrench with blood on it found at the end of the driveway; golf clubs, one in the front seat, one in back; a bat in the hatchback area; and more wrenches and Twisted Tea cans inside the vehicle.
King said the red wrench with blood was in Gordon's car and was pulled out to get Reis into the vehicle, according to what Zachary Uhlman told her.
Uhlman was given a bag of marijuana by Robert Danforth and problems arose when he failed to pay for it.
The defense attorneys questioned placement of the items in the Subaru and whether they were tested before being returned to Gordon.
Four people rode in the back seat from a party on Main Street to the golf course and Robert Danforth's nearby home, so someone would have known the golf club was there, Glynn said.
"There was access to something that could be used as a weapon from every seat of the car," she said.
There were also questions about the car being left unattended at the hospital parking lot for about five hours, the items inventoried and then given back to Gordon. She also questioned whether a person, asleep in the front seat, who got out and walked home, was investigated and his home searched.
Kimberly James, a firearms examiner from the Maine State Police Crimes Unit, described testing the shotgun and the distance between the muzzle and Reis' wounds according to powder residue and a lead type of soot.
Wounds to Reis' foot and thigh were not made from within 2 feet of the muzzle, she said. The wound to the shoulder was within 12 to 24 inches. The first wounds probably occurred as Reis came toward the Danforths on the porch and the last hit to the shoulder as he was going down, she said.
According to King, witness Matthew Kerr, during an initial interview, said Robert Danforth was at the top of the steps and Timothy in front of the door to the trailer. During a second interview in August, Kerr said Robert was by the door and Timothy was by a gas grill on the porch.
The state also called Christine Waterhouse, a forensic DNA analyst with the Maine State Police Crime Lab, to the stand.
Waterhouse described connecting blood stains on the porch to Reis by a DNA profile.
She said she also identified the blood on the wrench as mostly Reis' with a little DNA from someone else. There was not enough to make an identification.
He went on to ask her whether she had tested other items from the car, such as Twisted Tea cans, a marijuana pipe, gloves, the bat and golf clubs. She said no such tests were requested.
There was no reason to fingerprint or do DNA tests on the golf clubs and wrenches, King said during her testimony.
The state asked how Reis' DNA could have been on the wrench. Waterhouse said there were multiple ways, including his blood being on the hands of someone who touched the wrench.
The defense played 911 calls made by both Robert and Timothy Danforth that night. Robert Danforth made two calls to a Wilton police officer earlier in the evening.
In the 911 calls, both Danforths said they had never seen Reis before and didn't know who he was. Robert Danforth told a dispatcher he had told the visitors to "get off my porch three times."
During his testimony, Chief Medical Examiner Mark Flomenbaum said toxicology tests indicated Reis had a 0.095 percent blood-alcohol content.

Texto completo: A progress update on the West Gardiner rod and gun club.
WEST GARDINER -- The shooting range is quiet for now, but as the calendar ticks closer to the opening day of deer season, the members of the West Gardiner Rod & Gun Club expect that to change.
For years, members came to the shooting range behind the club in the fall to test their guns for the coming hunting season in a field with a couple of bunkers and some aging shooting stations.
This year, they'll see the results of weeks of summertime labor -- a 60-foot wide shooting range enclosed on three sides by concrete block walls that are 2 feet thick and 8 feet high. Each of the blocks, made by Auburn Concrete, weighs 3,600 pounds, and they made to interlock, like huge LEGO blocks.
The fourth side is a 20-foot-tall berm covered with a layer of ballistic sand. Access to the facility behind the clubhouse on Collins Mills Road is controlled by gates in a chain-link fence for either people or heavy equipment. "A tremendous amount of work went into this," club President Scott Farnum said on Friday. "There's 2 feet of crushed stone under the walls."
"We had to dig a trench for the crushed stone, and we put in some drainage tiles," club Treasurer Paul Okerholm said.
"It looks like a shooting range now, rather than an open field," Farnum said.
The work is not quite done yet. A soundproofed building that will house shooting stations is expected to be built next year; the slab for the building was poured just last week.
And the security and surveillance system has yet to be installed. Money for that comes from an NRA Foundation grant, funded by events held in Maine and sponsored by the Maine Friends of the NRA.
The Maine Department of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife was awarded a five-year Range Access Improvement Grant in 2012 from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to support efforts to develop or improve recreational firearm and archery shooting opportunities and promote accessibility to those facilities. The West Gardiner club also took advantage of that money.
Club members embarked on the project after securing $70,000 from the state and the foundation. To meet the match requirements of the grants, club members donated labor to complete the project.
David Trahan, executive director of the Sportsman's Alliance of Maine, said some clubs are dying out and others have become more active. Fish and game clubs across Maine vary in size from a couple dozen members to a couple thousand members.
Some clubs are old, established long before modern technology and regulation, he said. Many of those clubs are making improvements, thanks to the Pitman-Robertson Funds, which are excise taxes collected on guns, ammunition and hunting gear and funneled back to states to fund conservation efforts.
Mark Latti, spokesman for Inland Fisheries & Wildlife, said states receive those funds on a per capita and per license basis.
"We've dedicated a portion of those funds for range access grants and improvement projects," Latti said. "We started those in 2013 and awarded grants through 2017."
Next year, he said, the department will allocate a portion of grant money to the state's own shooting range in the Summerhaven gravel pits for a large-scale improvement project.
Trahan said the funds have made significant improvements in safety. He has not heard whether the state will continue the grant program.
"If that money dries up, our organization will be seeking state money to do the same thing," he said.
The goal of all of this work, Farnum said, is to gain more members to help support the club and its operations. The club now has about 200 members.
He and other club members have visited other ranges, which may have set apart their shooting ranges from the land around them with wires strung on poles, and he thinks West Gardiner has a lot to offer.
One way to get people onto the range is during public access events, required by Inland Fisheries & Wildlife, when the public may use the facility.
The club has both a Facebook page and a website, wgrg.org, where information on public access times will be posted. It also will post a sign in a visible location on the grounds to let people know.
In the meantime, the club will rely on its annual hunters' breakfast, scheduled for 4 a.m. to 9 a.m. on Oct. 28 to raise money and bring people through the door.

Texto completo: A rare steer that escaped from its stall last week at the Common Ground Country Fair in Unity and eluded capture was found by its owner Wednesday night.
Jason Stutheit, who owns Pond Hill Farms in Brooks, said he found the Wagyu steer in a field near the fairgrounds while searching with his son.
ï¿½He was with another herd grazing,ï¿½ Stutheit said.
The steer, a Japanese breed of beef cattle known for its marbled meat, first got away from Stutheit and his daughter when they were dropping it off at the fair.
ï¿½He jumped out of the stall,ï¿½ Stutheit said. Steers are different from dairy cows and will jump and climb, he said. ï¿½Theyï¿½re just more agile than a dairy cow. They donï¿½t like to be pinned.ï¿½
The steer, called ï¿½970,ï¿½ or ï¿½70ï¿½ for short, even tried to climb over a 5-foot-tall panel while Stutheit loaded him into a trailer Wednesday night.
The 13-month-old managed to elude capture for days, traveling over an area of a few wooded square miles near the fair. During the day, he hid in the shade to keep cool.
ï¿½Imagine trying to find a needle in the haystack,ï¿½ Stutheit said. ï¿½A black cow at night, which is when theyï¿½re moving.ï¿½
Stutheit alerted all law enforcement agencies, he said, but the steer wasnï¿½t dangerous to the public, ï¿½just loose.ï¿½
To his knowledge, the two Wagyu steers he owns are the only ones in Maine. Theyï¿½ll be butchered when theyï¿½re about 3 and have grown to about 1,800 pounds.
ï¿½Weï¿½re trying to establish a market for them in Maine,ï¿½ said Stutheit, who runs a grass-fed beef farm that also sells Angus beef. The steer, whose meat goes for about $100 per pound, cost Stutheit about $4,000.
Despite the hassle 70 caused, Stutheit said he and his daughter enjoyed bringing their two Wagyu steers to the fair for the first time and they hope to do it again next year.
ï¿½Hopefully weï¿½ll do it again without an escapee stunt,ï¿½ he said.

Texto completo: Maine State Police will be demonstrating how drones can be used to investigate accident scenes outside MSP headquarters at 9:30 a.m. Thursday morning. I will speak with them about how they're using the drones, why and how they get around questions about privacy/proper investigative techniques. I will also try to reach a source at the ACLU for perspective on the legal guidelines around drone investigations.
AUGUSTA ï¿½ In the past, when two or more vehicles collided in a remote part of the state, it might have taken the Maine State Police more than 24 hours to travel to the scene, photograph the wreckage and process the images, to help determine what caused the crash.
But in early August, when a pickup truck crashed into a blueberry truck in the Down East town of Northfield, it took the agency far less time. Its investigators recently started using cameras mounted on remote-controlled drones to snap photos of crash scenes, along with software that stitches the digital images together.
After the Northfield crash, investigators ï¿½took 81 pictures, and it took 14 minutes, and theyï¿½re done,ï¿½ said Col. Robert Williams, of the Maine State Police. Without a drone, he continued, ï¿½that would have taken at least two hours at the scene and 30 hours back at the office.ï¿½
Williams was speaking Thursday morning outside Maine State Police headquarters as three drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles, flew overhead. For the last two months, state police have been using the flying, camera-mounted machines to document crash scenes, and supervisors from around the state were in Augusta to learn more about the technology.
ï¿½Itï¿½s just a way to bring a new technology to something that we have done for years,ï¿½ Williams said of the agencyï¿½s use of drones. ï¿½Itï¿½s no different than black-and-white photos becoming colored. This is a just a new way to take photos.ï¿½ Given how much more efficiently drones can capture images over a large area, the new technology has raised alarm among some citizens and groups, such as the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, which says it could violate the privacy of Maine residents if the appropriate protections arenï¿½t in place.
In 2015, those groups helped get a law passed that regulates the use of drones by Maine police. The law prohibits the use of drones in criminal investigations when a warrant hasnï¿½t been obtained. It allows drones to be used to photograph crash scenes. It also directed the Maine Criminal Justice Academy to establish minimum standards for any police agency that uses drones, including training requirements for operators and restrictions on the use of high-powered lenses and facial recognition technology.
Drones are still a rare technology among Maineï¿½s law enforcement community.
As of the summer of 2016, no police agencies in the state had reported using drones as part of their investigative work, according to an annual report that the Maine Department of Public Safety must file with the Legislature. And Scott, of the state police, said he is unaware of any other police agency using drones in the state.
A copy of the 2017 report on drone use was not available Thursday because the director of the Maine Criminal Justice Academy, John Rogers, was away on vacation, representatives said.
Maine State Police have used drones to take pictures at 18 crash scenes so far, said Lt. Bruce Scott, who commands the agencyï¿½s traffic safety unit. One of those uses occurred on Wednesday morning, when a fatal motorcycle crash closed an on-ramp to Interstate 95 in Augusta, Scott said.
The stateï¿½s overall highway death toll this year is 124, up 17 percent from the 105 reported during the same period in 2016.
Three members of Scottï¿½s unit have been licensed by the Federal Aviation Administration to fly drones, and they also have performed about 35 training flights, he said.
The state police have bought three DJI Matrice 200 drones, each costing about $5,000 and stored in protective cases.
To use them, the agencyï¿½s licensed pilots, who all have worked as crash investigators, must drive to the accident scene and assemble the machines. With a remote control, they can direct the drones and see whatï¿½s on-camera using a small attached monitor. The devices also include safety features, such as transceivers that alert the operators when airplanes are nearby and sensors that are supposed to prevent the drones from colliding with other objects.
On Thursday, Scott and others praised the ability of camera-equipped drones to document an accident scene quickly and help police reopen roads that have been shut down.
At this point, Scott said, the agency is using the technology ï¿½to augmentï¿½ its crash investigations, but he said that other opportunities could arise for the agency to use drones, as long as theyï¿½re legal.
He also dismissed the privacy concerns around drone use. The state police follow the rules that were included in the 2015 law regulating drone use, he said. And when a vehicle unrelated to a crash investigation is caught on a droneï¿½s camera, he said, the drone operators can remove that person from the final rendering of the photo thatï¿½s submitted to investigators.
ï¿½We just delete the vehicles out of the pictures,ï¿½ Scott said. ï¿½As you do your rendering, you remove everything other than whatï¿½s pertinent to your scene. ... We havenï¿½t had any issues or concerns with privacy violations, and I donï¿½t anticipate those being a problem. I really canï¿½t see it.ï¿½
Oamshri Amarasingham, advocacy director at the ACLU of Maine, questioned how practical it can be for the state police to crop unrelated individuals out of every photo taken at an accident scene.
There are appropriate situations for first responders to use drones, such as when firefighters used them at the scene of a Sanford apartment fire in June, Amarasingham said.
But Amarasingham, who helped get the 2015 law passed in Maine, also questioned what level of privacy protections the state police have included in their internal drone policy.
Scott and Maj. Christopher Grotton, who oversees the agencyï¿½s drone usage, did not respond to requests Thursday afternoon for a copy of the agencyï¿½s drone policy.
Earlier in the day, Williams said the agency based its program ï¿½word for wordï¿½ on Maineï¿½s statutes and the guidelines set by the Maine Criminal Justice Academy. The Maine State Police also follow a number of rules set forward by the Federal Aviation Administration, Williams said.

To use them, the agencyï¿½s licensed pilots, who all have worked as crash investigators, must drive to the accident scene and assemble the machines. With a remote control, they can direct the drones and see whatï¿½s on-camera using a small attached monitor.
The devices also include safety features, such as transceivers that alert the operators when airplanes are nearby and sensors that are supposed to prevent the drones from colliding with other objects.
On Thursday, Scott and others praised the ability of camera-equipped drones to document an accident scene quickly and help police reopen roads that have been shut down.
At this point, Scott said, the agency is using the technology ï¿½to augmentï¿½ its crash investigations, but he said that other opportunities could arise for the agency to use drones, as long as theyï¿½re legal.
He also dismissed the privacy concerns around drone use. The state police follow the rules that were included in the 2015 law regulating drone use, he said. And when a vehicle unrelated to a crash investigation is caught on a droneï¿½s camera, he said, the drone operators can remove that person from the final rendering of the photo thatï¿½s submitted to investigators.
ï¿½We just delete the vehicles out of the pictures,ï¿½ Scott said. ï¿½As you do your rendering, you remove everything other than whatï¿½s pertinent to your scene. ... We havenï¿½t had any issues or concerns with privacy violations, and I donï¿½t anticipate those being a problem. I really canï¿½t see it.ï¿½
Oamshri Amarasingham, advocacy director at the ACLU of Maine, questioned how practical it can be for the state police to crop unrelated individuals out of every photo taken at an accident scene.
There are appropriate situations for first responders to use drones, such as when firefighters used them at the scene of a Sanford apartment fire in June, Amarasingham said.
But Amarasingham, who helped get the 2015 law passed in Maine, also questioned what level of privacy protections the state police have included in their internal drone policy.
Scott and Maj. Christopher Grotton, who oversees the agencyï¿½s drone usage, did not respond to requests Thursday afternoon for a copy of the agencyï¿½s drone policy.
Earlier in the day, Williams said the agency based its program ï¿½word for wordï¿½ on Maineï¿½s statutes and the guidelines set by the Maine Criminal Justice Academy. The Maine State Police also follow a number of rules set forward by the Federal Aviation Administration, Williams said.

Texto completo: With Maine Sen. Susan Collins announcing her opposition to the Graham-Cassidy bill to reform Obamacare, she has slammed the door on this latest Republican effort to address our health care crisis.
I'm just able to muster up one word to capture my sense of Sen. Collins: Irresponsible.
Collins expressed her concern that the bill would "open the door for states to weaken protection for people with pre-existing conditions."
What insight does Collins thinks she has that the 48 Republican Senators who support the bill don't grasp?
Graham-Cassidy does give flexibility to states to seek a waiver on the federal requirement to cover pre-existing conditions. However, to achieve the waiver, states must demonstrate they have another approach for dealing with the problem.
The current situation simply causes damage to everyone. By forcing insurance companies to provide products that don't work economically, the companies have to either raise rates — which is what is happening — or withdraw from markets — which is also happening.
Graham-Cassidy takes a difficult situation and says, "It's clear we're not going to solve it in Washington, so let's turn it over to states and let each state deal locally with its challenges."
This is indeed what America is about. This is what the founders of the USA wrote into our constitution. A limited federal government, and the rest left to the states. And they were right!
But liberals, like Susan Collins, have upset the apple cart over the years and now we have a mess in Washington.
Collins should celebrate that Graham-Cassidy allows her to work with citizens in her own state with great latitude to solve these difficult problems locally. But like most liberals, instead of concluding that things are not working because the federal government is too big, she concludes it's not big enough.
Sen. Lindsey Graham summed up the current situation with precision when he said that his main concern is that "Obamacare is a placeholder for Berniecare." "Berniecare" is, of course, the national single-payer government health care that Sen. Sanders is pushing for.
Barack Obama was clear that's also what he wanted. But seeing that he couldn't get it, he opted for getting it through the back door by way of the Affordable Care Act.
With its vast array of regulations and taxes coupled with the huge expansion of Medicaid, Obamacare has been a major step toward a single-payer government system. Medicaid, which is a single-payer system for low-income Americans, now covers 73.5 million Americans, up from 47.7 million in 2008. Medicaid together with Medicare now has almost 40 percent of all Americans on government single-payer health care.
Graham-Cassidy is far from the ideal health care bill Republicans wanted to replace Obamacare. The problem is that once the nation gets put on welfare, once people get used to handouts, it is enormously difficult to change.
At least Graham-Cassidy turns things around in a serious way. Block-granting Medicaid, turning management of this program to local control at the state level, is a huge and important reform.
Maybe what's really gnawing at Collins is that the bill pulls taxpayer funds from Planned Parenthood, the nation's No. 1 abortion provider, which she loves so much.
Graham-Cassidy is a noble effort to improve our health care system, given tough existing political realities.
Collins, like Sens. John McCain and Rand Paul who said "no" before, is leading us to socialism. Without a change of heart, she hurts her party, her state and her country.

Texto completo: While virtually everyone knows and loves the classic story of "Peter Pan," Maine East High School's Fine Arts Department will present the show with a spirited, playful and modern twist at 7:30 p.m. Friday and Saturday, Sept. 29-30 in the school auditorium, 2601 W. Dempster St., Park Ridge. Tickets are $7, or $5 with a Maine East ID.
In the show, a young woman, Wendy, is visited by a magical boy named Peter Pan and his friend Tinkerbell. Together, they fly off to the fantastical world of Neverland, full of mermaids, fairies, lost boys and pirates. A battle ensues between the leader of the pirates, Captain Hook and Peter. But in this adaptation by Jon Jory, Captain Hook is female. What remains unchanged are the themes of good and evil, childhood innocence and the belief of never growing up.
The show runs for about 70 minutes and features both prerecorded music and live singing. In addition to the public performances, Maine East will present a private matinee to 800 first- through fifth-grade students from Franklin and Field Elementary Schools, of Park Ridge-Niles School District 64. Maine East has provided the elementary school students with a study guide that includes a crossword puzzle, word scrambles and fun facts about "Peter Pan" in addition to an explanation of the story.
Directing the presentation are Karen Hall and Konnie Kay Sherry. Technical direction is by Jessica Mitilineos; production assistance by Amelia Kmiec; costumes by Stephanie LaFontaine.
The Fine Arts Department Chair is Edward Eubank and administrative assistant is Lisa Disparte.
Twenty-six students are working crew; while the cast consists of: Wendy: Karisma Kohli; Peter: Palash Ranjit; Tinkerbell: Jasmine Moraga; Hook: Mayah Rotter; Smee; Hailey Hawkins; Narrator: Olga Grzehyk; Mrs. Darling: Rachel Zarembski; Mr. Darling: Krystian Kuprowski; Nana: Abby Garcia; Tootles: Akshar Shah; Nibs: Jacob Carrion; Curly: Myrrh Gobenciong; Slightly: Nick Muilaert; James: Erik Olijnyk; Ceccos: Iva Galic; Skylight: Penny Veneri; Silence: Cecylia Selwocki; Starkey: Kat Templo; Whibbles: Joanne Areno; Tiger Lily: Amanda Schaefges; Prince Nicu: Georfe Philip; Toma: Angelina Hermiz; and Radu: Arianna Romano.

Texto completo: In a twisted sort of way, author Stephen King can be a funny guy.
But keep in mind that his brand of humor could fall flat if you disregard his legendary career as the writer of iconic horror stories. And King's sense of humor is all but certain to get a warm reception in a room filled to capacity – with more than 700 of his fans.
That's what happened Wednesday night at Bard College in Annandale.
King was at Bard's Richard B. Fisher Center for the Performing Arts with his son Owen to discuss "Sleeping Beauties," the new book that the pair wrote together. The sold-out event inside the Sosnoff Theater was staged by the Fisher Center and Oblong Books & Music in Rhinebeck. And each ticket holder received a copy of "Sleeping Beauties."
Stephen and Owen King each read from the book and the father and son chatted with each other on stage. Then the house lights went up for questions from the audience.
"Look how beautiful this room is," Stephen King proclaimed, as the lights grew brighter, revealing the audience and multiple balconies. "I hope nobody falls."
The crowd erupted in laughter.
King added, "... because you would die."
The laughter exploded.
That was one of many moments at Bard College when Stephen King generated laughs. And it was one of many moments when the famed author revealed bits and pieces of his personality, some of which seemed out of place for the man who wrote such terrifying stories as "The Shining," "Carrie," "Cujo," "Salem's Lot" and "Misery."
With ease, King offered insight into his creative process. The Maine resident offered advice. And he spoke fondly of his family.
But above all, Stephen King embodied a timelessness, a relevancy and a sense of intrigue, all of which have fascinated millions of moviegoers and literary enthusiasts over decades, whether they got a tingle and a thrill from being scared or simply couldn't resist a good plot twist.
Underscoring King's relevancy is the film "It," which is based on his novel and currently in theaters, and the Netflix thriller "Gerald's Game," which is also based on a King novel.
Speaking of writing, Stephen King said, "One incident leads to another." He also said, "You have to be true to what you know" and "you also have to observe human nature."
Justin Brown, 32, drove from his home in Boston to see the Kings at Bard. He picked up his brother in New York City and the two were meeting their parents, who had driven from Ohio specifically to see Stephen and Owen King.
Brown was planning on driving home to Boston after the author program, because he had to work on Thursday.
"Stephen King is an amazing author," Brown said. "He really goes in-depth with the character work, really fleshing out the scene. It grips you."
Krista Miller of the City of Pougheepsie called King her "childhood hero."
"He builds emotions very well," said Miller, 28. "I do actually get scared when I read his books."
USA Today called "Sleeping Beauties" "The first epic collaboration between Stephen King and son Owen King" and described the book as "ambitious, heartbreaking and, when it comes to its central horrors, all too timely. Their novel 'Sleeping Beauties' is part enchanting fable and part cautionary tale, positing this 'what if?' notion: What if all the women in the world were to nod off to sleep and not wake up?"
The book started with an idea that Owen King – a Hudson Valley resident and novelist – had for his father. And an agreement to collaborate followed. The original plan was for a television show, but a book soon took shape. As the writing process unfolded, father and son left gaps in the story for the other to fill.
"When we started, I didn't know we would end up with something we wanted to publish," Owen King said.
He continued, "What was so exciting to me about it is, I'm 40 years old, and when you get to be my age, you've got your own family and you live in another state than your parents, you don't spend the time we got to spend together to do this and it was so exciting to be able to have this 10-month, year-long conversation about a book."

Texto completo: WEST HARTFORD -- Jim Calhoun says his favorite basketball memories aren't necessarily the national championship wins over Duke and Georgia Tech or the rivalry wins over Syracuse and Georgetown.
He remembers wins as a high school coach in Dedham, Massachusetts 45 years ago just as fondly.
With that in mind, the Hall of Fame head coach is almost going back to his roots at the University of Saint Joseph. The small, Division 3 program in West Hartford formally introduced Calhoun on Thursday as ...
Well, not as head coach. At least not yet. For now, Calhoun will simply be known as a consultant to the fledgling men's basketball program, which won't start up until 2018-19.
"I'm thrilled to be here," Calhoun said at a press conference. "I'll always be a Husky, but that doesn't mean I can't have another love, too."
While all signs point to Calhoun becoming the program's first head coach, nothing is official yet. It can't be. Calhoun is still employed by UConn, under terms of a contract he signed when he retired after 26 years as the Huskies' head coach in September, 2012. That contract expires at the end of March, 2018. Until then, it would be a conflict of interest for Calhoun to be coaching another college program while still employed as an ambassador for UConn.
So, for now, Calhoun is a consultant. Saint Joseph's announced on Thursday that former UConn assistant Glen Miller will be hired as a full-time coach, as well.
"There are a lot of people on campus that consult with people," UConn athletic director David Benedict explained. "Coach, at this point in time, is going to consult with St. Joe's as they approach having a basketball program. If, at whatever point in time, they change because of what his desire is, we can have that conversation."
It's clear, however, that Calhoun intends to be the program's head coach - at least for one season.
"I terribly missed coaching on a daily basis," he said. "Getting up at 6 a.m., getting on a bus to go to Providence, or when I was at Northeastern to go to Orono, Maine. It can be a cold, long day in December, but you get that win? Yeah!"
"I think at some point, that's going to be up to him," said Saint Joe's athletic director Bill Cardarelli, who was an assistant on Calhoun's first UConn team in 1986-87. "I think he misses it. He understands our mission here. Is it gonna be difficult? Sure. But we've got calls already from kids that want to play."
Calhoun said he'd love to bring in as many local kids as possible, but has already heard from some of his contacts in the sport from as far away as Israel.
"If you're a 6-8 kid and can play," Calhoun said with a wink, "we just might take you."
Saint Joseph's just decided to go co-ed in June. It is expected to enroll about 50 male students (perhaps more) beginning next fall. It is also starting up men's soccer, swimming & diving and cross country programs, to go with basketball.
Cardarelli, a New Haven native, reached out to current UConn men's coach Kevin Ollie, women's coach Geno Auriemma, Rutgers coach (and former Husky player and assistant) Steve Pikiell and others shortly after the school decided to go co-ed and add men's sports.
He met with Calhoun and asked him if he missed coaching. When Calhoun hesitated, Cardarelli immediately knew the answer.
"I'm intrigued," Calhoun eventually told him.
It's certainly an intriguing decision by Calhoun, owner of two national titles and 873 wins at the Division 1 level.
"I know he wants to be on the sideline," said Ollie. "I know he's gonna be involved in those young kids' lives. They've got a great mentor, a great second father figure, a Hall of Famer to look up to. He'll be a blessing to any kid, to even spend 10 minutes with him ... but him being out there day-to-day, being able to recruit will be great for St. Joseph, great for our state and great for the student-athletes there."
Added Benedict: "I'm supportive of Coach and his desire to impact young men. My dad was a coach, so I grew up in a household with someone who that was their passion. If Coach feels like he can go there and provide St. Joe's help in building their program, prior to them starting it, I'm happy for him to be doing that."
Asked why he thought Calhoun took the job, former Husky great and current CCSU head coach Donyell Marshall replied: "He's bored."
"He loves the game, he misses the kids," Marshall added. "We talk all the time. It's something that's in your blood, man. I think he'll be a great mentor down there. If he ends up coaching, I think he'll be a great asset there. It's gonna be different, going from coaching All-Americans to coaching Division 3, academic kids. But, he loves challenges. He's always been that way. It's gonna be interesting."
Interesting, indeed. Intriguing, even. But there was Jim Calhoun on Thursday morning, in a small room on the bucolic campus of the University of Saint Joseph, taking over a brand-new, Division 3 men's basketball program.
"At 2, 3 p.m.," he noted, "I'll be in a gym some place, looking for future Blue Jays."

Texto completo: Give workers paid sick leave
While Sen. Rebecca Millett's bill -- LD 1159 -- requiring employers to provide paid sick days to their employees failed to pass in the Legislature, she helped to jumpstart a conversation throughout the state about the importance of providing the benefit to working people. In Portland, city councilors are considering an earned paid sick leave ordinance in Maine's largest city.
The proposal -- brought forward by the Southern Maine Workers' Center and Maine Women's Lobby -- has already gained the support of Mayor Ethan Strimling and several councilors.
The ordinance would allow workers to earn at least one hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours worked up to six days per year. Employers would not be required to pay employees for their unused time when they leave their jobs.
Nearly 200,000 Maine workers are unable to take a paid sick day, according the National Partnership for Women & Families, and they are forced to choose between coming to work sick or losing their pay -- something that many of them simply can't afford to do. For the rest of us, paid sick days are a public health issue, as we're exposed to the germs of workers in restaurants and other workplaces who are forced to come to work sick.
Earned paid sick leave is already the law in three New England states and more than 20 cities around the country. Portland should be next, leading the way for the rest of Maine to follow.

Smears used to silence debate
In 1966, when President Lyndon Baines Johnson and the Vietnam War enjoyed overwhelming public support, I read Bernard Falls book " Street Without Joy: Indochina at War." Overnight, I became an anti-war activist. My father, a college professor, insisted I had swallowed communist propaganda.
In his autobiography, Colin Powell writes: "I recently reread Bernard Fall's book, 'Street Without Joy' I cannot help thinking that if President Kennedy or President Johnson had spent a quiet weekend at Camp David reading that perceptive book, they would have returned to the White House Monday morning and immediately started to figure out a way to extricate ourselves from the quicksand of Vietnam."
Temporarily ignoring headlines that agitate us, and immersing ourselves in a transforming book, is like dunking your head in a barrel of ice water: it clarifies thoughts and calms emotions.
Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think-tank focused on fiscal and economic analysis of immigration policy, has written an equally profound book, " The New Case Against Immigration: Both Legal and Illegal." It's not a white nationalist rant, and it doesn't provoke animus. It's a thoughtful book that left me stunned by the information missing in our news, not unlike Vietnam.
Trigger warning: The Southern Poverty Law Center, a self-appointed authority on racism, recently smeared the center as a "hate" group. In the 1950s and 1960s, the words "commie" and "pinko" would silence your political opponent without any debate. Today, it's the word "hate."
Don't be deterred. Read the book. And make up your own mind.

Time to organize aid for Puerto Rico
It is my view that the U.S. government should activate every Air Force and National Guard unit on the mainland, while states may be prompted to organize drives of food, potable water and medicine to be taken to air bases in their states.
The donations could be organized by FEMA. The needed supplies could easily be airlifted to Puerto Rico and parachuted into every inaccessible region of the island. This must be done now while there is still time and hope.
We did this during the Berlin airlift of 1948-1949, and today's aircraft are far better than what we then dispatched. Also, we have fleets of KC-135s to refuel these aircraft over open water. What is the delay? The need is imminent and clear. May God bless Puerto Rico and its suffering people.

Put aside politics
Politics is a game the U.S. cannot afford to play, whatever the issues on that particular game board may be (health care, the North Korean nuclear program, immigration, education, employment, and so on). It doesn't matter the issues because just too much is at stake, with the bottom line in all these issues being people, the human element whose value cannot be quantified.
So, senators and representatives, let's get out of the game playing and start rolling up your sleeves to work together, regardless of who is on your team, what label they may bring to the table, or on which side of the table they may be. We need you to work as one team to tackle and come up with some real solutions to the very real problems we all are facing.
That's why we the people elected you and put our faith in you.

Stop sabotaging Obamacare
President Donald Trump and the GOP are playing politics with people's health care. By shutting down the enrollment website 12 hours a week during open enrollment, cutting back the advertising budget and reducing the enrollment period, they are making an effort to sabotage the Affordable Care Act.
As a veteran and a nurse, I find this to be shameful. Mainers shouldn't have to suffer because the GOP's mission is to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
There is always a political side to what is going on, but when you're deployed into a combat zone, you're not thinking about politics, you're trying to do your job and stay alive. I need Rep. Bruce Poliquin to do his job in Washington, D.C., representing Maine veterans like me.
When I joined the military, I swore to protect my fellow Americans. Poliquin took an oath of office to ensure the general welfare of those he represents. That's why I'm demanding that Poliquin represent Maine people and and make bipartisan efforts to stabilize rather than sabotage the Affordable Care Act. These are fixable problems.
If you aren't coming up with a solution you are a part of the problem. Right now, Poliquin is a part of the problem.

Texto completo: CARIBOU, Maine -- The Caribou Parks and Recreation Department's pee wee soccer leagues concluded with games played Sept. 18-25.
Summaries of the two World League matches, for grades 5 and 6, and the five Premier League matches, for grades 3 and 4, are as follows:
Colombia vs. USA -- USA and Columbia played to an exciting tie on Sept. 18. Jaden Picard and Brayden Brescia scored the goals for the USA and speedster Naliyah Love helped keep the pressure on the Columbia defense. Emily Fraser and Isabella Cherrier kept moving the ball upfield from their midfield positions. Joseph Peter Paul had another outstanding effort as goalkeeper as he turned away several good shots.
Brazil vs. USA -- In a match played Sept. 22, USA lost its season finale to Brazil in a game that was close until the second half. Edison Sleeper scored the lone goal for USA off a nice pass from Macie Towson. Gage Hale had several nice shots on goal as he was moved up to the striker position from his normal sweeper position. Braxton McCrossin, Jayden Fournier and Emmie McIntire played tough defense and helped keep the ball away from the USA end of the field. Calvin Hersey had another great game as goalkeeper by turning away some great shots by Brazil.
Galaxy vs. Revolution -- In Premier League action on Sept. 18, Caela Day and Faith Lagasse applied great offensive pressure throughout the match and Kadence Hafford played super defense for the Galaxy. Cayden Ala put two balls in the back of the net while Owen Corrigan and Lucas Belanger contributed one each.
D.C. United vs. Red Bulls -- Also on Sept. 18, D.C. United played a tough game against the Red Bulls, whose offense is very strong. The D.C. defense held its own with many great stops and saves. Landen Belanger scored a "hat trick" with three goals. The Red Bulls offense only put one in the net in the first half, with Declan Miller assisting Levi Cole. In the second half, both players switched roles with Cole assisting on two goals and Miller scoring four times.
Timbers vs. Revolution -- Ben Bouchard, the Timbers' leading scorer, notched a goal in the Sept. 20 contest. Excellent goalkeeping by Gage Theriault, who stopped several shots, and tough defense by Hannah Willey-Forbes, who cleared the ball multiple times in the fourth quarter, keyed the effort. Marshall Hersey had a strong debut on offense with Carter Carpine and Phoebe Butler pitching in on defense with Jade Cray. Seth Dubay and Taylor St. Peter were solid as midfielders.
Galaxy vs. Red Bulls -- This Sept. 20 match was close through three quarters as Lily McCrossin scored the first goal of the contest. Riley Williams and Jeremy Martin applied great offensive pressure throughout the game. Brock Gagnon played great in goal in the fourth quarter coming up with some big saves. In the fourth quarter, the Galaxy broke through with Lucas Cormier putting two in and Owen Corrigan and Cayden Ala also scoring.
The Red Bulls played extremely hard in this contest. Kody Tracy managed to get one by the goal line in the second half.
Timbers vs. D.C. United -- In the final night of soccer Sept. 25, D.C. scored all of its goals in the first half of action with Carsen Richards and Landen Belanger each putting two in. Bella Clayton and Mason St. Peter were great defenders in the first half, while Nikko Love and Landon Spooner controlled the midfield. Kaleb LeTourneau played excellent in goal.
Timbers were scoreless against a tough D.C. United team, but Gage Theriault was excellent in goal and good ball control was displayed by Ben Bouchard.

Texto completo: The federal fraud and bribery investigation that stunned the major college basketball world earlier this week did not come as a shock to Maine's lone NCAA Division I men's basketball head coach.
"I was sad, I was not surprised," said fourth-year University of Maine coach Bob Walsh. "I think you'd have a hard time finding anyone involved in college basketball who could honestly say they were surprised.
"It's been talked about openly, the influence of the sneaker companies over the last 10 years or so. That influence was out in the open, and as far as the money side of it I think people naturally thought that there was money flowing somewhere."
Federal prosecutors announced Tuesday that 10 men -- including shoe company executives, sports agents and four assistant coaches at high-profile NCAA Division I schools -- were charged with using hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes to influence the choice of top recruits' schools, agents and shoe sponsors.
Assistant coaches arrested were from Auburn, Oklahoma State, Southern California, and Arizona, while South Carolina, while the University of Miami and Louisville also have been mentioned in relation to the case and several other schools have started internal investigations.
The most well-known casualty to date is Louisville coach Rick Pitino, who was placed on unpaid leave in the aftermath of the federal announcement and said by his attorney to have been "essentially fired."
Louisville athletic director Tom Jurich also finds his job in jeopardy after having been placed on paid leave by the school.
"I think it's just the tip of the iceberg," Walsh said. "I think when you look at what has been uncovered and hear what has been said, it's natural to think that (federal investigators) have a lot more information and that there's probably more players, coaches and schools involved.
"It's exposing an underbelly that is sad and unfortunate."
Walsh expects little if any direct impact from the case on low- and mid-major basketball programs such UMaine and its America East brethren.
"I don't think what's going on at Louisville or Arizona trickles down to where we are at the University of Maine," said Walsh, whose team next Tuesday opens formal practices for the 2017-2018 season. "I just think there's a huge gap, and the divide has only grown bigger with all the money there is in college athletics between the big schools that want to spend a lot of money on it and the smaller schools that maybe don't have as much invested.
"Fans of college basketball realize that that's the elite level and that and the low- to mid-majors are pretty far apart."
In the latest investigation, federal prosecutors say at least three top high school recruits were promised payments of as much as $150,000, using money supplied by athletic footwear and apparel company Adidas, to attend two universities sponsored by the athletic shoe company. Court papers didn't name the schools but contained enough details to identify one of them as Louisville, the other was Miami.
According to UMaine athletic media relations spokesman Tyson McHatten said UMaine's arrangement with New Balance is different than the deals between big-time schools and other companies.
He explained that New Balance provides UMaine with some of its athletic footwear and apparel, but that the university purchases most of those items from the company out of their respective budgets.
What impact there might be on low- and mid-major programs, Walsh suggested, may have more to do with the public's general perception of college basketball and the recruiting process.
"It affects us in that it's bad for the sport and it's sad," he said. "There are a lot of people you have to get involved with and get to know in recruiting that may not have the best interests of the kids in mind or may be looking for something personal, and I don't mean money but it could be standing or possibly being considered for a job down the road in college, whatever it is.
"Recruiting is filled with a lot of different people. It's not just mom, dad and the high school coach anymore."

Portland's new pro hockey team to be called Mariners

Texto completo: The name of the new ECHL franchise in Portland will be a familiar one to the city's ice hockey fans.
On Friday, it was announced that the league's new team, scheduled to drop the puck in the fall of 2018, will be named the Maine Mariners.
The name was announced at a news conference in Portland on Friday afternoon.
Mariners was one of five nickname finalists along with the Watchmen, the Wild Blueberries, the Lumberjacks and the Puffins. Ultimately, the city's hockey roots won over.
Colors and logos for the Mariners will be determined at a later date.
Lumberjacks had been used twice for two professional sports franchises in Maine, the Maine Lumberjacks of the Continental Basketball Association (1978-83) and the Bangor Lumberjacks, an independent league baseball team that existed from 2003-2004.
In June, Comcast Spectacor, the parent company of the Philadelphia Flyers and Spectra, announced that it had purchased the ECHL's Alaska Aces and had planned to relocate the team to Maine's largest city.
The ECHL's Mariners will fill a professional hockey void that was left at the Cross Insurance Arena when the American Hockey League's Portland Pirates abruptly departed for Springfield, Massachusetts, in 2016.
The ECHL, like the AHL, is a stepping stone for players to reach the National Hockey League. New England-based teams include the Manchester (New Hampshire) Monarchs and the Worcester (Massachusetts) Railers.
The original Maine Mariners began AHL play in 1977 after the Maine Nordiques folded following the 1976-1977 season. The team won the Calder Cup championship its first two seasons, and was affiliated with the Philadelphia Flyers.
In 1986, the Mariners relocated to Utica, New York, but an expansion team was approved and played under the Mariners' name and was affiliated with the Boston Bruins. The franchise relocated to Providence after the 1991-1992 season and was renamed the Providence Bruins, which today remains Boston's top minor-league affiliate.
The Pirates started their run in Portland in 1993 and, like the Mariners, brought the city a Calder Cup championship in its first year.

Texto completo: A fire broke out at Peaked Mountain Farm and Native Pollinator Sanctuary on Friday morning in Dedham that destroyed the homestead and another building and spread into the woods, according to a Penobscot County Regional Communications dispatcher.
When firefighters arrived, flames were already burning through the roof of the home, Dedham Fire Chief Craig Shane said Friday night.
"It expanded and caught the woods on fire," the chief said. "It was blowing up the ridge. The forest service said it burned two acres."
At least eight neighboring fire departments and the Maine Forest Service, who used a helicopter to drop water, assisted Dedham firefighters with the destructive blaze, which was reported at 11:21 a.m., the dispatcher said.
Peaked Mountain Farm, which sits upon Peaked Mountain, is located on Ellery's Lane.
The 180-acre farm is a Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association (MOFGA) Certified Organic Wild Blueberry Grower and Processor, as well as a National Wildlife Federation Certified Wildlife Habitat and Monarch Waystation.
The farm is owned by Gail and Daniel VanWart, who also operate the Naked Blueberry gift shop in Bar Harbor. A message left for the VanWarts was not immediately returned.
Shane said the couple was not at home at the time of the blaze, but they did have insurance. There are two cats missing, Shane said, and there was one minor injury.
"I got one firefighter with an ankle injury," Shane said.

Texto completo: BREWER, Maine -- Senior quarterback Anthony Sousa scored on a 1-yard run with 30 seconds left in the fourth quarter Friday night to lift Cony of Augusta to a 20-14 Class B North football victory over Brewer at Doyle Field.
The win was the third straight for coach B.L. Lippert's club, now 3-2 on the season. Brewer suffered its second straight loss -- both at home -- and fell to 2-3.
Cony trailed 14-6 entering the fourth quarter but drove 60 yards in five plays to tie the game on Logan Leadbetter's 5-yard scoring run and a two-point conversion pass from Sousa to Matthew Wozniak with 6:48 left.
Cony's defense held Brewer without a first down on its next two possessions, the second stop leading to the Rams taking over at their 45 with 1:56 left.
A pass interference penalty against Brewer soon advanced the ball to the Witches' 15 before Sousa ran 13 yards to the 2 -- with a personal foul penalty against Brewer moving the ball to the 1.
Sousa went off left tackle on the next play, initially being stopped after jumping toward the end zone but crossing the goal line on second effort for the game-winner as the Rams avenged a 44-34 loss at Brewer in last year's Class B North semifinals.
Sousa finished the night 15 of 26 passing for 212 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions, but key to Cony's offensive success was its balance as the Rams added 133 rushing yards on 24 carries. Leadbetter gained 54 yards on nine tries, while Jordan Roddy rushed for 49 yards and added 51 receiving yards.
Wozniak contributed four pass receptions for 89 yards and also had a pass interception and a fumble recovery on defense, while Reed Hopkins intercepted a Brewer desperation pass in the game's final seconds.
Wozniak's fumble recovery, at the Brewer 47-yard line on a muffed punt return by the Witches, led to the only touchdown of the first half.
Cony, which had been stopped at the Brewer 9-, 8-, 24- and 31-yard lines on possessions earlier in the half, went the distance in just four plays, with a 25-yard pass from Sousa to Wozniak helping to set up a 16-yard touchdown pass from Sousa to a wide-open Hopkins on the right side of the field to give the Rams a 6-0 lead with 50 seconds left in the second quarter.
Brewer came out rejuvenated offensively after intermission, taking the third-quarter kickoff and marching 80 yards in 20 plays, a drive that consumed the first 9:20 of the second half.
Andrew Kiley capped off the scoring march, scoring from the 1 with 2:40 left in the period and then adding the extra-point kick to give the Witches a 7-6 edge.
Cony had the ball for just 29 seconds on its next possession before punting, and Brewer then required just three plays to extend its advantage as senior quarterback Cody Wood found junior tight end Jacob McCluskey wide open along the right sideline for a 53-yard touchdown strike with 53 seconds left in the period. Kiley's extra-point kick made it 14-6.
Wood finished the game completing 14 of 26 passes for 189 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions. McCluskey made six catches for 86 yards.
Cony's defense limited Brewer's ground-oriented offense to just 117 rushing yards on 41 carries, with Bryant Kiley leading the way with 61 yards on 18 tries and Andrew Kiley adding 41 yards on 10 carries.
Brewer's defense recorded three interceptions, two by junior Brandon Glidden -- one on an option pass by Hopkins -- and the third by Wood.
Cony outgained Brewer 345-306 in total offense.

Maine soccer coach loses lawsuit over eye surgery

Texto completo: A Penobscot County jury on Friday deliberated just 10 minutes before ruling against Ashland's award-winning girls soccer coach in his medical malpractice lawsuit against a Bangor eye doctor.
Peter Belskis of Ashland sued Dr. Curt Young of Bangor in Penobscot County Superior Court in 2014, about 2 1/2 years after Young performed cataract surgery on Belskis' left eye.
Attorneys for Belskis claimed that Young failed to dilate the coach's eye in a follow-up visit on June 15, 2011, so he could not see that the coach was experiencing complications from the surgery. By July 2 of that year, Belskis' retina had become detached. Because of that, Belskis underwent a successful surgical procedure in Portland on July 7, 2011, to repair his retina.
Belskis can still drive and coach soccer, but he does not see as well as he did before his retina became detached, his attorney, David Kreisler, said. Due to his diminished eyesight, Belskis had to quit coaching basketball and now relies more heavily on his assistant soccer coach Holly Chasse to know what is happening on the field during games.
In his closing argument, the coach's attorney asked the jury of five men and four women to award Belskis medical expenses, as well as damages, but did not suggest a dollar amount.
"You must consider how impacted Peter's life has been," Kreisler said.
But Young's attorney, Mark Lavoie of Portland, told jurors Friday that the coach's eye was dilated at the follow-up appointment, according to a notation on Belskis' chart. The coach also signed a consent form containing a warning that a detached retina was a possible side effect of cataract surgery.
Lavoie said that Belskis' sight in his left eye now is 20/40, good enough for him to pass the eye test to obtain a driver's license.
"This gentleman got a good result," Lavoie said of Belskis. "This is a guy who continues to this day to coach and to umpire games. If his sight was that bad, somebody would have fired him by now."
Belskis was "disappointed" but "appreciated the opportunity to tell his story," Kreisler said after the verdict.
In December, Belskis was named New England high school girls soccer coach of the year in the small school division by the National Soccer Coaches Association of America.
Under Belskis, the Hornets went 14-0 during the regular season last year and won the state championship. The Hornets' record this season is nine wins and no losses.

Texto completo: AUGUSTA, Maine -- Gov. Paul LePage moved Friday to call the Maine Legislature in for a long-anticipated special session on Oct. 23, when lawmakers plan to take up a bill regulating marijuana legalization and conflicts around ranked-choice voting.
The proclamation issued by the Republican governor called them back for two other reasons: The legality of a first-in-the-nation food sovereignty bill challenged by the federal government and a possible budgeting oversight that LePage has said could defund a state mapping agency.
The Legislature can consider any issue during a special session and regulating Maine's new recreational marijuana market and solving constitutional questions around ranked-choice voting -- two laws passed by voters in 2016 -- are expected to be the focal points.
Earlier this year, lawmakers delayed retail marijuana sales until 2018 to develop oversight and taxation guidelines. A legislative committee endorsed a sweeping regulatory bill on Thursday that would place a 10 percent tax on retail marijuana sales and a 10 percent tax on wholesale sales between growers and sellers.
Ranked-choice voting may be a more pressing matter. In a May advisory opinion, the state's high court said it was unconstitutional in general elections for state offices.. Republicans want to repeal it, but Rep. Kent Ackley, I-Monmouth, has submitted a bill that would allow it to go forward in primaries and federal elections.
LePage made an August call for a special session after the U.S. Department of Agriculture said the food sovereignty bill -- which allows municipalities to regulate food systems -- must be changed to mandate that state officials continue to conduct meat and poultry inspections.
And the governor flagged a funding issue affecting the Maine Office of Geographic Information Systems and the Library of Geographic Information in August. On Friday, LePage said the funding "will dry up before November" if the Legislature doesn't act, putting it and the state's ability to provide GIS services "in extreme jeopardy."
But lawmakers have disputed that. On Friday, Rep. Drew Gattine, D-Westbrook, the co-chairman of the Legislature's budget-writing committee, said the agency is underwritten with a $110 million information services fund and that it "doesn't really seem to be an emergency issue," but he wants to hear more from the administration on it.

Texto completo: AUGUSTA, Maine -- Paul LePage isn't the first Maine governor to threaten to remove sheriffs.
He isn't even the first Republican to do it -- or the first one who ascended to the office from Waterville.
More than a century ago, Waterville lawyer William T. Haines narrowly won a two-year term as governor, promising to aggressively enforce Maine's alcohol prohibition laws as part of a dry Republican platform. Within four months of his inauguration, three sheriffs were gone.
LePage, a Republican and former Waterville mayor, did something similar last week when he threatened to fire two Maine sheriffs for not cooperating with requests from federal immigration officials to hold inmates past scheduled release dates without a warrant.
It didn't go well for Haines, who lost re-election two years later. But Maine law has changed a lot since then, making it unclear what process LePage would follow to remove sheriffs.
Haines' demands worked politically, but not practically. Maine passed a first-in-the-nation prohibition law in 1851. A watered-down law replaced it seven years later. Partial bans persisted until prohibition was written into the state Constitution in 1885.
Bars were still common, but Maine voted in 1911 to keep prohibition in the Constitution. In 1912, Haines -- a former attorney general, legislator and Kennebec County attorney -- campaigned on ramping up enforcement.
His dry candidacy amused The New York Times. In September 1912, it said he brought in a "not brilliant" $13,000 in liquor fines in his four years as county attorney while a Democratic successor collected $16,000 in one year. But he beat an incumbent Democrat.
In his inaugural address, Haines cast drinkers as pariahs. A man seeking work with "rum in his breath" would be doomed to "trampdom." A farmer coming home drunk was viewed with "contempt" by neighbors who would give the drunk's wife and children "pity and sympathy."
"All that remains is for the law officers, especially sheriffs, city marshals, and county attorneys, to do their duty and enforce this law in accordance with the oaths they have taken," he said, drawing applause from a large crowd as reported by the Bangor Daily News.
Haines' argument was powerful politically, but not practically. An "old resident" told the Times that while Mainers wanted an alcohol ban, "they do not want it enforced." But many in the religious community -- led by the Christian Civic League of Maine -- demanded it be enforced.
The BDN's local liquor coverage then was perfunctory. On Jan. 11, a front-page headline declared Millinocket "very, very dry" with praise for a Penobscot County sheriff's deputy. In March, it praised the Waldo County sheriff for a "clever capture" of Belfast whiskey-runners.
Haines then moved on four Maine sheriffs and a county attorney. In late March, Haines told the Legislature that he received complaints that led him to believe that liquor laws were "not fairly or honestly enforced" by officials in five counties.
He said the "most flagrant" case was in Cumberland County, but he also named sheriffs in Androscoggin and Knox counties. The Legislature asked for more information, gathered evidence and scheduled proceedings on two of those elected officials, the Penobscot County sheriff and the Androscoggin County attorney.
The hearings were lengthy affairs a joint session of the Legislature. Penobscot County Sheriff Wilbert Emerson had only taken the office in January and his lawyer said that he found conditions "deplorable," since alcohol had been "recognized as a legitimate traffic" around Bangor for 50 years. He gave examples of raids he attended as far away as Enfield.
It didn't matter. Lawmakers recommended that Emerson, Cumberland County Sheriff Lewis Moulton and Sagadahoc County Sheriff John Ballou be removed. The Androscoggin sheriff resigned. Knox's sheriff never made it to Augusta because he said he was quarantined for smallpox -- which Haines called "an artful subterfuge" -- and the county attorney wasn't convicted.
The three sheriffs were removed and replaced later that month by Haines and his executive council. Haines lost his 1914 re-election and things didn't get much better in Bangor -- by 1918, other governors removed two of Emerson's successors.
But Maine law has changed since then and it's unclear how LePage would remove sheriffs. In 1917, Maine took the Legislature out of the removal process, passing a constitutional amendment giving that power to the governor and his Executive Council -- a seven-member check on executives that was usually filled with ex-legislators from the majority party.
The last ouster of a Maine sheriff may have been in Kennebec County in 1926 -- again over liquor. A grand jury foreman did complain in 1951 that a Cumberland County sheriff wasn't enforcing gambling laws. It went to a hearing, but evidence was deemed insufficient.
Maine voters abolished the Executive Council after a 1975 vote that removed every reference to it from the Constitution. If a governor is going to remove a sheriff now, the Constitution requires a complaint and a hearing. It doesn't say what the hearing would look like.
Fast-forward to LePage, who enters his potential battle with sheriffs with that constitutional provision and a state law saying sheriffs have to obey his orders. Sheriffs say that holding inmates past release dates opens them to false imprisonment lawsuits.
If LePage tests his power, this issue is likely to be settled in court. While Maine's history is rich, it doesn't provide us with many answers about how that would go.

Arrests of immigrants without criminal records triple in New England under Trump

Texto completo: PORTLAND, Maine -- Arrests of undocumented but otherwise law-abiding immigrants spiked in New England during the first six months of Donald Trump's presidency, more than tripling from the same period last year.
Across the region, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents also detained more undocumented immigrants who committed crimes, but arrests of those without criminal records rose at a much higher rate, according to agency data obtained by the Bangor Daily News through a public records request.
The New England pattern mirrors the national arrest figures, and shows that the Trump administration is more aggressively targeting immigrants whose only transgression is living in the United States without legal status -- which is often a civil violation, not a crime. And it is reflected by enforcement in Maine, according to an immigrant advocacy group, despite the state's low rate of illegal immigration
"There is a general feeling of fear, anxiety and confusion in the immigrant communities," said Susan Roche, executive director of the Portland-based Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project. "Even for individuals who are not impacted by the new policies, there is a fear that somehow the laws will change and impact them."
Federal agents arrested 1,570 immigrants in New England and 77,974 across the country from January 20 to July 20, according to the ICE data. These figures far exceed the number of arrests during the same period in the final year of Barack Obama's presidency. Most of the increase is accounted for by more aggressive targeting of illegal immigrants without criminal records.
In New England, the arrests of immigrants without a criminal record more than tripled to 631, compared with 206 during the same period last year -- while the arrests of undocumented immigrants who committed crimes rose only 21 percent.
Across the county, immigration arrests for people who'd committed crimes increased about 20 percent, while the arrest rate for immigrants without criminal records rose more than 260 percent in the same period.
Both nationally and in New England, a majority of the immigrants ICE agents arrested during the first half of 2016 had been convicted of a crime. And an agency spokesman said that since 2010 ICE has arrested far more immigrants with criminal records than ones without.
But the increase in arrests of undocumented immigrants without criminal records accounts for 59 percent of the rise in national immigration arrests, comparing the first six months of Trump's presidency with the same period in 2016.
The national arrest count remains slightly lower than it was in the first half of 2014, one of the peak years of Obama's deportation push. But in New England, ICE arrested more immigrants with and without criminal records during the first six months of Trump's presidency than during the same period in 2014.
The ICE arrest statistics are not broken down by state, but most of the New England arrests were likely not in Maine, which is estimated to be among the states with the fewest unauthorized immigrants.
Nonetheless, Maine immigration lawyers have seen an increase in the number of immigrants arrested here. And many of these people do not have criminal records, according to Roche, of the Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project.
In pursuing immigrants who have committed crimes, ICE agents have also more frequently asked jails to hold people beyond their scheduled release dates.
In New England, ICE agents made more than 1,000 of these controversial requests during the first half of 2017, far exceeding those made in the last three years. Nationally, ICE made more than 78,000 such requests, dramatically surpassing the two previous years and rising to around the level hit in 2014 under Obama.
Last week, Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce became the first law enforcement official in Maine to say he would not honor these requests. Known as detainers, they have become slightly more common in recent months, Joyce said.
Federal courts have ruled that holding someone in jail beyond their scheduled release can violate their constitutional rights, but Gov. Paul LePage is trying to force Joyce and other Maine sheriffs to honor ICE's requests.
LePage has threatened to fire sheriffs who defy him, but seems hesitant to begin what would likely be messy and contentious removal processes.

Texto completo: BAR HARBOR, Maine -- Marina. Museum. Commercial fishing dry dock. Cruise ship pier.
A Town Council committee that toured the former Bay Ferries Ltd. dock on Wednesday had plenty of ideas about possible uses for the state-owned facility it is considering buying.
The Maine Department of Transportation, which took ownership of the dock after Bay Ferries ended its Bar Harbor service in 2009, would prefer that the property serve the area's transportation needs, Town Manager Cornell Knight said.
It will sell it to the town for $2 million if an investor is involved, $2.5 million if the town pledges transportation use for it and $3.5 million without those obligations, Knight said.
If converted into a marina, the dock could alleviate "tight" conditions in Bar Harbor, said Councilor Matthew Hochman, who took the tour.
"I'm sure that [recreational boaters] wouldn't mind having a facility separate from cruise ships," he said.
The committee has until early November to advise the council whether to buy the facility. The state's deadline for the council's decision is Nov. 30.

Texto completo: PRESQUE ISLE, Maine -- Tractor Supply Company will continue its successful partnership with National 4-H Council by hosting its semi-annual Paper Clover Campaign fundraiser for 4-H students Oct. 4-15.
Customers can participate by purchasing paper clover emblems during checkout. Donations, which begin at $1 and have no cap, fund scholarships that send in-state 4-H youth to 4-H camps, conferences and development programs, where they learn everything from animal care to civic leadership.
"We created the paper clover fundraiser because we know how important local 4-H groups are to protecting a way of life that's built around community and service," said Christi Korzekwa, senior vice president of marketing at Tractor Supply Company.
The partnership between the National 4-H Council and Tractor Supply has yielded more than $11 million to support 4-H programming since 2010. The spring 2017 campaign raised nearly $825,000, resulting in 16,301 scholarships awarded to youth attending camps or other leadership experiences.
Individual 4-H Clubs are encouraged to participate at their local Tractor Supply stores during the fundraiser. Many groups will hold bake sales, car washes and other activities to help boost donations.

Texto completo: BURLINGTON -- Three men have been charged in a large-scale, multidecade appliance scam that allegedly grossed more than $400,000.
Robert O'Neil, 70, of Woburn, Michael MacMillan, 49, of Reading and Keith Ryan, 44, now a resident of Connecticut, were arraigned in Middlesex Superior Court this week in connection with the scam, Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan and Burlington Police Chief Michael Kent announced Friday.
"This marks the conclusion of a lengthy investigation to identify not just the individuals executing this scam on the ground but also the individuals who were allegedly organizing and overseeing this scheme from the top," DA Ryan said in a statement.
The defendants allegedly defrauded victims by promising to sell overstocked large-screen deluxe televisions at deep discounts, according to the statement. The transactions were done entirely in cash in mall parking lots around the Northeast, and the TVs were never delivered.
They allegedly stole more than $400,000 from the unsuspecting buyers between 2008 and 2016, but the alleged scam goes back to at least 2000, authorities said.
The scam was mainly conducted at malls with Sears and Best Buy locations around Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire, including: Auburn Mall; Burlington Mall; Cambridgeside Galleria; Emerald Square Mall in North Attleboro; Natick Mall; North Shore Mall in Peabody; Pheasant Lane Mall in Nashua, N.H.; Rockingham Park Mall in Salem, N.H.; South Shore Mall in Braintree; and Square One Mall in Saugus. Other malls in Maine, New Jersey and New York were also targeted.
DA Ryan and Burlington police began a collaborative investigation in 2015 to identify the architects of the long-running scheme. Since then, many of the lower-rung associates involved in the scheme have been arrested and convicted with the help of police departments throughout Massachusetts and neighboring states.
From 2000 to 2016, the three defendants allegedly targeted small businesses, cold-calling owners identified through the Yellow Pages and online databases. One would call a business owner and represent himself as the usual UPS delivery person for that business, and claim that his brother, usually named "Henry Collins," was a longtime employee of Sears or Best Buy and could sell deeply discounted, overstock flatscreen TVs privately to special customers, but only in cash.
They also allegedly recruited "runners" who would act as store employees, even wearing store identification tags, to meet the victims. Once "Henry" and a victim struck an agreement, they would be sent to a store parking lot where they would give the runner the cash payment in exchange for a false receipt. The runner would tell them to move their car into the loading dock, enter the store, and they would disappear through another exit with the cash.
The defendants were each charged with multiple counts of larceny and conspiracy to commit larceny, and released on personal recognizance following their arraignment.
Clerk Magistrate Matthew Day ordered that O'Neil and MacMillan wear GPS monitoring devices and abide by a curfew. Keith Ryan is under supervision in Connecticut.
The defendants are due back in court Nov. 6.

Texto completo: STEVENS POINT-Robert Rama Williams passed away on Sept. 27, 2017. He was born to Ralph Rama Williams and Jeannette Gibson on Sept. 5, 1925, in Oshkosh, Wis. They soon moved to Neenah, Wis., where they lived with Bob's grandmother. Bob had a wonderful childhood in Neenah with track, debate, golf (caddying), the First Presbyterian Church and good grades. He graduated in 1943, and immediately enrolled at UW-Madison. He joined a Navy program which sent his unit to Oberlin College, Ohio, for further education.
After his Navy shipboard experience in 1945, he worked in Maine for a bit and returned with a wave of veterans to UW-Madison. Bob worked for the Department of Agriculture after graduation in 1949 and then became an editor at Gas Magazines at the suggestion of lifelong friend, Dottie Johnson Troller. Work, meeting deadlines, completing written articles became Bob's life for that time.
He accepted a job in public relations at the Kohler Company, Kohler, in 1951 and then moved to work in employee relations with Hardware Mutual in late 1952.
He and Mary Markham were wed in Janesville, Wis., in April 1950. They and daughter, Jennifer, became Stevens Point residents in 1953. In 1954 Bob's life was forever changed by contracting polio. His right arm was permanently paralyzed by the disease. However, his dream came true with the formation of his own public relations firm, Idea Associates, in 1958. It was his privilege to associate with many fascinating professionals in his endeavors in public relations; among them were Roy Menzel and John Koutre. In 1977, Charles Nason came home to Stevens Point from Appleton to be Bob's partner. Ann Garber was his stalwart and beloved associate for many years. Ann said, "our clients did not remain clients-they became Bob's fast friends."
His children, Jennifer (Crow), Markham (Merle), Sarah (Bersh) and Faith, were treasures in his life and remained so always. In addition to his work, Bob was passionate about planning trips and photography. He was rarely seen without his camera around his neck, capturing images of tropical beaches or at convivial gatherings. He and friends, Dottie and Bob Troller and Margo and Joe Melli, loved Door County and may be responsible for its population increase since the early 1950's when they began yearly vacations there.
Bob participated in many political campaigns. Among them were campaigns for Supreme Court candidates, William Bablitch, John Wilcox, Shirley Abrahamson, Annette Ziegler, and Ann Walsh Bradley. He and friends, Bob Froehlke and Bill Kraus, were believers in good government and helped many superior candidates including Melvin R. Laird and Lee Sherman Dreyfus.
Bob's public relations clients included the Marshfield Clinic, Parker Pen of Janesville, the Copps Company, vegetable growers, branch banking, Good Roads Association, and the UW Alumni Association. Melvin R. Laird asked Bob to help with the original Laird Youth Leadership campaign at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point.
Bob's career and life collected awards, including the distinguished service award from the School of Journalism, UW-Madison, the Quality of Life Leadership Award from St. Michael's Foundation, the Letters and Science Community Award, UW-Stevens Point, and the Significant Achievement Award from UW-Stevens Point. The Rotary Club of Stevens Point honored Bob for his educational efforts on behalf of post polio syndrome research and awareness.
His grandchildren include Abby (Colin) of Cottage Grove, Wis., Eli of Madrid, Spain, Frances of Madison, Wis., and Portland, Ore., and Gabriel of Hanover Park, Ill. Lucy Belle Green is his great-grandchild. He was preceded in death by his parents and granddaughter, Kelly Katherine Williams.
Other survivors include cousin, William Rock of Middleton, Wis., his four children and in Bob's words, his ultimate playmate and best friend, wife, Mary Markham Williams of Stevens Point, Wis.
Bob would like to thank his many friends, including the Hot Shot Club, the Stevens Point Country Club, Cardio-Rehab-Plover, Ministry Home Care, Frame Presbyterian Church, Heartland Hospice and Living Well Caregivers.
Family and friends will gather to share memories on Sunday, Oct. 1, 2017, from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the SHUDA FUNERAL CHAPEL, Stevens Point. A service will be held at FRAME PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH, Stevens Point, on Friday, Oct. 20, 2017, at 10:30 a.m. Memorial gifts may be made to UW-Stevens Point for scholarships, to UW-Madison for journalism students or to Frame Presbyterian Church to help the unfortunate.
Online condolences may be sent by visiting www.shudafuneral.com.

Navy awards BIW money to build two more Arleigh Burke destroyers

Texto completo: Bath Iron Works has been awarded a contract to design and build two Arleigh Burke class destroyers for the Navy, work that is expected to keep one of Maine's largest employers busy for several years.
BIW and members of Maine's congressional delegation announced the Navy's contract award for planning and construction of two DDG-51 Class destroyers on Thursday.
The Navy isn't releasing the value of the contract because it plans to award more contracts in the future and wants to make sure the bidding process remains competitive. BIW, which is owned by General Dynamics, competes for Navy surface combatant contracts with Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi.
"These contracts help to stabilize our business and are welcome news," BIW President Dirk Lesko said in a statement. "We are grateful to Maine's congressional delegation and Navy Secretary (Richard) Spencer for their efforts and leadership."
The Navy contract award was modified to include full funding for two destroyers, the DDG-126 and DDG-127, and will include funding for Flight III radar design upgrades on the DDG-126, Lesko said. The new, advanced radar is expected to significantly improve the Arleigh Burke class destroyer's ability to detect and destroy enemy targets, including ballistic missiles.
The Navy originally had wanted both ships built with the new radar system, which would have required a significant redesign of sections of the DDG-126, but members of Maine's delegation and BIW officials worried that integrating a complex radar system into the design would have proven more costly, with the Bath shipyard being forced to absorb additional costs.
Funding for the ship already had been awarded under a multi-year competition for DDG-51 class destroyers in 2013. Funding for the DDG-127 was approved this year by Congress under separate legislation, Lesko said in the statement.
'THE WORKHORSES OF THE NAVY'
Lesko said the Navy has decided to name the DDG-126 ship after Louis H. Wilson Jr., the 26th Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps. Wilson received the Medal of Honor for his actions during the Battle of Guam.
Lesko said there are currently four DDG-51 destroyers under various stages of construction at BIW. The Arleigh Burke destroyer is a multi-mission ship that offers defense against a wide range of threats. There are also two Zumwalt Class or stealth destroyers in production at BIW.
The amount of work at the Bath shipyard could drop off when the Navy takes delivery of the third and final Zumwalt-class destroyer sometime later this decade. The Navy and BIW have not provided a completion date for that destroyer - considered to be the largest and most technologically advanced destroyer in Navy history.
"These contracts to construct two new DDG-51 class destroyers in Bath demonstrates the Navy's commitment to BIW and its confidence in the highly skilled, hard-working employees at the shipyard. There is no workforce in the world better positioned to build these ships," Maine Sens. Angus King, Susan Collins and Rep. Chellie Pingree said in a joint statement.
"As the workhorses of the Navy, this destroyer's ability to deliver capability and presence has been demonstrated many times over. These ships will strengthen our naval fleet and allow the Navy to promote stability and security in the face of proliferating threats around the globe," the legislators said.
King, an independent, is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and Collins, a Republican, is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. Pingree is a member of the House Appropriations Committee. She represents Maine's 1st District.
In July, Pingree and her House colleague, Rep. Bruce Poliquin, R-2nd District, succeeded in adding an amendment to a defense bill that allowed BIW to build the DDG-126.
"I am extremely pleased with today's announcement and am thrilled for the thousands of hardworking Maine shipbuilders at BIW, who play an essential role in ensuring our nation's defense and strength," Poliquin said in a statement. "America's might around the world depends on these Maine workers."
NEWS HELPS OFFSET LAST YEAR'S LOSS
The news that more Navy work is heading to Bath comes at an opportune time for the Kennebec River shipyard. About a year ago the shipyard missed out on an opportunity to build a new class of offshore patrol cutters for the Coast Guard - a potential $10 billion contract, involving 25 ships.
Bath Iron Works competed for the Coast Guard cutter contract as a way to diversify its shipbuilding workload, which consists almost exclusively of Navy destroyers. The shipyard adopted leaner manufacturing operations and negotiated new labor contracts in an effort to lower its production costs.
But Eastern Shipbuilding Group, Inc., based in Panama City, Florida, won the cutter contract, a decision that threatened 1,000 jobs at BIW, shipyard officials said at the time.
BIW is state's fifth largest private employer, employing between 5,500 and 6,000 workers during the fourth quarter of 2016, according to state data. Employment levels can change based on the nature of the shipbuilding business, which has up and down swings.

U.S. Navy Secretary: 'We have great faith' in BIW

Texto completo: BATH -- The secretary of the U.S. Navy reaffirmed the federal government's commitment to Bath Iron Works on Friday and said the military must work with shipyards to expand capacity as the Navy seeks to grow its fleet.
"We have great faith in Bath - Bath built, best built - and we look forward to this relationship growing and even becoming stronger from a base that is historically monumental," Secretary Richard Spencer said.
Spencer toured BIW for the first time on Friday, one day after the Navy announced contracts for two additional destroyers at the shipyard. The contracts provide funding for the fifth Arleigh Burke-class destroyer as part of a five-ship contract awarded to BIW in 2013 as well as for a sixth ship negotiated by the Navy, BIW parent company General Dynamics and Maine's congressional delegation.
Speaking with reporters before his tour, Spencer said the Navy "definitely" needs a larger fleet given the threats facing the nation and the importance of having ships deployed around the globe. With their powerful radars and armament systems, Arleigh Burke-class destroyers provide both offensive capabilities but can also track and destroy short- to intermediate-range ballistic missiles.
"We are not at war because that is a technical (decision) that Congress has to demand, but I will tell you that we are in combat around the globe," Spencer said. "Our uniformed service members and their civilian teammates are fighting on many fronts. These threats, we don't see them diminishing in any way. The Navy-Marine Corps team needs to have these platforms prepared for power projection."
The Navy and Trump administration have called for building toward a 355-ship fleet, up from less than 300 ships today. Such a move would be costly, however. A recent analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service estimated that a 350-ship Navy would require $3.5 billion to $4 billion in additional funding every year over the 30-year build-out period.
BIW and its competitor shipyard for building Navy destroyers, Huntington Ingalls in Mississippi, are both under intense pressure to hold down costs on Arleigh Burke destroyers that each carry a price tag estimated at $1.8 billion. But Spencer said the Navy has a responsibility "to work with our suppliers as a partnership" to reduce costs and ensure the industrial base has the capacity to build additional ships.
There are currently six destroyers at various stages of construction in Bath - four Arleigh Burke-class ships and two Zumwalt-class stealth destroyers.
"This is where we are going to be working alongside Bath and General Dynamics . . . to see how, in fact, we grow going forward," Spencer said. "We can't simply sit here and mandate, 'We want ships built.' We have to understand what the actual industrial base can support and where capacity is. Where we can help to expand capacity in lockstep with our suppliers, our contractors, we will do so."
Two destroyers built at BIW, the USS Fitzgerald and the USS John S. McCain, were recently involved in collisions that killed 17 sailors. The incidents prompted a systemwide Navy review of culture, training and maintenance in a Navy fleet that experts say is increasingly stretched thin. Spencer said reviews of those incidents are ongoing but that the Navy is also reaching out to the maritime community and private companies for ideas on improving safety.
The Navy awarded the contract to repair the Fitzgerald to BIW's competitor, Huntington Ingalls, a decision that disappointed BIW officials and members of Maine's congressional delegation. Spencer said the Navy is still analyzing where to repair the McCain, which sustained less damage than the Fitzgerald.
"We have not come to a conclusion," Spencer said. "The primary driver though is how can we get it back into the fleet as soon as possible. This is a critical part of the ballistic missile defense system."
With roughly 6,000 workers, BIW is one of Maine's largest private employers and is one of two shipyards that build the guided-missile destroyers that are considered the "workhorses" of the Navy fleet. Spencer was expected to address members of BIW's workforce later on Friday.
All four members of Maine's congressional delegation - U.S. Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King and U.S. Reps. Chellie Pingree and Bruce Poliquin - joined Spencer at BIW on Friday along with BIW President Dirk Lesko. The delegation members each worked on different aspects of securing authorization or funding for the two additional destroyer awards announced on Thursday and thanked Spencer for his personal commitment to finalizing the two contracts.
"That demonstrates the Navy's commitment to BIW and its confidence in its highly skilled workforce," said Collins, a Republican member of the Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee that earmarks money for shipbuilding. "You noticed that the secretary already knows that 'Bath built is best built.' The contracts will help to strengthen our fleet and allow the Navy to promote civility and security in the face of proliferating threats around the globe."
King, an independent who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee, told Spencer that he is always welcome to visit Bath.
"And now that you've established the precedent, bring a couple of destroyers with you," King said. "We'd love to have you."

Texto completo: State ferries will continue to run to the islands. No information was available about ongoing road and highway construction projects. However, Associated General Contractors of Maine is telling members to prepare to stop work starting Monday. CEO Matt Marks said a shutdown would delay construction on current projects. Some contractors are worried they will not get paid for work they've already completed, and bidding on new jobs may be pushed back, he said. A prolonged shutdown could jeopardize entire projects, Marks said, especially in the case of bridge work that has specific work windows. "Any day we lose, especially if it is a nice day, is going to be very difficult to catch up on," he said.
Maine State Police will continue to patrol state highways, the Maine Warden Service will be on duty in the woods and waters, marine patrol officers will be on the clam flats and the drug enforcement agency will be on the job. Staffing also will be maintained at the state's prisons and in the Department of Corrections.
The state was working to pre-load money on debit cards used for public assistance programs such as food stamps and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families so that beneficiaries will not be without money during the shutdown, LePage said in an interview. The state's two secure psychiatric hospitals, the Riverview Psychiatric Center in Augusta and the Dorothea Dix Psychiatric Center in Bangor, will continue to operate. No information was available on whether child protective services workers or staff who process Medicaid or other benefit applications would be on the job in the Department of Health and Human Services. Legal advocates for low-income Mainers filed suit in federal court Thursday seeking to ensure that welfare benefits continue to flow in the event of a shutdown. The lawsuit seeks a temporary restraining order against LePage and Maine's DHHS requiring the department to continue issuing benefits as well as receiving and processing applications for MaineCare, food stamps and TANF.
Motor vehicles
Applying for a driver's license or taking a license examination or road test for new drivers will not be possible. All Bureau of Motor Vehicles offices statewide will close, as will the bureau's headquarters in Augusta. Most of the bureau's online services, including license renewals, will be working, but online permits for overweight or oversized vehicles will not be available.
Two other bureaus overseen by the Office of the Secretary of State - the Maine State Archives and the Bureau of Corporations, Elections and Commissions - will be closed.
Courts
About half of the state's courthouses will stay in business, with at least one court in each county open during regular business hours. But the courts will limit their activities largely to public safety issues, criminal matters and child protection cases. Civil and traffic violation cases will be postponed.
The courts will not be able to accept online payments for traffic tickets or court fines because court staff will be unavailable to revoke arrest warrants previously issued for failure to pay fines. The Bureau of Motor Vehicles will not be open to reinstate driver's licenses once fines are paid.
State parks and historic sites
The state's parks and historic sites will remain open, including Baxter State Park. The state has not specified whether lifeguards, rangers or other park and historical site staff will be on duty.
LICENSING AND permits
It was unclear which, if any, business and professional licenses would be available or if the state Department of Environmental Protection would be open to issue environmental permits. The agencies that handle these functions were not included on LePage's initial list of services, although a spokesman for the governor said several areas, including food and dairy inspectors, were still being reviewed.
Fish and wildlife
The Maine Wildlife Park in Gray and the Swan Island campground and historic grounds on the Kennebec River in Richmond will remain open. But it remained unclear whether fishing and hunting licenses would be made available for purchase or renewal, either online or from private vendors, which sell those licenses for the state.
Farms and forests
The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry firefighters will remain on duty on an on-call basis. Other functions of the department were left undetermined Thursday.
Unemployment, career centers, labor
LePage's initial list did not include any of the services, including applications for unemployment insurance that are handled through the Maine Department of Labor.
State workers
A shutdown will leave thousands of state workers without a job and without pay. Even those who are deemed essential will be working on trust and without pay until a new budget is in place. With about 12,000 employees, state government is one of the largest employers in Maine.
"It's a sad situation," LePage told television reporters. "And the people who are going to work are going to be working without pay because there's no money to pay them."
The Maine Credit Union League said many of the state's 58 credit unions would be offering special low- or no-interest loans or skip-a-payment options on car loans or mortgages as a way to help state employee members.
LePage also acknowledged that the shutdown would be a hardship on the general public. "Government is going to be shut down so it's not going to be business as usual," LePage said. "Agencies are going to be shut down, there's not going to be anybody answering the phones."

Texto completo: The University of Vermont announced its men's hockey schedule for the upcoming season on Thursday.
Regular-season action begins against Colorado College at Gutterson Fieldhouse on Oct. 6. The 34-game slate includes the program's first trip to Michigan's historic Yost Ice Arena, and 24 Hockey East contests in the revamped 11-team league, in addition to UVM's own Catamount Cup tournament at the end of December.
The 2017-18 schedule, month to month:
Oct. 6-7 vs. Colorado College; Oct. 14, Oct. 15 at Quinnipiac, Union; Oct. 20-21 at Michigan; Oct. 28 vs. New Hampshire.
Nov. 3-4 at UConn; Nov. 10-11 vs. Boston College; Nov. 17 at Northeastern; Nov. 25 at Dartmouth.

Jan. 5 at UMass Lowell; Jan. 12-13 vs. UMass; Jan. 19-20 vs. UMass Lowell; Jan. 26-27 at Merrimack.
Feb. 2-3 vs. Providence; Feb. 9-10 at New Hampshire; Feb. 16-17 vs. Northeastern; Feb. 23-24 at Boston University.
Hockey East playoffs begin with the first round series on March 2. Quarterfinals follow on March 9 with the semifinals and championship game taking place March 16-17 at TD Garden in Boston.
New talent on campus: The Catamounts' incoming freshman class will feature six forwards, four defensemen and two goaltenders. Through graduation and early departures, Vermont has lost 11 players, including eight seniors, from last season's team that went 20-13-5 overall and 10-8-4 in Hockey East.
The new forwards are (hometown, age, height, weight, most recent team): Ace Cowans of Beverly, Mass., 19, 5-7, 166, Waterloo Blackhawks (USHL); Vladislav Dzhioshvili of Moscow, Russia, 19, 6-1, 192, Bloomington Thunder (USHL); Alex Esposito of West Haven, Conn, 21, 6-0, 200, Youngstown Phantoms (USHL); Martin Frechette of Rockland, Ontario, 20, 5-8, 150, Cumberland Grads (CCHL); Max Kaufman of Pittsford, N.Y., 21, 5-8, 172, Langley Rivermen (BCHL); and Bryce Misley of Calgary, Alberta, 17, 6-2, 187, Oakville Blades (OHJL). Misley was a recent NHL draft pick of the Minnesota Wild (fourth round, No. 116 overall).
The defensemen include: Christian Evers of Waukee, Iowa, 20, 6-2, 220, Lincoln Stars (USHL); Owen Grant of Stittsville, Ontario, 19, 6-0, 185, Carleton Place Canadians (CCCHL); Brian Kelly of Purchase, N.Y., 19, 6-0, 180, Connecticut Jr. Rangers (USPHL Premier); and Cory Thomas of St. Brieux, Saskatchewan, 19, 6-5, 210, Flin Flon Bombers (SHJL).
The two freshmen goalies will be: Matt Beck of Westport, Conn., 20, 6-0, 180, Philadelphia Jr. Flyers (USPHL Premier) and Tyler Harmon of Ramsey, N.J., 19, 6-3, 190, Jersey Hitmen (USPHL Premier).
Three depart, two gain year's eligibility: Three of the 2016-17 Catamounts eligible to return have decided to leave the team. Senior forward Kevin Irwin will remain at UVM but will not play. Junior defenseman Mike Lee is transferring to Sacred Heart. Sophomore forward Cameron Klein also plans to transfer to an undetermined college.
One of last year's seniors, defenseman Ori Abramson, will return for a fourth year after the NCAA approved a medical waiver granting him another season of eligibility. Abramson briefly attended Providence College in 2012-13 but did not play before illness forced him to miss two years.
Another Catamount, forward Conor O'Neil, also received an NCAA medical waiver granting him another year of eligibility. As a sophomore last year, O'Neil played in only four games before an injury ended his season.

Walgreens to buy half of Rite Aid drugstores

Texto completo: Walgreens Boots Alliance abandoned its deal to acquire drugstore chain Rite Aid and will instead buy nearly half of its smaller rival's stores after U.S. regulators raised antitrust concerns about the original plan.
The long-suffering deal's implosion preserves the nation's three largest drugstore chains as independent entities, but the new agreement will still make Walgreens the nation's largest by number of locations, edging rival CVS Health.
Consumer advocates welcomed the development, saying the original accord would have given Walgreens too much power but cautioning that the new deal may still require scrutiny.
"This merger would have led to higher prices," former FTC policy director David Balto said. "It's important to preserve three national competitors. That's in essence what the FTC was saying."
Walgreens said Thursday that it would pay $5.175 billion for 2,186 Rite Aid stores, three distribution centers and inventory.
To be sure, the new deal must still pass regulatory muster, which could be stiff if officials suspect that Walgreens would have too much pricing power or bargaining leverage.
With the new agreement, Walgreens would have more than 10,200 U.S. stores, giving the chain opportunities for cost cuts and greater leverage in negotiation with landlords, health care companies and vendors. CVS has more than 9,600 stores.
Rite Aid, which currently has about 4,600 locations, is selling stores primarily located in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and southeastern U.S.
As a result of the original deal's cancellation, Walgreens owes Rite Aid a $325-million breakup fee — a customary provision in major merger agreements to compensate the targeted company if a deal collapses.
The move also means that Rite Aid's previous deal to sell certain stores to drugstore chain Fred's is off.
Walgreens CEO Stefano Pessina said the new deal would allow the company to make its stores more efficient, with a goal of wringing out $400 million in annual "synergies." That often includes cost cuts and purchasing improvements.
For Walgreens, the new accord is also significantly less expensive. The company's original deal was pegged at about $9.4 billion, but it was lowered to a range of $6.8 billion to $7.4 billion in January after the tie-up languished.
"It's true to our original strategic aim," Pessina said. "Overall, I view this deal as being more attractive than the transaction it replaces."
Walgreens stock rose $1.28 to $78.37.
But Rite Aid investors were experiencing the Wall Street equivalent of a panic attack, driving shares down 26.3% to $2.90.
Rite Aid said it had to ditch the original deal after regulators privately "led the company to believe that the parties would not have obtained FTC clearance to consummate the merger."
"It's now clear we're gonna continue as an independent company," Rite Aid CEO John Standley said, adding that he believes the company will be "more focused."
The deal gives Rite Aid the right to purchase generic drugs through Walgreens to gain the cost advantages it's otherwise relinquishing by shedding locations.
But financial pressures are badgering Rite Aid, including reduced drug reimbursement rates and fewer prescription fulfillments.
Sales at Rite Aid stores open at least a year fell 3.9% in the quarter ended June 3, the company said Thursday. And the company's quarterly net loss widened to $75.3 million from $4.6 million a year earlier.
Meanwhile, Walgreens said Thursday that its net earnings rose 5.2% to $1.17 billion for the quarter ended May 31.
The new deal was designed to alleviate the FTC's concerns about the market overlap between Walgreens and Rite Aid.
Tad Lipsky, acting director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition, said the agency had "thoroughly investigated the potential impact" of the originally proposed deal and several revised offers but that the companies "voluntarily withdrew."
Lipsky said the agency would review the new deal, as is typical.
"The FTC has made its mark here," Balto said. "They're not necessarily going to roll over for Walgreens."
Mizuho Securities analyst Ann Hynes hailed the deal as "positive" for Walgreens because it generates additional profits and will deliver cost savings.
Moody's Investor Service noted that the deal would result in less borrowing by Walgreens. Meanwhile, Rite Aid plans to use the proceeds to cut its debt in half.
Rite Aid is exiting South Carolina, Utah and Indiana, and will have one or two stores apiece in Mississippi, Georgia, Alabama, Maine, Rhode Island, West Virginia, Kentucky and Nevada. The company is also selling most of its stores in Colorado, Tennessee, Louisiana, Vermont, North Carolina and Massachusetts.
As part of the latest deal, Rite Aid agreed not to open for two years any new stores in the locations where it's selling.
The company said about 60% of the stores it will continue to operate have been recently remodeled to focus on wellness, as drugstores increasingly attempt to offer health care services to customers.

Pittsfield's largest employer – Globe Manufacturing Co. – which makes professional firefighting gear, is being bought for $215 million.
MSA Safety, a publicly traded company headquartered in Pennsylvania, announced the all-cash deal this week.
Globe has been family-owned and -operated since 1887, when it was purchased by Courtland F.H. Freese in Lynn, Mass., and moved to Pittsfield. Since then, it's grown into the largest manufacturer of turnout gear – the protective coats, pants and gloves that firefighters wear – in the country. It has more than 420 employees, and brings in about $110 million in annual revenues.
With headquarters and a 60,000-square-foot plant in Pittsfield, it is the area's largest employer, and the town's third-largest taxpayer.
None of that should change, said Rob Freese, Globe's vice president of marketing and sales.
“Globe in its history has never had a layoff per se,” he said. “We pride ourselves on treating people the way we want to be treated.”
Freese will stay on, he said, as will his brother, Gef Freese, who oversees manufacturing, and Don Welch, the company's president.
In addition to its Pittsfield operation, Globe has a manufacturing facility in Oda, Okla., and a footwear plant in Auburn, Maine, that it purchased in 2014.
With $1.15 billion in revenues in 2016, MSA makes a host of safety products, including thermal imaging cameras and breathing apparatuses for firefighters. What it doesn't make is the kind of gear Globe specializes in – jackets, pants and footwear.
“When you combine all those products now, it means that MSA, with Globe, can provide complete coverage for firefighters,” said Mark Deasy, an MSA spokesman.
Provided the sale receives a green light from federal regulators, both parties say they expect the deal to close within the third quarter, which spans July to September.

Texto completo: Fishers rough up E-Rod
Boston Red Sox starting pitcher Eduardo Rodriguez didn't have the rehab outing he was hoping for, but the New Hampshire Fisher Cats took full advantage Thursday night in Portland, Maine.
The Fisher Cats snapped a three-game losing streak – at Rodriguez's expense – with a 9-5 victory, their only win of the four-game series.
Rodriguez, who was making his first rehab appearance since injuring his knee June 1 in Baltimore, gave up six runs – five earned – on nine hits over three innings pitched and was tagged with the loss. The 24-year-old did end the night on a high note though, striking out the side in the third inning.
Jonathan Davis led off the game for New Hampshire (32-46) with a solo home run and finished with two hits and three runs scored. Tim Lopes also drove in four runs on two hits and Ryan McBroom hit his ninth home run of the season in the sixth inning.
Jon Harris snapped a five-game winless streak with a solid performance on the mound. He gave up two runs on five hits over seven innings and struck out five batters with just one walk.
The Fisher Cats open a four-game homestand with the visiting Trenton Thunder tonight at 7:05 p.m.

Texto completo: Officials ban woman from city for charges
BREWER, Maine ï¿½ A Maine woman has been indicted on the charges that caused her to be barred from the city.
WABI-TV reports 25-year-old Christina McCarthy was arrested in April after a family fight. McCarthy was indicted Wednesday on charges of assault, domestic violence assault, criminal threatening with a dangerous weapon, trespassing and refusing to submit to arrest.
Officials ordered McCarthy to stay out of the city of Brewer.
Lightning bolt starts fire, destroys house
CUSHING, Maine ï¿½ A Maine home was set ablaze after being struck by a lightning bolt during a series of thunderstorms Tuesday.
The fire was reported around 7 p.m. and firefighters were not able to respond in time to save the Cushing home. WGME-TV reports the exterior of the home is still standing, but the inside has been badly damaged.
Resident Tony Campagna says he was the only person home when the lightning hit, and went to his neighborï¿½s house after calling 911. He and his wife will be staying at their neighborï¿½s home until they figure out their next steps.
Cushing Fire Chief Arthur Kiskala says they will have to tear down the house and rebuild.
A home in Thomaston was also struck by lightning, but no injuries were reported.
Lobstermen, fishers have cheaper bait
AUGUSTA, Maine ï¿½ Maine lobstermen are out fishing after a cold winter ï¿½ but they have many more options for bait fish than they did last year.
The state Department of Marine Resources says bait fish are much less expensive than last year, where the price of herring rose to as high as 60 cents a pound. The Portland Press Herald reports herring costs about half as much this year.
Commissioner Pat Keliher says it is definitely better but still not a great price. Herring went for around 18 cents a pound in 2015.
Demand for bait has been low this year due to the month-late start to the fishing season because of cold weather. Keliher says the late start has helped keep demand and prices down on bait.
Compiled from wire reports Court order prohibits teacher from contact with student
KENNEBUNK, Maine ï¿½ A judge has ordered a Kennebunk High School teacher to avoid contact with a student for two years because of an abuse complaint.
A District Court judge issued a civil protection order against 29-year-old health teacher Jill Lamontagne, whoï¿½s been at the school for five years.
The Journal Tribune reports that the studentï¿½s mother wrote in a complaint that the two engaged in an inappropriate relationship. A lawyer for Lamontagne on Wednesday denied the accusations and declined further comment.
Regional School Unit 21 Superintendent Katie Hawes says Lamontagne is on leave while the district investigates the claims.
She said the school is working with the appropriate agencies and following protocols ï¿½to ensure the safety of our students and our staff.ï¿½
Southern Maine communities to get nearly $1.4M in CDBG money
BRIDGTON, Maine ï¿½ Officials in Cumberland County say the area will receive nearly $1.4 million in federal Housing and Urban Development grant money for projects such as home repair for seniors, fire station renovations and waterfront improvements.
The Community Development Block Grant money will fund projects throughout the county. One of the largest grants is a $400,000 award to South Portland for public services and infrastructure. The Opportunity Alliance will get $150,000 for homeless prevention.
The county says it has invested more than $15 million in such grant money over the past 10 years.
Veto expected on solar bill heading to governorï¿½s desk
AUGUSTA, Maine ï¿½ A solar compromise bill will head to Republican Gov. Paul LePageï¿½s desk for an expected veto.
The Maine House and Senate passed the amended bill Wednesday with the more than two-thirds support needed to override a veto.
State utility regulators released solar billing rules this year that drew criticism from solar proponents and skeptics such as LePage. The governor supports a market-based credit system for solar energy and is a critic of the stateï¿½s current program that lets solar customers receive fixed bill credits for generated energy.
The Maine Public Utilities Commission said it would maintain current billing rules for existing solar customers for 15 years, while reducing certain bill credits over time.
The amended bill would reduce billing credits through 2019 and call for new solar rules.
4 minor earthquakes in Maine last week
PORTLAND, Maine ï¿½ The United States Geological Society has measured four minor earthquakes in Maine over the past several days.
The earthquakes began on Sunday and the most recent was recorded on Wednesday morning. WMTW-TV reports two 1.4 magnitude earthquakes were recorded outside Lincoln on Sunday morning and a third measuring 1.7 was measured in the same area on Sunday afternoon.
An earthquake with a 1.3 magnitude was measured near Livermore on Wednesday.
The USGS says earthquakes below a 3.0 magnitude are low intensity and are felt by few people.

LePage: Shutdown ï¿½necessaryï¿½

Texto completo: AUGUSTA ï¿½ Closed-door negotiations on the state budget continued Thursday evening, but prospects for averting a government shutdown were dimming by the hour.
Legislative leaders missed a self-imposed Thursday afternoon deadline to strike a deal on a two-year, roughly $7 billion budget in order to give themselves sufficient time to seek full approval today in the House and the Senate.
If lawmakers do not pass a budget by tonight, state government will shut down starting at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. And even if lawmakers did approve a budget, Gov. Paul LePage threatened again Thursday to trigger a government shutdown by waiting 10 days to veto any spending plan that increases the lodging tax without sufficient cuts to the income tax ï¿½ despite his own previous proposals to raise the lodging tax.
ï¿½I will tell you this: If they put a tax increase (in the budget), ready for a shutdown. End of story,ï¿½ LePage said told the hosts of a WGAN radio talk program. ï¿½Iï¿½ve told them since January, if you increase taxes without lowering the income tax, I will take my 10 days.ï¿½
The lack of movement Thursday, combined with the governorï¿½s vow to take his time with the bill, strongly suggested Maine was headed toward the first shutdown since 1991. Back then, thousands of angry state workers filled the State House and the Capitol grounds during boisterous protests that created a public relations nightmare during the peak tourism season in Maine. While the LePage administration was taking steps Thursday to mitigate potential effects on tourists and Mainers ï¿½ including plans to keep state parks and beaches open ï¿½ the various parties already were attempting to assign blame for a shutdown.
Lawmakers suggested LePage should avoid hurting state workers and the economy by immediately vetoing any budget deal that he knows he canï¿½t support, thereby allowing an immediate override vote.
ï¿½To not sign a 2/3 budget that will pass over his veto just for the show of shutting down government would be despicable,ï¿½ Maine Democratic Party chairman Phil Bartlett tweeted.
The governor, meanwhile, accused Democrats, labor unions, environmental groups and even Senate Republican leaders of attempting to increase taxes.
ï¿½Look, a shutdown is necessary for the future of Maine. Thatï¿½s the way I look at it now,ï¿½ LePage told WGANï¿½s Ken Altshuler and Morning News guest host Andy Smith. ï¿½Itï¿½s about the future. You canï¿½t tax yourself to prosperity.ï¿½
The Legislature voted Thursday morning to extend its session by five days to provide more time for lawmakers to negotiate and vote on a budget and, if necessary, vote on an override of a LePage veto. But without a budget deal on the table, legislative leaders sent most House and Senate members home Thursday afternoon while warning of a long day on Friday, which is the final day of the fiscal year. Meanwhile, thousands of state workers were bracing for the possibility that they will lose pay for an indeterminate period if lawmakers fail to settle on a compromise capable of garnering two-thirds support in both chambers, or if LePage holds the bill for up to 10 days.
Ramona Welton, president of the Maine State Employees Association SEIU Local 1989 union, said many workers are under stress as they worry about whether they will receive a paycheck in the coming weeks. Many workers also were still waiting to hear whether they would be among the ï¿½emergencyï¿½ personnel who will be required to work during a shutdown.
ï¿½There are a lot of questions and not a lot of answers at this point,ï¿½ Welton said.
Lawmakers still are struggling over what to do about the 3 percent income tax surcharge on earnings over $200,000 that voters approved last November. LePage and Republicans are insisting that any budget proposal repeal the surcharge, but Democrats are demanding that lawmakers replace some of the estimated $320 million in revenues the tax was expected to generate for schools.
Lawmakers appeared to be narrowing the gap Wednesday, after Senate Republicans offered a budget that would funnel an additional $146 million into education while increasing the lodging tax from 9 percent to 10 percent. But LePage rebuffed that idea on Thursday ï¿½ even though his own budget proposal in January included a 1 percent increase in the lodging tax. LePageï¿½s original budget proposal would have effectively eliminated the 3 percent surcharge. He also has called repeatedly for broadening Maineï¿½s sales tax base to capture more dollars from tourists.
Speaking on WGAN Morning News on Thursday, LePage said he would take the full 10 days to veto a budget that increases the lodging tax without cutting the income tax.
ï¿½Iï¿½m telling you, if he puts that in, 10 days and it starts midnight tomorrow night,ï¿½ LePage said of Sen. Roger Katz, an Augusta Republican who is part of the budget negotiating committee. ï¿½Iï¿½m not playing any more. I have been talking to these people for six months. They have ignored, ignored, ignored. They are playing games, they are playing chicken at 100 mph. And Iï¿½ll tell you something: You want to play chicken? Letï¿½s play chicken.ï¿½
All of the budget proposals currently pending with lawmakers would, in actuality, cut income taxes for wealthy Mainers, but there is disagreement about how to do that while also funneling more money toward kindergarten-through-grade 12 education. LePageï¿½s original budget proposal would have effectively eliminated the 3 percent tax surcharge while also moving Maine toward a flat income tax rate of 5.75 percent by 2020. Lawmakers have rejected that proposal.

Texto completo: AUGUSTA ï¿½ State budget negotiators reached a tentative deal to eliminate a 3 percent tax surcharge on wealthy Mainers while funneling an additional $162 million to education, setting up a crucial vote today hours before a potential state government shutdown.
Yet a proposed 1.5 percent increase in Maineï¿½s lodging tax means the shutdown threat still looms large, given Gov. Paul LePageï¿½s vow to delay a decision on any budget bill that contains tax increases.
ï¿½If they put a tax increase (in the budget), ready for a shutdown. End of story,ï¿½ LePage told a radio talk show Thursday morning. ï¿½Iï¿½ve told them since January, if you increase taxes without lowering the income tax, I will take my 10 days.ï¿½
After weeks of stop-and-start negotiations, members of a special budget committee voted 5-1 Thursday to endorse a two-year, $7.1 billion budget plan. The proposal will go to the House and Senate for consideration on Friday, where legislative leaders will need two-thirds majorities in both chambers to even send it to LePageï¿½s desk ï¿½ a potentially tall order for a budget containing deep concessions.
Some of the major compromises in the budget deal include:
ï¿½ Elimination of the controversial 3 percent tax surcharge on earnings over $200,000 that voters approved last November to funnel more money to K-12 education.
ï¿½ Allocation an additional $162 million to public schools, offsetting some but not all of the estimated $320 million that will be lost by repealing the tax surcharge.
ï¿½ Increasing the lodging tax from 9 percent to 10.5 percent.
ï¿½I think we did the very best that we could do to deliver a budget that people can vote on tomorrow, and if it doesnï¿½t get us there, then we will be back at the table,ï¿½ House Speaker Sara Gideon, D-Freeport, said prior to the 5-1 committee vote in support of the compromise. The dissenting vote was cast by Rep. Tom Winsor, R-Norway, whose House Republican caucus has been closely aligned with LePage throughout the budget process.
The late hour of the compromise, combined with the governorï¿½s vow to take his time with the bill, strongly suggested Maine could be headed toward the first shutdown since 1991. Back then, thousands of angry state workers filled the State House and Capitol grounds during boisterous protests that created a public relations nightmare during the peak tourism season in Maine.

Texto completo: Emergency legislation allowing municipalities to ban marijuana caregiver facilities from any location within 500 feet of the property line of a public or private school has been signed into law.
Law allows limiting growing marijuana near schools
AUGUSTA ï¿½ Emergency legislation designed to give cities and towns temporary authority to regulate the location of marijuana grow facilities is now law.
Gov. Paul LePage signed the bill June 23, giving cities and towns temporary authority to impose limits on how close to public and private schools that marijuana grown by caregivers can be cultivated in new or expanding facilities. Cities and towns now can restrict caregivers from growing pot any closer than 500 feet from a school property line in land-use ordinances.
Rep. Seth Berry, D-Bowdoinham, introduced the emergency legislation earlier this month when Richmond town officials found they had no grounds to deny an application for a proposed caregiver facility thatï¿½s less than 300 feet away from Richmond Middle/High School. Berryï¿½s district includes Richmond.
150 Main LLC has proposed to convert 30,000 square feet of vacant industrial space into a secure marijuana grow facility that will be sectioned off and leased to individual caregivers.
The law has a sunset date of July 1, 2018, but Berry said Thursday that the Legislatureï¿½s Joint Select Committee on Marijuana Legalization Implementation is expected to take on a host of marijuana-related bills in the next legislative session. That list includes a measure granting cities and towns permanent authority to restrict how close a medical marijuana grow facility can be to schools.
Berry said there is a bill that addresses this issue specifically, but also includes commercial establishments listed in the statewide referendum to legalize pot that Maine voters narrowly approved in November 2016.
ï¿½This is the same approach we take with respect to other land-use compatibility and planning issues,ï¿½ Berry said. ï¿½This is a new thing for Maine that the law doesnï¿½t give municipalities the authority which they have in other areas like retail sales or industrial uses.ï¿½
Before this, state law had no such restrictions in place for caregivers.
The law does not affect any facility thatï¿½s already in place, including the one planned for Richmond.
Catherine Lewis, the president of Medical Marijuana Caregivers of Maine, a trade association geared to supporting and promoting safe access to medical marijuana for patients and caregivers, said sheï¿½s not sure proximity to schools is a big concern among her groupï¿½s members.
ï¿½They are all under the assumption there was a limit,ï¿½ Lewis said. ï¿½They assumed it was already the case.ï¿½
Her organization does not oppose cities and towns being given the authority to put ordinances in place that restrict where caregiver facilities can go.
ï¿½We just donï¿½t want to see patient access restricted, and they are not going to caregiver facilities anyway,ï¿½ she said.

Texto completo: Follow on a competency hearing for Ismail M. Awad, charged with agg assault, burglary, thefts and aggravated trafficking. Heï¿½s at Riverview.
Six criminal charges dismissed; Ismail Awad, 28, to remain at Riverview Psychiatric Center
AUGUSTA ï¿½ A judge on Wednesday found a former Portland man not mentally competent to stand trial on six criminal charges and ordered those charges dismissed.
The dismissal of charges against Ismail Mohamed Awad, 28, occurred during a hearing at the Capital Judicial Center, where a clinical psychologist and a nurse practitioner told Justice Michaela Murphy that Awad has been taking his antipsychotic medication voluntarily for the past five months and has shown some improvement, but not enough for him to proceed in the cases. Murphy also accepted their conclusion that it was unlikely Awad could be restored to competence.
ï¿½Mr. Awad has been at Riverview for almost three years,ï¿½ Murphy said. ï¿½They have been treating him as best they can.ï¿½
Awad had been charged with aggravated trafficking, unlawful trafficking, burglary and three counts of theft by unauthorized taking, all occurring March 15 through Aug. 4, 2013 in Portland; as well as aggravated assault from Oct. 14, 2014, in Augusta. All those charges were dismissed Wednesday.
Awad had been under a court order to take his medication after he refused to do so, and that order was appealed to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court, which heard oral arguments in October 2016. No opinion has been issued.
Awad previously was found not competent to stand trial after a hearing in January 2015.
While at Riverview, Awad also was charged with assaulting three mental health workers there in October 2014.
At an initial hearing in those cases, Awad repeatedly begged Judge Valerie Stanfill at first to let him plead guilty and be freed on probation and later to place him in a mental institution. ï¿½Can I go back to a mental institution?ï¿½ Awad asked. ï¿½Please, please, I cannot do jail time.ï¿½
He told the judge he had a mental illness and had spent time at various psychiatric hospitals, including Spring Harbor and Riverview in Maine and several years at Bridgewater State Hospital in Massachusetts, which handles forensic patients ï¿½ those who are accused of a crime.
ï¿½My bodyï¿½s hesitating. My bodyï¿½s shaking,ï¿½ he said. ï¿½I cannot do jail time. My body will fall apart.ï¿½
In contrast to those remarks, Awad said nothing at Wednesdayï¿½s hearing, instead allowing his attorneys, Lisa Whittier and Kevin Moynihan, to speak for him.
He wore a gray long-sleeved sweatshirt and his hands and feet were shackled. He was visibly heavier than he has been at earlier court hearings.
After the hearing, Moynihan said Awad had been charged with drug trafficking offenses in March 2013 in Portland after a drug dealer discovered he could take advantage of Awadï¿½s mental illness.
Peter Donnelly, a clinical psychologist who has evaluated Awad 11 times since 2014, testified that before 2016, Awadï¿½s ï¿½compliance with medication was poor,ï¿½ that he has ï¿½a very limited understandingï¿½ of charges against him.
ï¿½He has poor short-term memory and oftentimes canï¿½t retain information,ï¿½ Donnelly said, noting that Awad had been a special education student in Portland.
Doctors previously said Awad suffers from schizophrenia, antisocial personality disorder and substance abuse.
The prosecutor, Assistant District Attorney Kate Marshall, said Awad meets the criteria for a civil commitment.
Murphy ordered Awad placed in the custody of the commissioner of the Department of Health and Human Services and noted that the civil commitment procedure for Awad already was in progress.

heroin, cocaine
An Augusta man was arrested on a federal warrant charging him with conspiracy to distribute heroin and cocaine base.
Jason Folkner, also known as ï¿½Crazy,ï¿½ joins 10 others who were arrested recently on an indictment charging them with being involved in the same conspiracy.
Records at U.S. District Court in Bangor show that Folkner, whose age is listed as 41, was arrested Sunday in Augusta.
The prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney Joel B. Casey, is seeking to have Folkner held without bail, saying that there is probable cause to believe he committed a crime that carries a term of imprisonment of more than 10 years.
Magistrate Judge John Nivison ordered Folkner held temporarily until a hearing on that issue, which is now set for July 7 in Bangor.
The indictment was handed up by a federal grand jury May 17 but sealed until Folknerï¿½s arrest.
Attorney Jeffrey M. Silverstein was appointed to represent Folkner, who pleaded not guilty Monday at his arraignment.
All the defendants face charges of conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute controlled substances, which are heroin, fentanyl and cocaine base from June 2015 to March 2017. Several are charged with possession with intent to distribute controlled substances and maintaining drug-involved premises from June 14, 2015, to March 9, 2017, in central Maine.

Texto completo: PRESQUE ISLE -- Aroostook County Action Program has welcomed two new members to its senior leadership team: Human Resources Manager Alyssa Levesque and Resource Developer Monica Pettengill Jerkins.
Levesque began her position on May 1, joining ACAP after seven years of human-resource-related work in the manufacturing industry. She has her bachelor's degree in business administration from Husson University.
"My experience as the office manager in my previous position gave me a well-rounded understanding of each working part of a business. It also furthered my understanding of how important employees are in guaranteeing the success of a business," said Levesque "I really enjoyed the human resources aspect of my former job and I was excited to have an opportunity to expand upon that."
Levesque says she is most looking forward to being a part of the greater good through the services that ACAP provides to the community. She lives in Presque Isle with her husband, Tim, and daughter, Kayla. She enjoys spending time with her family, thrift shopping and restoring vintage furniture.
Jerkins returned to The County after two years living in southern Maine and working as the executive director of the New Hampshire Snowmobile Association to assume her ACAP role on April 10. She has a certificate in grant writing from the University of Southern Maine and an associate degree in paralegal studies from McIntosh College in Dover, NH. She worked as a reporter for the St. John Valley Times, and then as editor for Fiddlehead Focus during its early years.
"It's exciting to return to The County where I consider my roots to be," said Jerkins of her return. "I look forward to using my skills in research and writing, as well as my familiarity with the unique challenges facing Aroostook County, to assist ACAP in its mission to improve the quality of lives of Aroostook's most vulnerable residents."
Jerkins is in charge of internal and external communications at ACAP and is also the primary grant writer for the agency. She lives in New Sweden with her family. In her spare time, she enjoys exploring, writing and boating.
"We are fortunate to have two accomplished professionals, both widely respected in their fields, join our ACAP family and the agency's senior leadership team," said ACAP executive director and CEO Jason Parent. "Their leadership in supporting our most valuable asset " our ACAP staff, and in securing support to advance new and existing initiatives will be critical to our growth and ability to 'make life better' across Aroostook County."

Texto completo: In late April, Congress and President Trump reached a deal to avoid a government shutdown at the federal level. But if you're one of those people who pines for October 2013 and the excitement of a nasty political budget fight, Ballotpedia has a nice write-up about six states that are facing partial shutdowns or or an abrupt curtailment of non-essential services.
Four of the states -- Maine, New Jersey, Illinois, and Washington State (where Republicans have functional control of the state Senate in spite of a one-seat Democratic majority) -- are in some sort of divided government situation. The other two -- Connecticut and Delaware -- are under complete Democratic control. None of the states facing potential shutdowns are fully Republican-run.
Some of the impasses will be difficult to solve. For example, in Maine, Democrats are demanding a new tax hike in exchange for repeal of a tax on high earners ($200,000 and above) that passed by referendum. And they have leverage -- although the State House is very narrowly Democratic, the budget requires a two-thirds majority in the legislature -- a rule that makes you wonder how they ever pass a budget.
Illinois is in an apparently hopeless situation after two years without a state budget. The state's fiscal year ends today, and the Democrat-controlled legislature remains deadlocked in its current special session, which was called earlier this month by Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner. Bond rating agencies have threatened to downgrade Illinois' debt to junk status if no deal is reached by tonight. The state has announced it is cutting off lottery ticket sales tonight in anticipation of failure. State road construction is also being halted, and Chicago's public school system has borrowed money, expecting state funds to be delayed.
In short, don't be disappointed if Washington's game of chicken doesn't play out -- there are enough governing failures out there to go around.

Texto completo: Second to Maine: Nearly double the national average, it's a continuation of a trend.
New Hampshire is now second only to Maine in the percentage of the population receiving Social Security Disability Income for mental illness, according to the latest research from the Urban Institute, released on Thursday.
Nationally, 1.76 percent of the population is receiving a monthly check for disability related to conditions like schizophrenia, mood disorders or depression.
In New Hampshire, the rate is nearly double at 3.18 percent, topped only by Maine, at 3.41 percent, according to Urban Institute researcher Jon Schwabish, who relied on data from the Social Security Administration, the U.S. Census Bureau and other sources.
"It was shocking to me," said Schwabish. "It's not just that it's higher; it's much higher than elsewhere in the country."
Maine and New Hampshire are followed by Rhode Island and Vermont in the top four. Massachusetts ranked eighth, after Kentucky, West Virginia and Arkansas. Connecticut was the only New England state close to the national average.
The large number of SSDI recipients for mental disorders in the New England states is not particularly new, Schwabish observed.
The New Hampshire Union Leader first reported on the trend in early 2015. Since 2001, New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, and Rhode Island saw increases in the number of people filing claims for mental disorders that far exceeded national averages.
But there is no conclusive research on why the New England states are such outliers when it comes to disability income for mental illness. New Hampshire demographics run contrary to the stereotype of a disability income recipient, with the exception of our aging population.
Demographics vary
When it comes to claims for all types of disabilities, including physical impairment, the top five states are West Virginia, Alabama, Kentucky and Mississippi all states with lower median income, lower education levels, more diverse populations and more of the workforce engaged in the kinds of jobs that lead to disability.
New Hampshire ranks 13th in the nation when it comes to all types of disabilities, with 6.28 percent of the population receiving SSDI checks, averaging about $1,170 a month. That's not too far off the national average of 5.06 percent.
Colorado, California, Hawaii, Alaska and Utah were at the bottom of the list for all disabilities, and ranked very low for mental illness as well, in the 1 percent range of population, compared to New England numbers three times higher.
"New England states tend to have older, whiter and richer populations. Consequently, the question remains as to why the rate of disability income for mental disorders is so much higher for these states than for the rest of the country," writes Schwabish in his report, titled, "Geographic Patterns in Disability Insurance Receipt: Mental Disorders in New England."
He goes on to note that some of the evidence suggests that access to the health care system may help people not only identify their illnesses but also get in contact with the SSDI program and other services.
More insured in NH
New Hampshire has one of the highest percentages of population with health insurance in the country, and despite complaints about wait times for an appointment, one of the highest ratios of service providers per capita.
"If you have a mental health impairment and have access to mental health services, you may find that the service providers are giving you information about ways in which you can find support, and one of those ways is the disability program," said Schwabish. "We don't have the data to prove that's what's happening on the ground, but that's my hypothesis, because you don't see the same rates of access in other parts of the country."
The disability program is often criticized as being plagued by fraud and abuse. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., claimed during his presidential campaign that more than half the people on disability are either "anxious or their back hurts."
Budget cuts proposed
President Trump's proposed budget cuts billions of dollars from the SSDI program, which currently serves nearly nine million American workers, generally between the ages of 18 and 64, and almost two million of their dependents.
If the Trump budget becomes law as proposed, roughly $70 billion would be cut from SSDI over the next 10 years.
Schwabish believes the opioid crisis may be playing a role in the growing number of New Hampshire residents with disability claims related to mental health, but no one has yet established a clear link.
"The link to opioid use is not concrete," said Schwabish, "because one issue is we don't know in what direction things go. Do people seek out medication and maybe they abuse it, can't work and go on DI?; or do they seek services because they aren't working, get on DI, and start getting prescribed opioids, and start abusing them?"
As the report says, "better data and further study are warranted."

Shaheen: Legislation will authorize visas for Afghan interpreters
WASHINGTON Authorization of visas for 4,000 Afghan interpreters and military support staff has been included in key defense legislation, U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-NH, announced Wednesday.Shaheen said the Senate Armed Services Committee included authorization of the special immigrant visas, which she has championed.The visas are included in the National Defense Authorization Act, which establishes national security priorities."Make no mistake, the Special Immigrant Visa program saves the lives of Afghan interpreters and support staff who stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Americans in the field, putting themselves and their families at risk to help our soldiers and diplomats accomplish their mission and return home safely," Shaheen said in a statement."Our nation made a promise to these Afghans and it's critical that Congress keeps that promise."

Back home, Mainers are urging Susan Collins to stay strong

Texto completo: CAMDEN, Maine — As she sat at the right hand of President Trump at the White House this week, US Senator Susan Collins's prominent position on a white-hot national stage could hardly have been more conspicuous.
And to hundreds of Mainers who want New England's only Senate Republican to more forcefully wield her blend of quirky independence as a bipartisan beacon, the seating chart in the executive mansion could not have been more hopeful.
“Trump has just crossed a line," said Richard Anderson, 76, a Republican and former Boston textbook developer. “Not only is he not reasoned and rational, it verges on whether he's sane or not. You wonder what's in his head."
Jim Nelson, a registered independent who with Anderson is leading a new effort to encourage Collins to more fully embrace Maine's political legacy for principled bipartisanship, sits across his living room table from Anderson and slowly nods his head.
“This is throwing 22 million people out of health care at a time when we have serious income inequality," said Nelson, 75, a retired chief executive and corporate consultant who once taught business courses at Babson College in Wellesley. “In a bipartisan environment, we wouldn't even be talking about a bill like this."
But now, of course, it's all anyone is talking about.
The Senate's Republican leadership, reading ominous political tea leaves, has put off a vote until after the July Fourth holiday, fiercely trying to cobble together support for the measure in the face of rebellion.
The bipartisan group led by Anderson and Nelson began this week taking out newspaper ads in Maine publications, starting with a full page ad in Tuesday's Bangor Daily News. When they asked for supporters via e-mail, more than 350 raised their hands. And opened their checkbooks.
“We didn't even break a sweat getting these names," Nelson said. “If we had really put on a full-court press, I think even in a small state like this we could have gotten 10,000 names."
Collins, they said, has yet to respond to their request for a face-to-face meeting. But the woman from Caribou, whose mother and father both served as mayor there, is embracing — as she frequently has — the central tenets of the open-letter campaign, which underlines positions of integrity that helped define her political forebears.
“History will record where each member of Congress stood in this time of testing," read the ad, which also appeared in the Portland Press Herald on Wednesday. “Senators Margaret Chase Smith in the era of McCarthyism and Bill Cohen in the Watergate era set a standard of principled leadership creating a legacy for Maine's senators. Please affirm the heritage and trust that citizens of Maine have bestowed upon you."
Collins, reacting to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, has said she would vote against advancing the Senate's version of the health care bill. She said she wants to work with Democrats to overhaul the bill, not just tinker with it.
And she sent out a tweet that signatories to this week's open letter could easily have penned themselves.
“I want to work w/ my GOP & Dem colleagues to fix the flaws in the ACA (Affordable Care Act)," she wrote. “CBO analysis shows Senate bill won't do it. I will vote no. . . . CBO says 22 million people lose insurance; Medicaid cuts hurt most vulnerable Americans; access to healthcare in rural areas threatened."
The roots of her opposition are found along Maine's craggy coastline and, more severely, in its poorer, pine-studded interior.
Some 265,000 people in Maine rely on Medicaid, which here is known as MaineCare. Most of those — some three-quarters — are children, seniors, or disabled people. Simply put, opponents say, lives are at risk.
And livelihoods, too.
Stacey McClure knows how that feels. With her two teenaged children, she lives in a Rockland mobile home park, a gone-to-seed place where I found her walking her dog Tuesday evening.
She works for the catering department at a nearby resort hotel and was recently told she makes just a tad too much to qualify for MaineCare.
“I don't have health insurance anymore," she said. “It weighs on my mind. Things are very broken."
Yes, they are.
Thomas Judge has seen it up close. And, he said, if voices like that of Susan Collins are drowned out in this poisonous political debate, the American tradition of caring for its mostvulnerable will be its ignominious victim.
Judge is executive director of LifeFlight Maine, a nonprofit consortium of health care systems that serves all of Maine with its fleet of three helicopters, one airplane, and a staff of about 100.
He is a registered independent. He does not always agree with Collins. But Judge said he's never doubted her integrity, her principles, or her commitment to Maine.
Obamacare wasn't perfect, he said, but it was working.
“It was beginning to make a difference," Judge said. “And to go back to where people are living in fear of getting sick, living in fear that they're going to be left out and not taken care of is a big mistake for one of the world's greatest countries.
“We forget that Medicaid came from some place. We forget that Medicare came from somewhere and Social Security came from somewhere. It came from a place where a huge amount of the population translated its political will and said, 'We will not have our elderly without health care.' Now, we're in a place in society where we're saying, 'Maybe that's OK.' "
Susan Crimmins lived in the rural town of Minot, a place of about 2,500 in Androscoggin County, until moving to Portland three years ago after a workplace shoulder injury forced her into a job change and 20 months of physical therapy.
She credits Obamacare with her ability to obtain health insurance she needs for chronic vision problems.
Crimmins has read every paragraph of the Senate health care bill. And it scares her.
“We're a really rural state, and we're really old," Crimmins said. “This country should not decide that people's health and welfare are more important than tax cuts."
Crimmins wants Collins to follow in the footsteps of Margaret Chase Smith, a woman Collins once spent two hours with in 1971 while on a high school trip to Washington.
“Collins is very cagey," Crimmins said. “She's committed in public against the motion to proceed. That's allowed me to sleep for the first time in months. What concerns me is what happens if the bill is tweaked. Maine has always been independent, and we're just asking her to assert her independence."
That's what Jim Nelson and Rich Anderson want, too.
And they will be watching and hoping to sit next to Collins to encourage her to remain resolute even if out-of-state money begins to pour in, threatening to weaken a strong spine.
“Maine is a very special place right now," Nelson said. “I mean, two votes can swing the Senate. We have an independent senator [Angus King] who is of very high quality. And we've got Susan Collins, who is probably most likely to depart from her party purity. Maine can have a lot to do with what happens in this country. It's a source of pride for us, and it's also a source of energy to do this work."
It's difficult to argue with people who are fed up with the nightly cable-news echo chamber of high-volume bile, the electronic version of political discourse that now embarrasses the United States across the world.
What people like Nelson and Anderson are calling for is so simple that it's simply profound.
Can't we govern with civility, with genuine respect for positions of conscience?
Can't we agree that a plan that denies 22 million people basic health insurance is governmental cruelty?
They'd like to have a rational and reasoned and polite debate about that this summer.
Maybe it's a fool's errand. If it is, that's a national shame.

LePage says he won't sign latest budget proposal and will allow a shutdown

Texto completo: Gov. Paul LePage said Friday that he won't sign a state budget package endorsed Thursday night by a special panel, ensuring a partial shutdown of state government at midnight.
The Republican governor's opposition to the budget deal would force Maine's first state government shutdown since 1991, which could stretch 10 days if LePage holds a budget bill for the full time the Constitution allows before he must act.
[Maine House budget vote falls short of total needed to stave off shutdown]
A budget would go to him tonight if the Legislature can muster two-thirds votes in both chambers, but even that was a big "if" on Friday.
LePage hosted House Republicans for a Friday morning meeting where he reportedly implored them to oppose the budget deal negotiated by Senate President Mike Thibodeau, R-Winterport, and House Speaker Sara Gideon, D-Freeport.
LePage told reporters his major objections were the overall cost of the budget package -- around $7.1 billion -- and that it proposes raising the state's lodging tax from 9 percent to 10.5 percent without income tax cuts. However, the budget package currently under consideration contains an income tax cut of 3 percent because it eliminates the surtax on income above $200,000 per year for education which was approved by voters last year.
LePage said "on June 30" -- the deadline for Maine's next fiscal year -- "they're trying to put a gun to the governor's head," but it won't work.
[Here's what happens when state government shuts down]
"This budget they have has no prayer, and if they're hell-bent on bringing this budget down, we will shut down at midnight tonight and we will talk to them in 10 days," LePage said.
The comments came hours before the House and Senate were due to vote on the compromise spending plan.
Gideon said the governor's threats don't change the fact that the Legislature's only priority should be sending him a budget with two-thirds support.
"If we do not do that and if the governor then does not do his job by either signing the budget or returning it to us immediately with his veto then we will be damaging the lives of too many people in this state," she said.
Senate Minority Leader Troy Jackson, D-Allagash, said during a hastily organized news conference after the governor's comments that he will personally introduce a bill to eliminate the proposed lodging tax increase if that would spur LePage and Republicans to support the budget bill, though Gideon said she wouldn't support any changes late in the process.
[Late-night budget deal aims to dodge Maine government shutdown]
"If the governor has objections to the lodging tax, that's fine," Jackson said. "I will personally sponsor any bill he puts in that eliminates the increase in the lodging tax."
The Republican majority in the Senate pitched the deal in dire circumstances Friday, with Thibodeau saying it's "incredibly important to make sure our members have the ability to vote on a document before our state government grinds to a close."
Legislative Democrats are likely to mostly support Senate Republicans in their budget push, but the more LePage-aligned House Republicans have enough votes to block the budget's passage there.
Many members hadn't seen the full budget proposal before noon Friday, with Rep. Heather Sirocki, R-Scarborough, a conservative Appropriations Committee member, saying, "I can't vote on something I haven't read."
Rep. Matthew Pouliot, R-Augusta, a moderate who represents many state workers, said he'll vote for the budget, calling it "important for us to move forward with a reasonable approach to closing this budget deal."
But when asked how many members of his caucus would vote for it before LePage spoke, Pouliot demurred -- sort of.
"I don't know," he said. "It's not looking good."
Gideon said she is not sure how much support there is for the budget in the House.
"It is a lift and not something automatic or something we assume that we have," she said. "We are working person by person in conversations with members to get to that number."
If all House members are present, 101 would have to vote for a budget to hit the two-thirds threshold.
Under a shutdown, the state's roughly 12,000 employees will either work or stay home without pay, since no budget means Maine has no authority to pay workers.
LePage announced Thursday that state law enforcement, state parks, psychiatric hospitals, prisons and ferries will remain operational, but that was only a partial plan. In 1991, 2,000 employees were called into work at the beginning of the shutdown.
That's likely to have a wide effect in Maine: Workers represented by the Maine State Employees Association will lose wages generating $2.5 million in daily economic impact, according to an analysis from the liberal Maine Center for Economic Policy, with $944,000 in Kennebec County alone.
Some of those union members were at the State House on Friday, including Kip Mitchell, 53, a Maine Department of Transportation employee who said he's the only wage earner in a family of four. "The uncertainty is scary," he said.
Jonathan French, 38, of Hallowell, a civil engineer in the same department, said he had worries besides his job, because his young son gets services through the Maine Department of Education's Child Development Services program.
"We're citizens, too, so we're going to be out of work, but we're also going to experience all the other effects of the shutdown " he said. "So, it's kind of a double-whammy for us."

Texto completo: Last week there was another grim reminder of the magnitude of Maine's opioid epidemic. Trailing only Massachusetts, Maine had the second highest rate of opioid-related emergency room visits in the country.
This latest figure confirms an uncomfortable truth that the epidemic is particularly out of control in Maine, and it's not letting up.
Given the magnitude of the problem, a more consistent and effective approach is needed.
This starts with doing more of what we know works. There is overwhelming evidence that using medicine to treat addiction -- called medication-assisted treatment -- is effective at reducing drug use and, therefore, savings lives. It also improves lives and saves money by reducing infectious complications and decreasing criminality. It also has the potential to save public money by reducing emergency room visits, hospital stays and the burgeoning prison population.
Yet in Maine and across the country, medication-assisted treatment is vastly underutilized. Of the 4,795 Maine physicians, physician assistants and nurse practitioners who could prescribe buprenorphine -- one of the two main drugs that help people with opioid addictions, and the only one that's available in regular doctor's offices -- just 566, or fewer than 12 percent, have the required waiver to prescribe it, according to federal data released to the BDN this week.
Physicians, who have been able to prescribe buprenorphine since it came on the market in 2002, should be leading the other health care professions in providing medication-assisted treatment. Yet they are failing to do so in significant numbers. Of the 2,587 licensed physicians in Maine who practice in primary care or mental health and are in a position to use medication-assisted treatment, a mere 509 have the waiver to prescribe buprenorphine, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the federal agency that oversees the waiver program.
In February, nurse practitioners and physician assistants were also given the right to apply for the waiver to prescribe buprenorphine, when a federal law aimed at combatting the opioid addiction crisis came into effect.
But in the five months since, only 10 physician assistants in Maine -- out of 787 total in the state -- have sought and received the waiver, according to federal data. And just 47 Maine nurse practitioners have obtained the waiver -- out of 1,421 who could.
There's no good reason for Maine's health care providers to not provide medication-assisted treatment. The science says it works, and the training to receive the waiver is free and online. While some believe maintenance medications such as buprenorphine only continue the cycle of harmful substance dependence, when these medications are administered appropriately they replace addiction and cravings, allowing people to restore broken relationships, find productive employment and become happy, contributing members of society.
There are plenty of reasons why Maine's providers continue to resist prescribing buprenorphine. The most common are cultural stigmas, financial disincentives -- many drug users either don't have insurance or have MaineCare, which reimburses doctors at low rates and puts time limits on treatment -- and fears of having their practices overrun with challenging clients.
But these reasons can and should be overcome. The medical community is partially responsible for creating this crisis in the first place, by over-prescribing opioids for chronic pain. It's time the profession also became a vigorous part of the solution.
Of course, increasing the number of healthcare practitioners in Maine who provide medication-assisted treatment will not solve the crisis by itself. But it can help.
With more than one Mainer -- usually in the prime of life -- dying of an overdose every day, Maine is a patient in the critical care unit whose situation is serious and deteriorating. In such instances, medical professionals intervene -- aggressively, decisively, and as a team. Maine's opioid addiction crisis demands such an approach.

Penobscots lose appeal over policing river

Texto completo: A federal appeals court on Friday rejected arguments made by the Penobscot Indian Nation in a dispute over whether wardens for the state or the tribe have the authority to stop or regulate paddlers, hunters or anglers on the river.
The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston sided by a 2-to-1 majority with a 2015 ruling by U.S. District Judge George Singal that the Penobscot Indian Reservation includes the islands "consisting solely of Indian Island, also known as Old Town Island, and all islands in that river northward," but not the river itself, based on the 1980 Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act.
[documentcloud url="http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3883255-PIN-1st-Circuit-Decision-2017-06-30.html" responsive=true sidebar=false pdf=false]
The tribe sued the state in 2012 in U.S. District Court in Bangor after then Attorney General William Schneider told the nation that only the state of Maine had the authority topolice the river.
Attorneys for the tribe claimed ownership of the entire river and the riverbed. They also expressed concern that its sustenance fishing rights were in danger.
Both sides appealed Singal's ruling last year.
The 1st Circuit's decision also found that the state has not interfered and does not intend to interfere with the nation's sustenance fishing rights, according to the Maine attorney general's office.
The 1st Circuit dismissed a claim that the Penobscot Indian Nation's sustenance fishing rights were threatened. Two of three judges found the issue was not ripe for consideration because the tribe had not cited examples of tribal members who had been injured because they had not been allowed to fish in the Penobscot River.
"We are gratified by the court's ruling and we look forward to working with the Penobscot Nation on areas of mutual interest," Attorney General Janet Mills said Friday in a press release. "We respect and honor the Penobscot Nation's deep historical and cultural ties with the river and look forward to working with them to preserve the health and vibrancy of this major watershed which is so critical to all the people of Maine."
Tribal Chief Kirk Francis said Friday evening that while the ruling was a setback, the tribe will continue the fight for jurisdiction of the river, which he said is inextricably linked to the very identity of the Penobscot people.
He also said that the tribe had never ceded its rights to regulate the river, on which its members depend for the sustenance of fish.
"We'll never walk away from this. It's our ancestral obligation," Francis said.
"Obviously, it's a split decision," Francis said of the ruling, adding that the tribe and its legal team are encouraged by a strong dissenting opinion issued by one of the three judges who weighed in on the issue.
In his opinion, Circuit Judge Juan Torruella noted that treaties signed in 1796, 1818 and 1833 giving the Penobscots sustenance fishing rights "only make sense and can only be exercised" if their reservation includes at least part of the water of the river.
He also cited a legal precedent in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that land and islands can include contiguous water and submerged land.
Efforts to reach lawyers for the tribe were unsuccessful late Friday afternoon.

Fund group homes so Maine doesn't abandon people with disabilities

Texto completo: When it comes to helping people with disabilities in Maine, the state has long been leaving them behind.
More than 4,000 people with intellectual disabilities in the state of Maine require services from direct support professionals who ensure they take their medication, help them eat and use the bathroom, and run group homes to provide a safe place for them to live with 24/7 assistance.
But over the past decade, direct support providers have faced staffing shortages and vacancies as reimbursement rates for services paid for by MaineCare, Maine's version of Medicaid, have been cut by 30 percent since 2007. The percentage accounts for inflation. Direct support providers are funded under Section 21 of MaineCare, and rates must be set by the Legislature.
In 2007, direct care workers made an average of $10.37 an hour. Ten years and numerous cuts to the program later, they now make around $9.17 an hour, barely above minimum wage, according to the Maine Association for Community Service Providers. Once the state minimum wage increases to $10 an hour beginning in 2018, providers will not be able to keep up.
LD 967, sponsored by House Majority Leader Erin Herbig, D-Belfast, would increase reimbursement rates by 10 percent over 2007 levels, in an effort to keep staff and prevent closures.
Just in the past year, 24 group homes have closed , Herbig said, leaving 69 people with disabilities displaced. In the next six months, another 12 homes are expecting to close, bringing the total number of people with disabilities displaced up to 109. If LD 967 doesn't pass, that number is expected to increase.
"The state shouldn't be in the business of deciding which of our loved ones receive care," Herbig said. "If we do not get funding for this bill, it's inevitable that this entire system of care will collapse."
As the bill was originally written, it would have cost the state $65 million between July 1, 2016, and June 30, 2017, showing just how much money each year has been denied to professionals who serve those with disabilities. The $65 million would not only increase rates back to 2007, but would adjust for inflation and the rising costs of operations that have accumulated over the last 10 years.
The bill has since been amended, reducing funding to $26.5 million for 2017-2018 to simply revert rates back to levels seen in 2007 and increase them 10 percent for inflation. Further discussion has reduced this funding even more, to just $15 million, which restores 2007 rates without inflation, but this decrease has not been officially enacted yet.
When Maine closed its psychiatric institutions decades ago, it never fully created the safety net that people who need consistent care need. Not fully funding the providers who are struggling to make ends meet -- and causing them to shut down -- is yet another example of how Maine has let down some of its most vulnerable residents.
The bill, as it currently stands, would provide the absolute bare minimum needed to maintain the system at 2007 funding levels. This is as good as the state can, apparently, do. Providers will take the slight raise because they need it, but then what will they do next year? State government has an obligation to help people with disabilities live in their community, but the plan to make it happen has never fully materialized.
While Maine's House and Senate passed LD 967, it currently sits with the Appropriations Committee, awaiting action on a state budget to see if the money is there to fund it. This is where many bills, approved by the full Legislature, go to die.
The state cannot choose to do nothing.
Maine has no Plan B. Without the provider community, nobody delivers these needed services. If providers are forced to close, people with disabilities who are in need of help will be left on their own. There is no way the state can ethically leave them waiting for a white knight who they need but will never come.
"If there's no relief, this could spell the end of the home- and community-based service system in the state of Maine," said Todd Goodwin, board president of the Maine Association for Community Service Providers and CEO of Community Partners, Inc., a nonprofit that provides direct care services to individuals with disabilities. "Without it, we're looking at devastation."
That's why lawmakers must fund LD 967.

Texto completo: An emergency bill to tweak a year-old law to allow pharmacists to sell medicine to stop an opiate overdose over the counter and without a prescription became law last week without the governor's signature.
Gov. Paul LePage passed on signing an after-deadline bill submitted in early May and endorsed by more than two-thirds of the Legislature that fixed language in an existing law to permit sales of the opiate antidote naloxone, which is commonly sold as Narcan nasal spray, at pharmacies without a prescription.
As written, the original bill -- introduced last year by Rep. Sara Gideon, D-Freeport -- still required would-be customers to have a prescription. That led Rep. Karen Vachon, R-Scarborough, to submit the amendment two months ago.
LePage, who also unsuccessfully vetoed the original bill, has said that Narcan "does not truly save lives, it merely extends them until the next overdose."
The bill is an effort to battle the state's drug overdose epidemic, which claimed the lives of 376 people in 2016, 313 of whom had used an opiate.
The Maine Board of Pharmacy is now tasked with writing the rules for the amended law, which also adds required training for pharmacists and customers.

Texto completo: On a recent Wednesday in Bucksport, the midday breeze was just right. Birds were singing and the sound of distant chimes carried on the swaying grass.
It was a splendid day to be outside.
Perched like a king behind Bonnie Brennan's home was Titus, her six-year-old long-haired cat. With feline immunodeficiency virus, Titus isn't able to enjoy the life of a traditional outdoor cat. The risk of infecting another cat through a bite, paired with the stress that exploring the outdoors would put on his immune system, has confined Titus to a life indoors.
But last summer that all changed thanks to some mesh screening, a few pieces of lumber and a touch of handy work from Brennan. Now, on these nice summer days, you can find Titus lounging in a window box that juts out from Brennan's first floor bathroom, where he can enjoy the breeze and nap in his own sanctuary.
"He loves it. It's a way for him to be closer to nature and it's kind of like his little space," Brennan said.
Among feline enthusiasts, these screen window boxes, and in some cases large-scale outdoor enclosures, have been dubbed "catios." Brennan said she first saw the idea for a catio online and was inspired to make her own. Premade catios can be pricey, and Brennan figured all the do-it-yourself lessons she learned from her brothers growing up would pay off in this instance.
The six foot-by-two foot catio box that Brennan constructed is mounted to the exterior of her home so Titus can access the space from the open bathroom window as he pleases. Because the walls of the catio are made with screen, Titus is kept inside while bugs and pests are kept out.
Equipped with a bed and a few cat toys, Titus spends much of his time on decent weather days enjoying the labors of his adoptive owner. Brennan took on Titus as a foster cat about five years ago when a friend in Florida found him being taunted by some neighborhood children. Having cats in the past, but none presently, Brennan agreed to foster Titus.
In Maine for the past five years, Titus has never been an outdoor cat, though he has escaped a handful of times, Brennan said. Knowing that Titus has a space to look at birds and feel the fresh air while still being safe gives Brennan satisfaction as a pet owner.
While Brennan has weatherized her catio with insulation and plexiglass which she removes during the warmer months so Titus can enjoy the space into November, just up the street, Chester Seidel has taken the catio concept to the next level.
Seidel and his wife have retired to a quaint white home in Bucksport, and aside from a cat statue that greets visitors by the side door, you would assume that Seidel has invested an average amount of time into caring for his indoor cats.
But if you follow him around the back of his garage, a three story catio equipped with carpeted ramps, multiple levels and a tree limb for maximum activity will show you just how lucky Seidel's two cats, Blackie and Rascal, are to have him.
"They have the run of the house," Seidel said. "It was their demand, I just went and did it."
Like Brennan's catio, Seidel also constructed his catio himself. Using two perpendicular exterior walls of his home's attached garage, Seidel built two additional walls to make the area a perfect square using scrap wood he had on hand and chicken wire he purchased to create an enclosed square space that runs the height of the garage. His cats have two entryways into the catio from the garage, one on the ground level and one on a higher level of the catio.
While neither of Seidel's cats have health problems that prevent them from living the life of a traditional outdoor cat, he doesn't want to risk the cats being injured by a predator. Even in the more populated area of Bucksport where Seidel and Brennan live, coyotes and other animals that pose a threat to small pets have been spotted. By having a catio, cats are able to enjoy the experience of being outside without becoming lost or hurt.
"I think anyone that has animals, dogs or cats, should have an enclosed outdoor area for them to do what they want in," Seidel said.
Neither Brennan or Seidel worked with a specific template when building their catios. Instead, they constructed units that would fit their cats' needs. Brennan gathered inspiration online, where you can find ample information on catios as well as websites where you can purchase premade structures.
In their respective catios, Brennan's and Seidel's cats sure looked like they were living the life. Looking content from their perches, they raise the point: If humans can enjoy a nice summer breeze, why shouldn't an indoor cat?

Texto completo: Maine Public Utilities Commissioner Carlisle McLean resigned Friday, signaling that she will not seek or was not in line for reappointment by her former boss, Gov. Paul LePage.
The three-person commission announced McLean's departure in a prepared statement Friday afternoon. A former legal counsel to LePage, she served two years, the last months of which were marked by tension.
McLean was the first commissioner up for reappointment after LePage called for all three commissioners to resign over changes to the state's solar energy policy, which he said was too generous to owners of small-scale solar systems.
McLean stated in her letter that she "sought to deliberately, independently and thoroughly consider each decision in light of the record before me with the public interest and the Maine ratepayer front of mind."
She also had been absent from the commission's two most recent deliberations, which PUC spokesman Harry Lanphear said was a planned vacation. She was present last at the commission's May 31 hearing.
In the Friday statement, McLean expressed her appreciation for the appointment and the challenges of adjudicating matters related to the state's public utilities, but did not elaborate on what prompted her resignation.
"I feel so fortunate to have had this incredible privilege to serve the Maine people and work on cutting edge energy and utility regulatory issues," McLean said. "I will cherish the experience throughout the future and reflect upon it fondly."
Lanphear wrote in an email that McLean would not be taking interviews.
Commission Chairman Mark Vannoy said McLean will be "truly missed" on the panel.
Before her appointment to serve out the term of former chairman Tom Welch, who resigned four years into his six-year term, McLean was LePage's chief legal counsel. Before that, she was in private practice at the Portland law firm Preti Flaherty.
McLean added that she enjoyed working with the other commissioners, colleagues across the region and commission staff.
"...they are a dedicated group of professionals who work extraordinarily hard every day for the citizens of Maine," McLean said. "I look forward to pursuing my next career challenge while spending some personal time with my family."
It's unclear whether LePage has selected a successor for McLean. Lanphear directed that question to the governor's office.
Spokespeople for LePage were not immediately available for comment Friday and the governor's office had not issued a statement regarding McLean's resignation.

Texto completo: AUGUSTA, Maine -- House Republicans dealt a fatal blow to a last-minute budget compromise by heeding Gov. Paul LePage's advice Friday to reject the spending plan crafted by legislative leaders to avoid a government shutdown.
While a majority of the House supported the budget during two votes, Republican opposition denied it the two-thirds majority it needs to pass as an emergency measure in time to steer Maine away from a government shutdown.
In each case, the vote was 87-60 with all of the Democrats and independents in favor, along with nine Republicans. The second House vote, shortly after 8 p.m., means that the Legislature will not be presenting a budget to LePage in time to prevent a shutdown on Saturday.
In the latest odd twist in this year's tortured budget talks, word that LePage would offer a new last-minute budget kept lawmakers in the building after the House vote that doomed the compromise. Confusion and rancor deepened as the clock ticked toward the midnight shutdown deadline.
[Here's what happens when state government shuts down]
The compromise budget bill passed in the Senate on a 34-1 vote, which raised the stakes for the next House vote on the proposal. Only Sen. Eric Brakey, R-Auburn, opposed the budget, he said, because of the increase in the lodging tax that it contains.
After the Senate vote, legislators met individually and in groups, trying to sway colleagues toward their positions on the budget. House Democrats and Republicans held caucus meetings, leading up to the key enactment vote Friday night. But those efforts failed to alter the outcome.
The initial House vote followed a lengthy debate. Only Democrats -- urging passage of the compromise budget -- spoke before the second House vote.
During debate on the initial vote, Rep. Jeff Timberlake, R-Turner, a member of the Appropriations Committee, has led the opposition to the compromise spending plan. He objected to both its contents and the process that led to Friday's vote, which ended with the leaders of the House and Senate negotiating the final details.
"We owe it to the people of the state of Maine to fix this document and pass a responsible budget," Timberlake said. "I promised them I would vote for a smart, fiscally responsible policy. That is not this bill that's in front of us now."
[LePage: Police would work, state parks stay open in shutdown]
Rep. William Tuell, R-East Machias, was one of the nine Republicans to vote for the budget.
"Is it what everyone wants? No," said Tuell. "We can scream and rant and rave and holler for the next two weeks, two months or two years and nobody is going to get everything they want."
Some Democrats who had voiced opposition earlier during negotiations swung to vote for it.
Rep. Michael Sylvester, D-Portland, led an effort earlier this year to gather Democrats and independents to vote against the budget without a progressive revenue source to keep the state's share of public school funding at 55 percent or more. Fifty-two House Democrats and two independents signed the pledge. Despite the fact the education surtax enacted in a November 2016 referendum was pushed out of the budget on Thursday, Sylvester voted for the compromise plan. Like many who expressed reservations about the final draft, Sylvester said the specter of a shutdown motivated him to support the plan.
"I will vote for hope," said Sylvester. "I will vote for the young lady who emailed me less than an hour ago asking me if they would have food for the next week."
While some senators -- mostly Democrats -- spoke at length about their displeasure with the compromise and the process that led to it, all but Brakey voted for the bill, in a show of support that Sen. Bill Diamond, D-Windham, said he hoped would change minds in the House.
"In my estimation, this budget will be known as the education budget," said Sen. Brian Langley, R-Ellsworth. "This has tremendous value for our students and our taxpayers."
The last-minute votes were the result of a controversial state budget debate that has been ongoing for several weeks, though the sticking point has been clear since November of last year when voters approved the 3 percent surtax on income above $200,000 to benefit public schools. LePage quickly vowed to repeal the law and legislative Republicans joined him in their opposition earlier this year.
LePage has vowed repeatedly to veto the budget -- including at a State House news conference late Friday morning -- but only after he has held it for 10 days, which he is entitled to do under the Maine Constitution. Unless the governor changes his mind and either signs the bill or vetoes it immediately, avoiding a government shutdown is impossible.
After the second House vote failed, Rep. John Martin, D-Eagle Lake, asked about rumors that LePage would introduce a new budget bill. House Minority Leader Ken Fredette, R-Newport, said that he had engaged in conversations with LePage about that possibility and that a proposal would likely be forthcoming, although he did not say when.
As House members discussed the situation, all routes around a shutdown seemed blocked.

FishFinder: Big tuna numbers off the Maine coast

Texto completo: Bluefin tuna are much sought-after and even more so since the show "Wicked Tuna" made them all the more prime to want to put on the deck. Well, they are back in pretty decent numbers chasing large schools of herring and pogies off the Maine coast. The tuna numbers are making a comeback, allowing commercial anglers to keep five fish last season and probably as many this year. No one knows what the price will bring come the middle of August but it's good to see the tuna numbers have rebounded and with good management they will continue to thrive for decades to come.
SALTWATER
NORTH SHORE -- The cows have arrived! Not the milkers silly, the real ones we like to catch hook line and sinker. Striped bass have migrated up from the deep south and they are chasing pogies in the Piscataqua River, Hampton River and a few off Plum Island. These big bass are up to 50-plus pounds but several 45-pound fish were taken in the last three days. On Plum Island and the Salisbury drift bass are coming and going on low tide. I fished here the other day using worms and managed a fish on every cast, but all were shorts. Lots of fun though while the guy next to me caught a couple of keepers to 34 inches. The southern end of Plum is all bass to Ipswich Bay. Offshore the first reports of bluefish are coming in and they are scattering the mackerel. Party boats are catching cod to 20 pounds but letting them all go. Lots of haddock and some pollock.
BOSTON HARBOR -- Good-to-fantastic striped bass action in Hull Gut along with black sea bass. Long Island has good bass and plenty of flatties to fill a cooler. The inner harbor has stripers chasing the herring but these are now on the tail end of the run. Pogies however are in the harbor and take the place of the herring as bait. The great fishing for flounder continues in deeper water now with doormats to 4 pounds common. A few black sea bass are found here.
FRESHWATER
LOWELL AREA -- The smallmouth bass action is pretty good around UMass Lowell. Use live bait such as shiners. Long Pond was great in Littleton for bucketmouths until last weekend then the water got murky. This will clear and the action will be great now.

Health Care Ads Running This Recess

Texto completo: The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is launching geo-targeted and candidate-specific Google search and display ads on the Republican health care bill over the July Fourth recess as part of an ongoing six-figure digital ad buy.
The holiday recess isn't a typical time for expensive TV buys since many families go away or are spending time outdoors. But plenty of groups will be advertising over the congressional recess -- mostly online, but some on TV -- on the GOP health care proposal ahead of anticipated Senate action when Congress returns July 10.
As Nevada Republican Dean Heller participates in a July Fourth parade in small-town Ely, targeted voters near the parade route (and others throughout the state) will be directed to a 30-second YouTube version of the DSCC's previously released health care ad "The Price," which ends with the words, "What will Senator Heller's vote on health care cost you?"
Voters in Arizona and Texas will see the same DSCC ad tailored to Sen. Jeff Flake and Sen. Ted Cruz, respectively.
In states where GOP governors or members of Congress are considering running for the Senate, voters will see a different six-second DSCC YouTube ad. Targets of those ads include Florida Gov. Rick Scott, North Dakota Rep. Kevin Cramer, Michigan Rep. Fred Upton, Indiana Reps. Todd Rokita and Luke Messer, Pennsylvania Reps. Lou Barletta and Mike Kelly, West Virginia Rep. Evan Jenkins and Missouri Reps. Vicky Hartzler and Ann Wagner.
The DSCC ads target voters in the geographic proximity of parades -- like attendees at the Point Pleasant Sternwheel Regatta in West Virginia, where Jenkins is scheduled to serve as grand marshal of Saturday's parade. Voters looking up information about parade routes or candidates will see Google search ads that direct them to a website that plays "The Price."
"We are joining voters in speaking out against the GOP's expensive, unpopular and horrific proposals and in holding Republican Senate candidates accountable wherever they go," DSCC spokesman David Bergstein said in a statement.
The Progressive Change Campaign Committee went on the air in West Virginia on June 28 with a broadcast and cable TV ad, "Priscilla," that urges viewers to tell their senators that "cutting Medicaid is immoral." Beginning Saturday, the group is expanding into Texas, Arizona and Nevada, with the ad running through the recess.
It's running in the Austin and San Antonio, Texas, media markets, in the Phoenix media market, in the Las Vegas media market, and on Fox, MSNBC and CNN.
The Progressive Change Campaign Committee is also extending its West Virginia buy, which initially ran in all five of the state's media markets and in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area on cable news. Starting July 1, it will continue running in the Charleston media market and on cable. The group declined to specify how much it's spending but said the buy will expand, in dates and location, based on its grass-roots fundraising.
Planned Parenthood Action Fund is running TV ads in Arizona, Nevada and West Virginia over the recess on cable and broadcast. It declined to provide the size of the buy.
AARP Advocates is continuing to run a seven-figure ad campaign that urges viewers to tell their senators to "vote no on the health care bill." Ads are running on TV, radio and social media in Ohio, Alaska, Nevada, West Virginia and Colorado. Social media ads only are running in Maine, Kansas and North Dakota.
The AFL-CIO is continuing to run ads on YouTube and social media over the recess as part of a six-figure campaign that began on June 23 in Alaska, Maine, Nevada, Ohio and West Virginia.
UltraViolet Action, the PAC for the women's advocacy group, is launching ads on local newspaper homepages in West Virginia, Arizona and Maine between July 5 and 7 that highlight the number of people in each state that the group says would lose insurance under the GOP plan.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is running Facebook ads in four districts where GOP lawmakers voted for the health care bill in the House. The ads, backed by a five-figure investment, target Reps. Martha McSally of Arizona's 2nd District, Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey's 11th District, Jeff Denham of California's 10th District and David Valadao of California's 21st District.

Texto completo: AUGUSTA (AP) -- Maine has granted temporary regulatory powers to local officials after a town recently discovered it had no authority under the state's long-standing medical marijuana program to restrict a pot growing facility from being opened next to a school.
AP file photo
More political coverage....
The Kennebec Journal reports Republican Gov. Paul LePage signed the new law June 23. It lets cities set rules to prevent caregivers from growing pot within 500 feet of a school.
The bill was introduced this month when Richmond officials found they could not stop a 30,000-square-foot marijuana facility proposed less than 300 feet from a school.
A trade group for marijuana caregivers said most assumed a similar law was already in place. Caregivers can provide marijuana to a small number of patients.

The sign for the Priscilla and Dolard Gendron Early Learning Center is unveiled at the YWCA Central Maine on East Avenue in Lewiston.
The name reflects the financial support the Gendron family has given to the YWCA on East Avenue.
In 2010, the Gendrons provided a sustaining donation to the organization.
YMCA board President Barbara Bixby said at the dedication, "When the organization was on the brink of closing and the YWCA Central Maine had few resources remaining, the Gendron family recognized the value that the organization still held in our community. At that pivotal moment, Priscilla and Dolard Gendron kept the doors open and planted a seed that has allowed the YWCA to thrive."
In 2016, the Gendrons made another substantial gift that has supported the YWCA in expanding the organization's vision for the Early Learning Center program.
The Learning Center serves 50 children ages 2[1/2] to 5. The program offers hands-on learning with an emphasis on empathy and equality that allows children to enter kindergarten prepared.
The Gendrons received flowers from YWCA prekindergarten children and guests had a lunch and celebration.

Texto completo: GRAY -- An inflatable star theater will be set up Saturday, July 8, at the Maine Wildlife Park to introduce children to astronomy and space science. The program be held from 6:30 to 9 p.m. at the park off Route 26.
John Meader, educator at Northern Stars Planetarium, will lead a fun and educational exploration of the night sky. The presentation, called "The Wonderful Sky," will explore constellations, visible planets, meteors, the sun, the moon, and maybe comets.
Northern Stars Planetarium has been traveling to schools, libraries and events throughout Maine for the past 25 years, sharing the wonders of the sky with nearly 20,000 Maine school children each year.
Before or after the star shows, scheduled at 7, 7:30, 8 and 8:30 p.m., attendees can participate in other nighttime activities, including constellation chalk art, stories and legends, a lunar cycle demonstration and a solar-scavenge. Or just walk around the park learning more about astronomy and what wildlife does in the dark.
Tickets for each of the four consecutive shows will be distributed to visitors as they enter the park. About 50 people at a time will be able to participate in each show.
The program must be canceled if it is raining. Information will be posted on the park's voice mail.

Texto completo: AUGUSTA -- A controversial commission set up by President Donald Trump to examine U.S. election fraud asked all 50 states on Wednesday to provide detailed information on voter rolls, but Maine law may keep Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap from releasing much of it.
Sun Journal file photo
Maine's Secretary of State Matt Dunlap is interviewed by NECN's Amy Sinclair outside the Lewiston Armory in 2014. Dunlap was making a whilrwind tour of the state, checking on how the election was going.
All states got a Wednesday letter from Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, the vice chairman of the Presidential Commission on Election Integrity, asking them to provide data publicly available under state laws on voter files, saying it will be made available to the public.
It's an effort to examine voter fraud -- a phenomenon that is a focus of Republicans, yet has proven to be rare. A professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles wrote in The Washington Post in 2014 that he found 31 cases out of 1 billion ballots in the preceding 14 years.
The commission convened by the Republican president and chaired by Vice President Mike Pence has been criticized by many, including the American Civil Liberties Union, which has called it a "boondoggle."
But Dunlap, a Democrat, agreed to join it in May, saying that while he expects the commission to find little evidence of fraud, his attitude about serving was "that if you're not at the table, you're on it."
Kobach's letter asks for the first and last names of registrants, along with middle names or initials, addresses, dates of birth, party affiliation, the last four digits of Social Security numbers, voter history from 2006, information on felony convictions, overseas citizen information and other information -- if that information is publicly available.
In an email, Dunlap spokeswoman Kristen Muszynski said the secretary of state "will review the request" for voter information and if it's granted, the commission "would have to follow all the provisions" of state law around the file, known as Maine's Central Voter Registration.
But state law could shield much of that, allowing Maine to provide voter information to governmental entities while saying it can be used only for "authorized activities and may not be redistributed."
In those cases, first and last names can be released, but only the year of birth and not the date. Randomly assigned voter record numbers can be disclosed to the voter, a court pursuant to a court order or a bona fide law enforcement official who is investigating a specific voter. But they "are not released in any report or file of voters, regardless of whether it is an authorized use," according to Muszynski. Party affiliation isn't included in that list of uses.
The American Civil Liberties Union has fought Kobach in Kansas on attempts to tighten voting laws there. A federal judge fined him $1,000 for making "misleading" statements about a document that he was photographed taking into a meeting last year with Trump when the ACLU asked for it, according to the Associated Press.
"I fully expect the secretary of state to protect that information if they have it," Zach Heiden, the chief lawyer for the ACLU of Maine, said.

Texto completo: AUGUSTA -- The Maine Court Appointed Special Advocates program will hold training for volunteer advocates Aug. 8 to 11 in the Augusta area.
The training is free. Attendees will learn about all aspects of child advocacy work in order to be certified as a volunteer guardian ad litem in the Maine District Courts.
Maine CASAs are community volunteers who are appointed to serve as guardians ad litem (GALs) for children whose parents are involved in a child protection case. The foundation of the CASA's work is learning about the case, then advising the judge in writing of what he/she believes is in the child's best interest.
CASAs come from a wide variety of professional and personal backgrounds and are guided throughout the process by staff attorneys.
Last year, hundreds of children involved in a child protection case had a volunteer CASA who served as the child's voice in court. Now, there are more foster children than CASA volunteers.
Volunteers do not need any special training to apply other than a high school diploma or GED equivalent. They must also be over 21. Along with the application, they must provide three references and must complete a background check that includes disclosing any criminal or child protection history.

Budget committee sends budget plan to Legislature

Resumen: LePage hammered that in a Thursday radio interview -- even though he suggested raising the lodging tax to 10 percent in his original budget proposal in January as part of a package of tax proposals designed to eliminate the 3 percent surtax for education and reduce Maine's top income tax rate to 5.75 percent. [LePage: Police would work, state parks stay open in shutdown] Among the other elements of the deal the special budget panel added Thursday were more than $14 million in new funding for direct-care worker pay rates and $8 million for a LePage-supported grant fund to help schools and municipalities regionalize. LePage has said repeatedly this week that if the full Legislature doesn't support the budget priorities backed by House Republicans, he will delay action on a budget bill for up to 10 days before vetoing it.

Texto completo: Barely a day away from a government shutdown, a special six-person budget committee recommended a tenuous two-year state spending plan to the Legislature late Thursday, setting up a scramble to wrangle two-thirds support and a showdown with Gov. Paul LePage.
AP file photo
More political coverage....
The deal brokered by Senate President Mike Thibodeau, R-Winterport, and House Speaker Sara Gideon, D-Freeport, has a bottom line of $7.1 billion and appears to be the state's only hope of avoiding a shutdown.
But it's full of pitfalls that could repel some Republicans and Democrats in what promises to be a dramatic set of votes on Friday. Minority members in both parties said they were left out of negotiations, with Rep. Tom Winsor, R-Norway, casting the lone vote against the plan.
Chief among potential conflict points are a lodging tax increase and overall price tag that Gov. Paul LePage has said is too high, as well as repeal of a surtax that progressive Democrats have staunchly defended.
[More: Here's what happens when state government shuts down]
The budget bill must win two-thirds approval in the House and Senate and be signed by the governor before 11:59 p.m. Friday to avoid Maine's first government shutdown since 1991.
However, LePage said on Thursday that he'd hold a budget that raised any taxes for the 10 days he's allotted under law, which would cause a shutdown even if a budget passes.
Thibodeau called the budget "an imperfect document," but said he hoped it "will be good enough to bring people together."
"We feel we've done the best job we can here," Gideon said.
But Winsor's vote could be problematic, because a number of LePage-aligned House Republicans will have to support the budget to achieve two-thirds support.
Afterward, he and fellow Republican members were hustled into a meeting with Kathleen Newman, LePage's deputy chief of staff. House Minority Leader Ken Fredette, R-Newport, declined comment through a spokesman.
"I don't know whether the governor's office and the governor himself would approve this proposal," Winsor said during the meeting.
The plan aims to resolve Maine's budget impasse by increasing state aid to K-12 public education funding by $162 million over the current biennium while eliminating the surtax on high-income earners approved by voters in 2016.
Republicans have long aimed to repeal the surtax but progressives have defended it. The scrapping of the surtax represents a major concession by Democrats, as does the level of education funding offered by Republicans.
To offset some of the lost revenue, the plan would raise Maine's lodging tax from 9 percent to 10.5 percent beginning Oct. 1 -- higher than the Senate Republican proposal of 10 percent that was made earlier this week.
LePage hammered that in a Thursday radio interview -- even though he suggested raising the lodging tax to 10 percent in his original budget proposal in January as part of a package of tax proposals designed to eliminate the 3 percent surtax for education and reduce Maine's top income tax rate to 5.75 percent.
The compromise plan also would use unspent Medicaid funding and $10 million over the biennium from the Fund for a Healthy Maine, which is underwritten by a lawsuit against tobacco companies.
[LePage: Police would work, state parks stay open in shutdown]
Among the other elements of the deal the special budget panel added Thursday were more than $14 million in new funding for direct-care worker pay rates and $8 million for a LePage-supported grant fund to help schools and municipalities regionalize.
Under committee rules, the budget proposal forwarded Thursday night cannot be amended during debate in the House and Senate.
Thursday's meeting followed quietly unproductive Appropriations Committee budget talks that stalled for several weeks before the committee of conference convened on June 13 to take over negotiations.
LePage isn't the only concern with the budget. Both Thibodeau and Gideon said they expect some Republicans and Democrats to vote against it.
Sen. Catherine Breen, D-Falmouth, the only Senate Democrat on the special budget committee and the Appropriations Committee, voted for the plan, but she said during the meeting that she was disappointed that the Appropriations Committee was cut out of the process and that end-stage negotiations were conducted only by Gideon and Thibodeau.
"I believe most likely it'll still be a two-thirds vote," said Senate Minority Leader Troy Jackson, D-Allagash, "but I don't think it had to come to this."
After LePage unveiled his budget proposal in early January, the Appropriations Committee spent months poring over it before presenting three partisan recommendations, none of which stood a chance of garnering support needed to pass in the House and Senate.
LePage has said repeatedly this week that if the full Legislature doesn't support the budget priorities backed by House Republicans, he will delay action on a budget bill for up to 10 days before vetoing it. Not counting Sundays, that's the window afforded him to consider bills under the Maine Constitution.
If that comes to pass, presuming the Legislature garners the needed two-thirds support on Friday, state government would be shut down through July 10.

Texto completo: DURHAM -- Back in 1975, Bob Hackett wanted to live in a lighthouse, so he built one, 10 miles from sea.
It went on the market June 14 looking for a new keeper.
The Lighthouse, as it's called, is generating plenty of interest -- 7,981 clicks on the real estate listing just last week, the most-clicked house of the week anywhere in the country on realtor.com.
"It's going to take a unique buyer for a unique property," said Realtor Kathy Gallant with RE/MAX Riverside. "The kitchen's round, everything's round -- it's round, round, round, round."
The house officially measures 35-feet across at the base and 47-feet high, four stories with an observation deck on top. (And yes, there's a rotating, blinking light on top, too.) It has four bedrooms, 2.5 baths, three fireplaces and an unattached garage on two rural acres.
Hackett built the house out of concrete blocks. Gallant is more familiar with its history since 2003, when the current owners bought it out of foreclosure. It was in rough shape and had turned into a party house.
"They really loved the fact it was a lighthouse in Maine," she said.
The owners put in new windows, renovated the kitchen. "They've been very happy here," Gallant said.
They're selling because they need more space and a property with an in-law apartment.
The kitchen is on the first floor, master bedroom on the third. The fourth floor observatory features a walk-out deck and a pull-down staircase that gives access to the all-windows topmost level.
A Boston Magazine blog last week called it quirky and "quite an impressive bargain at $86 per square foot."
That's a list price of $235,000.
Gallant said there's likely to be an open house in late July. To date, she's seen interest from as far away as Massachusetts.
The new buyer "could be a family -- someone who certainly doesn't want a cookie- cutter cape in a subdivision," she said. "For someone who wants a truly unique home, you're not going to find anything else like it."
Connie Footman, Durham's town clerk from 1965 to 2006, remembers when Hackett built the Lighthouse.
"People would come in (to the town office) and say, 'I wonder what he's doing?'" Footman said. "I would tell them, 'He told me he's building a lighthouse because he always wanted to live in one.' I think we figured everybody to his own."

Texto completo: The dash to get away for the July Fourth holiday weekend is well underway, with steady-to-heavy traffic reported on major roads leading to Cape Cod, Maine, and New Hampshire early Friday evening.
“There are delays due to heavy volume, but that's to be expected. There's been nothing spectacular so far. No major accidents that shut down lanes or anything like that," said Trooper Paul Sullivan, a spokesman for the Massachusetts State Police.
Cameras recording traffic in real-time show delays are heaviest on Route 1 north, from Revere to Saugus, according to Mass511.com. Interstate 95 northbound is backed up from Burlington to Wakefield.
Farther north in New Hampshire, heavy delays were also reported on I-95, from exit 2 near the Hampton toll plaza to exit 7 in Portsmouth, according to online traffic reports for the Granite State.
The rush south to the Cape is also in full swing.
On Interstate 92, delays were reported from the Ashmont exit in Dorchester to Braintree.
On the Cape, Route 25 is backed up from Bourne to Exit 2 as drivers try to cross the Bourne Bridge.
There are similar delays in Sagamore, as bridge congestion has backed up Route 30 for several miles.
Sullivan, the trooper, had advice for those still waiting to get away.
“Get out when you have the opportunity. There will be traffic, but, so far, there aren't any major lane closures or anything like that. Don't wait until there are."

Texto completo: There is a lot going on weather-wise in New England Friday evening, and all of it is happening because of a boundary that passes through the middle of the six-state region. South of this warm front, here in Southern New England, it's hot and very humid. Temperatures have soared well into the 80s. Dew points, a measure of humidity in the air, are in the lower 70s. This is an uncomfortable and unstable air mass, and storms are already developing in it.
To the north of the front, across Maine, New Hampshire, and a small piece of northern Vermont, the air is cooler, but it is bumping up against the very warm and humid air to the south. This dynamic will bring at least two rounds of rain, some of it quite heavy, between Friday evening and Sunday morning. Because of the expected rain, the National Weather Service has issued a flood watch for much of Maine and New Hampshire away from the coast.
As of Friday afternoon, severe thunderstorm watches were posted for an area including Central and Western Massachusetts. Some of these storms could bring strong, damaging winds, hail, and frequent lightning. If you are traveling this evening in New England, be aware of highly variable weather.
Day-by-day forecast
Look for showers and storms overnight Friday, but after the sun sets, the lack of heating means the severe storm threat is over. It's going to be very humid, and if you don't have air conditioning, it will be quite uncomfortable for sleeping. The greatest likelihood of severe weather is west of Route 495. I don't expect any severe weather over Cape Cod. Saturday will feature the conclusion of early showers and skies becoming partly to mostly sunny and very warm and humid. A new round of possible showers and storms is expected to move in during the afternoon or evening. Again, this rain could be heavy and have some strong thunderstorms embedded in it. Highs will be in the 80s to near 90 in the warmest spots.
Sunday through Independence Day
On Sunday, any morning showers will end, and we can expect it to clear thereafter. I am feeling more bullish about a nice day with very warm air and quite a bit of developing sunshine. You probably can even head to the beach after the morning showers end.
This sets up Monday and Tuesday as the top picks of the five-day period. Monday and Tuesday appear to be dry and warm everywhere with sunshine and little or no risk of showers. Humidity levels will be much lower than Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. And with no rainfall in sight, I would say these two days are the best for outdoor activities.

Texto completo: It doesnt matter if you like them hard-boiled, scrambled or soaked in heart-clogging hollandaise sauce: When eggs are this cheap, its a good time to get cracking. Supplies in the U.S. have surged so much in recent months that prices are the lowest for this time of year in at least a decade. It will probably take awhile for consumers to eat through the surplus inventory, so the government is predicting egg costs will drop more than any other food group in 2017.
The slump marks a sharp turnaround in the egg business. In 2015, an avian influenza outbreak forced farmers to destroy millions of birds and prices skyrocketed. Eager to take advantage of the rally, producers expanded flocks that were the biggest ever by the end of last year. But demand hasnt keep pace.
The market was temporarily starved for eggs, and now its drowning, said Tom Elam, president of Carmel, Indiana-based consulting firm FarmEcon LLC. Theres just too many eggs out there.
Retailers were charging $1.414 on average for a dozen eggs in May, the lowest for the month since 2006, Bureau of Labor Statistics data show. Prices have plummeted 52 percent from a record $2.966 reached in September 2015. Costs are on track to fall by as much as 6 percent this year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture forecasts. The decline comes even with overall food inflation projected at as much as 2 percent.
Total egg supplies in the U.S. will climb 1.3 percent in 2017 to 8.829 billion dozen, the government said in a June 9 report. Thats the highest in data going back to 1992. Output is projected to rise again next year, with total supplies forecast at 8.957 billion dozen, the USDA estimates.
The glut has been a drag on Cal-Maine Foods Inc., the nations largest egg company. Shares have slumped 12 percent in 2017, the worst start to a year since 2009. Adam Samuelson, an analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., downgraded the recommendation on the stock to sell from neutral on June 16.
Historically, the egg industry has experienced many boom and bust cycles with periods of overproduction disrupting the supply-demand balance, Cal-Maine Chief Executive Officer Adolphus Baker said during a presentation earlier this month.
The current slump may not last, Baker suggested. High prices cure high prices by encouraging more supply, but low prices also cure low prices by forcing producers to cut back, he said.
In response to the market rout, production has been cut at Mentone, Indiana-based Midwest Poultry Services LP, a family owned company with 10 million laying hens on five farms that normally produce about 160 million dozen eggs annually.
This year, the first six months have been disastrous, said CEO Bob Krouse, a 34-year veteran of the egg industry. He declined to say how much hes reduced output. Its just a good reminder to everybody that this is a cyclical business.
Nationwide, farmers have reduced their flocks by about a million birds a month this year, dropping to 371 million as of June 1, from about 376 million on Jan. 1, USDA data show.
Another bright spot for producers is that demand is expected to pick up before the end of the year. Consumers tend to eat more hot breakfasts that include eggs after the weather turns colder. At the same time, holiday cooking and baking also helps boost consumption, which usually increases around Thanksgiving.
But for now, farmers arent reducing their flocks fast enough to have a major impact on prices, Elam said. At the same time, even with smaller animal numbers, egg production is rising because the hens are younger and genetically more productive, said Knox Jones, a dairy analyst at Advanced Economic Solutions.
As of June 1, 100 hens produced an average 77.1 eggs per day, the USDA said in a June 23 report. Thats up 1 percent from 76.3 a year earlier.
Adding a further drag on prices, the industry-wide move to increase cage-free production is limiting farmers ability to trim flocks. By 2050, as much as 75 percent of output will be cage-free, up from about 14 percent now, Jones estimates. The move comes as companies such as McDonalds Corp. have pledged to move to cage-free eggs to meet growing demand from consumers focused on animal welfare.
Premiums for the product could also start to disappear as they become more the norm, Jones said.
Farmers are unprofitable right now, but they find themselves in an awkward situation, Jones said. They should be producing less to ease the glut, but they also need to be expanding their flocks of cage-free animals, he said.

California's Rise and Fall, From One Gov. Brown to Another; Jerry Brown is the opposite of his father, who made the Golden State the most livable in the country.

Texto completo: On a recent drive from the East Coast back home to California, I found myself thinking about four men. The first was President Dwight Eisenhower, who championed the notion of continental superhighways before signing, in 1956, the law that authorized the Interstate Highway System. It reflected an American passion for the open road, as symbolized in popular culture by the ad jingle "See the U.S.A. in your Chevrolet" and Jack Kerouac's novel "On the Road," written in 1951.
The second man was Wallace Libby Hardison. In 1870s Pennsylvania, he and a partner, Lyman Stewart, successfully wildcatted for oil until John D. Rockefeller put everyone like them out of business. Undaunted, the pair left for the land of opportunity--California--where ambition and industry were all a man needed to succeed. They struck oil in what is today Ventura County and founded the Union Oil Co., later known as Unocal. A few years on, Hardison and another Maine transplant, Nathan Weston Blanchard, gambled big by buying 400 acres and planting citrus. Thus was born the Limoneira Company, now one of North America's largest growers of lemons and avocados.
The third man who came to mind was Edmund G. "Pat" Brown. As governor from 1959-67, his ambition was to make California the most livable state and thereby dethrone New York as the nation's most populous. To that end, he turned the Golden State's public university system into the world's finest; built roads, bridges and other infrastructure; and constructed a water-delivery system that ensured adequate supply everywhere, from California's agricultural center, to its coastal cities, to its deserts.
By the end of 1962--days before the governor's second inaugural--enough Americans had moved here for him to declare victory and ring a bell kicking off a 72-hour statewide celebration. "My son asked me what I hoped to accomplish as governor," Brown once said. "I told him, essentially, to make life more comfortable for people, as far as government can."
That son who'd asked him was the fourth person I thought of while driving: Jerry Brown, California's present governor. I was struck by the chasm that separated him from his father, Eisenhower and Hardison. Those three men believed government's role was to provide Americans wider opportunities to pursue individual happiness--which worked particularly well in California, where there was more liberty than infrastructure. Jerry Brown, by contrast, appears to believe that happiness is a collective notion and that the endpoint of helping "as far as government can" is visible only through the Hubble telescope.
Take his insistence that California spend unknown billions of dollars on a bullet train connecting Southern and Northern California. Every poll shows that few people intend to ride it. Why? Because taking your own car will be faster and cheaper than driving to a station, parking, riding with stops along the way, and then renting a car or hailing an Uber at your destination. And anyway, tickets to fly between L.A. and San Francisco--which the train won't even reach directly--can be had for less than $100. Why ride a rail that's routed not along the state's scenic coast (already served by Amtrak's Coast Starlight) but through its distinctly unlovely interior?
An even more utopian folly is Mr. Brown's determination to establish California as a model for climate-change politics and policy. It goes without saying that one state--or even one country--cannot reduce carbon emissions enough to benefit the climate in a meaningful way. The true consequence of the governor's ubergreen policies is to reverse his father's migration, at least for productive citizens and businesses. They're leaving California for states where energy is cheaper, taxes are lower, and the regulatory burden is lighter. Middle-aged people making $100,000 to $200,000 a year are the largest cohort of those moving out, according to researchers Joel Kotkin and Wendell Cox.
Two years ago, Mr. Brown signed a bill requiring state-regulated utilities to produce, by 2030, 50% of their electricity from renewable sources like wind and solar. Although those are highly subsidized, Californians still pay about 50% more for power than the national average. Gasoline is no better. The moment my car crossed the state line from Arizona, a gallon of gas instantly cost a dollar more, and nearly twice what I'd paid in Louisiana. The higher price can be blamed on not only taxes but the cost of refining gas to California's exacting specifications, a 25-year-old antipollution program that may well have outlived its need.
California's gas taxes were, until recently, a mere 30% higher than the nationwide average, yet its streets and highways tend to be in poor shape compared with those in other states. So in April the governor strong-armed the Legislature into raising gas taxes 12 cents a gallon and annual vehicle fees $50. The extra $5 billion a year will barely address a backlog of repairs estimated at more than $100 billion. And there's no ironclad guarantee the funds will be allocated to road improvements at all. Yet the governor dismissed his opponents as unworthy of argument. "Roads require money to fix," Mr. Brown said. "The freeloaders--I've had enough of them."
For most of human history, people spent much of their day in search of calories. Only in the past century and a half have those concerns been obviated by plentiful fossil-fuel energy that spurred new technologies and literally built California. See: W.L. Hardison. If Gov. Brown is looking for a legacy worthy of his father, he'd do well to take a page from California's history of relying on the grit and ingenuity of Californians. Left unshackled, the species that invented language, music, and single-malt scotch can overcome whatever Mother Nature is going to do anyway, notwithstanding the state's shrinking carbon footprint.
Mr. Engel is author, most recently, of "L.A. '56: A Devil in the City of Angels."

Texto completo: Washington state lawmakers released the details of their last-minute $43.7 billion budget deal Friday.
The two-year operating budget is expected to be passed by the legislature and signed by Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, by the end of the day to avoid a partial government shutdown.
The agreement came after a prolonged fight between Republicans who control the state Senate and Democrats who control the House.
The sides have been at odds over how to meet state education funding levels mandated by the state Supreme Court.
The budget would increase state spending on kindergarten to 12th grade education by about $1.8 billion over the next two years.
About $1.6 billion in new funding would come by boosting property taxes.
Another $456 million would come from ending tax exemptions, including collecting more taxes on online sales.
"This is a historic budget that I believe fully funds our schools for the first time in decades and will meet our constitutional obligations," said Gov. Inslee. "As I have said, a split Legislature means compromises are necessary and neither side will get everything it wants."
The showdown in Washington state, home to more than seven million people, came as legislatures in Illinois and Maine are also fighting over their budgets.

When did summer camp offerings start sounding like brochures for Canyon Ranch?

Texto completo: Sweet-smelling laundry, washed and folded regularly. A Ninja Warrior course modeled after the “American Ninja Warrior" TV show — and overseen by a real ninja warrior. For dinner, perhaps Dover sole in lemon butter sauce with jasmine rice.
No, this isn't the latest brochure from Canyon Ranch. These are just a few of the amenities at Maine's Camp Micah, said Irina Aguirre, whose son attended the camp last year and can't wait to return this summer.
“We went to a family immersion day and had lunch in a cathedral-ceilinged cafeteria," said Aguirre, of Chestnut Hill. “The pasta bar! The veggie options! It was like grabbing lunch in the Financial District."
Summer camp used to be a touchstone of homespun nostalgia and character-building sleeping accommodations, immortalized in teen flicks like “Little Darlings" and “Wet Hot American Summer." Remember that old musical parody about camp, “Hello Mudduh, Hello Fadduh"? The lyrics went something like this: “I went hiking with Joe Spivy/He developed poison ivy/ You remember Leonard Skinner/ He got ptomaine poisoning last night after dinner."
If Joe Spivy went to camp now, he'd develop a taste for kite-surfing, and young Leonard might be cruising the sushi bar.
I came to this realization when browsing the brochure for my first-grader's day camp, where he'll enjoy activities ranging from creative movement to yoga. For lunch? A pasta bar, a meat option, a vegetarian choice, and, yes, a composed salad.
“Do they have pre-masticated food options?" asked one fellow parent, half-joking.
“This is amazing. I wish I were going to camp," another whispered to me at orientation.
Agreed. Back in 1984, I wandered to a playground near my house and painted a wooden name plate that gave me splinters. The counselor slipped us Popsicles, I think. It wasn't my parents' fault; it was a generational thing.
“I spent my summers home alone with my sister! You can't do that now. We were the last generation to do that — we just came home each night filthy and tired," said Raluca Mandrila-Viazmensky, whose daughter will attend camp at Dexter Southfield in Brookline this summer.
“They have this novelty chess set in their courtyard. I'm totally jealous and living through her," she said with a laugh.
Nice knowing you, Matt Dillon. While camps still provide classic, character-building activities like archery and swimming, many higher-end camps have added bells and whistles to cater to a new generation of families who want more.
Granted, many families could never consider such pricey summer camps, and lots of kids spend their school-free days in no-frill community daycamps or hanging out at home. But in a driven world, kids' needs — and middle-class parents' desires — have shifted.
“Things have evolved tremendously," said Sudbury's Robin Berman, an adviser with The Camp Experts, a company that matches children with overnight camps. “A lot of the changes are similar to the changes we see in schools. Things have become more demanding. Kids are involved in a lot more than they were in the 1980s."
With so many options these days — there are 14,000 day and residential camps nationwide, according to the American Camp Association — finding the right fit can be a process.
(“You know how dogs and owners start to look alike? Camps take on the personality of the people running it. Go with your gut. You'll get a definite feeling," Berman said.)
“We're living in an age of 'VUCA' — volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity," said Moira Kelly, longtime executive director and president of EXPLO, a teacher-led educational summer program based in Norwood for elementary through high schoolers. At EXPLO, kids come from all over the world to, say, learn to think like doctors at a medical simulation center at Brigham and Women's Hospital or create security devices made of Legos.
“Parents are rightfully anxious about their kids' future," she said. “You hear horror stories of college and kids living in their parents' basement, and you want to do well by your child. Sometimes parents push kids into academics, and sometimes too early. Kindergarten now looks like first grade."
To mitigate this, EXPLO employs an approach called “playful learning," Kelly said.
“When kids are playing, they use their imaginations, they take risks, they experiment, and it's collaborative," she said. “It's active and engaging, and when you approach curriculum development this way, you can dive into incredibly sophisticated work and content."
Yes, the roles of camp have changed. Nat Saltonstall has directed Chestnut Hill's Beaver Summer Camp for nearly 20 years, and he's seen the shift first hand.
“Our challenge is striking that balance between maintaining the essence of camp, so powerful for generations and still true today, yet at the same time adjusting to today's needs and expectations," he said.
Some things, he said, will never change: A good camp should provide kids with skills like independence, responsibility, confidence, and relationship-building. But now, for instance, he's in frequent contact with parents over menu items.
“Parents care deeply about what children put in their mouths, and there's clearly an evolution of and increase in allergies," he said.
Camp also has to serve as a refuge for kids who are hyper-driven during the school year, almost playing the role that backyards and neighborhoods fulfilled 20 or 30 years ago.
“Kids need the freedom to take some incremental risks, and I think we can be that place within a larger structure that they might not be able to get at home and in their neighborhood," Saltonstall said. “We can give the freedom to make choices, play, and engage with other kids that maybe is somehow replacing, in a safer way, what you and I grew up with — where we could spend three hours until dusk on our bike with our parents not knowing where we were."
And, as such, camps need to cater to what today's kids enjoy: Beaver offers cooking classes where campers can make fresh pasta; instruction in circus arts; a race track for pedal carts with big balloon tires; and digital video activities using iPads.
Sounds amazing, right? You'd like to skip work for a day or two, yes? Of course, these niceties don't come cheap. Aguirre, for example, estimated that she'll spend about $7,500 on her son's Camp Micah stay. But it's a chance to give him an experience impossible until now, she said.
“My parents were immigrants, and now I'm in a different position," she said. “It's nice to give him something I never had — although this is the only thing we're signing him up for and he'll also get a job." she said.
Plus, these days, summer camp's mission is more essential than ever.
“Kids need a click-down in competition. Parents want their kids to chill out. It's a wonderful thing to just relax and be yourself," The Camp Expert's Berman said.
Even if they're relaxing on 400-thread-count sheets.

Texto completo: Obamacare repeal hurts business
In the national debate about health care, the voices of small-business owners are often eclipsed by partisan rhetoric. As a small-business owner, I'm writing to flag to our politicians that quality affordable health care is essential for entrepreneurs and their communities. The health care plan moving through the Senate threatens Main Street from all sides.
My husband and I own a small business, a green design and building company for average-income clients like our neighbors. We were born and raised here, and we moved back when it was time to take on two major life challenges -- starting a family and starting a business.
Before the Affordable Care Act, private insurance was unaffordable, and I was employed elsewhere in order to keep our young family covered. With the Affordable Care Act, I could focus full time on our business. Since then, our business has quintupled, which is great for our community. We're able to employ more local plumbers, electricians and carpenters, and purchase more local materials such as lumber.
The GOP repeal bill badly hurts business by introducing a lot of uncertainty into our local economy. Under it, 22 million people would go without insurance and Medicaid spending would be cut by $772 billion.
What happens to our community when people get sick without insurance? What happens to the local economy when Maine's Medicaid dollars disappear and the bottom falls out? How many of our average-income clients will feel confident enough in their financial futures to hire us when their premiums jump next year?

New laws won't stop gun violence
In response to Dave Witham's June 26 BDN letter to the editor, I would like to state that the shooter of the Republican members of Congress at the baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia, went through the legal process to purchase the two firearms he used.
It is indeed frustrating to someone who does not know the process of acquiring a firearm legally, but it is indeed hard if not impossible to discern if someone who carries a grudge or is mentally disturbed decides to use violence with these firearms.
New laws will not stop someone with this agenda. Thankfully the Capitol police were there to stop this politically deranged individual.

Lives on the line with Senate health bill
We hear that thousands will die from the health bill that Congress is trying to push for approval, but that message doesn't seem to get through to enough people.
How about a more graphic message. I see millions of people -- myself included -- standing on a high cliff, and we see a hand extended to pull us from the edge to keep us from falling. But when the hand gets close, that hand give us a push and down we go.
Not pleasant, is it?
We need to start screaming now, loud and clear for single-payer health care. That is the only health program that works, and it is a proven one -- just ask our neighbors in Canada or France and England.
And pray!

Implement ranked-choice voting
I strongly hope our Legislature will quickly implement ranked-choice voting for the 2018 elections for U.S. Senate, U.S. House and for state primaries. As a state, we voted for ranked-choice voting last November, and the Maine Supreme Judicial Court found no constitutional issues for using ranked-choice voting for these elections, so it's time for our Legislature to respect the will of the people. As we have affirmed as a state, ranked-choice voting will improve our people's choices in elections, so let us move forward with this process quickly.

The beauty of acceptance and tolerance
Sitting around the dining room table the other morning while visiting with my sister and mom and discussing what we feel is the sad trend in politics and the world of news, we happened across the June 24 BDN article about the LGBT farmers in Morrill. What a beautiful story about acceptance and tolerance, the way life should be.
With the charged atmosphere surrounding politics and equality, where everything seems to be dividing the country and the world, it is nice to know there are still places where love and friendliness still exists. We are all different. Each of us have strengths that should be celebrated, weaknesses to be worked on, and differences of opinion that should be respected and taken into consideration when problems need to be solved. People should not be judged or labeled. Who you are should be based more on the kind of person you are. Do you live by the golden rule, do unto others as you would have them do unto you?
This act of kindness from the town of Morrill should stand as an example for the rest of Maine, New England, our great nation, and the world.

Wealthy profit from Senate health bill
Millions will lose health care coverage and thousands will die if the cruel Republican health care bill is passed.
Who will profit? Investors in insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies will see their profits rise. Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini was compensated with a $27.9 million package in 2016. Other top health insurance CEOs were compensated with $17.3 million in 2015. The top 2 percent of the wealthiest will get tax breaks under the Senate health care bill.
We need Medicare for all, designed to provide health care not for a profit, as nearly all other industrialized countries have done. Thanks to Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King for planning to vote "no" on the Republican health care proposal, which was crafted in secret and rushed to a vote without adequate discussion. We can improve the Affordable Care Act, but there will continue to be problems as long as profit, not health, is the motive for coverage.
How do we pay for Medicare for all? It's time for bold solutions. Let's stop paying for advertising by insurance and drug companies and their lobbyists. Let's stop paying for insurance companies to put patients through hoops before reimbursing health care providers. Let's invest in illness prevention jobs, and jobs to ensure clean air and water. Let's stop spending billions on war and nuclear weapons that should never be used and put the whole world at risk.

Missing Connecticut woman found in northern Maine

Texto completo: A Connecticut woman whose abrupt disappearance and subsequent sighting in Maine confounded her family members has been found.
The Clinton Police Department reported Friday morning that Kimberly Piccolo, 31, has been found, about five days after she suddenly left home in Newtown, Connecticut, seemingly without taking any money, belongings or anxiety medication.
Police did not immediately announce where or under what circumstances Piccolo was located but said in an online update that after stories circulated about her disappearance Thursday, police were able to track her movement away from Clinton, where an officer and rescue personnel last saw her in a market parking lot Sunday night.
Clinton police said that Piccolo used her AAA service in Bangor, and additional sightings were reported in Houlton and then as late as 8 p.m. Thursday in Sherman before authorities announced the woman had been found. A Maine State Police trooper out of Troop F in Houlton identified Piccolo by a tattoo on her wrist, Clinton police said in Friday's announcement.
Piccolo's sister, Allie, posted on social media that Kimberly ran out of gas in Bangor, necessitating the AAA call. Allie Piccolo wrote that the wide number of shares of Kimberly's picture and story on Facebook helped aid in the ultimately successful search.
"We want to thank everyone for all the prayers and shares," Allie Piccolo wrote. "She would not [have] been found without all of your help, and we are forever grateful for all of you."
Clinton police previously reported that one of the department's officers, along with local rescue personnel, responded to a report of an unresponsive female at Tradewind Market on Hinckley Road on Sunday at around 7 p.m. to find a woman later identified as Piccolo in her car there, a nearly six-hour drive away from her hometown of Newtown, Connecticut.
Piccolo allegedly told the officer she fell asleep in her car while waiting to meet up with friends, and "she appeared to be in good condition and she refused medical care," according to an alert posted on the Clinton police Facebook page, and police had no reason to suspect at the time she was a missing person.
The circumstances surrounding Piccolo's disappearance and her sighting in Maine perplexed members of the woman's family, who told reporters earlier this week she has no ties to this state.
The missing woman's aunt, Fran Chappa, told Portland NBC television affiliate WCSH Piccolo didn't appear to take any belongings, anxiety medication or money when she abruptly left home.
Her mother, Barbara Piccolo, told the Morning Sentinel that Kimberly left her home in Connecticut around 7 a.m. Sunday, and had been acting "paranoid" in recent days.
"She was acting like she thinks somebody's watching her," Barbara Piccolo told the newspaper, saying her daughter was frequently checking to make sure doors were locked and window shades were drawn closed. "Even her anxiety in the past was nothing like this past week."

Texto completo: ROCKLAND, Maine -- Woodland creatures have kept a Rockland police officer busy this week, according to a department Facebook post.
Officer Addison Cox saved a skunk that got its head stuck in a discarded peanut butter jar Thursday night, after the animal was discovered wandering around an apartment complex parking lot in Rockland.
[Watch a Lewiston cop help a skunk with its head stuck in a jar without getting sprayed.]
"We can't blame the skunk; peanut butter is awesome," the department said in the post. "If there were a jar of peanut butter big enough that we could get our head in, we probably would, too. But, we have the advantage of possessing hands to remove said jar, while Mr. Skunk does not."
Cox removed the jar and the skunk scampered away toward the woods. Apparently appreciative of the help, the skunk didn't spray.
A week ago, a resident called Rockland police because there was a raccoon in her yard. The caller was concerned after reports of rabid animals over the past month, notably the story of a rabid raccoon attacking a runner.
Addison didn't seen any signs that the raccoon was rabid, and picked the animal up by the scruff of its neck and brought it to the treeline, where the critter scampered into the woods.
The department dubbed Cox "the raccoon whisperer."
Rockland police say that if you see an animal behaving strangely, call 911, and do not attempt to touch or move the animal yourself.

State rep: Suicide fence on Penobscot Narrows Bridge too expensive, ugly

Texto completo: Lawmakers on the state's joint Transportation Committee think a suicide-prevention fence on the Penobscot Narrows Bridge would be too expensive, ineffective and an eyesore, according to Rep. Karl Ward, who said he asked about a fence at the request of a constituent.
The Dedham Republican, who represents the communities on both sides of the bridge, said committee members told him that suicidal people simply "would find another way" if jumping from the Penobscot Narrows Bridge were impossible. He added that he was told protective fencing would cost $500,000 to $1 million.
That cost was the the main reason an emergency bill to install a prevention barrier on the Penobscot Narrows Bridge failed in 2014, he said.
"I was advised that the committee still felt as they did 3 years ago and that I would be unlikely to get any support," Ward said. "I do not have any plans to submit legislation at this point."
In May 2015 the Maine Department of Transportation spent $30,000 to install four solar-powered crisis hotline phones on the Penobscot Narrows Bridge. Two phones are on either side of the bridge.
But those phones have been malfunctioning since the winter -- including on June 23, when authorities began the search for a Sedgwick man in his 60s who is feared to have jumped off the bridge. His car was found before dawn that day -- parked and still running -- at the midpoint of the bridge. A body has not been found, but authorities suspect the Sedgwick man was the eighth suicide at the bridge -- the second one this year.
"We think he jumped off the bridge," said Maine State Police spokesman Stephen McCausland.
New handsets were installed Wednesday, and all four phones were working on Thursday when a Bangor Daily News reporter checked them.
No state or local agency apparently keeps track of how many people have died by suicide from individual bridges, but Greg Marley, clinical director for National Association on Mental Illness of Maine says the span near Fort Knox State Park in Prospect, which is around 135 feet above the Penobscot River, is the most used.
"Over recent years, the [Penobscot Narrows] has been most common," he said.
State Sen. Kim Rosen, a Republican who represents nearby Bucksport, said Monday that "many constituents have asked" for a suicide-prevention barrier on the 2,120-foot span that connects Prospect to Verona Island, where at least seven suicides have occurred since it opened in 2006. She supports adding fencing, saying, "I would love to put in a bill next session."
"My hope is, this will deter them from using the Penobscot Narrows Bridge in the heat of the moment and maybe, just maybe, give them time to think it through," said Rosen, who serves on the Transportation Committee.
Adding suicide prevention barriers does not mean people will just go to the next bridge, according to a 2007 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study of the Memorial Bridge in Augusta, which had been the site of 14 suicides -- six connected directly to the nearby Augusta Mental Health Institute -- before a barrier was added in 1983. There has been none there since Maine DOT installed a fence that curves inward at the top and is nearly impossible to scale. (The Augusta City Council voted to have the fence re-installed in 2006, after it was taken down during bridge renovations.)
The Penobscot Narrows replaced the Waldo-Hancock Bridge, which also was the site of so many suicides that Maine DOT officials considered adding a fence or a separated pedestrian walkway to the new span but in the end decided against it.
Piscataqua River Bridge, which connects Maine to New Hampshire, has also been used numerous times by people to end their lives, according to media reports.
People have also jumped to their deaths from bridges in Bangor. An 18-year-old Holden man who jumped from the Veterans Remembrance Bridge in March was rescued from the icy waters below the bridge that connects Bangor and Brewer.
In March 2014, after the first six suicides from the Penobscot Narrows, former Maine Rep. Joseph Brooks of Winterport proposed an emergency bill to build a fence along the span to deter people from jumping.
The bill drew support from the parents of a 25-year-old Eddington man who committed suicide on the bridge a year earlier. It was also backed by the National Association on Mental Illness.
Brook's emergency bill ultimately failed in committee after lawmakers said they didn't have enough time to review the proposal thoroughly.
Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in Maine, according to the National Association on Mental Illness. Data from the state Department of Health and Human Services indicate that from 2010 to 2015 an average of 266 people took their lives in Maine. During that six-year period, a total of 15 people died by jumping from high places. Three of those died at the Penobscot Narrows.
If you or someone you know is in crisis and contemplating suicide, call the Maine Crisis Hotline at 1-888-568-1112. If you are not in Maine, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255). A trained crisis prevention worker will be available to talk and set you up with services to help. You can also communicate directly with a crisis counselor online at www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org.

Texto completo: Here's your Finding Nemo July Fourth cocktail glass of politics, from Joshua Miller of the Boston Globe at the Massachusetts State House.
CONGRATULATIONS TO BRIAN McNIFF, a State House stalwart and Secretary of State Bill Galvin's spokesman, who is retiring today after 52 years as a reporter and communications professional. Debra O'Malley will be his successor.
CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYONE WHO HAS ALREADY LEFT FOR THE LONG WEEKEND. Boston-area traffic not looking so hot. http://bit.ly/2tsbFyd
CONDOLENCES TO THE DEMOCRATIC-CONTROLLED MASSACHUSETTS LEGISLATURE, which is blowing through deadlines on a marijuana law rewrite bill and the state budget. Will lawmakers be voting this weekend or on Monday? Who knows. Condolences to the voters of the Commonwealth, too, who have been kept in the dark about how their tax dollars will be spent in the fiscal year that begins tomorrow.
ANY WHITE SMOKE FROM POT NEGOTIATORS? Via Colin A. Young and Katie Lannan of the State House News Service: “House and Senate conferees charged with reconciling bills changing the voter-approved marijuana law apparently met briefly Friday morning and are expected to continue swapping proposals throughout the day. ..."

WOMP WOMP FOR MAINE LAWMAKERS, FACING AN EMBARRASSING GOV'T SHUT DOWN, via Kevin Miller of the Portland Press Herald: “State budget negotiators reached a tentative deal late Thursday to eliminate a 3 percent tax surcharge on wealthy Mainers while funneling an additional $162 million to education, setting up crucial votes Friday just hours before a potential state government shutdown at midnight.
And a proposed 1.5 percentage point bump in Maine's lodging tax means the shutdown threat still looms large given Gov. Paul LePage's vow to delay a decision on any budget bill that contains tax increases. ..." http://bit.ly/2s6QSww
ROUGH DAY FOR WGBH, which does amazing, powerful journalism every day, but came out not looking too good in a front page Boston Herald story today by Joe Battenfeld: “Boston public broadcasting behemoth WGBH, facing potentially severe budget cuts by the Trump administration, awarded big pay hikes and bonuses to executives and staffers last year while reporting a $38 million loss, new reports show.
The taxpayer-funded nonprofit's CEO, Jonathan Abbott, got an $85,000 bonus in the 2016 fiscal year, boosting his annual compensation to $624,930, according to tax reports filed with the state attorney general's office. WGBH gave out a total of nearly $300,000 in bonuses to 10 employees, including Abbott, according to their financial reports.
New on-air host Jim Braude earned nearly $364,000 in the 2016 fiscal year, reports show, while seven other high-ranking staffers and executives also topped the $300,000-a-year mark. ..." http://bit.ly/2t8CC7H

Sun powers 20 bowling lanes, video games in Portland

Texto completo: PORTLAND, Maine -- The first thing that catches your eye from the roof of Portland's largest bowling alley is the taco-spewing Airstream trailer. This bit of retro chic is compelling, but even more significant is the vast solar array blanketing the hottest place to hang out in Portland this summer.
"People are blown away. When you walk out, all you see is solar. You are walking in solar," said Justin Alfond, co-owner of the Bayside Bowl, which recently underwent a multimillion-dollar expansion in Portland's burgeoning Bayside neighborhood.
While setting the bar high for bowling -- the emporium has 20 lanes and four bars -- the roof above the expansion created an opportunity for the enlightened owners to reduce their carbon footprint, save on electricity and funnel power back to the grid.
"The reduction in our energy bill is about $400 per month," said Alfond, who along with partner Charlie Mitchell made an investment in solar because "it's good business and good for the planet."
Pin setters below are powered by the sun, as are LED lights and arcade games. Generating enough power to cover 35 percent of Bayside Bowl's energy needs, it is the second largest solar system in Portland. (The first is the Fore Street garage, which powers the Hyatt Place Portland Old Port hotel.)
Though most people sipping beers on the rooftop are talking about the panoramic views of Portland, not renewable resources, "this is changing hearts and minds," Alfond, a former state senator from Portland, said. "The more you are around it, you ask more questions."
By mounting 422 solar panels steps from the alfresco bar, taco truck and fire pit, the entertainment emporium is a visible sign of what is possible.
"It's great for business, the environment and great for our future. Great talking point," Alfond said. "It was awesome putting this together. There were a lot of moving parts."
Despite Maine's abundant sunny days, the state lags in solar innovation and job growth. Roadblocks from the government keep getting in the way, according to Alfond, who is contemplating running for governor when Gov. Paul LePage terms out.
"It's the right thing to do financially. It's the right thing to do, period," Alfond said, adding that the state doesn't make it easy to go green.
Lawmakers approved a solar policy compromise Wednesday that modifies a recent rule change proposed by the Maine Public Utilities Commission.
The rule was criticized for being unfair, cumbersome and expensive to implement, according to Josh Baston, a project manager at ReVision Energy, who helped install the Bayside Bowl's system, because it would have allowed the utility to charge customers for solar energy that they consumed in real time, something solar supporters have called an "anti-solar tax."
"The legislation isn't perfect, but it does roll back the very worst parts of the PUC rule and gives solar customers and companies some level of predictability and certainty to make investments, which is a good thing," Baston said.
Those in the solar industry in Maine, like Baston, say systems like the Bayside Bowl's go a long way spreading the gospel of solar.
"You see it and it becomes more commonplace, not a fringe idea that doesn't exist," Baston said, adding that the cost of solar equipment has gone down dramatically in the past five years.
"It's a wonderful asset we have, called the sun," Alfond said. "Let's use it."

Maine's new food sovereignty law puts local control over local foods

Texto completo: There was a time when all food exchange in Maine took place at the local, neighbor-to-neighbor level, free of regulations and government licensing.
But over the years that changed with the advent of food safety laws and inspections.
Proponents of food sovereignty in Maine hope a new law, based on exchanging locally produced and grown food, will bring back some of that community-based commerce.
On June 16 Gov. Paul LePage signed LD 725, An Act to Recognize Local Control Regarding Food Systems, June 16, legitimizing the authority of towns and communities to enact ordinances regulating local food distribution free from state regulatory control.
"This is huge," said Heather Retberg, who has helped craft ordinance language. "Historically this is how many people have always exchanged food, especially in rural areas."
Under the new law, any town or municipality in Maine may now adopt an ordinance allowing food producers to sell their products directly to consumers free from state regulations or licenses.
"This law and the ordinance are not intended to create a retail market that simply circumvents the rules of food safety," Richard Loring King, Maine food sovereignty advocate, said. "It's to rejuvenate traditional local foodways where communities provided for themselves in an atmosphere of trust, not unlike having friends over to share a meal."
For a great many of Maine's rural small farmers and poultry producers who operate out of roadside stand or directly from their farms, the new law does not change how they do business, as they are already free from state inspections.
The real changes involve those who sell meat or dairy products, Retberg said, which are highly regulated by the state.
"These are the frontline foods in the food sovereignty movement," she said. "Since the law was passed, these are the farmers we are hearing from."
Under Maine food safety laws, anyone who wants to raise and sell meat -- such as beef, lambs, pork or goats -- must have the animals butchered and processed in a state-certified facility.
For many livestock growers in Maine, Retberg said, this means driving the animals long distances to slaughter.
In the case of dairy products -- milk, cheese or yogurts, for example -- producers must invest large amounts of money to build their own state-approved facility or spend money contracting production out.
Now, thanks to LD 725, if a town or municipality creates and adopts an ordinance, those meat and dairy producers are free to process their food on site -- as long as it is for direct sale to customers.
More importantly, the state can't penalize the producers for doing so.
At least for now.
"The department is in consultation with state and federal officials to determine the broad legal implications resulting from the bill's passage," John Bott, spokesman for the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, said. "And how the new law will be implemented going forward."
Jordan Pike, a first generation farmer starting his 10th season at his Two Toads Farm in Lebanon, said the new law will allow small, family farms to flourish in Maine.
"Our communities need farmers now more than ever," Pike said. "We are growers that depend on healthy soil, healthy animals and healthy plants to make healthy food that we eat ourselves."
Without a food sovereignty ordinance, Pike said, if a farmstead ends a season with surplus meats or dairy they are unable to sell, those products are processed by a licensed dairy or butchering facility. Whether contracting that out to existing facilities or building their own, this can be cost-prohibitive to small farms.
With an ordinance, he said, these same farmers would potentially be able to sell directly to their customers food they process on site, free of licensing and site regulations.
The freedom to sell those extras not only puts healthy food into the local food distribution chain, it provides some additional income without additional expense for the farmers.
"Providing this service to community members and neighbors can mean the difference between keeping the cow -- even keeping the farm" or having to sell out," Pike said. "It means being able to pay the vet bill for an animal instead of putting it down, or pay the roofer to fix the leak in the barn, or the painter and keep our property values up."
Retberg pointed to a family in her area who raises goats for meat and creates smoked goat sausage for their own consumption.
"Right now, if I go to their house for dinner and try that sausage, I wouldn't be able to buy any from them," she said. "If an ordinance is passed in their town, they can sell directly to me or any customer."
Likewise, crafters of local ordinances are free to include locally produced foods like jams, jellies or baked goods, thus freeing those producers from the expense and time associated with setting up regulated, state-inspected kitchen facilities.
Retberg and other supporters of food sovereignty understand people are wary of local foods that may be unsafe if unregulated.
"A big part of the food safety is food exchanged between the food grower and consumer is at its lowest risk of pathogens [because] the more times food exchanges hands between producers and consumer, the more risk there is for problems due to temperature changes and exposure to bacterias," Retberg said. "The law and ordinances are about relationships and trust [and] customers saying to the producers I am comfortable trusting you."
To take advantage of the new law, towns must adopt the ordinance.
A template for anyone wishing to propose an ordinance at it is available for download at localfoodrules.org.
So far, 20 Maine towns have adopted the ordinance and Retberg said she is fielding calls from many more interested in starting the process.
"I am starting to hear from so many places," she said. "I feel incredibly heartened for those of us who have been out there in front with machetes clearing the way that now we know there are really people who were behind us that needed this law to happen."

History or junk? Plan to remove old pilings roils Maine beach community

Texto completo: Homeowners of cottages along Popham Beach responded frantically this week after learning that federal and state regulators granted preliminary approval to remove about 150 wood pilings set deep in the sand at the northern end of the beach.
Opponents of removal plan say that the pilings are a key component of Popham's history and that removing them could disturb critical fish habitats.
But Susan and Jack Parker of Woolwich -- the latter of whom is the CEO of Reed & Reed Construction -- have cleared nearly all the hurdles to remove the pilings of the pier used by the Eastern Steamship Company, a major early 20th century shipping firm.
Jack Parker said in his application, and at a public meeting last November, that he wants to remove the pilings because they are a navigation hazard and create "eddying," which causes the ocean to "scour" a small inlet near the pilings.
But town committees, neighbors and others in Popham, which nestles beside a state park barrier beach at the tip of the Phippsburg peninsula, say the pilings may play a role in reducing the erosion Parker seeks to stop.
Parker did not return a phone call or email seeking comment this week.
OK with regulators
In November, the Parkers received a general permit from the Army Corps of Engineers to remove the "deteriorated pilings from a dilapidated, abandoned dock."
Last week, Phippsburg Town Administrator Amber Jones received a letter from Christine Woodruff, project manager for the Maine Department of Environmental Protection granting preliminary approval for the project. According to that draft order, the pilings are located below mean low water and are thus submerged land and owned by the state of Maine, which does not object to their removal.
Woodruff was out of the office this week, but Mark Bergeron of the DEP's Bureau of Land Resources said that only new evidence could change the department's decision now.
Parker proposes to extract or break off, then remove the pilings with a "vibratory extractor" and clamshell bucket handled by a barge-mounted crane over the course of about a week. They'll then be moved for sale or disposal, according to a report by Ransom Consulting.
According to the Ransom report, "the shoreline at the site is relatively stable compared to beaches to the south" and the removal of the pilings will likely cause the concave section of the beach to fill in and "accelerate the straightening of the beach."
'Never been a hazard'
Victoria and Rafael Villamil, whose house on Popham abuts the Parkers' property, say their house is more affected by the pilings than the Parkers, and they aren't interested in having the beach straightened.
They believe the pilings have likely prevented erosion in front of their house like that experienced on other parts of Popham.
Victoria Vilamill was born and grew up at Gilbert Head across from Popham Beach, and inherited her Popham home about 25 years ago, she said.
"When we sit in our living room, I do not look forward to seeing Mr. Parker's boat or boats as part of my scenic view," she said Tuesday from her year-round home in Philadelphia. "According to the NOAA charts, those pilings have never been a hazard to navigation in 120 years of existence. There's been not one recorded accident. All this goes to show that the removal of these pilings is a 'favor' to Mr. Parker so he can more easily maneuver the anchoring of his boats in front of his property."
The Vilamils aren't the only residents furious about the pilings: More than two dozen signed a petition to save the pilings, and last fall the Phippsburg Harbor Commission and the Phippsburg Conservation Commission opposed the project.
In an undated letter to Woodruff, the Phippsburg Conservation Commission wrote of the pilings that marked an old coal loading wharf for the nearby forts, and served as a stop for steamers in the 19th century.
"The pilings will not be here forever and they may be eyesores for a few, but, while they are here, they remind us of how our predecessors lived, worked and recreated," they wrote. "Let them fade away, gently. Many townspeople feel they are our history's treasure."
"The idea that anyone feels that they unilaterally have the right to petition the removal of an historical landmark is almost unbelievable," Anne Dale, who grew up in Bath and spent summers at Popham, wrote to Woodruff.
Dale continued, "The bigger question here is that someone cannot simply decide for themselves that, after purchasing a property, they want their view changed or water flow altered by stepping over their property line into the ocean and waving a magic wand. The wand was not included in the deed and they did not purchase the pilings. Frankly, if they didn't like the slim beach there or the view, they should not have bought the house. That's our view, our heritage, our beach, our pilings, period."
'A more natural state'
While acknowledging that the pilings "evoke a sense of nostalgia," and are part of the Popham "experience," the DEP permit states that the pilings are not the primary draw to the area, and that removing them "will return the area to a more natural state."
At a Nov. 12, 2016, meeting of the Board of Selectmen, Jack Parker said he wanted to remove the pilings "to protect the beach from erosion with rising sea levels," according to meeting minutes. "He claimed he had no ulterior motive, as had been rumored, for building a dock or adding a mooring and offered to answer any questions."
But as Victoria Villamil pointed out in an email to Woodruff -- which she sent with a copy of the building permit -- when Parker applied in 2012 to build his house, he was required to prove that a two-foot rise in the sea level would not damage the house.
"Much to our surprise, we see that they had successfully proven exactly that," she wrote, adding later, "Their house is safe and they know it. Ours may not be, because of the uncertainty that accompanies the removing of the pilings."
After an Oct. 7, 2016, site visit, the Army Corps of Engineers reported it found no signs to indicate why the pilings were historic and the Maine Historic Preservation Commission determined the pilings are not eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places due to a loss of integrity.
Endangering fish?
Because the ACOE issued a "general permit," the project falls under previously agreed upon minimal impacts with the federal, state and local resource agencies," no additional review by the National Marine Fisheries Service is required to determine if the project's impact on essential fish habitat or endangered species, according to Tim Dugan of the ACOE.
But Dugan said one condition of the permit is that work take place between Nov. 8 and April 9 in order to avoid impacts to endangered species.
According to the permit, the Maine Department of Marine Resources stated that "the project as proposed will have minimal impacts to marine resources or habitat and that no impact on traditional fishing or riparian access is expected."
But state geologist Stephen Dixon wrote in the permit that he is "unable to conclude with certainty" that removing the pilings will not threaten the dunes or the homes on the dunes."
With permits in hand, Parker appears ready to move the pilings this fall, which Victoria Villamil said is "causing an entire community real grief."

Texto completo: It doesn't matter if you like them hard-boiled, scrambled or soaked in heart-clogging hollandaise sauce: When eggs are this cheap, it's a good time to get cracking.
Supplies in the U.S. have surged so much in recent months that prices are the lowest for this time of year in at least a decade. It will probably take awhile for consumers to eat through the surplus inventory, so the government is predicting egg costs will drop more than any other food group in 2017.
The slump marks a sharp turnaround in the egg business. In 2015, an avian influenza outbreak forced farmers to destroy millions of birds and prices skyrocketed. Eager to take advantage of the rally, producers expanded flocks that were the biggest ever by the end of last year. But demand hasn't keep pace. While some farms have scaled back in recent months, hens have gotten more productive, keeping the market flush with supply.
"The market was temporarily starved for eggs, and now it's drowning," said Tom Elam, president of Carmel, Indiana-based consulting firm FarmEcon LLC. "There's just too many eggs out there."
Retailers were charging $1.414 on average for a dozen eggs in May, the lowest for the month since 2006, Bureau of Labor Statistics data show. Prices have plummeted 52 percent from a record $2.966 reached in September 2015. Costs are on track to fall by as much as 6 percent this year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture forecasts. The decline comes even with overall food inflation projected at as much as 2 percent.
Total egg supplies in the U.S. will climb 1.3 percent in 2017 to 8.829 billion dozen, the government said in a June 9 report. That's the highest in data going back to 1992. Output is projected to rise again next year, with total supplies forecast at 8.957 billion dozen, the USDA estimates. The vast majority of supply is domestically produced.
The glut has been a drag on Cal-Maine Foods Inc., the nation's largest egg company. Shares have slumped 12 percent in 2017, the worst start to a year since 2009. Adam Samuelson, an analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., downgraded the recommendation on the stock to sell from neutral on June 16.
"Historically, the egg industry has experienced many boom and bust cycles with periods of overproduction disrupting the supply-demand balance," Cal-Maine Chief Executive Officer Adolphus Baker said during a presentation earlier this month.
The current slump may not last, Baker suggested. "High prices cure high prices" by encouraging more supply, "but low prices also cure low prices" by forcing producers to cut back, he said.
In response to the market rout, production has been cut at Mentone, Indiana-based Midwest Poultry Services LP, a family owned company with 10 million laying hens on five farms that normally produce about 160 million dozen eggs annually.

Texto completo: Despite repeated pleas to lay off Twitter, President Donald Trump has only grown more forceful over five months in office, spraying critics with 140-character bursts of venom and revenge.
Most days, the reaction amounts to a collective head-shaking.
But Thursday, there was bipartisan alarm that he crossed a line with an attack on MSNBC hosts Joe Scarborough, a former Florida congressman, and Mika Brzezinski, who in recent days mocked Trump's fake Time magazine cover.
"I heard poorly rated @Morning_Joe speaks badly of me (don't watch anymore)," Trump tweeted shortly after the show ended. "Then how come low I.Q. Crazy Mika, along with Psycho Joe, came ... to Mar-a-Lago 3 nights in a row around New Year's Eve, and insisted on joining me. She was bleeding badly from a face-lift. I said no!"
The comments were denounced by House Speaker Paul Ryan and other prominent Republicans for being below the dignity of the office. Some viewed it as sexist, recalling Trump's history of vulgar comments about women.
On a larger scale, it was a reminder that the president's Twitter finger has often stepped on his own agenda, with Thursday's salvos coming as GOP Senate leaders scrambled to build support for an Obamacare replacement and as Trump sought to highlight energy policy.
"Inappropriate. Undignified. Unpresidential," former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush wrote on Twitter.
"This is not okay," said Republican Rep. Lynn Jenkins of Kansas. "As a female in politics, I am often criticized for my looks. We should be working to empower women."
Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, whose support for the health care bill is already in jeopardy, tweeted: "This has to stop - we all have a job - 3 branches of gov't and media. We don't have to get along, but we must show respect and civility."
The White House was unapologetic. "When the president gets hit, he's going to hit back harder," spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said during the daily briefing. She accused Scarborough and Brzezinski of leveling constant attacks on Trump, including questioning his mental fitness.
The electorate "knew what they were getting when they voted for Donald Trump," she said. Effectively, deal with it.
Indeed, Trump's outspokenness appealed to many voters. But increasingly, his use of Twitter has drawn a negative reaction.
A Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday showed that 61 percent of American voters say he should stop tweeting from his personal account, @realdonald trump, which has 32.9 million followers. In another poll published by NPR on Wednesday, 69 percent of Americans said Trump's use of Twitter is "reckless and distracting."
Every day brings anticipation of what Trump may tweet, his words providing amusement, shock and feeding news cycles. But Thursday's reached a higher level. "Donald J. Trump: Cyberbully-In-Chief," said Rep. Lois Frankel, D-West Palm Beach.
Republicans worry that Trump is undermining their ability to get things done. "It's maddeningly frustrating," Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said in a CNN interview.
"@POTUS, do you want to be remembered for your tweets or your accomplishments?" Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, asked on Twitter. "Stop it! The Presidential platform should be used for more than bringing people down."
What apparently set Trump off was a Morning Joe discussion about a story that Trump's properties, including Mar-a-Lago, feature a made-up Time magazine cover from 2009 declaring his reality show The Apprentice "a television smash."
"Nothing makes a man feel better than making a fake cover of a magazine of himself, lying every day and destroying the country," Brzezinski said. She also made a snide remark about the size of Trump's hands.
Trump has largely blamed his White House struggles on the news media, arguing he hasn't been given a fair chance. He has repeatedly lashed out at major news outlets as purveyors of "fake news." CNN, a frequent target, gave Trump ammunition Friday when it retracted a story about an ally of the president.
So it was not unusual to see Trump go after MSNBC. What was different and why so many lawmakers spoke out was the deeply personal nature of his attack on Brzezinski.
"It's despicable," said former U.S. Rep. David Jolly of Pinellas County, a Republican and vocal Trump critic. "This is the same man who spoke offensively on the Access Hollywood tapes."
He fears longer-term damage to the party image.
"Most of what this president does is beneath the dignity of the office, but we knew that. And those who voted for him knew that. ... Our party owns this right now and we're responsible for extricating ourselves from it or it's going to brand us for a very long time. We're a long way from the likes of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush."

Maine, Connecticut Among States Likely to Soon Feel Pain Without Budget Deals; New Jersey, Maine could face shutdowns tonight; tough cuts for Connecticut

Texto completo: Lawmakers in two New England states on Friday edged closer to blowing through midnight deadlines without new budgets in place, setting the table for Maine's first government shutdown in 26 years and painful spending cuts in Connecticut.
Those states are among 46 that start a new fiscal year on Saturday, and nearly a dozen where budget negotiations have come down to the wire. While some states routinely wait until the 11th hour or later, and have measures in place to fund government until accords are reached, the consequences are much more stark in many other states.
"Fiscal difficulties and political difficulties go hand-in-hand," said John Hicks, executive director at the National Association of State Budget Officers. "It creates more hard choices, and therefore there's just a natural tension."
In Maine, Republican Gov. Paul LePage said Friday he doesn't like the budget compromise that legislative leaders released late Thursday. He urged House Republicans to vote it down Friday, and said he won't sign the measure if it reaches his desk. He can wait 10 days to take action on a bill. The state, which bills itself as 'Vacationland,' will shut down parts of its government at midnight without a finished budget.
"I think this is a bad budget for Maine," the governor said at a news conference Friday. He said he wouldn't veto it, but also said "I'm not putting my name on this budget."
By law, the governor has 10 days to sign, veto or let a budget go into law without his signature, a spokesman for the governor said. So even if the legislature strikes a deal, it may not go into effect for another 10 days.
Unlike this year, the legislature typically sends the governor a budget early enough so that he can take those 10 days before the fiscal year ends, the spokesman said.
To the south in the Nutmeg State, Gov. Dannel Malloy, a Democrat, signed an executive order Friday to keep the state government running after the Legislature failed to approve a budget plan to close a two-year deficit of $5.1 billion.
Mr. Malloy's executive order will trigger deep spending cuts for the state and would amount to a $2.1 billion reduction for the entire fiscal year. The plan would slash education funding, eliminate summer youth-employment programs and cut rental-assistance programs. It will go into effect at midnight.
"This is a regrettable path and one I worked very hard to avoid," Mr. Malloy said Friday. "Nevertheless, I want to assure the public that my administration will manage our finances in a thoughtful and responsible way."
Mr. Malloy had asked the Legislature to pass a 90-day "mini-budget" to keep the government running as his administration continued to negotiate with the Democratic-controlled state Legislature. But Democratic Speaker of the House Joe Aresimowicz refused, instead proposing a vote on a full two-year budget on July 18 while also raising the sales tax from 6.35% to 6.99%.
The New England states are among a handful pushing budget talks up to the very end of the fiscal year. Other states locked in debate include Illinois, which hasn't had a budget in two years and has faced a risk of a ratings downgrade to junk status. Officials there took a promising step forward to resolve the standoff on Friday, with the House of Representatives voting to support a Democratic spending plan largely viewed as a compromise measure.
New Jersey is also pushing the limit, and Republican Gov. Chris Christie has told his cabinet to prepare for a possible shutdown. If that happens, only essential state employees would report to work, the governor said. State beaches and parks would close, including Liberty State Park, which overlooks New York City and is scheduled to host more than 100,000 people for its annual Fourth of July celebration and fireworks display on Tuesday.
Lawmakers in Washington state, meantime, are expected to pass their two-year budget on Friday, heading off a partial shutdown. Lawmakers there have been battling over how to meet educating-funding levels mandated by the state Supreme Court.
Washington state lawmakers released the details of their last-minute $43.7 billion budget deal Friday.
"As I have said, a split Legislature means compromises are necessary and neither side will get everything it wants," said Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat.
Maine's debate has centered around what to do with a 3% additional tax on annual household income topping $200,000, which voters called for in a November referendum to raise education funding. Republicans including the governor have fought to repeal the tax, and a deal brokered late Thursday by the Democratic House speaker and Republican Senate president would do that.
Their deal would also add $162 million in education funding over the two-year budget period, about half of what tax proponents hoped to raise.
"In a divided government, compromise is the only option," Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon said Thursday. "We did our job in the face of tremendous pressure. I urge my colleagues to support this proposal and urge the governor to take action immediately."
But the deal's overall budget number of $7.1 billion is higher than House Republicans or Mr. LePage wanted, and the budget also includes a lodging-tax increase without a steeper income-tax cut Mr. LePage had included.
Lawmakers will have to pass the budget by a two-thirds majority Friday to even get a bill to Mr. LePage.
"There will not be a signature on a budget that increases taxes," Mr. LePage said Friday. "There is plenty of money, they do not have to increase taxes."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON * Senate Republican leaders considered keeping one of former President Barack Obama's big tax increases on wealthier Americans and using the money to fatten proposed subsidies for the poor in a bid Thursday to placate moderate GOP lawmakers and salvage their struggling health care bill.
With a core priority tottering, top Republicans also assessed an amendment pushed by conservatives to let insurers offer plans with low premiums and scant benefits. To do so, a company would also have to sell a policy that abides by the consumer-friendly coverage requirements in Obama's 2010 statute, which the GOP is struggling to repeal.
Both proposals were encountering internal Republican opposition, and it was uncertain either would survive. But the effort underscored how Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., needed to mollify both wings of his divided party if he's to rescue one of his and President Donald Trump's foremost campaign promises.
McConnell postponed a vote on an initial version Tuesday, forced by conservative and moderate GOP senators prepared to block it.
By Friday, McConnell wants to add changes to the bill that would assure its passage after Congress' week-long July 4 recess. For him to prevail, no more than two of the 52 GOP senators can oppose the measure.
But as senators charged out the Capitol's doors Thursday to begin their break, there were no overt indications that GOP leaders had resolved their problems.
"We're kind of at a stalemate right now, I'd say," said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., who with Ohio GOP Sen. Robert Portman and others want to forestall reductions the measure would make in Medicaid. Discussions about easing those cuts were continuing, but progress so far was "not enough for me," said Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev.
The Medicaid program for low-income and disabled people has grown dramatically in their states and others, but the Republican bill would cut it, with reductions growing over time.
Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said that while GOP leaders might have a package in hand Friday, "I'm not confident that's going to, kind of, solve everybody's concerns."
Vice President Mike Pence met in the Capitol on Thursday with Capito, Heller and other GOP dissidents, including Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Texas' Ted Cruz.
The Senate bill would repeal most of the tax boosts Obama levied, around $700 billion over the coming decade. They were aimed largely at high earners and the medical industry and helped finance his expansion of coverage to about 20 million people.
Under a proposal by Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., the bill would retain Obama's 3.8 percent tax increase on investments by higher earners. Keeping that increase would save $172 billion over 10 years, and moderates want to use it to make the health care subsidies their bill would provide more generous.
Democrats say the GOP bill is mostly a tax cut for the rich. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the Senate measure would raise out-of-pocket health care costs for many low earners while producing 22 million more uninsured people by 2026.
Corker said he was "very confident" that leaders would address the issue in the updated bill. He said cutting upper-income taxes and increasing health care costs for the poor "is not an equation that works."
"Obviously we'd like to get rid of all" of Obama's tax boosts, said No. 3 Senate GOP leader John Thune of South Dakota. "But if it takes something like that to get our members on board to move this process forward, I think we have to consider that."
Conservatives said they opposed the idea, along with the chairmen of Congress' two tax-writing committees: Senate Finance chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and House Ways and Means chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas.
Obama's health law enacted an additional 3.8 percent tax on investment income for married couples making more than $250,000 a year and individuals making more than $125,000.
Also in play was the proposal by Cruz to let insurers offer skimpier policies, which conservatives say would lower premiums.
Moderates oppose that, especially if it lets insurers raise premiums on people with pre-existing medical problems. No. 2 GOP leader John Cornyn of Texas suggested the proposal might not survive because Senate rules won't allow it on the bill.
The leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus suggested the Senate bill would be doomed if it excluded something like Cruz's plan or House-approved provisions letting insurers charge higher prices to people with serious diseases. Many expect the House to try for quick passage of any health care bill the Senate approves, foregoing potential problems of negotiating a bicameral compromise.
"Is failure an option? Absolutely not," said Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C. "Is failure on the doorstep knocking? Absolutely. So we've got to make sure we don't answer that door."
Republicans also said party leaders agreed to add $45 billion for battling opioids abuse to their bill. They were also considering a proposal by conservatives to let people use tax-advantaged health savings accounts to pay health care premiums.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON--Conservative Republicans on Friday revived a proposal to speedily repeal the Affordable Care Act and come up with a replacement later, a surprise move reflecting the fractured state of the Senate GOP and the frustration felt by some conservatives about the pace of the Republican health-care push.
The move, backed by President Donald Trump in a tweet, renewed an idea that earlier had been seen as politically and practically unworkable, and Republicans on Capitol Hill said the idea was unlikely to get enough support this time as well. But it had the potential to excite the Republican base as Congress heads into its July 4th recess.
Sen. Ben Sasse (R., Neb.) kicked off the push, saying that he believed congressional leaders' prospects of simultaneously overturning former President Barack Obama's 2010 Affordable Care Act and enacting a replacement were dimming. He said that the party's best hope could be to wipe out the law in its entirety, then work on filling the void over time.
"On the current path, it looks like Republicans will...fail to pass any meaningful bill at all," Mr. Sasse said in a letter to the White House. "We must keep our word."
He suggested that if Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) couldn't assemble a bill with broad GOP support by the time senators return from their recess on July 10, the Senate should vote on the same ACA repeal bill Congress passed in 2015, which was vetoed by Mr. Obama.
Within minutes of the suggestion, which Mr. Sasse also discussed on "Fox & Friends," Mr. Trump signaled support. "If Republican Senators are unable to pass what they are working on now, they should immediately REPEAL, and then REPLACE at a later date!" he tweeted.
Democratic lawmakers, who are united in support of the ACA, warned of the consequences of a repeal-first approach on Friday. Sen. Patty Murray (D., Wash.) said that Mr. Trump shouldn't urge Republicans "to pull coverage and protections away from tens of millions of families and increase costs for tens of millions more without any plan for a replacement."
Mr. Sasse's move and Mr. Trump's response were notable in part because they pointedly circumvented Mr. McConnell, who has been laboring to produce a bill that would satisfy his party's conservative and centrist factions and win the support of at least 50 Senate Republicans.
Mr. McConnell's office had no comment on the proposal on Friday.
Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of consumers around the country are getting letters from insurers warning that their health plans bought under the ACA would be terminated at the end of the year.
Republicans say the letters show the need for their legislation, while Democrats say insurers are reacting to uncertainty about the future of the health law that has been created by the GOP push.
Mr. Sasse's proposal focused attention on July 10, when senators will return after a week in their home states hearing from their constituents. GOP leaders hope to use the recess to cement a deal that they can quickly bring to the Senate floor, but given the bill's unpopularity in polls and the GOP's divisions, that is by no means assured.
With no support from Democrats, Senate Republicans can afford to lose no more than two votes and still pass their legislation, counting on Vice President Mike Pence to break a 50-50 tie if necessary. The House has passed its own version of the bill.
The repeal-first approach reopens an old skirmish between Republican centrists and conservatives, whose disagreements over everything from the scope and timeline of an ACA repeal to the future of Medicaid and the nature of health insurance have hamstrung the party.
Earlier this year, some Republicans advocated repealing the ACA with an expiration date a year or two in the future. That, they hoped, would pressure Democrats and Republicans to come together and craft a workable replacement that would kick in before the ACA expired.
But others inside and outside the GOP warned that repealing the ACA without a replacement in hand would create enormous uncertainty, roiling the insurance markets, panicking consumers and making life difficult for businesses. That prompted GOP leaders instead to pursue a single repeal-and-replace bill, and at the time Mr. Trump voiced support for that approach.
Some lawmakers said Friday that going back to the repeal-first approach would be a mistake. "That doesn't achieve what President Trump set out to do, which is to not only repeal the damaging effects of that law, [but] help people who are trapped in it right now," said Rep. Kevin Brady (R., Texas), chairman of the House Ways and Means panel, which oversees health care.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president's tweet didn't mean he had changed his thinking "at all."
"We're still focused on trying to push through where we are," Ms. Sanders said. "The bottom line is we're focused on the end product here, and that is repealing and replacing Obamacare with health care that works for every American."
During the previous debate over the repeal-first proposal, centrists said their primary concern was to avoid the possibility of a gap in coverage or additional upheaval in already-fragile individual insurance markets. Five Republican senators formally announced their objection in January to repeal legislation separate from a replacement.
"Sen. Collins would not support this strategy," Annie Clark, spokeswoman for Susan Collins (R., Maine), one of the five, said on Friday.
But Rand Paul of Kentucky, another senator whose support could make or break the legislation's prospects, endorsed Mr. Sasse's suggestion.
"I have spoken to @realDonaldTrump & Senate leadership about this and agree. Let's keep our word to repeal then work on replacing right away," he said on Twitter.
One challenge for Republicans is that party leaders have spent seven years since the ACA's passage calling it a catastrophe and promising to uproot it at the first opportunity. Conservative groups repeatedly cite the Senate's 2015 repeal vote, when 49 of the current GOP senators voted for outright repeal.
"All of us believe the best solution all along is for the Republicans to do not only what they said, but what they passed when Obama was still in office," said Jim DeMint, former president of the conservative Heritage Foundation.
Under Mr. Sasse's proposal, the ACA would remain in place for a year, giving lawmakers a fixed time to hammer out a replacement. But Mr. Sasse also said the Senate should stay in town in August, working six days a week to pass replacement legislation by Labor Day.
Mr. Sasse had kept his position on health care relatively quiet, so his move Friday was a surprise. It makes clear the extent of the challenge facing Mr. McConnell, who already saw an unusual rebuke to his authority earlier this week when senators threatened to block a procedural motion to begin debating the health-care bill.
Andy Roth, vice president of government affairs at the conservative Club for Growth, supported the Sasse approach, saying Republican centrists use the term "replacement" to disguise their support for maintaining parts of the ACA.
"Moderate Republicans are very supportive of keeping in place large parts of Obamacare," he said. "If Republican moderates want to oppose full repeal, then they need to answer to the voters."

Back home, Mainers are urging Susan Collins to stay strong

Texto completo: CAMDEN, Maine — As she sat at the right hand of President Trump at the White House this week, US Senator Susan Collins's prominent position on a white-hot national stage could hardly have been more conspicuous.
And to hundreds of Mainers who want New England's only Senate Republican to more forcefully wield her blend of quirky independence as a bipartisan beacon, the seating chart in the executive mansion could not have been more hopeful.
“Trump has just crossed a line," said Richard Anderson, 76, a Republican and former Boston textbook developer. “Not only is he not reasoned and rational, it verges on whether he's sane or not. You wonder what's in his head."
Jim Nelson, a registered independent who with Anderson is leading a new effort to encourage Collins to more fully embrace Maine's political legacy for principled bipartisanship, sits across his living room table from Anderson and slowly nods his head.
“This is throwing 22 million people out of health care at a time when we have serious income inequality," said Nelson, 75, a retired chief executive and corporate consultant who once taught business courses at Babson College in Wellesley. “In a bipartisan environment, we wouldn't even be talking about a bill like this."
But now, of course, it's all anyone is talking about.
The Senate's Republican leadership, reading ominous political tea leaves, has put off a vote until after the July Fourth holiday, fiercely trying to cobble together support for the measure in the face of rebellion.
The bipartisan group led by Anderson and Nelson began this week taking out newspaper ads in Maine publications, starting with a full page ad in Tuesday's Bangor Daily News. When they asked for supporters via e-mail, more than 350 raised their hands. And opened their checkbooks.
“We didn't even break a sweat getting these names," Nelson said. “If we had really put on a full-court press, I think even in a small state like this we could have gotten 10,000 names."
Collins, they said, has yet to respond to their request for a face-to-face meeting. But the woman from Caribou, whose mother and father both served as mayor there, is embracing — as she frequently has — the central tenets of the open-letter campaign, which underlines positions of integrity that helped define her political forebears.
“History will record where each member of Congress stood in this time of testing," read the ad, which also appeared in the Portland Press Herald on Wednesday. “Senators Margaret Chase Smith in the era of McCarthyism and Bill Cohen in the Watergate era set a standard of principled leadership creating a legacy for Maine's senators. Please affirm the heritage and trust that citizens of Maine have bestowed upon you."
Collins, reacting to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, has said she would vote against advancing the Senate's version of the health care bill. She said she wants to work with Democrats to overhaul the bill, not just tinker with it.
And she sent out a tweet that signatories to this week's open letter could easily have penned themselves.
“I want to work w/ my GOP & Dem colleagues to fix the flaws in the ACA (Affordable Care Act)," she wrote. “CBO analysis shows Senate bill won't do it. I will vote no. . . . CBO says 22 million people lose insurance; Medicaid cuts hurt most vulnerable Americans; access to healthcare in rural areas threatened."
The roots of her opposition are found along Maine's craggy coastline and, more severely, in its poorer, pine-studded interior.
Some 265,000 people in Maine rely on Medicaid, which here is known as MaineCare. Most of those — some three-quarters — are children, seniors, or disabled people. Simply put, opponents say, lives are at risk.
And livelihoods, too.
Stacey McClure knows how that feels. With her two teenaged children, she lives in a Rockland mobile home park, a gone-to-seed place where I found her walking her dog Tuesday evening.
She works for the catering department at a nearby resort hotel and was recently told she makes just a tad too much to qualify for MaineCare.
“I don't have health insurance anymore," she said. “It weighs on my mind. Things are very broken."
Yes, they are.
Thomas Judge has seen it up close. And, he said, if voices like that of Susan Collins are drowned out in this poisonous political debate, the American tradition of caring for its mostvulnerable will be its ignominious victim.
Judge is executive director of LifeFlight Maine, a nonprofit consortium of health care systems that serves all of Maine with its fleet of three helicopters, one airplane, and a staff of about 100.
He is a registered independent. He does not always agree with Collins. But Judge said he's never doubted her integrity, her principles, or her commitment to Maine.
Obamacare wasn't perfect, he said, but it was working.
“It was beginning to make a difference," Judge said. “And to go back to where people are living in fear of getting sick, living in fear that they're going to be left out and not taken care of is a big mistake for one of the world's greatest countries.
“We forget that Medicaid came from some place. We forget that Medicare came from somewhere and Social Security came from somewhere. It came from a place where a huge amount of the population translated its political will and said, 'We will not have our elderly without health care.' Now, we're in a place in society where we're saying, 'Maybe that's OK.' "
Susan Crimmins lived in the rural town of Minot, a place of about 2,500 in Androscoggin County, until moving to Portland three years ago after a workplace shoulder injury forced her into a job change and 20 months of physical therapy.
She credits Obamacare with her ability to obtain health insurance she needs for chronic vision problems.
Crimmins has read every paragraph of the Senate health care bill. And it scares her.
“We're a really rural state, and we're really old," Crimmins said. “This country should not decide that people's health and welfare are more important than tax cuts."
Crimmins wants Collins to follow in the footsteps of Margaret Chase Smith, a woman Collins once spent two hours with in 1971 while on a high school trip to Washington.
“Collins is very cagey," Crimmins said. “She's committed in public against the motion to proceed. That's allowed me to sleep for the first time in months. What concerns me is what happens if the bill is tweaked. Maine has always been independent, and we're just asking her to assert her independence."
That's what Jim Nelson and Rich Anderson want, too.
And they will be watching and hoping to sit next to Collins to encourage her to remain resolute even if out-of-state money begins to pour in, threatening to weaken a strong spine.
“Maine is a very special place right now," Nelson said. “I mean, two votes can swing the Senate. We have an independent senator [Angus King] who is of very high quality. And we've got Susan Collins, who is probably most likely to depart from her party purity. Maine can have a lot to do with what happens in this country. It's a source of pride for us, and it's also a source of energy to do this work."
It's difficult to argue with people who are fed up with the nightly cable-news echo chamber of high-volume bile, the electronic version of political discourse that now embarrasses the United States across the world.
What people like Nelson and Anderson are calling for is so simple that it's simply profound.
Can't we govern with civility, with genuine respect for positions of conscience?
Can't we agree that a plan that denies 22 million people basic health insurance is governmental cruelty?
They'd like to have a rational and reasoned and polite debate about that this summer.
Maybe it's a fool's errand. If it is, that's a national shame.

THERE'S NO STRATEGY BEHIND SELF-DEFEATING TWEETS

Texto completo: With his health care bill going down in flames, the North Korea crisis percolating, a special prosecutor investigating his campaign's possible collusion with Russia and his own public attempts to obstruct the investigation, President Donald Trump chose yesterday to tap out two obnoxious, misogynistic tweets in retort to criticism from "Morning Joe's" two anchors.
His spokeswoman, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, asked about the tweets on the administration's state TV, Fox News, blithely declared that he "will not be allowed to be bullied by liberal media or liberal elites in Hollywood or anywhere else." The president is once again a victim of bullying, the poor dear.
This time around, maybe wearied from the routine and certain the president's popularity is sinking like a stone, notable Republicans told him to clam up. Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska tweeted: "Please just stop. This isn't normal and it's beneath the dignity of your office." Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina: "Mr. President, your tweet was beneath the office and represents what is wrong with American politics, not the greatness of America." Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, whose vote Mr. Trump needs to pass a health care bill: "This has to stop - we all have a job - 3 branches of gov't and media. We don't have to get along, but we must show respect and civility."
Mr. Trump's latest outbursts are not part of a brilliant strategy. He gains nothing, at a time when his grasp of his job is openly questioned. He gains no allies in the health care debate. He reminds the country that Republicans who chose to ignore or rationalize this kind of behavior will go down as moral quislings. He reminds us that the conservative evangelicals who embraced him are not exemplars of moral or religious behavior; they are apologists and tribalists who rejoice in his exacting revenge on "elites."
No upside comes from this behavior. It's the reaction of a man-child who cannot contain his belligerence.

Texto completo: When you get home from a long day, just make a few clicking sounds and call out "Baby Kitty." Seconds later, a gorgeous Maine coon will wake from a nap and emerge from under the couch.
After stretching in the downward dog pose, the friendly cat will race over and to greet you at the door with cheerful meows. She may only have three legs, but that doesn't hinder her from being able to leap onto the couch to snuggle.
Baby Kitty will happily spend the evening sprawled out beside you on the sofa, and she purrs continuously when you scratch her neck. She's more affectionate than playful, however she can't resist chasing a laser light when it appears in front of her.
The 1-year-old is front declawed but still makes use of a sisal rope scratching post and likes climbing up a cat condo, located near the window, so she can watch birds. She's good with dogs, cats, kids and birds and, with a little time, she will blend in well to any home.
Meet Baby at the Arizona Humane Society, 9226 N. 13th Ave., Phoenix. Her adoption fee is $40 and includes her spay surgery, vaccinations and a microchip. For more information,call 602-997-7585 and ask for animal number A556301. She may have been adopted by the time you visit the shelter,but there are currently over 150 cats/kittens in need of new homes.

Texto completo: Tear up the closing notice - at least for now. Paula Vogel's Broadway drama "Indecent," which recently announced that it would close on June 25, will instead run an additional six weeks. The play, which won Tony Awards for Rebecca Taichman's direction and Christopher Akerlind's lighting design, explores Sholem Asch's controversial Yiddish melodrama "God of Vengeance." In a statement, producer Daryl Roth said that "the electricity of what is happening at the Cort has been profound" and the extension is meant "to give theatergoers a little more time to see it before we pack up our suitcases for the final time on August 6."
'Salesman' to get experimental makeover
Following the strange and divisive Broadway revivals of Arthur Miller's "A View from the Bridge" and "The Crucible" by experimental director Ivo van Hove, "Death of a Salesman," Miller's best-known drama, will receive an avant-garde, symbolism-driven interpretation in Brooklyn directed by Ruben Polendo (Theater Mitu). It will play the Fishman Space at BAM Fisher from July 14-23. A decade ago, when Polendo directed "Hair" at NYU, every actor shaved his or her head and the score was remade to sound like Philip Glass. To this day, I remain puzzled by that production.
Elvis bio musical premiering in Maine
Anyone remember "All Shook Up," the flop 2005 Broadway musical built around songs made famous by Elvis Presley, which had a plot that resembled "Twelfth Night" in a small Midwestern town in the 1950s? Well, Elvis is getting another chance to make it in musical theater. "Heartbreak Hotel," a new musical based on the life of Elvis, will debut in August at the Ogunquit Playhouse in Maine. It is written and directed by Floyd Mutrux, co-creator of the musical "Million Dollar Quartet" (about the legendary 1956 jam session between Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, and Johnny Cash).
'A Clockwork Orange' stage version follows '1984'
Just a week after opening night of "1984" on Broadway, another stage adaptation of a classic dystopian novel is set to come from London to New York. Alexandra Spencer-Jones's production of Anthony Burgess's incendiary 1962 work "A Clockwork Orange" will play Off-Broadway's New World Stages beginning Sept. 2. Just like "1984," "A Clockwork Orange" has scenes where its rebellious protagonist is captured and tortured. No word yet on whether stage versions of "Brave New World," "The Handmaid's Tale" and "Fahrenheit 451" are also on the way.
Lincoln Center Festival director stepping down
Nigel Redden, who has been director of Lincoln Center Festival (which brings theater, music and dance productions from around the world to Lincoln Center venues each summer) for almost 20 years, will step down from his position once the 2017 festival comes to an end. Festival highlights under his watch have included the Royal Shakespeare Company's residency at the Park Avenue Armory, Cate Blanchett in "Uncle Vanya" and "The Maids" at City Center, "Pacific Overtures" in Japanese and marathon productions by Ireland's Druid Theatre Company.
Florida dominates the Platt-hosted Jimmy Awards
Sofia Deler and Tony Moreno, both teens from Florida, won best actress and best actor, respectively, at the Jimmy Awards on Monday night at Broadway's Minskoff Theatre. The Jimmy Awards recognize high school students who won regional competitions across the country for their performances in stage musicals. Tony winner Ben Platt ("Dear Evan Hansen"), who hosted the event, at 23 years old, is not much older than the students who competed.
Harburg-Arlen musical 'Jamaica' to be revived in Harlem
Harlem Repertory Theatre will continue its series of musicals by playwright-lyricist Yip Harburg with "Jamaica," a long-forgotten 1959 musical about the island squaring off against American commercialism, beginning July 29 at the Tato Laviera Theatre. The original Broadway production starred Lena Horne and Ricardo Montalban. In terms of other Harburg works, the company is currently presenting "The Wizard of Oz" and will later produce "Finian's Rainbow," "Flahooley" and "Bloomer Girl." Among them, Harold Arlen wrote the music for "The Wizard of Oz," "Jamaica" and "Bloomer Girl."
Ruehl joins Urie for 'Torch Song'
Tony and Academy Award winner Mercedes Ruehl ("Lost in Yonkers") will join Michael Urie for the upcoming Off-Broadway revival of Harvey Fierstein's landmark 1982 gay drama "Torch Song Trilogy" (which has been revised and retitled "Torch Song") at Second Stage Theater. Urie will play a drag performer and Ruehl will be his Jewish mother. The play was made into a 1988 film with Fierstein, Matthew Broderick and Anne Bancroft. Preview performances begin on Sept. 26.
'Jerry's Girls' heading Off-Broadway
With the Bette Midler-led Broadway revival of "Hello, Dolly!" bringing in big bucks, it was inevitable that another Jerry Herman musical would come along. As part of its Musicals in Mufti series, the York Theatre Company will present a limited run concert production of the all-female revue "Jerry's Girls" (which contains songs from "Hello, Dolly!," "Mame," "Mack and Mabel," "Dear World" and "La Cage aux Folles") beginning Aug. 5. The 1985 Broadway production starred Chita Rivera, Dorothy Loudon and Leslie Uggams.

YOUR CAREER: Why an advanced degree? Nurses everywhere are responding to changes in the field and reaping major rewards

Texto completo: Nursing schools in Georgia and across the nation are turning out more graduates with Master's and doctoral degrees and the potential for six-figure starting salaries.
They're responding, at least in part, to a transformational move in medicine that's been embraced by 22 states, Georgia not included.
Following a recommendation from the Institute of Medicine, these states are allowing nurse practitioners - nurses with a master's or doctorate degree - to evaluate, diagnose, treat and prescribe medications to patients without a doctor's oversight.
Nationwide, the American Association of College of Nurses reports that nursing enrollment has increased by nearly 7 percent in master's programs, by 3 percent in research-focused doctoral programs and by 26 percent in practice-focused doctoral programs.
Applications at the nursing schools at Atlanta's Emory University and Georgia Southern University in Statesboro reflect those trends.
Applications for Emory's Doctorate of Nursing Practice program have jumped a whopping 856 percent since 2015, said Dr. Linda McCauley, dean and professor of the university's Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing.
Applications also are up in that same period by 366 percent for Emory's Accelerated Bachelor of Science in nursing program and by 370 percent for its Accelerated Master of Science in nursing program, she said.
Georgia Southern had 146 applicants for advanced degree programs this year, compared to about 40 a year in each of the last 10 years, Dr. Sharon G. Radzyminski, chair of the university's nursing program, said.
"We can't take that many students," she said, "but that's how many qualified students we had apply."
Georgia Southern turned away all but 40 of this year's 146 applicants because it didn't have the faculty to support more students, Radzyminski said.
The university's program for psychiatric mental health practitioners also is at capacity this year, she said.
"Strengthening the pipeline of highly educated nurses has always been a priority within the nursing profession -even before health care reform--to meet the nation's growing need for nurse scientists, faculty, expert clinicians, leaders and innovators,"Emory's
McCauley said. "With the growing
complexity of health care, the need for nurses with the highest level of scientific knowledge and practice expertise has only intensified."
Andi Smith, a 34-year-old single mother of three from Austell, is a doctoral student at Emory.
"It's all about personal knowledge," said Smith, who is an assistant nurse manager in the new mother/baby unit at WellStar Cobb Hospital. "I want to become a better leader."
Her employer is contributing $5,000 a year to her tuition costs, and that's been a huge help.
"WellStar made it possible to do it now while I'm young instead of down the road when I could afford it," said Smith, who started her doctoral program in August 2016 and hopes to complete it in 2018.
2010: A turning point
The push for more nurse practitioners began in the early 2000s, but dramatically escalated around 2010. That was the year that the Institute of Medicine released a report, "The Future of Nursing:Leading Change, Advancing Health."
The report said nurse practitioners "are a critical element of the health care team that can, in fact, improve outcomes of patient care, alongside their physician counterparts," Radzyminksi said.
The IOM said nurses should be "allowed to practice to the extent of their education and expertise," she said. "For that to come out of the Institute of Medicine was pretty earth-shattering at the time."
Nurse practitioners have an important niche to fill, Radzyminski said.
It centers on this reality:
With improved public health and medical care, Americans are living longer than previous generations. But they're also living longer with multiple, chronic geriatric health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, skin cancer and sleep apnea, she said.
These conditions aren't going to be fixed with a single pill, surgery or a simple procedure, Radzyminski said.
These are more likely to require multiple lifestyle changes and involvement by other family members, she said.
"It requires a more holistic, family-oriented kind of care. That is how nurses approach deviations in health care and work toward wellness, she said. "That's why people say this is tailor-made for nurse practitioners and why their outcomes are usually very good.
Programs for nurse practitioners grew significantly after the Affordable Care Act became reality, Radzyminski said.
"I think that was driven by the job market," she said. "As we have more and more underinsured individuals seeking health care, more employment opportunities become available for nurse practitioners in physician's offices and clinics."
Obtaining a master's or doctorate takes an average of three years. In 2016, the median annual pay for a nurse practitioner with a master's degree was $107,460, nearly three times the median annual wage for all U.S. workers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Nurse practitioners with doctorate degrees can earn $140,000 a year, although salaries vary by region.
"The need for doctorally prepared nurses is particularly acute,"Emory's
McCauley said.
Only one percent of the nation's nursing workforce hold doctoral degrees, although that's quickly changing, she said.
"Nurses with PhDs are the knowledge generators for the nursing profession,"McCauley said.
They're also "our faculty leaders, playing a critical role in educating the nursing workforce of the future," she said.
McCauley sees the demand for nurse practitioners continuing - especially with projections of a primary care provider shortage of 200,000 by 2020.
"Nurses trained at the graduate level will help fill the gap," she said. "Nurse practitioners (NPs)who earn a Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) or a Doctorate of Nursing Practice (DNP) degree are the fastest-growing group of primary care providers."
The number of nurse practitioners is projected to double to more than 244,000 by 2025, according to a recent RAND Corporation analysis, McCauley said.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics is predicting that employment for nurse anesthetists, nurse midwives and nurse practitioners will grow 31 percent between 2014 and 2024, much faster than the average for all occupations.
The BLS says growth in these job sectors will occur primarily as a result of healthcare legislation, an increased emphasis on preventive care and demand for healthcare services from the longer-living but less active baby-boom population.
Sharon Vanairsdale, program director for the Serious Communicable Disease Unit at Emory University Hospital, said she wrestled with the idea of whether to pursue her doctorate.
"I have been very lucky," she said. "I've had a very rewarding and enriching nursing career."
But Vanairsdale, who became part of history when she admitted three humanitarian aid workers with to Emory in, ultimately decided it was the right move.
"I just felt that getting my DNP would help give me those tools that I need to get evidence that we are doing best-practices at the bedside," Vanairsdale said.
She said she also believes a doctorate will help her to ensure "nurses have a voice at the table."
Dr. Carolyn Clevenger, Emory's associate dean for clinical and community partnership, said she tells students that the potential for an increased salary "is not a very fulfilling reason to suffer through graduate school."
Then, she says, she them her story--moving from an ICU nurse to a nurse practitioner with a master's and then to a PhD in nursing practice.
"I had more influence over people when I was diagnosing and prescribing for them as a nurse practitioner than I did as a nurse," said Clevenger, who specializes in geriatrics and started a nurse-run, comprehensive primary care clinic at Emory for patients with dementia. "Then from the master's to the doctorate, the shift was about going from the patient level to changing the whole system. And that brings a lot of joy to me."
McCauley said some of the stunning growth in Emory's doctoral program is likely due to the planned launch in fall 2017 of the university's DNP Nurse Anesthesia program, only one of two in the state.
Other factors include faculty reputation, research expertise and Emory's ranking as the No. 1 nursing school in the nation for National Institutes of Health research funding, she said.
In Georgia, nurse practitioners still have to be in a contract with a physician to be able to practice, Radzyminski said.
That's not as the Institute of Medicine suggested, she said.
The Medical Association of Georgia has blocked efforts to expand the role of nurse practitioners in the state, claiming nurses are not as educated as physicians, Radzyminski said.
"That's not true. They are educated differently," she said. "Health care is in the eye of the beholder, and you need everybody. There is a place for every single health care provider."
(Box)
Full Practice
State practice and licensure law provides for all nurse practitioners to evaluate patients, diagnose, order and interpret diagnostic tests, initiate and manage treatments--including prescribe medications--under the exclusive licensure authority of the state board of nursing.This is the model recommended by the Institute of Medicine and National Council of State Boards of Nursing. States in this category: Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, Washington, Wyoming; also, District of Columbia. Reduced Practice
State practice and licensure law reduces the ability of nurse practitioners to engage in at least one element of NP practice. State law requires a regulated collaborative agreement with an outside health discipline in order for the NP to provide patient care or limits the setting or scope of one or more elements of NP practice. States in this category: Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin. Restricted Practice
State practice and licensure law restricts the ability of a nurse practitioner to engage in at least one element of NP practice. State requires supervision, delegation, or team-management by an outside health discipline in order for the NP to provide patient care. States in this category: California, Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia.

New talent on campus: The Catamounts' incoming freshman class will feature six forwards, four defensemen and two goaltenders. Through graduation and early departures, Vermont has lost 11 players, including eight seniors, from last season's team that went 20-13-5 overall and 10-8-4 in Hockey East.
The new forwards are (hometown, age, height, weight, most recent team): Ace Cowans of Beverly, Mass., 19, 5-7, 166, Waterloo Blackhawks (USHL); Vladislav Dzhioshvili of Moscow, Russia, 19, 6-1, 192, Bloomington Thunder (USHL); Alex Esposito of West Haven, Conn, 21, 6-0, 200, Youngstown Phantoms (USHL); Martin Frechette of Rockland, Ontario, 20, 5-8, 150, Cumberland Grads (CCHL); Max Kaufman of Pittsford, N.Y., 21, 5-8, 172, Langley Rivermen (BCHL); and Bryce Misley of Calgary, Alberta, 17, 6-2, 187, Oakville Blades (OHJL). Misley was a recent NHL draft pick of the Minnesota Wild (fourth round, No. 116 overall).
The defensemen include: Christian Evers of Waukee, Iowa, 20, 6-2, 220, Lincoln Stars (USHL); Owen Grant of Stittsville, Ontario, 19, 6-0, 185, Carleton Place Canadians (CCCHL); Brian Kelly of Purchase, N.Y., 19, 6-0, 180, Connecticut Jr. Rangers (USPHL Premier); and Cory Thomas of St. Brieux, Saskatchewan, 19, 6-5, 210, Flin Flon Bombers (SHJL).
The two freshmen goalies will be: Matt Beck of Westport, Conn., 20, 6-0, 180, Philadelphia Jr. Flyers (USPHL Premier) and Tyler Harmon of Ramsey, N.J., 19, 6-3, 190, Jersey Hitmen (USPHL Premier).
Three depart, two gain year's eligibility: Three of the 2016-17 Catamounts eligible to return have decided to leave the team. Senior forward Kevin Irwin will remain at UVM but will not play. Junior defenseman Mike Lee is transferring to Sacred Heart. Sophomore forward Cameron Klein also plans to transfer to an undetermined college.
One of last year's seniors, defenseman Ori Abramson, will return for a fourth year after the NCAA approved a medical waiver granting him another season of eligibility. Abramson briefly attended Providence College in 2012-13 but did not play before illness forced him to miss two years.
Another Catamount, forward Conor O'Neil, also received an NCAA medical waiver granting him another year of eligibility. As a sophomore last year, O'Neil played in only four games before an injury ended his season.

Texto completo: State Supreme Court rules that woman can change her name to a friend's last name and slaps a probate judge who said she should get married if she wanted to make the name change
The Maine Supreme Judicial Court has overruled a judge's decision denying a single woman's request to change her surname to match that of her partner - because he said it might create an appearance that she is married.
In strong terms, the state's highest court said this week that the judge's interpretation of a key provision in state law would create "absurd results" and doesn't reflect how changes in society are affecting name choices.
"Given the variety of naming conventions in modern society, having the same last name no more indicates that a couple is married than having a different last name indicates that a couple is unmarried," the justices wrote in a unanimous order. They sent the matter back to the Cumberland County Probate Court with instructions to approve the woman's name change.
Carol Boardman, 62, of Standish, had taken her husband's name when they married in 2000, but he died in 2013. About a year ago, Boardman was living with a partner and decided she could use a "fresh start," beginning with a name change. Her partner, Charles Currier, suggested she choose his last name, and Boardman liked the idea.
She thought the name change would be a straightforward process, but when she went in front of Cumberland County Probate Judge Joseph Mazziotti, it turned out to be anything but.
When Boardman, in response to a question from the judge, said she and Currier were not married, Mazziotti balked.
"That presents a problem for me," he said, according to a transcript of the brief hearing on Aug. 18, 2016.
Mazziotti told Boardman that it was "OK" for her to seek a fresh start, but it would appear to anyone who met them that she and Currier were married and "that would be deceptive." Deception is one of the few criteria that Maine judges can use to deny a name-change request.
The judge went on to explain that if Boardman sought to get credit, sign a lease or obtain access to records, it would be done "under the misapprehension that you were a married couple, but you're not."
When Mazziotti said he was denying her request, Boardman asked, "What am I supposed to do?"
"Get married. That's your solution, I'm afraid," Mazziotti said.
In his order denying the name change, Mazziotti wrote that Boardman "admits" that the name change "would give the public impression they are a married couple and thus a false impression." Boardman, however, said she didn't agree with Mazziotti's ruling or admit that the change would create a false impression.
LEAVING STUNNED, DRAWING SUPPORT
Boardman said she was stunned by the judge's reasoning.
"He made some obvious assumptions that were not accurate," she said Wednesday after the state's top court agreed with her. "It was absurd. Chuck and I went in there that day thinking, 'Great, we'll celebrate tonight.' We walked out of there saying, 'What just happened?' I walked out of there stunned and said, 'Did he really just say that?' "
Boardman said she told James Mundy, a lawyer who had done some work for her, about the judge's denial, and he suggested appealing the decision.
"It seemed to me like a very normal thing to be seeking," Mundy said of the name change.
Mundy and his wife have a South Berwick law practice that handles mostly real estate matters and estate planning, but he dove into Boardman's appeal and found there have been few recent rulings on name changes in Maine, even while society has undergone seismic shifts.
"Changes in family structure are driving the name-change issue," he said. "It's an evolving area of the law, and there are constitutional implications over the power to control one's name."
The ACLU of Maine, the Boston-based GLBTQ Legal Advocates and Defenders, known as GLAD, EqualityMaine and the Trans Youth Equality Foundation all signed onto the case and filed briefs on Boardman's behalf.
Mary Bonauto, a Portland attorney who is the civil rights project director for GLAD and has been a key figure in the national struggle over marriage equality, said names are integral to a person's identity. Her organization believes judges shouldn't have such broad discretion to decide the validity of a person's reasons for seeking a name change.
"People can order their families as they see fit," she said, and names are part of that ordering. Mazziotti's use of marriage - or in this case, the lack of one - as a reason to deny a name change seemed to be an overreach, Bonauto said.
"The marriage issue to us was a red herring," she said. "We thought the law was clear that you don't need to be married to change your name. Marriage doesn't enter the equation."
NO GAINS FROM MARITAL DECEPTION
The Maine Women's Lobby didn't join the case, but Eliza Townsend, executive director of the organization, said the Supreme Judicial Court's ruling is heartening.
Deciding that a woman would need to get married before she could change her name seems like something out of a long-forgotten era, she said.
"The whole thing feels awfully dated," she said. "To assume that the last name is an indicator of your marital status is an awful lot to assume."
The Supreme Judicial Court also chided Mazziotti for assuming that Boardman's name-change request represented a deliberate deception. The court said there was no reason to assume Boardman was looking to deceive someone and noted that Maine law already bars discrimination on the basis of marital status, so she wouldn't have derived any benefit from appearing to be married in seeking housing or credit. And, the court said, unmarried domestic partners also have some legal protections regardless of their names, so she wouldn't have benefited by "appearing" to be married.
"We conclude that a person's potential misunderstanding of another person's marital status, without more, does not qualify as a fraud that precludes the otherwise liberal grant of name-change petitions in Probate Court," the Supreme Judicial Court said in a summary of its decision.
Mazziotti did not return a message seeking comment.
Boardman, soon to be Carol Currier, said the broader societal issues really weren't a factor in her decision to appeal, although she recognizes why other groups saw her case as important.
And in retrospect, she said, it could have been decided in that brief hearing nearly a year ago, avoiding a protracted appeal and high court ruling.
"I could have gone in there and lied and said, 'I picked the name out of a phone book,' " she said. Edward D. Murphy can be contacted at 791-6465 or at: emurphy@pressherald.com

Texto completo: Comments from local immigrant leaders and organizations on Maine travel ban; can stand alone or be folded into another story. They don't see an immediate impact in Maine, but are worried about the international impact of the travel ban.
Immigrant leaders and their advocates in Maine are not immediately aware of anyone who will be barred from traveling to Maine because of President Trump's revived travel ban.
But they are still worried about the practical implementation of the new policy and the broader impacts of the restrictions that took effect Thursday night.
"The feeling is that it is the policy of the administration to eliminate, to basically stop all immigration from Muslim countries," said Mahmoud Hassan, president of the Somali Community Association of Maine.
The U.S. Supreme Court will review Trump's travel ban in the fall. Until then, the court allowed a scaled-back version of the president's executive order. For the next 90 days, visa applicants from six Muslim-majority countries - Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Iran and Yemen - will need to prove close family or institutional ties to the United States before gaining entry. Refugees from any country also will be barred for 120 days if they cannot show those connections.
Hassan said refugees from his home country already go through years of vetting to enter the United States. He worried travel would become more difficult even for people who are not subject to the ban simply because they are from Somalia or one of the other listed countries.
"For an executive order to stand labeling entire communities as dangerous and unsafe just adds to the pressure on these communities, and adds to the power of certain agencies to inconvenience and make it difficult for safe and legal and law-abiding citizens," Hassan said.
Organizations that work with immigrants in Maine said the exception for family reunifications is positive for many of their clients.
The federal government resettled more than 3,200 refugees in Maine from 2011 to 2016, according to Catholic Charities, the agency that administers local resettlements. Spokeswoman Judy Katzel said many of the refugees resettled by the organization are meeting their relatives in Maine and would not be affected by the ban.
Refugee resettlement already has slowed in Maine in the first months of Trump's presidency, Katzel said, and she was not aware of any impending arrivals to Maine that would be delayed by the travel ban.
The State Department issued instructions on who is considered a close family member on Thursday. But Sue Roche, executive director of the Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project in Maine, said there is still confusion about what relationships exempt a person from the travel ban and what documentation is required to prove them. Providing proof of ties to the United States could be prohibitive for some people, she said.
The nonprofit receives anxious calls regularly from people with questions about Trump's immigration policies, Roche said, even naturalized citizens and legal permanent residents who are not impacted by the ban.
"There is still a lot of fear in the community that this is targeting people based on their religion and their country of origin," Roche said. Megan Doyle can be contacted at 791-6327 or at: mdoyle@pressherald.com Twitter: megan_e_doyle

Texto completo: Senator Angus King is concerned that relocating a mail sorter machine from Scarborough to Nashua will result in a reduction in services for southern Maine customers.
Postal workers employed at the Scarborough Distribution Center say that the U.S. Postal Service's decision to relocate one of the facility's Automated Parcel Bundle Sorters to Nashua, New Hampshire, will result in slower mail deliveries and reduced service throughout southern Maine.
Scott Adams, president of Local 458 of the American Postal Workers Union asked U.S. Sen. Angus King in a letter June 27 to intervene on the union's behalf and ask the postmaster general to delay removing the machine.
It could not be determined Thursday evening whether work to move the machine has started.
King sent a letter, dated June 28, to Postmaster General Megan Brennan in which he lays out his concerns about relocating the machine, which sorts outgoing priority mail in Maine and outgoing first class parcels sent from southern Maine.
"My concern is that such a move would result in delayed mail and reduced service standards, particularly during peak season. Such a course of action cannot but raise the possibility of difficulty for Maine businesses who have come to rely upon USPS for vital delivery and customer satisfaction services," King wrote.
King raised another concern in the letter - that delivery standards including first class next-day delivery from Scarborough will no longer be an option. King said that would result in extra charges for priority overnight shipping for customers seeking fast delivery.
Adams said in his letter to King that work to remove the machine was scheduled to begin June 29. Adams could not be reached for comment, and postal service spokesman Steve Doherty is on vacation and could not be reached.
None of the correspondence between Adams, King and the postal service indicated that any jobs would be lost in Scarborough when the machine is moved.
King's office did receive an initial response from the postal service's government liaison, Scott R. Slusher, earlier this month. Slusher said the postal service was moving forward with its plan to relocate the machine to Nashua.
"This efficiency improvement will necessitate changes to employee work hours," Slusher wrote in a letter dated June 5. "Obviously, with the APBS in Nashua, that plant will perform the associated work, but the corresponding reductions at southern Maine will not lead to excessing or terminating employees."
Any workforce reductions would have to be accomplished through attrition, Slusher told King.

Texto completo: A funeral mass will be held at 2 p.m. Friday at St. Mary's Church in Bath to mourn and honor Eric Gilliam, a lifelong public servant, who dedicated his life to helping people with developmental disabilities, mental health issues and troubled youth. Mr. Gilliam died Sunday after a year-long fight with cancer, He was 61. He served as chief operating officer at the Pineland Center for 27 years and oversaw its closure in 1996. He was former director of the Bath Children's Home, and served as director of support services at Augusta Mental Health Institute. He also served a decade at Long Creek Youth Development Center, retiring as deputy superintendent. Most recently, he served as chief operating officer at Riverview Psychiatric Center.
Eric Gilliam, who worked for decades to improve the lives of people with developmental disabilities, mental health issues and troubled youths, died Sunday after a brief fight with cancer. He was 61.
A funeral Mass will be celebrated at 2 p.m. Friday at St. Mary's Church in Bath.
Mr. Gilliam served as chief operating officer at the Pineland Center for about 25 years and oversaw its closure in 1996. He was former director of the Bath Children's Home and served for five years as director of support services at the Augusta Mental Health Institute. He also served at Long Creek Youth Development Center, retiring as deputy superintendent. Most recently, he served as chief operating officer at the Riverview Psychiatric Center.
"He was a man of integrity," said Rod Bouffard, a close friend who worked with Mr. Gilliam for 40 years. "He was always willing to make the right decision regardless of whether it would have a negative impact on him."
Mr. Gilliam was the last administrator at the Pineland Center. He helped secure placement for residents in new homes throughout Maine.
Bouffard reflected Thursday on the decision to close Pineland. He said they knew it was the right thing to do, even though it would put them and many others out of work.
"I really believe this is the right thing," Mr. Gilliam said in a 1995 Portland Press Herald column. "It's sad to see a place like this close, but I'm happy for the people who lived here. They're getting an opportunity to live in a less restrictive, more normal environment."
Mr. Gilliam went on to serve as director of the Bath Children's Home, and director of support services at AMHI.
Mr. Gilliam also worked for a decade at Long Creek Youth Development Center. Bouffard, the former superintendent at Long Creek, said Mr. Gilliam trained the security staff to better handle troubled kids.
"We introduced collaborative problem solving," Bouffard said. "We saw the seclusions and restraints drop well below the national average. We saw recidivism rates drop from 90 percent to 20 percent. Eric was incredibly skilled. He really had an ability to understand people and figure out what would motivate them."
Mr. Gilliam lived in Freeport with his wife of 12 years, Michele. He was the father of four children, three from his first marriage and one from the second.
Michele Gilliam described her husband Thursday as a loving and compassionate man who had a strong sense of family. She talked about the years he coached his kids' teams.
"He was beyond dedicated," his wife said. "He was a really wonderful, loving father."
Mr. Gilliam had a passion for art and antiques. In recent years, he would go to flea markets and art shows and buy items to sell on eBay. His wife said art was a release.
Mr. Gilliam came out of retirement in May 2016 to work at the Riverview Psychiatric Center.
His wife said they loved to travel and took several trips to Europe. They also liked to visit New Jersey to see his daughter and grandchildren. They went running together and were often seen walking around their neighborhood together.
"We had a great marriage," she said. "We truly appreciated each other. His goal was to spoil people he loved and to make people happy."
About a month ago, Mr. Gilliam was diagnosed with an aggressive form of liver cancer. He died at home with his wife by his side. Melanie Creamer can be contacted at 791-6361 or at: mcreamer@pressherald.com Twitter: MelanieCreamer

Missing Biddeford woman found after minor accident
A 79-year-old Biddeford woman with dementia who had been missing for nearly 24 hours was found Thursday afternoon when she was involved in a minor vehicle crash in Massachusetts.
Biddeford police said Audrey M. Brown had been missing since she left home Wednesday afternoon to visit a relative in Alfred.
By 6 a.m. Thursday, Brown had still not made it to her destination in the Keywood Manor area of Alfred, police said.
Brown was involved in a minor car crash in Lowell, Massachusetts, and was taken to Lowell General Hospital on Thursday afternoon because of her "altered mental state of dementia," according to Biddeford police. Her family has been notified.
Brown, who was driving a Nissan Sentra, had been spotted earlier in the day in another Massachusetts city.
A motorist driving in Haverhill called police around 11 a.m. Thursday to report a car was being operated erratically.
The license plate number provided to police matched the car Brown was last seen driving, but police were unable to find her or her car. She was last seen on Route 125 in Haverhill heading toward New Hampshire.
Biddeford police assume Brown took the Maine Turnpike to Massachusetts, but have not been able to confirm that because her car does not have an E-ZPass.
A Silver Alert had been issued in Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts.
WESTBROOK
Teenager found safe following appeal to public
A 15-year-old girl reported missing in Westbrook has been found and is safe, according to police.
"No further information is being released at this time. Thank you to everyone for helping get the word out," Westbrook police said in a written statement Thursday afternoon.
Madison Brown was last seen Tuesday on Brown Street in Westbrook, and police asked for the public's help locating her Thursday morning.
Brown's case was not believed to be related to another missing teenager, Jaedyn Smith, who was missing from Friday to Monday, when she was located.
BREWER
Woman indicted on charges stemming from family fight
A Maine woman has been indicted on charges that caused her to be barred from the city.
WABI-TV reported that 25-year-old Christina McCarthy was arrested in April after a family fight.
McCarthy was indicted Wednesday on charges of assault, domestic violence assault, criminal threatening with a dangerous weapon, trespassing and refusing to submit to arrest.
Officials ordered McCarthy to stay out of Brewer.
PORTLAND
Four minor earthquakes detected in recent days
The U.S. Geological Society has measured four minor earthquakes in Maine over the past several days.
The earthquakes began Sunday and the most recent was recorded Wednesday morning. WMTW-TV reported two 1.4 magnitude earthquakes were recorded outside Lincoln on Sunday morning and a third measuring 1.7 was measured in the same area Sunday afternoon.
An earthquake with a 1.3 magnitude was measured near Livermore on Wednesday.
The USGS says earthquakes below a 3.0 magnitude are low intensity and are felt by few people.
AUGUSTA
Three suspects plead guilty to reduced drug charge
Three people accused of trafficking in more than 20 pounds of marijuana while armed with a firearm pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of unlawful marijuana possession this week at the Capital Judicial Center and were placed on deferred disposition for two years.
Ernest Chasse, 64, and Patricia Chasse, 67, both of Farmingdale, and Michael R. Bridges, 28, of Oakland, entered the pleas Wednesday.
Under an agreement with the state, if the three defendants commit no new criminal conduct and refrain from possessing firearms, they would withdraw their guilty pleas to the felony-level possession charge, which would be dismissed, and they would plead guilty to a misdemeanor marijuana possession charge.
The sentence then would be 30 days in jail and a $400 fine.
If they do not comply, they could be sentenced to up to five years in jail.
The three were indicted last August on charges of aggravated trafficking in more than 20 pounds of marijuana while armed with a firearm, unlawful trafficking in more than 20 pounds of marijuana and unlawful possession of more than 20 pounds of marijuana. The offenses allegedly occurred in 2015 in Farmingdale.
WATERVILLE
City plans to put river-walk out to bid during August
The city plans to put a $900,000 river-walk project out to bid in August that will include a boardwalk, a children's play area, an amphitheater, a gazebo and a 900-foot-long boardwalk with railings at Head of Falls near the Two Cent Bridge.
The Waterville Rotary Club in 2015 donated $150,000 toward the project as a way to celebrate the club's centennial anniversary. City Manager Michael Roy, who heads the committee, said the city hopes to hire a contractor in September to do the work, some of which can be done this fall. Work would resume in the spring and the project would be completed in time for the Rotary Club to celebrate the opening in September 2018.
The city applied for a $300,000 grant from the Land and Water Conservation Fund managed by the National Park Service and was notified it was one of three municipalities in Maine to be approved for grant money.
Colby College donated $75,000 for the project; Waterville Development Corp. gave $50,000; Kennebec Messalonskee Trails, $15,000; and Inland Hospital, $10,000, according to Roy.
BOOTHBAY
UMaine, Bigelow Labs get grants for oyster-pest study
The University of Maine and Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in Boothbay were awarded two grants Thursday, totaling more than a half million dollars.
The $574,000 will be used to fund a joint study of a marine protozoan parasite that infects oysters. The grants were awarded by the National Science Foundation.
Maine U.S. Sens. Susan Collins, a Republican, and Angus King, an independent, made the announcement Thursday in a joint statement.
"This funding will support the innovative collaboration between Bigelow Lab and the University of Maine and further our knowledge of Maine's marine ecology," Collins and King said.

Texto completo: No one seems to know why Kimberly Piccolo was in Maine, but her mother said she had been acting odd.
CLINTON -- A Connecticut woman last seen in a parked car outside a small market in Clinton was reported missing by police Thursday, and no one knows what compelled her to drive to Maine.
According to a post on the department's Facebook Page, Kimberly Piccolo, 31, of Connecticut, was discovered sleeping in her car at 7 p.m. Sunday at the Tradewinds Market on Hinckley Road.
An officer and rescue personnel spoke with Piccolo, who reportedly said that she had fallen asleep and was waiting for friends to pick her up.
She appeared to be in good condition and refused medical care. There was no probable cause to make her go for a medical evaluation.
Piccolo drives a silver Mazda 3 with Connecticut license plate number 926YOV.
Barbara Piccolo, Kimberly Piccolo's mother, said the family has no idea why Piccolo would drive the nearly 350 miles from her home in Westport, Connecticut, to Clinton. She said they've talked to her daughter's friends, and they can't find anyone she would have visited in Maine.
"She just got in her car and drove," Barbara Piccolo said.
Piccolo's mother said she had just gotten into Portland around 2 p.m. Thursday, and was searching for Kimberly. She said her daughter's apparent spur-of-the-moment drive to Maine was not something Kimberly would do. "It's not in her character at all," her mother said.
Barbara Piccolo described her daughter as a "very professional, brilliant young lady," an educated person who usually kept everything together. But the mother said her daughter's behavior had been unusual last week. Kimberly Piccolo had been staying at her mother's home for the previous three days and had been acting "paranoid" lately. While she has suffered anxiety in the past and taken medication for it, Barbara Piccolo said that anxiety was nothing compared to the way her daughter had been acting.
"She was acting like she thinks somebody's watching her," Barbara Piccolo said, adding that included constantly checking to make sure doors were locked and window shades were drawn.
Barbara Piccolo said her daughter had a friend who lived in Portland at one time, but that friend moved away.
"I'm just thinking maybe she was distraught, got in her car and drove," Barbara Piccolo said. "It doesn't make sense, and that's what makes it worse."
While Kimberly Piccolo was not taking medication at the time, her mother thought maybe she should have been.
Barbara Piccolo said her daughter left her house at 7 a.m. Sunday, taking only her pocketbook and the car. She left all her clothes behind and didn't have much money.
"It's so weird that she would just drive up here and sleep in her car," Barbara Piccolo said. "None of it makes sense."
Clinton Police Chief Rusty Bell said his agency has been in contact with police in the Piccolos' area. He said Clinton police have reviewed surveillance video from the Tradewinds store and have a complete timeline from when police spoke with Piccolo to when she left around 8:40 p.m.
Bell said Connecticut police are working to "ping" Piccolo's phone to determine its location. This can mean sending the phone a message, and having it respond with requested data. It also might mean locating the phone by identifying the cell tower that received the last signal from the phone. Piccolo's phone is currently off, but pinging it will determine where she last used it.
When Piccolo left the market, Bell said, she turned right, which leads police to believe she was heading toward Interstate 95. They have no way of knowing if she went north or south, but Bell said she has no connection to Clinton.
In the video, Piccolo was last seen wearing a green-and-white jacket. Bell said she appeared healthy in the video, getting out of the car a few times and going into the store. The video doesn't show anyone meeting Piccolo. At the time an officer met with her, Piccolo had not been reported missing.
Bell said another cause for concern was that Piccolo is supposed to be in a wedding party Friday, and no one in the party had heard from her. Colin Ellis can be contacted at 861-9253 or at: cellis@centralmaine.com Twitter: colinoellis

Texto completo: AUGUSTA -- Emergency legislation to give cities and towns temporary authority to regulate the location of marijuana growing facilities is now law.
Gov. Paul LePage signed the bill June 23, authorizing communities to prohibit medical marijuana caregivers from growing pot within 500 feet of a school property line.
Rep. Seth Berry, D-Bowdoinham, introduced the bill this month after Richmond town officials found they had no grounds to deny an application for a marijuana growing facility less than 300 feet from Richmond Middle/High School. Berry's district includes Richmond.
In its application, 150 Main LLC has proposed converting 30,000 square feet of vacant industrial space into a secure marijuana grow facility that would be sectioned off and leased to individual caregivers.
The law will expire July 1, 2018, but Berry said Thursday that the Legislature's special Marijuana Legalization Implementation Committee is expected to take on several marijuana-related bills in the next legislative session, including one to make the temporary restriction on growers permanent.
"This is the same approach we take with respect to other land-use compatibility and planning issues," Berry said. "This is a new thing for Maine, that the law doesn't give municipalities the authority which they have in other areas like retail sales or industrial uses."
The law doesn't affect any facility that's already in place, including the one planned for Richmond.
Catherine Lewis, president of Medical Marijuana Caregivers of Maine, a trade association geared to supporting and promoting safe access to medical marijuana for patients and caregivers, said she's not sure that proximity to schools is a big concern among her group's members.
"They are all under the assumption there was a limit," Lewis said. "They assumed it was already the case."
Her organization does not oppose giving cities and towns the power to restrict where caregiver growing facilities can operate.
"We just don't want to see patient access restricted, and they are not going to caregiver facilities anyway," she said. Jessica Lowell can be contacted at 621-5632 or at: jlowell@centralmaine.com Twitter: JLowellKJ

Texto completo: Valley News Staff Writer
Bradford — A two-story clapboard house across from Oxbow High School was destroyed in an apparent explosion around 6:30 p.m. on Thursday, drawing firefighters from several area towns.
First responders confirmed that the homeowner, a woman in her early 60s named Marianne O’Malley, lives there alone and is out of town.
No injuries have been reported.
Firefighters as of Thursday night did not know what caused the explosion, which ripped open the house at 486 Upper Plain Road — also known as Route 5 — but left it partly standing, and which did not result in a long-lasting fire.
“Other than the obvious — that it blew up — we don’t know yet,” safety officer and former fire Chief Gary Moore, of West Newbury, Vt., said on the scene.
Dan Perry III, a former fire chief who lives across the street from the wrecked house, called in the blast shortly after it happened, around 6:30 p.m., while he was on the way out of his own home.
“I walked outside, then I heard ‘kaboom’ — it was as simple as that,” he said, describing the sound as something akin to a car crash.
There were no flames, but the building was torn open, with the roof sagging down toward an exposed corner facing the street. An ell in back appeared to have collapsed, and debris covered a pickup truck in the driveway.
In his 26 years as a firefighter, Perry said, he hadn’t seen anything like it.
Soon after the explosion, Perry went over to the house and turned off the line to an outside propane tank that had begun to leak. The house itself was structurally unsound and unsafe to enter, firefighters said, and Moore noted that the tank wasn’t necessarily the cause — the explosion could well have severed the line, he said.
Emergency workers initially were unsure whether or not O’Malley was at home, given that her truck was parked there, and made calls in the following hours to family members and friends. A search-and-rescue squad also was called to comb through the wreckage.
Moore said the authorities eventually got in touch with O’Malley in Maine, where she was on vacation.
Traffic was stopped in both directions on Route 5 as of 9 p.m., but was reopened shortly before 11:30 p.m. Emergency workers said they planned on being at the scene for quite a while.
“It’s going to be a real long night,” Moore said.

Texto completo: Valley News Staff Writer
Bedford, n.h. — Reed Winter has a little bit more to prove when he and two of his teammates represent Hanover High at tonight’s sixth CHaD East-West High School Football All-Star Game at Saint Anselm College’s Grappone Stadium.
First, Winter is an NHIAA Division II athlete on West squad comprised mostly of D-I talent. Second, he’s representing a Marauders program that not many people pegged for a playoff berth last fall. Hanover surprised most by going 8-1 in the regular season.
Winter is looking to surprise some more in the showcase.
“I absolutely did not expect (to get selected),” Winter said at West’s practice on Wednesday afternoon at Bedford High. “At Hanover, we were really hoping for a winning season. We got much more than that.
“It’s a huge honor and a great privilege. It’s for a great cause,” he added. “To be recognized as one of the best seniors in the state, it’s awesome. And just to get another chance to play is awesome.”
The East-West game, a swan song for New Hampshire’s outgoing senior football players, has become a major fundraiser for the Children’s Hospital at Dartmouth, bringing in more than $1 million in the last four years to help support CHaD programs. Athletes are handpicked by West head coach Jim Schubert, longtime football coach at Manchester Central, and Craig Kozens, head coach at Laconia High.
As of Wednesday night, the game raised $213,259 toward the cause.
“We’re raising money for kids that are not probably ever going to play this game. That’s number one,” Schubert said. “But that doesn’t take away the will to win for these kids. They’re all all-state players; they’re all select players. They’re the best of the best.
“When it comes to the kids, they get it,” he added. “They get what they’re there for.”
Schubert admitted there’s only so much his coaching staff can do in five days of practice ahead of the contest. On paper, West’s offense is littered with Upper Valley talent.
Winter, who is playing football at Iowa’s Grinnell College in the fall, led the Marauders with 13 touchdowns and rushed for 698 yards in eight games before being sidelined with an ankle injury. Lebanon’s Ryan Milliken led all Upper Valley athletes with 22 touchdowns and was second in the region with 1,315 rushing yards in 10 games. Parker Smith, from D-III title-winning Stevens High, led all Upper Valley receivers with 56 catches, 1,134 receiving yards and 14 touchdowns.
Smith admitted he was surprised he got the call before Wednesday’s practice. Smith, who plans to play football this autumn at Maine’s Bates College, helped the Cardinals win their first title since 1968 last November.
“It’s pretty humbling because I get to see the best players in New Hampshire,” Smith said. “But, at the same time, I want to do my best to represent the city of Claremont and show everyone, just because I come from a small school. … I still feel like, just because we come from a small school, we can also compete at any level. I’ve been trying to prove that throughout the week.”
Selecting Milliken, one of the more dynamic running backs in the state, came as less of a surprise. But practicing on an all-star squad with plenty of D-I guys has changed the speedy running back’s perspective before he heads off to Springfield (Mass.) College.
“It’s been interesting. It’s definitely different,” Milliken said. “Just the way practice is run. … We definitely don’t run as much as I thought we would. The play-calling is way different. We’ve got big linemen, more for a power running back. As you see, I’m not that big of a guy. But I enjoy it. You’re meeting new kids, which is definitely fun.”
Being able to help the cause, Milliken said, was most important.
“It’s definitely an honor, playing for CHaD, playing for the kids,” he said.
Hanover lineman Schuyler Cyrus and wide receiver Cameron Marshall are also on the West squad.
Kickoff is 7 p.m. tonight.
For Milliken, Smith and Winter, football has been a big part of their lives. Smith, who said he entered high school favoring basketball, called football “the money-maker.” Winter said football taught camaraderie and life lessons he wouldn’t have been exposed to otherwise. For Milliken, it’s an avenue to succeed.
“(Football) definitely means a lot,” Milliken said. “I want to go further and further with it.”
An exhibition like the East-West Game is a different experience for accomplished athletes. The cause makes it worthwhile, but it also answers some what-if questions for athletes wondering what it would be like to play on the same team as some of their more talented opponents.
“It’s been interesting to get to know everybody in a group of three divisions,” Winter said. “That’s been the first thing. Once that awkwardness went away, it’s been really great. I’ve made a lot of new friends.
“It’s definitely cool with Ryan (Milliken) and some of the best players we’ve played against, that’s really cool to put it all together to see what we can do with all that talent.”

Born Oct. 31, 1931, she was the daughter of Walter and Alice (Leary) O’Neill of Belmont, Mass. Maureen graduated from Belmont High School in 1948 and Framingham State Teachers’ College in 1952. She then taught elementary school in Lexington, Mass. and Oakland, Calif.
Maureen met her future husband working summers in Ogunquit, Maine. She married Marquand S. Ransom of Frankfort, Ind. on July 24, 1954. They moved to Indiana where Maureen taught school and completed her Master of Education from Indiana University, Bloomington in 1962 while raising three small children.
Maureen and her family spent several years living in England and Mexico offering her the opportunity for much European travel.
In 1996, after living in Scituate, Mass. for 27 years, Maureen and her husband retired to the Eastman community in Grantham becoming active in various community activities and committees. Maureen was a member of the Grantham school board, spent 12 years as an AARP tax preparation volunteer, and served on multiple Eastman committees.

U.S. News: State Budget Battles Heat Up as Deadline Draws Closer

Texto completo: Showdowns over state budgets are coming down to the wire around the country as lawmakers struggle to hash out issues such as education funding and taxes while, in some cases, trying to ward off state shutdowns.
The flurry of 11th-hour negotiating reflects the underlying revenue weakness that has broadly dogged states in the past two years and inflamed debates over how to spend limited resources, according to budget experts.
Maine's Gov. Paul LePage has threatened to shut down the state for the first time since 1991 over disagreements on taxes. In Connecticut, Gov. Dannel Malloy is preparing deep spending cuts as an agreement before Friday night appears elusive. All but four states start their next fiscal year on Saturday, and legislatures in 11 of those states had yet to finalize a budget as of Wednesday, according to the National Association of State Budget Officers.
"It's not untypical to wait to the end. What's untypical is the degree of crisis that we're seeing in terms of not being able to make the budget balance," said Elizabeth McNichol, senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. She noted this kind of stress in budget negotiations is more common during a downturn.
The lengthy budget processes may be another sign that states are on an unusually rocky fiscal road despite being eight years into an economic recovery. A recent Nasbo analysis of governors' spending proposals for the coming fiscal year showed they were aiming for just a 1% increase in general-fund spending, the smallest rise since fiscal 2010.
Nowhere are the budget pressures greater than in Illinois, which faces a possible debt downgrade to junk status and hasn't had a budget for two years. The two-year budget stalemate has resulted in a nearly $15 billion backlog in unpaid bills. Gov. Bruce Rauner has told lawmakers he will keep them in session beyond Friday's deadline if they fail to agree on a balanced budget.
Some states are finding a way forward. Washington state lawmakers Wednesday reached the outline of a deal that would avert a partial government shutdown.

Report offers look into shutdown effects

Texto completo: AUGUSTA -- Gov. Paul LePage says he is prepared to shut down Maine's government to protect the state.
He has threatened to do that by waiting the 10 days he's allowed by law to veto a state budget bill if it doesn't meet his demands to offset an increase in the lodging tax without a sufficient cut in the income tax -- despite his own previous proposals to raise the lodging tax.
The Legislature, which has been meeting since January, is struggling to overcome deep partisan divisions over education spending and taxes and forge a $7 billion budget that both Democrats and Republicans can support.
Lawmakers need to pass the budget by a two-thirds margin -- not only to get a spending plan passed at this late date in the legislative session, but also to override LePage's threatened veto.
Time is not on their side.
Under the Maine Constitution, state government must shut down at 12:01 a.m. Saturday, the close of the fiscal year, if a budget hasn't been passed by the Legislature and signed by the governor.
On Thursday, the LePage administration issued preliminary information about what a state government shutdown would look like. Here is what is known:
State ferries will continue to run to the islands. No information was available about ongoing road and highway construction projects. However, Associated General Contractors of Maine is telling members to prepare to stop work starting Monday. CEO Matt Marks said a shutdown would delay construction on current projects.
Some contractors are worried they will not get paid for work they've already completed, and bidding on new jobs might be pushed back, he said. A prolonged shutdown could jeopardize entire projects, Marks said, especially in the case of bridge work that has specific work windows. "Any day we lose, especially if it is a nice day, is going to be very difficult to catch up on," he said.
Maine State Police will continue to patrol state highways, the Maine Warden Service will be on duty in the woods and waters, marine patrol officers will be on the clam flats and the drug enforcement agency will be on the job. Staffing also will be maintained at the state's prisons and in the Department of Corrections.
The state was working to pre-load money on debit cards used for public assistance programs such as food stamps and Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, so that beneficiaries will not be without money during the shutdown, LePage said in an interview. The state's two secure psychiatric hospitals, the Riverview Psychiatric Center in Augusta and the Dorothea Dix Psychiatric Center in Bangor, will continue to operate. No information was available on whether child protective services workers, or staff who process Medicaid or other benefit applications would be on the job in the Department of Health and Human Services.
Legal advocates for low-income Mainers filed suit in federal court Thursday seeking to ensure welfare benefits continue to flow in the event of a shutdown. The lawsuit seeks a temporary restraining order against LePage and Maine's DHHS requiring the department to continue issuing benefits as well as receiving and processing applications for MaineCare, food stamps and TANF.
Applying for a driver's license or taking a license examination or road test for new drivers will not be possible. All Bureau of Motor Vehicles offices statewide will close, as will the bureau's headquarters in Augusta. Most of the bureau's online services, including license renewals, will be working, but online permits for overweight or oversized vehicles will not be available.
Two other bureaus overseen by the Department of the Secretary of State; the Maine State Archives; and the Bureau of Corporations, Elections and Commissions, will be closed.
About half of the state's courthouses will stay in business, with at least one court in each county open during regular business hours. But the courts will limit their activities largely to public safety issues, criminal matters and child protection cases. Civil and traffic violation cases be postponed.
The courts will not be able to accept online payments for traffic tickets or court fines because court staff members will be unavailable to revoke arrest warrants previously issued for failure to pay fines. The Bureau of Motor Vehicles will not be open to reinstate drivers' licenses once fines are paid.
The state's parks and historic sites will remain open, including Baxter State Park. The state has not specified whether lifeguards, rangers or other park and historical site staff will be on duty.
It was unclear which, if any, business and professional licenses would be available or whether the state's Department of Environmental Protection, would be open to issue environmental permits. The agencies that handle those functions were not included on LePage's initial list of services, although a spokesman for the governor said several areas, including food and dairy inspectors, were still being reviewed.
The Maine Wildlife Park in Gray and the Swan Island campground and historic grounds on the Kennebec River in Richmond will remain open. But it remained unclear whether fishing and hunting licenses would be made available for purchase or renewal, either online or from private vendors, which sell those licenses for the state.
The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry firefighters will remain on duty on an on-call basis. Other functions of the department were left undetermined on Thursday.
LePage's initial list did not include any of the services, including applications for unemployment insurance that are handled through the Maine Department of Labor.
A shutdown will leave thousands of state workers without a job and without pay. Even those who are deemed essential will be working on trust and without pay until a new budget is in place. With about 12,000 employees, state government is one of the largest employers in Maine.
"It's a sad situation," LePage told television reporters. "And the people who are going to work are going to be working without pay because there's no money to pay them."
The Maine Credit Union League said many of the state's 58 credit unions would be offering special low or no-interest loans or skip-a-payment options on car loans or mortgages as a way to help state employee members.
LePage also acknowledged the shutdown would be a hardship on the public. "Government is going to be shut down, so it's not going to be business as usual," LePage said. "Agencies are going to be shut down. There's not going to be anybody answering the phones."

Texto completo: HINCKLEY -- The Maine Academy of Natural Sciences has received a $5,600 grant from the Western Mountains Fund of the Maine Community Foundation to purchase laptops for its Threshold Program, according to a news release from foundation.
Threshold is a new program that will commence this September as a part of Maine's first charter high school, MeANS. The program will allow those that are pregnant, parenting or suffering from emotional/physical challenges, that make it difficult to attend school, an opportunity to re-engage with their education and earn their high school education.
Laptops will play a vital role in their learning, because most of the work and communications will come from the student's home. A teacher will visit participating students weekly and provide them the resources needed to pursue their high school education.
"We are very excited to get Threshold going as there is a tremendous need for a program of this kind in our area," said Emanuel Pariser, program designer, according to the release.

Texto completo: AUGUSTA -- Gov. Paul LePage says he is prepared to shut down Maine's government to protect the state.
He has threatened to do that by waiting the 10 days he's allowed by law to veto a state budget bill if it doesn't meet his demands to offset an increase in the lodging tax without a sufficient cut in the income tax -- despite his own previous proposals to raise the lodging tax.
The Legislature, which has been meeting since January, is struggling to overcome deep partisan divisions over education spending and taxes and forge a $7 billion budget that both Democrats and Republicans can support.
Lawmakers need to pass the budget by a two-thirds margin -- not only to get a spending plan passed at this late date in the legislative session, but also to override LePage's threatened veto.
Time is not on their side.
Under the Maine Constitution, state government must shut down at 12:01 a.m. Saturday, the close of the fiscal year, if a budget hasn't been passed by the Legislature and signed by the governor.
On Thursday, the LePage administration issued preliminary information about what a state government shutdown would look like. Here is what is known:
State ferries will continue to run to the islands. No information was available about ongoing road and highway construction projects. However, Associated General Contractors of Maine is telling members to prepare to stop work starting Monday. CEO Matt Marks said a shutdown would delay construction on current projects.
Some contractors are worried they will not get paid for work they've already completed, and bidding on new jobs might be pushed back, he said. A prolonged shutdown could jeopardize entire projects, Marks said, especially in the case of bridge work that has specific work windows. "Any day we lose, especially if it is a nice day, is going to be very difficult to catch up on," he said.
Maine State Police will continue to patrol state highways, the Maine Warden Service will be on duty in the woods and waters, marine patrol officers will be on the clam flats and the drug enforcement agency will be on the job. Staffing also will be maintained at the state's prisons and in the Department of Corrections.
The state was working to pre-load money on debit cards used for public assistance programs such as food stamps and Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, so that beneficiaries will not be without money during the shutdown, LePage said in an interview. The state's two secure psychiatric hospitals, the Riverview Psychiatric Center in Augusta and the Dorothea Dix Psychiatric Center in Bangor, will continue to operate. No information was available on whether child protective services workers, or staff who process Medicaid or other benefit applications would be on the job in the Department of Health and Human Services.
Legal advocates for low-income Mainers filed suit in federal court Thursday seeking to ensure welfare benefits continue to flow in the event of a shutdown. The lawsuit seeks a temporary restraining order against LePage and Maine's DHHS requiring the department to continue issuing benefits as well as receiving and processing applications for MaineCare, food stamps and TANF.
Applying for a driver's license or taking a license examination or road test for new drivers will not be possible. All Bureau of Motor Vehicles offices statewide will close, as will the bureau's headquarters in Augusta. Most of the bureau's online services, including license renewals, will be working, but online permits for overweight or oversized vehicles will not be available.
Two other bureaus overseen by the Department of the Secretary of State; the Maine State Archives; and the Bureau of Corporations, Elections and Commissions, will be closed.
About half of the state's courthouses will stay in business, with at least one court in each county open during regular business hours. But the courts will limit their activities largely to public safety issues, criminal matters and child protection cases. Civil and traffic violation cases be postponed.
The courts will not be able to accept online payments for traffic tickets or court fines because court staff members will be unavailable to revoke arrest warrants previously issued for failure to pay fines. The Bureau of Motor Vehicles will not be open to reinstate drivers' licenses once fines are paid.
The state's parks and historic sites will remain open, including Baxter State Park. The state has not specified whether lifeguards, rangers or other park and historical site staff will be on duty.
It was unclear which, if any, business and professional licenses would be available or whether the state's Department of Environmental Protection, would be open to issue environmental permits. The agencies that handle those functions were not included on LePage's initial list of services, although a spokesman for the governor said several areas, including food and dairy inspectors, were still being reviewed.
The Maine Wildlife Park in Gray and the Swan Island campground and historic grounds on the Kennebec River in Richmond will remain open. But it remained unclear whether fishing and hunting licenses would be made available for purchase or renewal, either online or from private vendors, which sell those licenses for the state.
The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry firefighters will remain on duty on an on-call basis. Other functions of the department were left undetermined on Thursday.
LePage's initial list did not include any of the services, including applications for unemployment insurance that are handled through the Maine Department of Labor.
A shutdown will leave thousands of state workers without a job and without pay. Even those who are deemed essential will be working on trust and without pay until a new budget is in place. With about 12,000 employees, state government is one of the largest employers in Maine.
"It's a sad situation," LePage told television reporters. "And the people who are going to work are going to be working without pay because there's no money to pay them."
The Maine Credit Union League said many of the state's 58 credit unions would be offering special low or no-interest loans or skip-a-payment options on car loans or mortgages as a way to help state employee members.
LePage also acknowledged the shutdown would be a hardship on the public. "Government is going to be shut down, so it's not going to be business as usual," LePage said. "Agencies are going to be shut down. There's not going to be anybody answering the phones."

Texto completo: Judge had called woman's request 'deceptive'
The Maine Supreme Judicial Court this week overruled a probate judge's decision denying a woman's request to change her last name, a request he said might make her appear to be married.
In strong terms, the state's high court said the judge's interpretation of a key part of the law on name changes would create "absurd results" and doesn't reflect how changes in society are affecting naming choices.
"Given the variety of naming conventions in modern society, having the same last name no more indicates that a couple is married than having a different last name indicates that a couple is unmarried," the justices wrote in a unanimous order sending the matter back to the Cumberland County Probate Court with instructions to approve the woman's name change request.
Carol Boardman, 62, of Standish, sought what she thought would be an easy name change. She had taken her husband's name when they married in 2000, but he died in 2013 and about a year ago Boardman was living with a partner and decided that she could use a "fresh start," beginning with a name change. Her partner, Charles Currier, suggested she choose his last name and Boardman liked the idea.
But when Boardman got in front of Cumberland County Probate Judge Joseph Mazziotti, what started out as a straightforward process turned out to be anything but.
When Boardman, in response to a question from the judge, said she and Currier were not married, Mazziotti balked.
"That presents a problem for me," he said, according to a transcript of the brief hearing on Aug. 18, 2016.
Mazziotti told Boardman that it was "OK" for her to seek a fresh start, but it would appear to anyone who met them that she and Currier were married and "that would be deceptive." Deception is one of the few criteria Maine judges can use to deny a name-change request.
The judge went on to explain that if Boardman sought to get credit, sign a lease or get access to records, it would be done "under the misapprehension that you were a married couple, but you're not."
When Mazziotti said he was denying her request to change her name, Boardman asked, "What am I supposed to do?"
"Get married. That's your solution, I'm afraid," Mazziotti said.
In his order denying the name change, Mazziotti wrote that Boardman "admits" that the name change "would give the public impression they are a married couple and thus a false impression." Boardman, however, said she didn't agree with Mazziotti's ruling or admit that the change would create a false impression.
Boardman said she was stunned by the judge's reasoning.
"He made some obvious assumptions that were not accurate," she said Wednesday, after the state's top court agreed with her. "It was absurd. Chuck and I went in there that day, thinking, 'Great, we'll celebrate tonight.' We walked out of there saying, 'What just happened?' I walked out of there stunned and said, 'Did he really just say that?'"
Boardman said she told James Mundy, a lawyer who had done some work for her, about the judge's denial, and he suggested appealing the decision.
"It seemed to me like a very normal thing to be seeking," Mundy said of the name change.
Mundy and his wife have a South Berwick law practice that handles mostly real estate matters and estate planning, but he dove into Boardman's appeal and found there have been few recent rulings on name changes in Maine, even while society has undergone seismic shifts.
"Changes in family structure are driving the name-change issue," he said. "It's an evolving area of the law, and there are constitutional implications over the power to control one's name."
The ACLU of Maine, the Boston-based GLBTQ Legal Advocates and Defenders, or GLAD, EqualityMaine and the Trans Youth Equality Foundation all signed on to the case and filed briefs on Boardman's behalf.
Mary Bonauto, a Portland attorney who is the civil rights project director for GLAD and has been a key figure in the national struggle over marriage equality, said names are integral to a person's identity, and her organization believes judges shouldn't have such broad discretion to decide the validity of a person's reasons for seeking a name change.
"People can order their families as they see fit," she said, and names are part of that ordering. Mazziotti's use of marriage -- or in this case, the lack of one -- as a reason to deny a name change seemed to be an overreach, Bonauto said.
"The marriage issue to us was a red herring," she said. "We thought the law was clear that you don't need to be married to change your name. Marriage doesn't enter the equation."
The Maine Women's Lobby didn't join the case, but Eliza Townsend, the executive director of the organization, said the Maine Supreme Judicial Court's ruling is heartening.
Deciding that a woman would need to get married before she could change her name seems like something out of a long-forgotten era, she said.
"The whole thing feels awfully dated," she said. "To assume that the last name is an indicator of your marital status is an awful lot to assume."
The court also chided Mazziotti for assuming that Boardman's name change request represented a deliberate deception. The court said there was no reason to assume Boardman was looking to deceive someone and noted that Maine law already bars discrimination on the basis of marital status, so she wouldn't have derived any benefit from appearing to be married in seeking housing or credit. And, the court said, unmarried domestic partners also have some legal protections regardless of their names, so she wouldn't have benefited by "appearing" to be married.
"We conclude that a person's potential misunderstanding of another person's marital status, without more, does not qualify as a fraud that precludes the otherwise liberal grant of name change petitions in Probate Court," the Supreme Court said in a summary of its decision.
Mazziotti did not return a message seeking comment.
Boardman, soon to be Carol Currier, said the broader societal issues really weren't a factor in her decision to launch an appeal, although she recognizes why other groups saw her case as important.
And in retrospect, she said, it could have been decided in that brief hearing nearly a year ago, avoiding a protracted appeal and major decision.
"I could have gone in there and lied and said, 'I picked the name out of a phone book,'" she said.

In Maine, a state shutdown looms

Texto completo: Ahead of an imminent government shutdown, a nonprofit legal-aid group filed a federal lawsuit Thursday against Maine Governor Paul LePage, seeking to force the state to continue operating welfare programs.
State government appears headed for an almost certain shutdown, beginning Friday at 11:59 p.m., because of a budget impasse between LePage and the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives. At the center of the dispute is whether to maintain a 3 percent tax surcharge on earnings above $200,000 that voters approved last year.
If state government shuts down, nearly 450,000 people who rely on public assistance programs — including MaineCare, food stamps, and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families — would be affected, argued Maine Equal Justice Partners, the organization suing the state.
The lawsuit says Maine is bound by federal law to distribute benefits in a timely fashion. It seeks a temporary restraining order to ensure that eligible citizens continue to receive government assistance.
“The failure to adhere to these unequivocal requirements places the Plaintiffs, who consist mostly of children, elderly, or disabled low-income individuals, at serious risk to their health and well-being," the motion said.
The suit seeks class-action status on behalf of such plaintiffs.
The governor designated a number of employees as “emergency personnel" on Thursday, including the State Police, Capitol Police, first responders, and correctional, psychiatric, and state parks staff. They would be expected to work during a shutdown.
But LePage's office did not address whether any efforts would be made to ensure that individuals applying for welfare benefits would get them. A number of agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services, declined to comment on plans for a shutdown and directed all questions to LePage's office.
Republican Senate leaders could not be reached for comment.
The silence sparked a wave of anxiety in Maine, particularly among those who rely on safety-net programs.
“We've been left in the dark," said Jack Comart, litigation director for Maine Equal Justice Partners.
Public employees were also largely clueless about how a shutdown would affect them. The governor said in a memo that he was “unable to answer at this time" whether employees would be paid for the July 4 holiday. While members of the state health plan would not be denied service, LePage said it was possible they'd be required to pay part or all of the insurance premiums due.
Some employees were told they would need to cancel previously approved vacations, said AFSCME union representative Jim Mackie. AFSCME's Maine office represents about 2,600 workers, many of whom have been designated emergency staff.
“The way the governor has handled this has been absolutely despicable, all these employees — we can't get a straight answer from anyone about what's going on," Mackie said.
The last time the state government shut down following a budget battle was in 1991, when John McKernan, also a Republican, was governor. Courthouses, state parks, and beaches closed for 16 days, and Mainers in the process of applying for MaineCare and food stamps were forced to wait.

Texto completo: WATERVILLE -- The city plans to put a $900,000 river walk project out to bid in August that will include a boardwalk, a children's play area, an amphitheater, a gazebo and a 900-foot long boardwalk with railings at Head of Falls near the Two Cent Bridge.
The RiverWalk Advisory Committee met Wednesday at City Hall with consultants from Mitchell & Associates landscape designers, of Portland, to continue finalizing plans.
The Waterville Rotary Club in 2015 donated $150,000 toward the project as a way to celebrate the club's centennial anniversary. City Manager Michael Roy, who heads the committee, said the city hopes to hire a contractor in September to do the work, some of which can be done this fall. Work would resume in the spring and the project would be completed in time for the Rotary Club to celebrate the opening September 22, 2018.
The city applied for a $300,000 grant from the Land and Water Conservation Fund managed by the National Park Service and was notified it was one of three municipalities in Maine to be approved for grant money. The funds would come through the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry and the city is awaiting final confirmation of funds.
Colby College donated $75,000 for the project; Waterville Development Corp. gave $50,000; Kennebec Messalonskee Trails, $15,000; and Inland Hospital, $10,000, according to Roy.
"We're going to design for a $900,000 project, hoping that we can raise the additional funds as we go forward," Roy said.
Committee members Wednesday said they want to move the "Ticonic" sculpture on The Concourse to Head of Falls to be part of the project there.
The sculpture was created by artist Roger Marjorowicz, of Whitefield, who died in 2015.
"I think the message from today's meeting is this committee is seriously interested in proposing to the City Council the relocation of the "Ticonic" sculpture to make it part of the river-walk project," Roy said.
The river walk development will include interpretive features, panels with historical information, a restroom and a lighted walkway. The rail and fence on the boardwalk will have features similar to those on the Two Cent Bridge.
Committee member Lisa Hallee talked about features of the park that could present naming opportunities, including the gazebo, the children's play area and the amphitheater. She said there could be an opportunity for lower-level donors to have names of their choice etched in granite pavers. It is not about the money so much as it is about being able to buy the pavers and having donors feel they can take ownership of the park, according to Hallee.
"People take real pride in that," she said. "It's a win-win. It may cost you some money to do the pavers, but it's a net gain."
Roy said during the meeting that the committee wants to light the Two Cent Bridge, though there is no definite plan yet for doing that.
"Can I put in a plug for LED lighting?" asked committee member Winifred Tate, who also is a city councilor.
The city several years ago installed water, sewer, electricity and parking at Head of Falls, which is off Front Street. The intention was to draw developers to the site and use part of it for green space and possibly an amphitheater, but that development did not occur.
However, the city in 2010 built a plaza west of the Two Cent Bridge that includes benches, an informational kiosk, walkway and landscaping. It is a popular place for people to sit and enjoy the Kennebec River, walk their animals, hike and bicycle.

A NEW AMERICAN SCULPTURE, 1914-1945: Lachaise, Laurent, Nadelman, and Zorach
HANS HOFMANN: Works on Paper
At Portland Museum of Art, 7 Congress Square, Portland, Maine, through Sept. 8 and Sept. 3, respectively. 202-775-6148, www.portlandmuseum.org
PORTLAND, Maine — “Stout" is not the word for Gaston Lachaise's sculptures of women. Each is a paragon of roundness, a consonance of curves. Each is dignity, ebulliently rendered.
His commanding bronze “Standing Woman," the finale of “A New American Sculpture, 1914-1945: Lachaise, Laurent, Nadelman, and Zorach," at the Portland Museum of Art, through Sept. 8, rises on her toes, lifts her arms. Her fingers, perhaps, flutter. Her chin is high. For all her mass — she is 6 feet tall — she floats.
The pleasing lines, curves, and volumes of “Standing Woman" exemplify American modernist sculpture during the interwar period. “A New American Sculpture" brings together four of its leading proponents, Lachaise, Robert Laurent, Elie Nadelman, and William Zorach.
These four artists defined a lyrical style that cohered with Art Deco — Laurent and Zorach have works at Radio City Music Hall — and with the clean lines and planes and pared down realism of modernist painters such as Georgia O'Keeffe and Marsden Hartley.
For Lachaise and Nadelman, this style took flight. Zorach and Laurent prioritized volume and material, and sometimes got stuck there.
In content, the show is merry, filled with acrobatics, family fondness, and Lachaise's buoyant women, modeled after his wife and muse, Isabel. At a time when Cubism was breaking figures and faces apart, Lachaise, Nadelman, Laurent, and Zorach committed to harmony.
All four, born in Europe, spent time in Paris during that city's crackling period of artistic fertility before World War I. Like many, they lapped up non-Western art, praising its presumed primitivism as essential and direct. One early Laurent, “Head (or Mask)," has the frontality of an African carving, the striated hair of a Japanese woodblock print, and the winsome features of a kittenish Renoir.
They contended with Auguste Rodin, their behemoth of a forefather, steering away from his emotional drama, his ropy musculature, his fingered surfaces. Instead, they sought calm and balance.
They rejected, too, Rodin's near-industrial workshop model — the artist had up to 50 assistants — and opted for an organic, hands-on relationship with material.
Once in America, these sculptors collected and took inspiration from American folk art and popular entertainment, such as burlesque, where they studied the lines and gestures of dancers.
Three of Nadelman's jaunty sculptures — “Dancer," “Chef d'Orchestre," and “Tango" — feature weathered wood and sparingly applied gesso, evoking folk art. The terrific “Tango," pregnant with implied movement, captures the dancers just before their bodies meet. The woman swivels; the viewer's eye cavorts.
Nadelman was a wizard with negative space. The tubular limbs of his subjects fly and curl. Where Lachaise's round women often defy gravity (“Two Floating Nude Acrobats"!), Nadelman's figures might spin in the wind.
Zorach and Laurent carved into wood or stone, seeking what it had to tell them. Their work is bulkier, of a piece, recalling pre-classical Greek or Egyptian sculpture. Their romance with direct carving leaves some of their art half-baked — chrysalises not fully emerged from their cocoons.
This approach can work with the right subject. Laurent carved into a long chunk of mahogany and found “Daphne," transforming herself into a tree as she flees Apollo. The lecherous god's hand grasps her ankle as she rises and begins to leap, in a piece charged with momentum and intrigue. But Laurent's “The Wave," an alabaster nude, feels trapped by the stone's shape.
Zorach's blocky style could be imposing, or thudding and congested. His mahogany “Mother and Child," less than 3 feet tall, feels monumental, daunting in the force of the figures' embrace. With more definition, more air, it might be tender. As it is, it's suffocating.
Lachaise, Laurent, Nadelman, and Zorach helped awaken the American public to modernism's attention to form. Complete abstraction nipped at their heels.
All four were contemporaries of German painter Hans Hofmann. Like them, he sojourned in Paris as the century's art was born, and later immigrated to the United States. But the harmonious objects in “A New American Sculpture" make a stunning contrast to the art in the taut, explosive “Hans Hofmann: Works on Paper," on view through Sept. 3. Here came Abstract Expressionism, like a tsunami.
Hofmann's first wife, Maria, called him “the embodiment of contradiction," and contradiction drove his art. He cranked up tensions between representation and abstraction, between geometric forms and organic ones, between color as surface and color as form.
The artist, a venerable teacher, can be a tetchy painter to get your arms around, always changing. He's best known for his late “slab" paintings of the 1960s, in which panes of color drift over active grounds, but he was always aggressively inventive, often theatrically colorful.
This show provides a remarkable primer. As works on paper — all relatively small drawings and paintings — it's a record of the artist in the act of seeing. It isn't all resolved. Much of it is on the fly: early sketches in ink of St. Tropez and California, or fleet, muscular, abstractions of Provincetown, studded with simple rooftops.
In an untitled work from 1943, blades of brilliant blue curve against heaving, yellow-red ones — they might be dunes, or sails. They contain those rooftops, sketched in black ink, as if sand, sun, and water are lifting and engulfing them. He uses tempera, watercolor, crayon, and ink — knowing the lush matte effect of the tempera, the slurry ramifications of watercolor. More tensions.
The show follows him through more than 50 years, from an early, soft landscape to his late airier, still-assertive works. A painting made in 1965, the year before he died, features vibrant blue blots against a ground warmed with breaths of yellow. Like his youthful landscape, it's quiet, but in its rhythms and contrasts, it holds so much more.

Texto completo: Kimberly Piccolo, 31, reported missing Thursday; seen asleep in her car at Tradewinds Market lot
CLINTON -- A Connecticut woman last seen in a parked car outside a small market in Clinton was reported missing by police on Thursday, and no one knows what compelled her to drive to Maine.
According to a post on the department's Facebook Page, Kimberly Piccolo, 31, of Connecticut, was discovered sleeping in her car at 7 p.m. Sunday at the Tradewinds Market on Hinckley Road. An officer and rescue personnel spoke with Piccolo, who reportedly said that she had fallen asleep and was waiting for friends to pick her up. She appeared to be in good condition and refused medical care. There was no probable cause to make her go for a medical evaluation.
Piccolo drives a silver Mazda 3 with Connecticut license plate number 926YOV.
Barbara Piccolo, Kimberly Piccolo's mother, said the family has no idea why Piccolo would drive the nearly 350 miles from her home in Westport, Connecticut, to Clinton. She said they've talked to her daughter's friends, and they can't find anyone she would have driven up to Maine to see.
"She just got in her car and drove," Barbara Piccolo said.
Piccolo's mother said she had just gotten into Portland around 2 p.m. Thursday, and they were searching for Kimberly. She said her apparent spur-of-the-moment drive to Maine was not at all something Kimberly would do.
"It's not in her character at all," her mother said.
Barbara Piccolo described her daughter as a "very professional, brilliant young lady," an educated person who usually kept everything together. But the mother said her daughter's behavior had been unusual last week. Kimberly Piccolo had been staying at her mother's for the previous three days and had been acting "paranoid" lately. While Kimberly has suffered anxiety in the past that she had taken medication for, Barbara Piccolo said that anxiety was nothing compared to the way her daughter had been acting.
"She was acting like she thinks somebody's watching her," Barbara Piccolo said, adding that the behavior included constantly checking to make sure doors were locked and window shades were drawn.
Barbara Piccolo said her daughter had a friend who lived in Portland at one time, but that friend moved away some time ago.
"I'm just thinking maybe she was distraught, got in her car and drove," she said. "It doesn't make sense, and that's what makes it worse."
While Kimberly Piccolo was not taking medication at the time, Barbara Piccolo thought maybe she should have been.
"Even her anxiety in the past was nothing like this past week," she said.
Barbara Piccolo said her daughter left her house at 7 a.m. Sunday, taking only her pocketbook and the car she drove away in. She left all her clothes behind and didn't have much money.
"It's so weird that she would just drive up here and sleep in her car," Barbara said. "None of it makes sense."
Clinton police Chief Rusty Bell said his agency has been in contact with the Police Department in the Piccolos' area. He said Clinton police have reviewed surveillance video from the Tradewinds store and have a complete timeline from when police spoke with Piccolo to when she left around 8:40 p.m.
Bell said Connecticut police are working to "ping" Piccolo's phone to determine its location. This can mean sending a phone a message, and having it respond with requested data. It also might mean locating the phone by identifying the cell tower that received the last signal from the phone. Piccolo's phone is currently off, but pinging it will determine where she last used it.
When Piccolo left the market, Bell said, she turned right, which leads police to believe she was heading toward Interstate 95. They have no way of knowing yet if she went north or south, but Bell said police don't have any reason to believe she is still in Clinton.
"She has no connection to Clinton," Bell said.
In the video, Piccolo was last seen wearing a green and white jacket. Bell said she appeared healthy in the video, getting out of the car a few times and going into the store. No one came to meet Piccolo during the length of the video. When she was checked out by the officer and rescue team, she appeared all right. At the time an officer met with her, Piccolo had not been reported missing.
Bell said another cause for concern was that Piccolo is supposed to be in a wedding party Friday, and no one in the party had heard from her.

Texto completo: HINCKLEY -- The Maine Academy of Natural Sciences has received a $5,600 grant from the Western Mountains Fund of the Maine Community Foundation to purchase laptops for its Threshold Program, according to a news release from foundation.
Threshold is a new program that will commence this September as a part of Maine's first charter high school, MeANS. The program will allow those that are pregnant, parenting or suffering from emotional/physical challenges, that make it difficult to attend school, an opportunity to re-engage with their education and earn their high school education.
Laptops will play a vital role in their learning, because most of the work and communications will come from the student's home. A teacher will visit participating students weekly and provide them the resources needed to pursue their high school education.
"We are very excited to get Threshold going as there is a tremendous need for a program of this kind in our area," said Emanuel Pariser, program designer, according to the release. Principal Tonya Arnold said, "I am thrilled to be able to offer more opportunities to more students, this is what MeANS is all about," according to the release.
Ten students have been accepted into the program to date and there are 10 more positions available. For more information or to receive a brochure, contact Lisa Sandy, director of admissions, at lsandy@gwh.org or 234-4034.
The Maine Community Foundation works with donors and other partner to improve the quality of life for all Maine people. To learn more about the foundation, visit www.mainecf.org.

Texto completo: Kimberly Piccolo, 31, reported missing Thursday; seen asleep in her car
CLINTON -- A Connecticut woman last seen in a parked car outside a small market in Clinton was reported missing by police on Thursday, and no one knows what compelled her to drive to Maine.
According to a post on the department's Facebook Page, Kimberly Piccolo, 31, of Connecticut, was discovered sleeping in her car at 7 p.m. Sunday at the Tradewinds Market on Hinckley Road. An officer and rescue personnel spoke with Piccolo, who reportedly said that she had fallen asleep and was waiting for friends to pick her up. She appeared to be in good condition and refused medical care. There was no probable cause to make her go for a medical evaluation.
Piccolo drives a silver Mazda 3 with Connecticut license plate number 926YOV.
Barbara Piccolo, Kimberly Piccolo's mother, said the family has no idea why Piccolo would drive the nearly 350 miles from her home in Westport, Connecticut, to Clinton. She said they've talked to her daughter's friends, and they can't find anyone she would have driven up to Maine to see.
"She just got in her car and drove," Barbara Piccolo said.
Piccolo's mother said she had just gotten into Portland around 2 p.m. Thursday, and they were searching for Kimberly. She said her apparent spur-of-the-moment drive to Maine was not at all something Kimberly would do.
"It's not in her character at all," her mother said.
Barbara Piccolo described her daughter as a "very professional, brilliant young lady," an educated person who usually kept everything together. But the mother said her daughter's behavior had been unusual last week. Kimberly Piccolo had been staying at her mother's for the previous three days and had been acting "paranoid" lately. While Kimberly has suffered anxiety in the past that she had taken medication for, Barbara Piccolo said that anxiety was nothing compared to the way her daughter had been acting.
"She was acting like she thinks somebody's watching her," Barbara Piccolo said, adding that the behavior included constantly checking to make sure doors were locked and window shades were drawn.
Barbara Piccolo said her daughter had a friend who lived in Portland at one time, but that friend moved away some time ago.
"I'm just thinking maybe she was distraught, got in her car and drove," she said. "It doesn't make sense, and that's what makes it worse."
While Kimberly Piccolo was not taking medication at the time, Barbara Piccolo thought maybe she should have been.
"Even her anxiety in the past was nothing like this past week," she said.
Barbara Piccolo said her daughter left her house at 7 a.m. Sunday, taking only her pocketbook and the car she drove away in. She left all her clothes behind and didn't have much money.
"It's so weird that she would just drive up here and sleep in her car," Barbara said. "None of it makes sense."
Clinton police Chief Rusty Bell said his agency has been in contact with the Police Department in the Piccolos' area. He said Clinton police have reviewed surveillance video from the Tradewinds store and have a complete timeline from when police spoke with Piccolo to when she left around 8:40 p.m.
Bell said Connecticut police are working to "ping" Piccolo's phone to determine its location. This can mean sending a phone a message, and having it respond with requested data. It also might mean locating the phone by identifying the cell tower that received the last signal from the phone. Piccolo's phone is currently off, but pinging it will determine where she last used it.
When Piccolo left the market, Bell said, she turned right, which leads police to believe she was heading toward Interstate 95. They have no way of knowing yet if she went north or south, but Bell said police don't have any reason to believe she is still in Clinton.
"She has no connection to Clinton," Bell said.
In the video, Piccolo was last seen wearing a green and white jacket. Bell said she appeared healthy in the video, getting out of the car a few times and going into the store. No one came to meet Piccolo during the length of the video. When she was checked out by the officer and rescue team, she appeared all right. At the time an officer met with her, Piccolo had not been reported missing.
Bell said another cause for concern was that Piccolo is supposed to be in a wedding party Friday, and no one in the party had heard from her.

Texto completo: The latest from Gov. Paul LePage and lawmakers as budget negotiations continue as a state government shutdown looms.
AUGUSTA -- State budget negotiators reached a tentative deal late Thursday to eliminate a 3 percent tax surcharge on wealthy Mainers while funneling an additional $162 million to education, setting up crucial votes Friday just hours before a potential state government shutdown at midnight.
And a proposed 1.5 percentage point bump in Maine's lodging tax means the shutdown threat still looms large given Gov. Paul LePage's vow to delay a decision on any budget bill that contains tax increases.
"If they put a tax increase (in the budget), ready for a shutdown. End of story," LePage told a radio talk show Thursday morning. "I've told them since January, if you increase taxes without lowering the income tax, I will take my 10 days."
After weeks of stop-and-start negotiations, members of a special budget committee voted 5-1 Thursday to endorse a two-year, $7.1 billion budget plan. The proposal will go to the House and Senate for consideration late in the morning or early in the afternoon Friday. Legislative leaders will need two-thirds majorities in both chambers to even send it to LePage's desk - a potentially tall order for a budget containing deep concessions.
Some of the major compromises include:
n Eliminating the controversial 3 percent tax surcharge on earnings over $200,000 that voters approved last November to funnel more money to K-12 education.
n Allocating an additional $162 million to public schools, offsetting some of the estimated $320 million that will be lost by repealing the tax surcharge.
n Increasing the lodging tax from 9 percent to 10.5 percent.
"I think we did the very best that we could do to deliver a budget that people can vote on (Friday), and if it doesn't get us there, then we will be back at the table," House Speaker Sara Gideon, D-Freeport, said before the committee voted to support the compromise. The dissenting vote was cast by Rep. Tom Winsor, R-Norway, whose House Republican caucus has been closely aligned with LePage throughout the budget process.
SHUTDOWN A STRONG POSSIBILITY
The late hour of the compromise, combined with the governor's vow to take his time with the bill, strongly suggested that Maine could be headed toward its first shutdown since 1991. Back then, thousands of angry state workers filled the State House and Capitol grounds during boisterous protests that created a public relations nightmare during peak tourism season in Maine.
While the LePage administration took steps Thursday to mitigate potential impacts on tourists and Mainers - including plans to keep state parks and beaches open - the various parties already were assigning blame for a shutdown and the resulting economic damage.
"To not sign a 2/3 budget that will pass over his veto just for the show of shutting down government would be despicable," Maine Democratic Party chairman Phil Bartlett tweeted.
The governor, meanwhile, accused Democrats, labor unions, environmental groups and even Senate Republican leaders of trying to increase taxes.
"Look, a shutdown is necessary for the future of Maine. That's the way I look at it now," LePage told WGAN's Ken Altshuler and "Morning News" guest host Andy Smith. "It's about the future. You can't tax yourself to prosperity."
The challenge facing legislative leaders in both parties was evident late Thursday. Budget committee member Sen. Cathy Breen, D-Falmouth, expressed frustration that Senate Democrats "were left out when this final compromise" was negotiated by Gideon and Senate President Mike Thibodeau, R-Winterport. Several Democratic House members in the audience left the room with long faces, and House Republican members have pledged to oppose any tax increases.
Thibodeau, a conservative Republican who nonetheless has a frosty relationship with LePage, lamented that "politics in America have changed" and that compromise is harder when people are so passionate about their positions.
"This is an imperfect document," Thibodeau said. "If you are a Republican, I can tell you which lines to look to, to find fault. If you are a Democrat, I can also point you to the lines that you can look to, to find fault. Sometimes, they are the exact same lines."
STATE WORKERS FEELING STRESS
The Legislature voted Thursday morning to extend its session by five days to provide more time for lawmakers to negotiate and vote on a budget and, if necessary, vote on an override of a LePage veto. Meanwhile, thousands of state workers were bracing for the possibility that they will lose pay for an indeterminate period if the budget deal is unable to garner two-thirds support in both chambers, or if LePage holds the bill for up to 10 days.
Ramona Welton, president of the Maine State Employees Association SEIU Local 1989 union, said many workers are stressed as they worry about whether they will receive a paycheck in the coming weeks. Many workers also were still waiting to hear whether they would be among the "emergency" personnel who will be required to work during a shutdown, even though they would not get paid until after a state budget is enacted.
"There are a lot of questions and not a lot of answers at this point," Welton said.
For months, lawmakers have battled over the 3 percent income tax surcharge on earnings over $200,000. LePage and Republicans have insisted that any budget proposal repeal the surcharge, while Democrats have demanded that lawmakers replace some of the estimated $320 million in revenues the tax was expected to generate for schools. The compromise struck Thursday only gets Democrats halfway there, a point likely to come up in Friday's debate.
CONCESSIONS TOO UNPALATABLE?
Rep. Owen Casas, a Rockport independent serving his first term, is emblematic of the challenge facing leaders Friday.
Casas had strong concerns about the impacts of the 3 percent surcharge, but also opposed repealing a tax hike that voters approved via a ballot referendum that he said was very clearly written. Speaking hours before the compromise was unveiled, Casas said he feared Democratic negotiators had gone "too far, too fast" in response to Republican demands to roll back the surcharge.
"If you are trying to make it more palatable specifically to House Republicans and the governor, there is a risk you are going to lose a lot of House Democrats and a fiscally conservative independent that didn't like the 3 percent surtax," Casas said.
LePage's own two-year budget, unveiled in January, included a 1 percent increase in the lodging tax, and he has repeatedly called for broadening Maine's sales tax base to capture more dollars from tourists. Yet on Thursday, he threatened to take the full 10 days to veto a budget that increases the lodging tax without cutting the income tax.
"I'm not playing any more," LePage said on WGAN. "I have been talking to these people for six months. They have ignored, ignored, ignored. They are playing games, they are playing chicken at 100 mph. And I'll tell you something: You want to play chicken, let's play chicken."
All of the budget proposals currently pending with lawmakers would, in actuality, cut income taxes for wealthy Mainers, but there is disagreement about how to do that while also funneling more money toward K-12 education.
LePage's original budget proposal would have effectively eliminated the 3 percent tax surcharge while also moving Maine toward a flat income tax rate of 5.75 percent by 2020. That proposal has been rejected by lawmakers. Kevin Miller can be contacted at 791-6312 or at: kmiller@mainetoday.com Twitter: KevinMillerPPH

Texto completo: As the United States confronts global warming in the decades ahead, not all states will suffer equally. Maine may benefit from milder winters. Maine may benefit from milder winters. Florida, by contrast, could face major losses, as deadly heat waves flare up in the summer and rising sea levels eat away at valuable coastal properties. In a new study in the journal Science, researchers analyzed the economic harm that climate change could inflict on the United States in the coming century. They found that the impacts could prove highly unequal: states in the Northeast and West would fare relatively well, while parts of the Midwest and Southeast would be especially hard hit.
In all, the researchers estimate that the nation could face damages worth 0.7 percent of gross domestic product per year by the 2080s for every 1 degree Fahrenheit rise in global temperature. But that overall number obscures wide variations: The worst-hit counties -- mainly in states that already have warm climates, like Arizona or Texas -- could see losses worth 10 to 20 percent of G.D.P. or more if emissions continue to rise unchecked.
"The reason for that is fairly well understood: A rise in temperatures is a lot more damaging if you're living in a place that's already hot," said Solomon Hsiang, a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and a lead author of the study.
"You see a similar pattern internationally, where countries in the tropics are more heavily impacted by climate change," he said. "But this is the first study to show that same pattern of inequality in the United States."
The greatest economic impact would come from a projected increase in heat wave deaths as temperatures soared, which is why states like Alabama and Georgia would face higher risks while the cooler Northeast would not. If communities do not take preventative measures, the projected increase in heat-related deaths by the end of this century would be roughly equivalent to the number of Americans killed annually in auto accidents.
Higher temperatures could also lead to steep increases in energy costs in parts of the country, as utilities may need to overbuild their grids to compensate for heavier air-conditioning use in hot months. Labor productivity in many regions is projected to suffer, especially for outdoor workers in sweltering summer heat. And higher sea levels along the coasts would make flooding from future hurricanes far more destructive.
The authors avoided delving into politics, but they warned that "climate change tends to increase pre-existing inequality." Some of the poorest regions of the country could see the largest economic losses, particularly in the Southeast. That pattern would hold even if the world's nations cut emissions drastically, though the overall economic losses would be considerably lower.
Predicting the costs of climate change is a fraught task, one that has bedeviled researchers for years. They have to grapple with uncertainty involving population growth, future levels of greenhouse-gas emissions, the effect of those emissions on the Earth's climate and the economic damage higher temperatures may cause.
Previous economic models have been relatively crude, focusing on broad global impacts. The new study, led by the Climate Impact Lab, a group of scientists, economists and computational experts, took advantage of a wealth of recent research on how high temperatures can cripple the economy. And the researchers harnessed advances in computing to scale global climate models down to individual counties in the United States.
"Past models had only looked at the United States as a single region," said Robert E. Kopp, a climate scientist at Rutgers and a lead author of the study. "They missed this entire story of how climate change would create this large transfer of wealth between states."
There are still limitations to the study. It relies heavily on research showing how hot weather has caused economic losses in the past. But people may find novel ways to adapt to warmer temperatures, said Robert S. Pindyck, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was not involved with this study.
Urban planners could set up cooling centers during heat waves to help vulnerable people who lack air-conditioning, as France did after a heat wave killed 14,802 people in 2003. Farmers may adopt new crop varieties or shift planting patterns to cope with the rise in scorching heat.
Notably, the model also does not account for the effects of future migration within the United States. If Arizona becomes unbearable because of rising temperatures, more people may decide to move to states like Oregon or Montana. Such migration could reduce the country's overall economic losses, said Matthew E. Kahn, an economist at the University of California, Santa Cruz.
Other outside experts praised the study, but cautioned that it may have underestimated certain kinds of damages. Economic losses on the coasts could be far higher if ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland disintegrate faster than expected. And climate change could bring other calamities that are harder to tally, such as the loss of valuable ecosystems like Florida's coral reefs, or increased flows of refugees from other countries facing their own climate challenges.
The study also does not factor in how reduced labor productivity could compound over time, leading to slower rates of economic growth, said Frances C. Moore, a climate expert at the University of California, Davis.
The researchers at the lab plan to expand their model to include more possible impacts and provide a detailed view of what individual counties can expect, so policymakers can begin to prepare far in advance.
"That's the hope, that this research can help prevent many of these outcomes," said Trevor Houser, a co-author of the paper who helps direct the Climate Impact Lab. "If cities take action to prevent heat wave deaths by building cooling centers, then costs would be lower than we project. But I wouldn't see that as a failure of prediction -- that's a policy success."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump's Twitter outburst on Thursday -- a highly personal attack on MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski -- reignited the controversy over his crass comments about women that nearly immolated his candidacy last year, and it imperiled his legislative agenda by drawing condemnation from women he needs to enact it. Mr. Trump described Ms. Brzezinski, the co-host of "Morning Joe," as "low I.Q. Crazy Mika" and claimed she was "bleeding badly from a face-lift" during a social gathering at the president's resort in Florida in the weeks after last year's election.
Mr. Trump's invective threatened to further erode his support from women and independents, both among voters and on Capitol Hill, where he is in need of negotiating leverage for the stalled Senate health care bill.
"This has to stop," Senator Susan Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine who is a crucial vote on the legislation, posted in a Twitter message. She added, "We don't have to get along, but we must show respect and civility."
Ms. Collins is one of three female swing voters who expressed their distaste for the "Access Hollywood" tape released during the campaign showing Mr. Trump making lewd comments about women with whom he hoped to have an affair.
Christine Matthews, a Republican pollster who specializes in the views of female voters, said the president's use of Twitter to target a prominent woman was particularly striking, noting that he used only one derogatory word -- "psycho" -- to describe the show's co-host, Joe Scarborough, and the remainder of his limited characters to hit upon damaging stereotypes of women.
"He included dumb, crazy, old, unattractive and desperate," Ms. Matthews said.
"The continued tweeting, the fact that he is so outrageous, so unpresidential, is becoming a huge problem for him," she added. "And it is particularly unhelpful in terms of building relationships with female Republican members of Congress whose votes he needs for health care, tax reform, and infrastructure."
Republican leaders have adopted a strategy after such comments of condemning Mr. Trump, then backing him politically. It was unclear whether the vehemence of the latest attack would embolden members of his party to turn disdain into defiance.
"The president's tweets today don't help our political or national discourse and do not provide a positive role model for our national dialogue," said Oklahoma Senator James Lankford, a Republican.
"Please just stop," Senator Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican who opposed Mr. Trump's nomination, wrote on Twitter. "This isn't normal and it's beneath the dignity of your office."
Senior Republican leaders, including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate majority leader, cycled through what has become a familiar series of emotions and calculations after the Twitter post, according to staff members: a flash of anger, reckoning of possible damage and finally a determination to push past the controversy to pursue their agenda with all deliberate speed.
"Obviously, I don't see that as an appropriate comment," House Speaker Paul D. Ryan said during a Capitol Hill news conference.
Then he told reporters he wanted to talk about something else.
Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, demanded an apology, calling the president's Twitter posts "sexist, an assault on the freedom of the press and an insult to all women."
Ms. Brzezinski, who has questioned Mr. Trump's competence and mental state, was stunned by the attack, telling a close friend that "I really don't need this." Ms. Brzezinski's father, Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, a former national security adviser, died in May. Her mother, Emilie Benes Brzezinski, has suffered two heart attacks since he died, according to the friend.
The ties between Ms. Brzezinski, Mr. Scarborough, Mr. Trump and his family are long and complicated. The president and Mr. Scarborough had a friendly, bantering relationship until this year when it soured as Mr. Scarborough started to regularly challenge Mr. Trump's actions on air.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Projected Medicaid spending under a Senate Republican bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act would be 35 percent lower after two decades, the Congressional Budget Office said on Thursday in a new report, which detailed how Medicaid changes would cut more deeply as they go fully into force. The budget office analysis created a fresh challenge for Republican leaders as they tried to muster support for their bill, even as senators scattered to their home states for a 10-day July 4 recess. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, entertained a stream of senators on Thursday, trying to reach agreement on the contents of a revised bill.
But by the end of Thursday, Mr. McConnell's caucus still appeared far from a consensus, and it was unclear when a new version of the bill would be ready.
The nonpartisan budget office had already said that the bill would cut projected Medicaid spending 26 percent in 2026. "A large gap would grow between Medicaid spending under current law and under this bill," the new report said, and that gap would widen, so that federal Medicaid spending in 2036 would be more than a third lower under the bill than under the Affordable Care Act.
"That is going to cause a lot of harm, and that's one of my biggest concerns about the bill," Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and a crucial holdout on the bill, told CNN after the release.
For Republican leaders who say Medicaid spending is unsustainable, the findings might be seen as evidence that their policies would work. They want to put annual caps on Medicaid spending and roll back the expansion of the program, which has extended coverage to millions of people in 31 states.
But for Republican senators from some of those states, including Nevada, Ohio and West Virginia, the pain of those cuts may prove politically untenable.
Hoping to revive their repeal bill, Senate Republicans said on Thursday that they were seriously considering proposals to keep one of the law's taxes on high-income people while providing more money to combat the opioid epidemic and a new incentive for people to establish tax-free savings accounts for medical expenses. Ms. Collins said Republican leaders and Trump administration officials had agreed to $45 billion for an opioid treatment fund.
Republicans also said they were considering a proposal that would allow insurers to sell cheaper, less comprehensive health plans if they also offered at least one plan that complied with consumer protection standards like those in the Affordable Care Act.
The talk of leaving in place a tax on investment income was a big break from the House-passed health bill and from the Senate's approach.
"It's not equitable to have a situation where you're increasing the burden on lower-income citizens and lessening the burden on wealthy citizens," said Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee. "That's not a proposition that is sustainable, and I think leadership knows that."
But for every concession made to one senator, another senator seemed to balk.
"We pledged that we would repeal Obamacare. I don't remember anybody going around saying, 'Oh, except for these job-killing tax increases,"' Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, said of the talk of leaving the investment tax increase in place. "So I expect that we'll be repealing all of the taxes in Obamacare."
The negotiations themselves are attracting controversy, and personal strains are showing.
Mr. McConnell dressed down Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, this week over his resistance to Medicaid cuts. Senate Republicans bristled after an outside group tied to Mr. Trump went after one of their own for opposing the bill, Senator Dean Heller of Nevada. Adding to the insult, one of the top officials of that group, Nick Ayers, was named Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff on Thursday -- after the blowup.
Democrats are also angry. For seven years, Republicans have denounced what they call corrupt deals made by Senate Democrats to buy votes for passage of President Barack Obama's health care bill.
The frantic wheeling and dealing among Republican senators on Thursday had more than a faint resemblance to the negotiations that led to adoption of the health care law in 2010.
"The slush fund is open," said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, referring to about $200 billion that could be available for deals in the Senate repeal bill. "Applicants can queue up and have a good chance of being treated favorably if they are from the right political party."
Mr. McConnell briefed senators on Thursday about possible changes in the repeal bill, but the broad agreement he had hoped for appeared elusive. He scrapped plans for a vote on the bill this week after he met broad resistance from Republican senators across the ideological spectrum.
Republicans were talking publicly on Thursday about keeping a tax on capital gains and other investment income, imposed by the Affordable Care Act on individuals with annual incomes exceeding $200,000 and couples making more than $250,000.
Mr. McConnell's bill would repeal that tax, like most other taxes in Mr. Obama's health care law. The Congressional Budget Office said that repealing the investment tax, retroactive to the start of this year, would cost the government $172 billion in lost revenue from 2017 to 2026.
Ms. Collins said, "I do not see a justification for doing away with the 3.8 percent tax" on certain investment income. She said the investment tax differed from other taxes in the Affordable Care Act, like an excise tax on medical devices, because those taxes can increase costs for consumers. "I distinguish between those tax increases that were part of Obamacare that increase premiums and the cost of health care versus those that don't," she said.
Mr. Corker said that the initial Senate bill would leave health care out of reach for many lower-income people and that keeping the tax on investment income would provide revenue that could be used to address that issue. The Congressional Budget Office said the bill could increase costs for low-income people to the point that "few low-income people would purchase any plan," even with financial assistance from the government.
The money for drug abuse treatment -- $45 billion over 10 years -- was meant to woo wavering Republicans from states hard hit by the opioid epidemic, including Mr. Portman and Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia.
But Senator Maggie Hassan, Democrat of New Hampshire, another state hit by the opioid crisis, said the additional money was "a drop in the bucket that would not come close to making up for the damage" that could be done by the bill's cuts in Medicaid.
The Congressional Budget Office said that over 10 years, Mr. McConnell's bill would cut more than $770 billion from projected spending under Medicaid, a program that pays for a large share of substance abuse treatment and prevention costs in many states.
Another proposal, championed by some conservatives, would allow people to use money in health savings accounts to pay premiums for insurance policies, not just medical expenses.
Christopher E. Condeluci, a former tax and benefits counsel at the Senate Finance Committee, said the change would make health savings accounts more attractive to people who could afford to put money into them. Such savings accounts have become more important, he said, as more Americans have high-deductible health plans, which require them to pay a larger share of their medical costs.
Senate Republicans are also considering a plan from Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, intended to create lower-cost insurance options. Under the proposal, if an insurer offered at least one plan that met certain federal requirements, offering benefits like maternity care and mental health services, it could also sell insurance policies that did not meet those standards.
Mr. Cruz says the proposal would allow consumers to buy policies they desire and can afford. But insurance experts see a risk that healthy people might sign up for the low-cost, less comprehensive policies, leaving sicker people in the more expensive plans. Republicans said there were ways to minimize that risk.

Texto completo: Corrections & Amplifications
Sen. Lisa Murkowski is a Republican representing Alaska. An earlier version of this article incorrectly used the abbreviation for the state of Alabama. (June 29, 2017)
President Donald Trump drew condemnation from members of his own party after he attacked a female cable news host over her appearance and intellect in a series of tweets Thursday morning.
In his tweets, the president said: "I heard poorly rated @Morning_Joe speaks badly of me (don't watch anymore). Then how come low I.Q. Crazy Mika, along with Psycho Joe, came. to Mar-a-Lago 3 nights in a row around New Year's Eve, and insisted on joining me. She was bleeding badly from a face-lift. I said no!"
The tweets refer to Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough, hosts of the MSNBC show "Morning Joe." The tweets came as the White House has been working to keep the focus on advancing Mr. Trump's policy goals, most notably a health-care bill.
One of the key voters on the health measure, Sen. Susan Collins (R., Maine), responded to Mr. Trump's tweets with one of her own.
"This has to stop--we all have a job--3 branches of gov't and media," Ms. Collins tweeted. "We don't have to get along, but we must show respect and civility."
Mr. Trump drew several other strongly worded rebukes from Republicans.
"Mr. President, your tweet was beneath the office and represents what is wrong with American politics, not the greatness of America," said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) in a tweet.
Sen. Ben Sasse (R., Neb.) tweeted: "Please just stop. This isn't normal and it's beneath the dignity of your office."
Democrats, who condemned Mr. Trump for his statements about women throughout last year's presidential campaign, joined in. "Trump's bullying tweets are an attack on women everywhere," said Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Adrienne Watson in a statement. "Trump has a long pattern of making demeaning, sexist and discriminatory comments about the women who take him on. The fact that they happen frequently doesn't make them OK."
It wasn't clear what Mr. Trump was reacting to, but his tweets came minutes after his social-media director, Dan Scavino, blasted Ms. Brzezinski and Mr. Scarborough, her fiancé, on Twitter.
Mr. Scavino tweeted: "#DumbAsARockMika and lover #JealousJoe are lost, confused & saddened since @POTUS @realDonaldTrump stopped returning their calls! Unhinged."
In a statement, MSNBC said: "It's a sad day when the president spends his time bullying, lying and spewing petty personal attacks instead of doing his job."
Ms. Brzezinski offered her own response via Twitter, posting an image of a Cheerios box showing a toddler reaching for a nugget of cereal with the caption "Made For Little Hands."
GOP lawmakers also expressed worry about the tweets' impact on civility in Washington and national politics, a central concern after a gunman shot a lawmaker and several others at a baseball practice this month.
In a statement, Sen. James Lankford (R., Okla.) cited the shooting and said: "The president's tweets today don't help our political or national discourse and do not provide a positive role model for our national dialogue."
Asked about the president's tweets during a morning news conference, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) said, "Obviously I don't see that as an appropriate comment." Pointing to his own efforts to improve civil discourse in politics, said the president's tweeting "obviously doesn't help do that."
First lady Melania Trump, whose main announced public initiative is to combat cyberbullying, issued a statement through her spokeswoman about the tweets.
"As the first lady has stated publicly in the past, when her husband gets attacked, he will punch back 10 times harder," said Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for the Mrs. Trump.
The White House defended the tweets. Deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Americans "knew what they were getting when they elected Donald Trump."
"He's not going to sit back and be attacked by the liberal media," she said. "When they hit him, he's going to hit back.
As Mrs. Huckabee Sanders was speaking, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R., Alaska), seen as another important vote on the health-care bill in the Senate, tweeted her opposition to the president's remarks.
"Stop it! The Presidential platform should be used for more than bringing people down," Ms. Murkowski said.
Mr. Trump's treatment of women played a significant role in the campaign, most notably when a decade-old recording emerged in which he spoke in crude sexual terms about women.
He also engaged in a long-running feud with TV anchor Megyn Kelly, after she pressed him in a televised debate on past insulting comments he had made about women.

How a Winter Sports World Champ Spends His Summer Vacation; Lowell Bailey won America's first biathlon world title; 'Huge in Oslo' but not so much in the U.S.

Texto completo: Five months ago, Lowell Bailey accomplished one of the rarest feats of any American athlete in recent years.
Bailey, a 35-year-old from Lake Placid, N.Y., won the world championship in biathlon's 20-kilometer competition, the first-ever world title for an American. He did it after more than a decade of only limited success on his sport's World Cup circuit and at an age when most competitors in his sport are getting worse, not better.
If Bailey were Norwegian, the triumph might get his face on billboards throughout Oslo, turn him into a national hero, and make him wealthy. But Bailey is from the U.S., where biathlon--a sport that combines target shooting and cross-country skiing--is the ultimate niche endeavor. He has led a decidedly un-Scandinavian existence since his signature win.
There were no parades in his hometown and adoring fans rarely interrupt the few dinners he can afford to eat out. He spent most of April in Montana, planning for a post-retirement job running a nonprofit Nordic sports center that he plans to take up full-time following next year's Olympics.
"I'm still waiting for Nike to call," Bailey said last week, while driving from his home in upstate New York to Maine for a board meeting of the U.S. Biathlon, for which he is an athlete representative.
Indeed, he hasn't signed a single additional sponsorship deal. He finances his pursuits with about $50,000 in prize money he won during the best year of his career; $25,000 a year from the U.S. Olympic Committee and the U.S. biathlon federation; and limited support from the Lake Placid Olympic Regional Development Authority, and equipment makers Rossignol and One Way. The U.S. team's apparel sponsor Adidas, gave him a performance bonus of nearly $10,000 and he earned about $15,000 in performance bonuses from the federation.
Bailey is already training full-time in pursuit of the first-ever U.S. Olympic medal in biathlon--the only winter Olympic sport in which the U.S. has never won a medal.
There is this consolation: In a Steph and Riley Curry-type moment, Bailey did an interview on Norwegian television after winning the world championship holding his then-eight-month old baby, Ophelia, who sucked on his medal. That video endeared him to that Nordic-sports obsessed country. Like an obscure indie rock band, Bailey is unknown in his home country, but "huge in Oslo."
Max Cobb, executive director of U.S. Biathlon, said the federation gets autograph requests for Bailey "from all over the world, but unfortunately not too many with American postage on them."
Biathlon presents one the most arduous tests in sports. Competitors have to survive torturous circuits on cross-country ski trails, then come flying into a shooting range and calm their breathing and heart rates enough to shoot five targets from 50 meters as thousands of fans scream from nearby bleachers. Missed targets result in humiliating laps around a penalty loop.
Bailey got into the sport when his parents moved from North Carolina to New York. As a teenager he excelled in cross-country skiing and got invited to a biathlon training camp in Lake Placid, site of the 1980 Olympics and one of the few world-class biathlon facilities in the U.S.
Two decades later, Bailey was supposed to be finished with biathlon after the 2015-16 season. He and his wife were expecting their first child last June. They purchased 70 head of cattle and planned to start a business on land near Lake Placid where his wife's family used to operate a bison farm.
Then Bailey got a call from a group looking for the right person to help develop the Crosscut Mountain Sports Center in Bozeman, Mont. The group was in the process of acquiring 500 acres for roughly $7 million to build a facility that will accommodate everything from Nordic sports, including an elite biathlon training center, to fat -tire mountain biking.
Bailey was the most prominent U.S. biathlete. His wife, Erika, had experience with land preservation and acquisition. If Bailey wanted to continue competing, the group told him he could begin part-time work during the off-seasons and start full-time after the 2018 Olympics. The perfect post-career landing spot had fallen into his lap. Bailey could take a run at his fourth Olympic team.
After Ophelia arrived last June 15, the Baileys decided they would stay together through the season, toting Ophelia, through Scandinavia, Russia, Eastern Europe and other World Cup outposts. Bailey felt more relaxed than ever. While he still cared desperately about his success, he didn't feel like his performances defined him.
"It was so much easier to let go of whatever happened," he said.
On February 16 in Hochfilzen, Austria, Bailey went 20 for 20 on the target range during a 20-kilometer race. He beat Ondrej Moravec of the Czech Republic by three seconds and Martin Fourcade of France, currently the best in the world, by 21.
There were plenty of celebratory messages from back home in Lake Placid, and some brief write-ups in national publications but little more attention than that.
Bailey returned home in late March. He spent April in Montana working on the sports center, letting his body rest up, and squeezing in some recovery training. For Bailey, that meant mountain trail runs of 90-120 minutes and the occasional kayaking expedition.
By May 1, he was back in Lake Placid to begin training for this Olympic season. Morning workouts last as long as three hours and can include roller skiing eight miles up Whiteface Mountain, or a workout that combines intervals of high-intensity roller-skiing and shooting. A two-hour afternoon workout of road cycling, trail running, and a strength workout follows.
Bailey remains hopeful that, as the Olympics approach, some blue-chip company will want to attach itself to his recent triumph and the hopes for a first U.S. biathlon medal--or even to the team itself, which has no title sponsor. If none of that happens, he says he will remain thankful for the rewards of 2017.
"It's the idea that you worked your whole life for something and finally achieved it," he says. "It's the knowledge that all of the work paid off."

Texto completo: On Monday, the Rolston String Quartet comes to the Bowdoin International Music Festival in Brunswick, Maine, with a program including R. Murray Schafer's String Quartet No. 2 (“Waves"). The classical repertoire is full of water music — with probably the most common evocation being that of the ocean — but Schafer's quartet is something else: strikingly different in sound from other musical portrayals of water, and yet inspired by an unusually deep study of the sonic qualities of the sea. The work represents an artistic expression of one of Schafer's longstanding concerns and fascinations: the ecology of sound.
Beginning in the late 1960s, while teaching at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, Schafer — already a composer of extraordinary, tenacious, and, at times, controversial individuality — began to investigate the increasingly inescapable presence of ambient sound in modern life, from sounds of nature to industrial noise to the hum of electricity to the wallpaper of Muzak. In 1971, Schafer and a band of similarly-interested colleagues started the World Soundscape Project, an attempt to make sense out of the modern sonic topography through cataloguing, analysis, and, most of all, close and discerning listening.
The String Quartet No. 2 grew out of the Soundscape Project's analytic approach. Schafer and his fellow investigators gathered data on the way waves rolled onto both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, finding that, while their sounds varied, their periods were intriguingly consistent, the waves almost always arriving every six to 11 seconds. Schafer borrowed that rhythm for the structure of his quartet: six-to-11-second phrases, the textures ranging widely, but constantly flowing into each other. The aim is less descriptive than elemental. In his 1977 book “The Tuning of the World," Schafer began his survey of the Soundscape with the sea, with water, the “first sound heard," whether at the dawn of life on the planet or of individual consciousness in the womb: “It is the fundamental of the original soundscape and the sound which above all others gives us the most delight in its myriad transformations."
Whether in his research or his music, Schafer has always pursued a more active awareness and, if necessary, superintendence of our sonic environment. In “The Tuning of the World," he put the stakes thus: “[I]s the soundscape of the world an indeterminate composition over which we have no control, or are we its composers and performers, responsible for giving it form and beauty?" Schafer would have each of us help orchestrate the world.
The Rolston Quartet performs music of Schumann, Schafer, and Beethoven, July 3, 7:30 p.m., Bowdoin College's Studzinski Recital Hall, 12 Campus Road South, Brunswick, Maine. Tickets $45. 207-373-1400, www.bowdoinfestival.org

Tiny ticks, big trouble

Texto completo: Planning that camping trip into the woods or along rivers? Be sure tick bite prevention is part of your plan.
Ticks carry the bacteria responsible for some 15 different illnesses, some of which are downright deadly.
Most of the illnesses can be treated with antibiotics with few lingering side effects if caught early enough, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Left untreated, a tiny tick bite can ruin your life and kill you.
The type of tickborne illnesses vary by geography and tick species. Luckily, dry New Mexico has few cases of the worst illnesses caused by tick bites, but they do occur. And if you're going to take road trips to forests and rivers in other states, be aware of tick warnings in summer and fall.
In the West, one virulent illness is Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Symptoms of spotted fever are a high temperature, sometimes a rash, headache, nausea, stomach and muscle pain. But many people will show few or no signs until the illness has progressed.
Most of the cases occur in North Carolina, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Missouri. Arizona also reported 140 cases between 2003 and 2010.
"Left untreated," warns the CDC "the bacteria can cause damage to blood vessels throughout the body leading to organ and tissue damage. RMSF can be fatal, even in previously healthy people, if not treated correctly, death can often occur within eight days of symptoms starting."
The American dog tick is the primary carrier of R. rickettsii , the bacteria behind Rocky Mountain spotted fever misery. Many of the spotted fever infections have occurred in communities with a lot of free-roaming dogs that are easy pickings for ticks.
Another nasty tickborne illness is Lyme disease, a dibilatating infection with similar symptoms as spotted fever. It is often, but not always, marked by a round skin rash called erythema migrans. Left untreated, Lyme disease can spread to joints, heart and nervous system.
Taos County had only four confirmed cases of Lyme disease between 2000 and 2015, according to the CDC. Statewide, only 46 cases have been confirmed. Most of the cases are in the Northeastern states such as Maine, Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Jersey.
What's the best way to avoid tick bites?
Treat dogs with tick repellant.
Avoid walking through heavily wooded and brushy areas with high grass and leaf litter, unless wearing boots, socks, long pants and long-sleeved shirts all treated with a 0.5 percent solution of permethrin.
Walk in the center of trails.
Spray exposed skin with a repellent that contains at least 20 percent DEET, picaridin, or IR3535. Avoid getting the spray in eyes or mouth
Bathe or shower as soon as possible after coming indoors to wash off crawling ticks.
Check every part of your body and face, and help your family check theirs, upon return from tick-infested areas. Check for ticks under the arms, in and around the ears, in hair, inside the belly button, behind the knees, between the legs, and around the waist.
Examine gear and pets. Ticks can ride into the home on clothing and pets.
Tumble dry clothes in a dryer on high heat for 10 minutes to kill ticks on dry clothing after you come indoors.

1-minute hike: Rumford Whitecap Mountain in Rumford

Texto completo: Difficulty: Moderate to strenuous, depending on the time of year you hike the mountain. The hike is about 5 miles total. Expect fairly continuous climbing with steep slopes, uneven forest floor, several brook crossings (without bridges), and a rocky ridge exposed to the wind and sun atop the mountain. There is no hand over foot climbing, ladders or rungs.
How to get there: From the bridge over Swift River spanning from the town of Mexico to the town of Rumford, drive to Rumford (west) on Route 2-Lincoln Avenue 0.2 mile, then turn left onto Route 2-Hancock Street. Drive 0.4 mile, then turn right onto Route 2-Rumford Avenue. Drive 0.5 mile on Rumford Avenue, which becomes Franklin Street along the way, then turn right onto Route 2-Bridge Street. Drive 5.6 mile to Rumford Center, where you turn right onto Andover Road. Drive 4.5 mile, then turn right onto East Andover Road. Drive about 0.2 mile and the gravel parking lot for the preserve is on the left. The parking lot is plowed year round.
You'll see on a trail map posted on a kiosk at the parking area that two trails lead up the mountain. Both trails start across East Andover Road from the parking area, on either side of the brook. 
Information: With a long, granite ridge that tops off at 2,214 feet above sea level, Rumford Whitecap Mountain offers a moderately challenging day hike to panoramic views of the mountainous wilderness of western Maine and New Hampshire. Starting out in a quiet mixed forest, the hike is a fairly continuous climb, crossing several tumbling brooks on the way to the mountain's open summit.
CAPTION:A close up of the map. Both trails climb the mountain for about 2 miles, and then, about 0.5 mile before the summit, the trails come together, and the Red-Orange Trail continues to the summit. The trail officially ends at the summit, which is marked by a round metal geological survey marked embedded in the bedrock. Past the summit, you'll notice red marks on the rock and trees that closely resemble the trail markers, however, this red paint is marking the preserve boundary. Whether you hike up and down the Red-Orange Trail or Starr Trail, or create a loop of the two, the hike is approximately 5 miles total. Also, the Red-Orange Trail intersects with what's known as the Black-White Trail 1.63 mile from the trailhead. The Black-White Trail is 4.75 miles and travels east to Black Mountain. The mixed forest covering the slopes of Rumford Whitecap Mountain includes a wide variety of tree species, including large white and yellow birch trees, stands of striped maple (which is also known as moose maple or moosewood, since it's a favorite snack for moose), tall hemlocks and red pines. In fact, Rumford Whitecap Mountain is home to what's thought to be the largest red pine woodland in the state, covering 210 acres, according to a report about the area's ecological significance by Beginning with Habitat, a collaborative conservation program of federal, state and local agencies and non-governmental organizations. This red pine woodland is located on the lower portion of the mountain's exposed ridge, mostly above 1,700 feet above sea level, on the western half of the mountain.
CAPTION: A split boulder near the top of the mountain. Rumford Whitecap is also home to a rare natural community known as mid-elevation bald, characterized by patchy subalpine to alpine vegetation and dominated by low mats of black crowberry, alpine bilberry, sheep laurel and lowbush blueberry interspersed with patches of lichen-covered bedrock. This rare community is located on the higher, more exposed areas on the east end of the ridge of Rumford Whitecap, and covers about 55 acres.
CAPTION: A red pine. Also of note, two rare plant species -- silverling and smooth sandwort (both of which produce small white flowers) -- have been documented along the mountain's ridge. Like many mountain trails, the two trails that climb Rumford Whitecap Mountain start out gradual and become steeper as they near the top of the mountain. To lessen the degree of the slope, trail builders constructed the trails so they switchback up the steepest slopes. Rumford Whitecap Mountain Preserve was established in 2007, when the Mahoosuc Land Trust acquired the property with the help of more than 500 donors, as well as grants from Land for Maine's Future and five charitable foundations. It's especially important to stay on trail during your hike because large portions of the trails are on private property. Also, staying on trail will help you avoid trampling rare and delicate alpine plants. Dogs are permitted on these trails if kept under control at all times. Camping and fires are not permitted, and visitors are expected to carry out all track. For more information, visit mahoosuc.org or call the Mahoosuc Land Trust at 824-3806.
CAPTION: A view on the mountain. Personal note: After spending all weekend ice fishing, snowmobiling and cooking over open fires at University of Maine 4-H Camp & Learning Center at Bryant Pond (something I'll write about soon), I was pretty well spend on Sunday, Feb. 26, when I arrived at the icy parking area for the Rumford Whitecap Mountain Preserve. To be honest, I didn't really feel like snowshoeing for hours. I smelled like campfire smoke, and I'd stayed up late flytying the night before. And what's more, because I was starting the snowshoe at 1:30 p.m., I knew I'd have to hike 5 miles, up and down the mountain, before sundown (which I prefer but isn't necessary, since I carry a headlamp).
CAPTION: Ice formations on the mountain. But sometimes, you just have to suck it up. So that's what I did. I threw on an extra wool shirt, clipped snow baskets on my new Leki trekking poles, stuffed an extra hat and jacket into my pack, checked the batteries in my satellite tracker, consulted the trail map at the parking area, crossed the road, climbed over the snowbank, fastened on my snowshoes, and hit the trail. 
CAPTION: The things I do for a photo.. Luckily for me, the deep snow on the Red-Orange Trail had been packed down by snowmobilers and snowshoers that had come before me, making it easy to snowshoe on. Eventually the trail branched off from the snowmobile trail and became narrower, but still fairly wide and easy to follow. When the mountainside became steeper, I snapped up my snowshoe heel lifts, which are little metal bars that pop up under my heels that give me support as I climb, taking some of the strain of my calves. They helped quite a bit. Despite it being in the 20s that day, recent warm weather had water pouring down the mountain, often along the trail. But I wore waterproof hike boots, so walking in the flowing water didn't bother me. In fact, some of the most beautiful sights I enjoyed on the trail were due to the water -- icicles formed along the edges of brooks and small waterfalls and in one spot, the water was moving so swiftly it had formed a layer of fluffy foam that formed, then froze, floating atop the water and crumbling to the touch of my mitten. As I neared the top of the mountain and the red pines started to disappear, I was greeted by a bitter wind that nearly knocked me off balance. The ferocity of the wind concerned me as I struggled forward, my snowshoes clacking and screeching over patches of ice and granite. The wind had swept the ridge clean of snow in many areas, but I didn't want to struggle with the straps of my snowshoes in such bitter cold, so I just kept them strapped to my feet, zipped up my windproof fleece jacket, swapped my beanie for my warmer fur-lined bomber hat, and carried on toward the summit.
CAPTION: The summit.

Texto completo: Teddy is only 9 months old, but he usually doesn't act his age.
The young golden retriever -- and newest employee at Maine West High School in Des Plaines -- is peaceful, calm and reserved. He keeps to himself and naps in school counselor Lizz Hoover's office until a student needs his help.
"He automatically senses when something is wrong," 16-year-old Faith Pfeifer said, recalling her first session with Teddy. "He'll come over and crouch next to you and let you pet him."
Hoover, a counselor at the school for the past 17 years, hatched the plan to bring in a therapy dog after her own dog died last year. She proposed the idea to school administrators in the fall, and Teddy started working full time about two weeks ago.
A nameplate above Hoover's office reads: Ms. Hoover "And Teddy."
Having therapy dogs in schools is becoming a trend to improve student mental health, Hoover said. Last year, a goldendoodle named Luke began work at Maine East High School in Park Ridge. Prospect High School in Northwest Suburban High School District 214 has Junie,

Texto completo: <!--StartFragment-->
President Trump needs to use his speech before Congress Tuesday to build bridges with the people who didn't vote for him during the election, Sen. Angus King said Tuesday.
The independent Maine senator said on CNN that Trump needs to realize there are a lot of people in the country who didn't vote for him. While he's spoken about unifying the country after a rough campaign, Trump needs to follow through with action, King said.
"I would like to see the president acknowledge there's a whole half of the country that didn't vote for him," King said. "There's a lot of anxiety, there's a lot of anger, there's a lot of people who are really worried about the direction of the administration. I'd like to see a little bridge building tonight, I think it's a great opportunity for him to do that."
Trump is likely to detail more of his budget plan during his first speech before a joint session of Congress, and King said he better get ready to be disappointed that most of his proposals won't be taken up by lawmakers.
King said he's worried about a $54 billion increase in military spending with no real plan for cuts coming from elsewhere. So far, decreases in the Environmental Protection Agency's budget and ending foreign aid have been discussed, but those wouldn't fully cover the increase.
King said ending foreign aid would be a mistake.
"It's about 1 percent of the budget," he said. "It's a relatively small number, and as [Secretary of Defense] James Mattis said, if you don't do foreign aid, you've gotta buy me more ammunition."
King added that decreasing EPA spending would really just be forcing states to increase their spending because a lot of EPA money is sent to state environmental regulators.
Trump's plan, which the president says is reliant on increases in economic growth, just isn't feasible right now, King said.
"There's no causal connection between what he's proposing to do and increases in the GDP," he said. "Increasing defense spending isn't going to increase GDP."

Texto completo: Teddy is only 9 months old, but he usually doesn't act his age.
The young golden retriever -- and newest employee at Maine West High School in Des Plaines -- is peaceful, calm and reserved. He keeps to himself and naps in school counselor Lizz Hoover's office until a student needs his help.
"He automatically senses when something is wrong," 16-year-old Faith Pfeifer said, recalling her first session with Teddy. "He'll come over and crouch next to you and let you pet him."
Hoover, a counselor at the school for the past 17 years, hatched the plan to bring in a therapy dog after her own dog died last year. She proposed the idea to school administrators in the fall, and Teddy started working full time about two weeks ago.
A nameplate above Hoover's office reads: Ms. Hoover "And Teddy."
Having therapy dogs in schools is becoming a trend to improve student mental health, Hoover said. Last year, a goldendoodle named Luke began work at Maine East High School in Park Ridge. Prospect High School in Northwest Suburban High School District 214 has Junie, a golden retriever trained at the same facility as Teddy. And other districts occasionally bring in therapy dogs to reduce stress.
It takes a special kind of dog to make it in this career. Teddy had to pass a temperament test to determine he was suitable for the job. He trained for four months in Michigan before Hoover bought him with her own money. Teddy spends school days helping students who experience stress or anxiety to relax and process problems, Hoover said.
On Teddy's first day on the job, a student visited Hoover's office crying and suffering from a panic attack, Hoover said. The girl petted Teddy and talked to Hoover.
"Within 10 minutes, she was smiling and laughing," Hoover said.
But Teddy's effect on students goes beyond Hoover's office, she said.
"I think he does help one on one," Hoover said. "But I think the overall feel of the school is positive. Everyone has been respectful, and he's kind of a rock star around here."

Texto completo: It's been a little over a month since the Waterville Police Department initiated Operation HOPE, a program aimed to get addicts the help they need to snuff out the demand for drugs in the city.
Lack of detox sites frustrates young program
Bill Lessa feels good about what heï¿½s accomplished so far as a volunteer for the Waterville Police Departmentï¿½s new program that helps those in the community addicted to drugs get long-term treatment.
But that good feeling isnï¿½t without some frustration at the lack of infrastructure in the state to help those with a substance abuse disorder.
ï¿½Step one is to get them into detox. After that you can talk long-term treatment somewhere,ï¿½ said Lessa, who helped place two people in residential facilities. ï¿½Thatï¿½s where the issue kind of lies ... itï¿½s a lack of detox centers, is what it really is.ï¿½
The problem gets worse when youï¿½re trying to find detox centers for people who donï¿½t have insurance, he said.
Operation HOPE, which stands for Heroin Opiate Prevention Effort, is one part of the three-pronged approach the department is using to fight the ongoing drug epidemic, Deputy Chief Bill Bonney said. The goal of HOPE, which focuses on treatment, is not only to help those in need, but to also lower the demand for drugs in the area. During a time when the Attorney Generalï¿½s Office says nearly one Mainer is dying each day from a drug overdose, police departments across the nation, including 11 in Maine, are taking action with similar programs.
ï¿½So far thereï¿½s been nothing easy about it, but weï¿½re committed to it,ï¿½ Bonney said.
In a little more than a month, the program has managed to help seven people, four of whom have already been placed in long-term residential facilities. Itï¿½s also raised more than $6,000 in donations and recruited another volunteer.
Lessa, who suffered from an opiate addiction for years, said giving back feels good.
ï¿½Every day, I know what these people are going through,ï¿½ he said. ï¿½Hopefully they donï¿½t have to go through the extent of what I went through.ï¿½
The program started on Jan. 15, and the police and volunteers, called ï¿½angels,ï¿½ have since worked with seven people, placing four in long-term treatment facilities. The other three have gone through short-term detox centers in Maine.
ï¿½The goal, obviously, of the program is to place them in long-term treatment facilities,ï¿½ Bonney said. ï¿½But the demand has far outpaced the supply of beds nationwide.ï¿½
Residential and long-term facilities are ideal because they remove those struggling with addiction from their environments, where they may have easy access to drugs.
But finding the right fit and the right financial package can be tough, Bonney said. If the person struggling with addiction also has other mental health issues, that complicates the process even further because not many facilities are equipped to handle both, he said.
The three men and one woman who are now in residential treatment centers in programs that last about a month were very excited to get the treatment, said Officer Chase Fabian, who is a coordinator of the program along with Officer Ryan Dinsmore. Three people went to facilities in Maine and one traveled to Virginia after the facility waived the majority of the fee.
Some of those who went through short-term detox are staying clean on their own now, but there is one person who calls weekly to see if theyï¿½ve found a place for her, Fabian said.
For every person the department has helped, there are many more who want help but arenï¿½t quite ready to get it, Fabian said.
He gets five calls each week from people who are interested in Operation HOPE, but who never ï¿½commitï¿½ and come to the station, he said.
ï¿½It requires a huge commitment on the part of the participant,ï¿½ Bonney said. They have to commit to changing their way of life and going to whatever treatment facility will take them.
Some of the volunteers working to match those who need help with the appropriate facilities know about that commitment firsthand.
Two of the angels ï¿½ Lessa and Eleanor Trask ï¿½ have personal experience struggling with addiction, and a third, Laurie Brown, has watched a family member struggle for years. They all signed on to show people there is hope and to help fight the epidemic.
ï¿½I think thatï¿½s why theyï¿½re so passionate,ï¿½ Bonney said. ï¿½That type of community involvement for people who have involved in opiate abuse is huge.ï¿½
The department is partnering with the Police Assisted Addiction Recovery Initiative, or PAARI, to match people with residential facilities. Other partners include the Kennebec Valley Community Action Program, MaineGeneral Health, Healthy Northern Kennebec and the Discovery House of Central Maine, which is a program of Acadia Healthcare.
The angels help the department make calls to hundreds of facilities around the country, some of which are partners with PAARI. So far, three of the four trained angels have been involved in placements, Bonney said, and a fifth has signed on for the next training session. The volunteers are essential to making the program work, he said.
The volunteer angels ï¿½have spent hours upon hours working to get these people someplace safe,ï¿½ Bonney said. ï¿½Thereï¿½s no cookie-cutter way to get these people where they need to be.ï¿½
But when the department is able to place someone in a residential facility for treatment, it feels great, Fabian said.
ï¿½The feeling you get when youï¿½re able to help somebody and get them treatment and hopefully change their life for the better ï¿½ itï¿½s unbelievable,ï¿½ he said. ï¿½I canï¿½t even describe it.ï¿½
The department is continuing its strong enforcement efforts, focusing on arresting drug dealers who are moving the majority of drugs into the area, Bonney said. Fabian has just recently been reassigned to the detective division to help with investigations.
Waterville Police are also going to be attacking the epidemic with education. The two coordinators of HOPE ï¿½ Dinsmore and Fabian ï¿½ are receiving training for a program called Prime for Life. They will work with Healthy Northern Kennebec to start a program that will teach the officers how to speak with children who are most at risk for drug abuse, so they can educate them about risk factors and prevention.
ï¿½I am so pleased that weï¿½re able to offer project HOPE to the community,ï¿½ said Waterville Police Chief Joseph Massey. ï¿½Itï¿½s a great opportunity to be able to provide this type of help to the people who need it.ï¿½
The program also plans to be self-sufficient and to not depend on tax dollars, Bonney said. The department raised $2,910 at a benefit concert in January and another $3,255 in private donations through the Kennebec Valley Community Action Program. The money raised will mostly go toward travel costs for people who are accepted into faraway facilities.

Texto completo: It's been a little over a month since the Waterville Police Department initiated Operation HOPE, a program aimed to get addicts the help they need to snuff out the demand for drugs in the city.
Lack of facilities for those needing help frustrates efforts of program
Bill Lessa feels good about what heï¿½s accomplished so far as a volunteer for the Waterville Police Departmentï¿½s new program that helps those in the community addicted to drugs get long-term treatment.
But that good feeling isnï¿½t without some frustration at the lack of infrastructure in the state to help those with a substance abuse disorder.
ï¿½Step one is to get them into detox. After that you can talk long-term treatment somewhere,ï¿½ said Lessa, who helped place two people in residential facilities. ï¿½Thatï¿½s where the issue kind of lies ... itï¿½s a lack of detox centers, is what it really is.ï¿½
The problem gets worse when youï¿½re trying to find detox centers for people who donï¿½t have insurance, he said.
Operation HOPE, which stands for Heroin Opiate Prevention Effort, is one part of the three-pronged approach the department is using to fight the ongoing drug epidemic, Deputy Chief Bill Bonney said.
The goal of HOPE, which focuses on treatment, is not only to help those in need, but to also lower the demand for drugs in the area.
During a time when the Attorney Generalï¿½s Office says nearly one Mainer is dying each day from a drug overdose, police departments across the nation, including 11 in Maine, are taking action with similar programs.
ï¿½So far thereï¿½s been nothing easy about it, but weï¿½re committed to it,ï¿½ Bonney said.
In a little more than a month, the program has managed to help seven people, four of whom have already been placed in long-term residential facilities. Itï¿½s also raised more than $6,000 in donations and recruited another volunteer.
Lessa, who suffered from an opiate addiction for years, said giving back feels good.
ï¿½Every day, I know what these people are going through,ï¿½ he said. ï¿½Hopefully they donï¿½t have to go through the extent of what I went through.ï¿½
The program started on Jan. 15, and the police and volunteers, called ï¿½angels,ï¿½ have since worked with seven people, placing four in long-term treatment facilities. The other three have gone through short-term detox centers in Maine.
ï¿½The goal, obviously, of the program is to place them in long-term treatment facilities,ï¿½ Bonney said. ï¿½But the demand has far outpaced the supply of beds nationwide.ï¿½
Residential and long-term facilities are ideal because they remove those struggling with addiction from their environments, where they may have easy access to drugs.
But finding the right fit and the right financial package can be tough, Bonney said. If the person struggling with addiction also has other mental health issues, that complicates the process even further because not many facilities are equipped to handle both, he said.
The three men and one woman who are now in residential treatment centers in programs that last about a month were very excited to get the treatment, said Officer Chase Fabian, who is a coordinator of the program along with Officer Ryan Dinsmore. Three people went to facilities in Maine and one traveled to Virginia after the facility waived the majority of the fee.
Some of those who went through short-term detox are staying clean on their own now, but there is one person who calls weekly to see if theyï¿½ve found a place for her, Fabian said.
For every person the department has helped, there are many more who want help but arenï¿½t quite ready to get it, Fabian said.
He gets five calls each week from people who are interested in Operation HOPE, but who never ï¿½commitï¿½ and come to the station, he said.
ï¿½It requires a huge commitment on the part of the participant,ï¿½ Bonney said. They have to commit to changing their way of life and going to whatever treatment facility will take them.
Some of the volunteers working to match those who need help with the appropriate facilities know about that commitment firsthand.
Two of the angels ï¿½ Lessa and Eleanor Trask ï¿½ have personal experience struggling with addiction, and a third, Laurie Brown, has watched a family member struggle for years. They all signed on to show people there is hope and to help fight the epidemic.
ï¿½I think thatï¿½s why theyï¿½re so passionate,ï¿½ Bonney said. ï¿½That type of community involvement for people who have involved in opiate abuse is huge.ï¿½
The department is partnering with the Police Assisted Addiction Recovery Initiative, or PAARI, to match people with residential facilities. Other partners include the Kennebec Valley Community Action Program, MaineGeneral Health, Healthy Northern Kennebec and the Discovery House of Central Maine, which is a program of Acadia Healthcare.
The angels help the department make calls to hundreds of facilities around the country, some of which are partners with PAARI. So far, three of the four trained angels have been involved in placements, Bonney said, and a fifth has signed on for the next training session. The volunteers are essential to making the program work, he said.
The volunteer angels ï¿½have spent hours upon hours working to get these people someplace safe,ï¿½ Bonney said. ï¿½Thereï¿½s no cookie-cutter way to get these people where they need to be.ï¿½
But when the department is able to place someone in a residential facility for treatment, it feels great, Fabian said.
ï¿½The feeling you get when youï¿½re able to help somebody and get them treatment and hopefully change their life for the better ï¿½ itï¿½s unbelievable,ï¿½ he said. ï¿½I canï¿½t even describe it.ï¿½
The department is continuing its strong enforcement efforts, focusing on arresting drug dealers who are moving the majority of drugs into the area, Bonney said. Fabian has just recently been reassigned to the detective division to help with investigations.
Waterville Police are also going to be attacking the epidemic with education. The two coordinators of HOPE ï¿½ Dinsmore and Fabian ï¿½ are receiving training for a program called Prime for Life. They will work with Healthy Northern Kennebec to start a program that will teach the officers how to speak with children who are most at risk for drug abuse, so they can educate them about risk factors and prevention.
ï¿½I am so pleased that weï¿½re able to offer project HOPE to the community,ï¿½ said Waterville Police Chief Joseph Massey. ï¿½Itï¿½s a great opportunity to be able to provide this type of help to the people who need it.ï¿½
The program also plans to be self-sufficient and to not depend on tax dollars, Bonney said. The department raised $2,910 at a benefit concert in January and another $3,255 in private donations through the Kennebec Valley Community Action Program. The money raised will mostly go toward travel costs for people who are accepted into faraway facilities.

Texto completo: PORTLAND, Maine -- The Central Maine and Quebec Railway in 2016 posted positive net income for the first time since buying the former Maine Montreal and Atlantic Railway in a bankruptcy sale.
In its fourth quarter earnings report, the Hermon-based international railroad reported net income of $605,000, driven by a 20 percent increase in revenue, to $30.8 million. That's up from about $25.6 million in revenue in 2015.
In 2016, the rail line shipped more carloads of building products, fuel and propane, chemicals and fertilizers, and paper and wood pulp. Among those product categories, paper and wood pulp carloads were the only to drop lower in the fourth quarter than one year ago.
The rise in total revenue follows about $23 million in capital investment the new owners put into the railroad after acquiring it for $15.7 million in a 2014 bankruptcy auction. A driverless derailment and explosion that killed 47 people in Lac-Megantic, Quebec, Canada, had pushed the Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway into bankruptcy and focused international concern on rail safety guidelines in an effort to prevent similar crashes.
The company said that it expects traffic on the line to increase in 2017.
"In particular, we see potential upside from wood pellet production and distribution to Europe and new chemical moves across the system," Joe Adams, CEO of Fortress' transportation investment arm said.
The company also continues to push for infrastructure improvements in the region, supporting a recent Maine Department of Transportation application for $8.1 million in federal funds to improve and repair bridges on the Maine Northern Railway line, running from Madawaska to Millinocket.
DOT would add more than $5.6 million from bond funds and $2 million from the state-owned Maine Northern Railway to fund the bridge fixes.
Primary customers of the Maine Northern Railway line include forest product and agricultural businesses including Irving Woodlands, Twin Rivers Paper Co., Woodland Pulp, McCain Foods and potato growers, according to the Maine DOT.

Texto completo: EAST MILLINOCKET, Maine -- Investors seeking to build a biofuel refinery that they say would employ more than 100 people at the former Great Northern Paper Co. mill site were granted a temporary restraining order on Tuesday preventing the razing of buildings vital to the project.
U.S. District Judge Jon Levy issued the order in response to a 16-page lawsuit EMEP LLC of Lincoln filed in U.S. District Court of Portland the same day. Attorneys for EMEP said they sought only to maintain the status quo. The order allows the company to continue demolition of four buildings for which it already received state permits.
They and attorneys for the site's owner, Florida-based North American Recovery Management, conferred over a proposed $1.75 million purchase price and terms after the hearing.
The lawsuit alleges that North American repeatedly delayed closing on the purchase and sale agreement of the site and committed breach of contract by violating a Letter of Intent covering the purchase. North American also began demolition of parts of the site in February that EMEP needs to complete its plans, according to the lawsuit.
EMEP claims that it spent about $6 million "toward implementing its plan to construct the [biorefinery] and consummating its purchase of the property in investment."
"The biorefinery itself will employ over 100 individuals, and EMEP estimates that the 24-month construction of the biorefinery would create over 2,000 jobs in direct and indirect construction services and induced community jobs," according to the lawsuit.
EMEP sought a court order requiring North American to halt site demolition and sale of the equipment EMEP needs "beyond that which is authorized" under North American's state permit, and also wanted the court to halt North American from selling or conveying the property to anyone else. The company seeks compensation for losses incurred due to the delays.
The venture is led by three partners, including William Harrington and Fahim Samaha, who own the U.S. arm of the French energy company Capergy, and SAG Realty LLC owner Scott Gardner. Samaha is president of Capergy US, which last year purchased Covanta's shuttered biomass plants in West Enfield and Jonesboro, and restarted them in January under the corporate name Stored Solar LLC.
Stored Solar has begun securing equity investors to share in 30 percent of the cost of the biorefinery, according to court documents, and has plans for a broader $240 million initiative to "acquire, upgrade and operate biomass plants throughout the state of Maine."
EMEP describes itself in the lawsuit as a Maine limited liability company with a principal place of business in Lincoln. Court documents indicate that the company hopes to convert forest biomass into a "drop in" ready fuel in the form of bio-crude or diesel, gasoline and jet fuel.
North American Chief Financial Officer Jason Inoff said he hoped to be able to comment in some detail about the lawsuit soon.
"This is the first I've seen of it," Inoff said via email.
Town officials have met with EMEP leaders about a half dozen times over the last six months, town Administrative Assistant Angela Cote said.
"We have been working with them for the past few months and the board [of selectmen] would support any efforts that would lead to them being able to purchase the mill site," Cote said.
Board chairman Mark Scally expressed town concerns in January about the heavy demolition equipment seen at the former mill site, saying it jeopardized a potentially lucrative deal for the town with a potential investor and employer. He did not identify the developer. Scally later said that the town had no legal means to prevent the demolition.
On Feb. 6, Inoff issued a brief statement saying that town officials were wrong to fear that the demolition would make the site less marketable.
The demolition "will not affect any future development of the site," Inoff said.
Several structures would remain on the property, including the site's biomass boiler, after the four buildings are demolished, he said at the time.
"If we wanted to take down the entire site we could have started that last April. We are trying our best to do several things," Inoff said. "We're trying to do our best to bring back the most commerce to this site."
Scally dismissed North American on Tuesday by saying "I haven't had any dealings with them, and I don't care if I ever do."
"I just hope that the damage that has been done [to the mill site] is not irreparable. I think they [EMEP] are good people and they have good backing," Scally added. "They have been upfront with us the whole way."
According to the lawsuit, EMEP and North American signed a Letter of Intent on June 30 for EMEP to purchase a power plant, several mill and office buildings, and associated equipment on the mill site, with an option to purchase contiguous property. The letter included a $100,000 deposit refundable if the property failed EMEP's due diligence examination or if it was unable to purchase the contiguous property. North American accepted the money on July 18.
The letter allowed EMEP 60 days for its research. It specified that the purchase and sale agreement would be signed in the latter half of the 60 days.
But neither party finished a purchase draft within the allowed time. The delays were caused by North American's delayed removal of "all non-ferrous metals" from the site -- equipment that had been used in connection with papermaking that EMEP wouldn''t need -- and EMEP hadn't yet bought the contiguous land, the lawsuit states.
Conflict between both parties began in November when North American sought permission to raze four buildings on the site. "Each of these buildings was contained in the letter of intent's description of the assets EMEP contracted to purchase," the lawsuit states.
EMEP agreed to the additional demolitions if, among other things, a purchase and sale agreement was concluded before the razings started. North American agreed, with its representatives telling EMEP on Nov. 16 "that its attorneys were reviewing the draft [purchase and sale] agreement and would be 'back to you shortly,' " the lawsuit states.
North American dodged requests to finish the sale agreement from then until Feb. 1, when EMEP told North American that state officials had reported to them that they had heard from North American that it no longer considered the letter of intent binding, the lawsuit states.
On Feb. 10, EMEP says it learned the owners plan to listen to other offers on the property starting March 1.
North American's demolition work and failure to complete the sale jeopardizes the loan agreements made between EMEP and the federal Department of Energy, the lawsuit states.
EMEP hopes to begin production in 2019.

Texto completo: SOUTH PORTLAND, Maine -- In her native country, Ghislaine Bola was a doctor. Here, in Maine, she's not even qualified to work in an ambulance. Her medical degree doesn't translate into the U.S. health care system. Plus, she doesn't speak English well enough yet to communicate with most patients.
But a new course at Southern Maine Community College is helping Bola with both problems.
The ESOL-to-EMT program -- short for English for speakers of other languages to emergency medical technicians -- is the first of its kind in the state. It's designed especially for new Mainers. The course teaches students to be language interpreters and state-certified EMTs. It also gives special language support as the students take the class in English.
The program began this semester when a local ambulance company told SMCC it needed bilingual EMTs. Scarborough based North East Mobile Health Services said the skill was vital given greater Portland's growing and diverse immigrant population.
Sixteen students enrolled in the first class. They come from Burundi, Somalia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iran, Cameroon and Honduras. Somali, Kirundi, Lingali, Farsi, French and Spanish are among the students' native languages. They all speak English, as well.
There is no cost to the students who attend class, though they were rigorously screened for language skills and aptitude. The class was funded through a grant from the Maine Quality Centers and the John T. Gorman Foundation. The MQC provides customized workforce training grants to Maine employers. The training is delivered through SMCC and Maine's other community colleges.
"Almost everybody here has some sort of [previous] medical training," instructor Paul Froman said. "Four members of the course would have been physicians back home, but when they came to the states it didn't mean anything in our medical field, unfortunately."
Bola specialized in pathology while a doctor in the DRC. She's been in the U.S. for a year and a half. She thinks she can become a doctor here, too. She sees this class as a first step. English is her fourth language.
"I have a barrier. The barrier here is the language. English is a barrier," she said. "But I know that with enough English courses I will go through that barrier. I wish to be a doctor, even if it will take more time, much money. I believe, with God's help, I can make it here."
Froman said the learning in his class goes both ways. He's taking the opportunity to learn as much as he can.
"We have more and more immigrants coming. As a paramedic, I'm running into more of them as patients. So, to have that one-on-one, non-emergency interaction with the class, I couldn't pass it up," he said.
A few weeks back, a student in his regular EMT class asked if it was permissible, in Islamic culture, to expose a woman's chest while performing CPR. Froman knew the answer was "yes" after asking the same question to one of his muslim students in the ESOL-to-EMT class.
"Before, I never would have had that knowledge," he said.
North East Mobile Health Services has committed to granting job interviews to all students who successfully complete the program. It expects to hire 15 to 20 EMTs in the coming year. SMCC is offering the class again in the summer.

Texto completo: PORTLAND, Maine -- The city's first homicide victim of 2017 was identified Tuesday by police as Bryan Garcia, 35, of Scarborough.
The cause of his death was not released, Assistant Chief Vern Malloch of the Portland police said in a press release.
Because of the ongoing nature of the investigation, only limited information is being made available, he said.
Garcia was found about 2:15 p.m. Monday in his car, a 2003 silver Infiniti G35 sedan, on Chadwick Street in the city's West End.
EMS crews took the man out of the vehicle to assess his well-being, and he died at the scene, according to CBS television affiliate WGME.
During a media briefing Monday afternoon, Portland police Chief Michael Sauschuck declined to say how police believed the man died, but he confirmed "the individual did pass away at the scene here and we are treating this situation as a homicide."
No arrests had been made as of mid-afternoon Tuesday and no one else was injured, Malloch said.
"The police department is working diligently to investigate this violent crime," he said Tuesday in the press release. "While no arrests have been made, we also have no indication there is an ongoing threat to the community. No level of violent crime is acceptable, but we are encouraged that overall crime continues to decrease and our city remains a safe place to live and work.
"Our condolences go out to Mr. Garcia's friends and family as they mourn during this most difficult of times," the assistant chief said.
Police are asking that anyone with information call 874-8575.

Texto completo: BANGOR, Maine -- Last year, a federal judge warned a local man who admitted to destroying government property by driving through a closed gate at the Cutler Naval Support Activity installation that the consequences would be harsh if he committed a new crime.
"I will put you in jail in the blink of an eye and it won't be for 45 days or time served," U.S. District Judge John Woodcock told Richard Hughes, 30, of Glenburn on Oct. 14.
On Tuesday, Woodcock made good on that promise.
The judge revoked Hughes' supervised release and sentenced him to a year and a day in federal prison for violating it, according to information posted on the court system's website. Hughes faced up to two years in prison for the revocation.
Hughes was arrested on Dec. 9 by Bangor police and charged in state court with domestic violence assault and terrorizing. A motion to revoke his supervised release was filed the next day in federal court.
He had been held without bail since his arrest awaiting the outcome of Friday's hearing.
Hughes pleaded guilty on Feb. 8 to domestic violence assault and was sentenced to 60 days in jail or time served on that charge, according to his attorney, Matthew Erickson of Brewer. In a plea agreement with the Penobscot County district attorney's office, the terrorizing count was dismissed.
Woodcock on Tuesday ordered Hughes to be on supervised release for an additional 23 months after his release and to pay $6,222 in restitution to replace and install a new gate at the Cutler facility.
The original charge of destruction of government property stemmed from an incident in the early morning hours of June 5, 2015, when Hughes drove a truck owned by his employer, Hahnel Brothers Co. of Lewiston, through the gate on the Navy's Cutler site after he had visited at least two bars.
Hughes was working at the site the previous day for Hahnel Brothers, which was contracted to repair a roof at a facility located at the former naval base, according to court documents. He and another employee, who has not been named, left work on June 4, 2015, in a company truck but returned in the early morning hours the next day and destroyed the gate.
When confronted about the incident, Hughes told police he was looking for a fishing hole.
The Navy's very low frequency shore radio facility at Cutler still operates to transmit communications to submarines in the Atlantic and Arctic Ocean regions.

Texto completo: PORTLAND, Maine -- The attorney representing a man serving a life sentence for the murder of a 92-year-old Waterville resident during a burglary has asked the Maine Supreme Judicial Court to end prosecutors' practice of charging defendants with two different kinds of murder -- intentional or knowing and depraved indifference.
Roland L. Cummings , now 47, is serving a life sentence at the Maine State Prison in Warren in connection with the stabbing death of Aurele Fecteau of Waterville on May 20, 2014. Cummings was convicted by a Kennebec County jury in November 2015 of murder, burglary and theft.
His appellate attorney, Tina Nadeau of Portland, argued in her brief that the double charging confuses juries that are not required to find unanimously whether a defendant is guilty of one type of murder or the other. She urged the court to force prosecutors to charge one or the other but not both kinds of murder. She also argued there was insufficient evidence to convict Cummings of either murder charge.
The Maine attorney general's office argued in its brief that the evidence was sufficient to sustain Cummings' murder conviction on either theory, so prosecutors were not required to pick one or the other. Assistant Attorney General Donald Macomber also said that the Maine court ruled in 1983 that "prosecutors did not have to elect which theory to present to a jury in murder cases so long as they ethically believe there is sufficient evidence to prove either theory beyond a reasonable doubt."
The justices are scheduled to hear oral arguments in the case at 10:40 a.m. Friday at the Cumberland County Courthouse in Portland.
Nadeau said in her brief that the only evidence that connected Cummings to the crime scene was his DNA recovered from Aurele's pant's pockets. No weapons, fiber, hairs or blood were found.
"The paucity of the evidence presented in this case is stunning and does not rise to the level of proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Cummings intentionally or knowingly killed Aurele -- no rational juror could believe otherwise," Nadeau said in her brief.
Macomber countered in his brief that the state presented "abundant circumstantial evidence" that Cummings stabbed Fecteau 16 times as he lay in bed.
" The fact that [Cummings] inflicted so many stab wounds, including to vital organs, strongly evinces the fact that it was his conscious object to cause Aurele's death [the definition of intentional or knowing murder]," the prosecutor said.
The jury also could have concluded that the way the crime was committed "demonstrated an almost total lack of concern or appreciation for the value of human life on the part of Cummings [the definition of depraved indifference murder]."
"In other words, viewing this evidence in the proper light, the jury rationally could have found both that Roland Cummings intentionally or knowingly killed Aurele Fecteau, and that Cummings' conduct manifested a depraved indifference to the value of human life and in fact caused the death of Mr. Fecteau," Macomber concluded in his brief.
Nadeau said the state's high court has ruled previously that "depraved indifference murder should be limited to the 'very few' instances where conduct is less than intentional but still constitutes conduct so heinous, so blameworthy as to support the imposition of the severest charge -- murder."
As examples, she cited "playing Russian roulette, viciously beating children and denying them medical attention, shooting a rifle into a house known to be occupied by children and adults, and torturing a restrained person with various implements over hours."
Nadeau asked the court to "establish that the state must elect to pursue either intentional or knowing murder or depraved indifference murder -- but not both -- prior to the reading of the indictment at trial," she concluded in her final brief. "This court should instruct and remind trial courts to not allow a depraved indifference instruction to go to the jury unless there is sufficient and appropriate evidence to support such a charge."
Nadeau and Macomber also disagreed on what should happen in Cummings' case if the justices rule that prosecutors must pick one charge over the other. Nadeau argued that her client's sentence should be vacated and he should be set free. Macomber said that he should be retried.
There is no timetable under which the justices must issue a decision.

Texto completo: WOODLAND -- Close to 15 people gathered in the Woodland Town office on Feb. 21 for a public hearing on retail marijuana in the town, with some standing against the wall in the small space.
Selectmen Tom Drew kicked off the hearing by playing devil's advocate and presenting an argument he has heard from residents in favor of retail pot in Woodland.
"Although I did not vote in favor of making marijuana legal," Drew said, "I've listened and heard from other towns around us that someone is going to grow marijuana around here. All kinds of tax money will be made from this new farming practice, that is going to be legal in the state of Maine."
While Drew believes prohibiting marijuana would be positive, he asked who would enforce that prohibition if law enforcement has yet to deal with the sale and usage of harder drugs in the town.
"We're not going to change the law by prohibiting marijuana in this town," said Drew. "I don't have a moral high horse to sit on, or any self-righteous stones to throw, and I'm not going to make Woodland safer by permitting its legal structured safety. I find it discouraging to be devil's advocate over a subject that, 20 years ago, meant a lot more than it does today."
With that in mind, Drew said that prohibiting retail operations in Woodland will do little to stop farmers from eventually growing pot in other parts of the state, adding that "as a town, we will be laughed at."
Kim Parent, of Power of Prevention, was present at the meeting, and responded by informing selectmen that Caribou, Fort Kent, Frenchville, Linneus, Presque Isle and Littleton are all prohibiting retail marijuana.
Parent says the negative impact of retail legalization could be avoided "If everybody takes a stand and says 'No, we don't want it," adding that "Anyone who works in treatment or recovery will tell you that the people using harder drugs all started with marijuana."
Drew said he appreciated what Parent does, adding that he has a hard time, and as a dairy farmer in a rural town, has employed people who he later discovered had been addicted to drugs and witnessed the impact of illicit substances on an individual.
"I've seen the effects that drugs have," Drew said, "and it enrages me because you have a fully functioning police department paid for next door, and a dozen houses in that town that harbor kids who passed the gateway long ago."
Parent said that, in Caribou, police are conducting an ongoing investigation on drugs and drug houses and are unable to comment on any of their findings.
"I completely understand that," Drew said. "However, someone is going to benefit from the money collected through this farming practice. This is going to be the world we live in whether we like it or not. I don't like it, but there are lot of things I don't like about the world. If you're going to have to live in a world that places these burdens on taxpayers, they should get some form of justice through legal financial restitution.
Selectman Will Barnum contributed by saying the "simple fact remains that this is still against federal law," and that it isn't wise for a "state or municipality to let it happen under their nose."
"I've ran into addicts during my day job," Barnum said, "and have yet to find anyone who didn't start with marijuana. By legalizing it, all we're doing is making the problem easier to get into."
Drew took a moment to clarify his reasons for representing a side in favor of retail legalization.
"When I was elected, I was elected to represent the public whether I agree with them or not," Drew said. "In the past couple weeks, I've received messages from people voicing concerns on the other side and that's what I just presented, because that's my job. It's not my job to vote on any personal bias. I came here to express other people's arguments and concerns, and I have no apologies for it, but I do respect that the consensus in the room is what it is, and that makes me proud."
Residents at the meeting expressed concern with activity already occurring in Woodland, where an individual who allegedly grows pot has a significant increase of traffic on their road has had crop stolen from him. Because of this, public attendants felt that retail legalization could potentially cause a spike in this activity and overall crime in the town.
"The only setup I would endorse is one that grows Charlotte's Web," said Barnum, "which is a strain of marijuana that has no THC and mostly CBD: the medicinal component of marijuana. And (CBD) does work, evidence shows that it can treat neurological disorders. I don't know if smoking it is the best way to take it, though."
Barnum's reiterated the federal illegality of marijuana should not be taken lightly.
"For us to say 'well, the state voted in favor of it, let's let everybody grow weed, smoke dope and chill,' that's not a good idea," Barnum said. "My other argument is based on what I see in my day job. I don't have a problem with stoners, but I do have a problem with meth-heads and bath salters, and they all started out as stoners."
Selectman Carl Grant's primary motivation in voting against legal marijuana is that the majority of Woodland voted against it in the recent election.
"My personal thoughts are that I wouldn't want a facility next to my property or in my neighborhood," Grant said.

Texto completo: A pair of local high school basketball coaches who enjoyed success during their tenures have both resigned, according to administrators at their respective schools.
Brian McDormand, who guided the Old Town boys to the program's first state championship in 23 seasons in 2014, has tendered his resignation after seven seasons at the school while Tim Scott, who has guided the Hampden Academy girls for the last three years, has also stepped down.
Old Town athletic administrator Brett Hoogterp and Hampden athletic director Mike Bisson both confirmed on Tuesday afternoon that the coaches had stepped down.
This past season at Old Town was McDormand's 25th in the coaching ranks. Perhaps his career highlight came during the 2013-2014 season when his Coyotes won the school's first state championship in boys basketball.
That team finished the season on a 10-game winning streak.
After serving as an assistant at several high schools in Massachusetts, McDormand got his first head coaching job at Lynnfield (Mass) High in 2000, and led the girls' team to a 71-19 record and a state championship game appearance in 2004.
After the 2003-04 season, McDormand moved to Maine and guided the Lee Academy prep program for a season before mentoring the girls at Mattanawcook Academy through the 2009-10 season.
He was hired at Old Town in the fall of 2010, and felt like now was the time to hang up his whistle.
"It's a grind and I just want to spend more time with the family really," said McDormand, who has three grandchildren, two of whom live in Hampden and the other in Massachusetts.
"I live in Lincoln so there's some travel involved," he added.
McDormand said he'll always remember the Old Town state championship team, which gave him his first gold ball.
"Everything came together at once," he said. "Physically, we were very good, we had great size, we had great balance."
At one point, the Coyotes won 23 straight games under McDormand's watch.
He subsequently guided the Coyotes back to the regional semifinals the following year where Old Town fell to Winslow.
Old Town, which fielded a young roster this winter, struggled to a 5-13 record.
"Brian is a hard worker and in my opinion outworked several coaches in terms of scouting and watching films," Hoogterp said.
McDormand said the Coyotes improved throughout the year and he expects the team to be in contention again in the future.
"We played well the second half of the year, we really improved defensively," he said.
Hoogterp said he was informed on Monday of McDormand's decision to resign.
Scott mentored the Hampden Academy girls for the last three years, guiding the Broncos to the Class A North semifinals the last two winters.
The Broncos posted an 11-7 regular-season record this winter, good for fifth place in Class A North. Hampden knocked off defending state champion Lawrence of Fairfield in the quarterfinals.
Hampden bowed out in the following round to eventual regional champion Messalonskee of Oakland.
Bisson said Scott wanted to spend more time with his family and watch his daughter, Brooklynn, play her senior year.
Bisson said Scott did an outstanding job and will be missed.
"It's a loss for our program," Bisson said.
Scott could not be reached for comment Tuesday.

Texto completo: When Maine passed a law in 2013 allowing residents to buy prescription medication by mail from other countries, the state essentially sanctioned a quest for cheaper drugs that has driven Mainers across the border to Canada for decades.
But the controversial law, the first of its kind in the nation, lasted only a couple of years. A federal judge struck it down in February 2015, ruling that Maine had infringed on the federal government's authority to regulate foreign commerce.
Under federal law, importing drugs into the U.S. from other countries is illegal. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, however, rarely enforces the ban among individual consumers.
Now, with medication prices soaring to record highs and President Donald Trump promising to rein in costs, the federal law is back in the crosshairs. A group of U.S. senators and representatives led by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, and including Maine Sen. Angus King, on Tuesday turned up the pressure on Trump. They introduced a bill that would allow the importation of prescription drugs from Canadian pharmacies, provided that the medications meet certain safety standards.
The legislation would require foreign drug sellers to register with the FDA. Patients would have to present a valid prescription and could receive up to a 90-day supply. The bill also would give the FDA the authority to shut down "bad actors," including rogue online pharmacies, Saunders said at a media event announcing the bill.
Controlled drugs, including narcotic painkillers, could not be imported under the legislation.
King described the bill as "deregulation" of the pharmaceutical industry that would open the market to greater competition.
"My principal foreign policy credential is 'I can see Canada from Maine,'" he quipped.
In the wake of news about skyrocketing prices for epinephrine injections and other prescription drugs, 71 percent of Americans across the political spectrum said they favored allowing the importation of drugs from Canada, according to a September 2016 Kaiser Family Foundation poll.
Canada, among other countries, can sell prescription drugs less expensively because its government caps prices on many prescription drugs.
Canada doesn't enjoy the cheapest drug prices worldwide, but they're significantly lower than what the U.S. pays. Americans spent $1,112 per person on prescription drugs in 2014, while Canadians spent $772, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
Debate over the drug importation bill will likely echo the controversy over Maine's law, with supporters arguing that drugs from Canada are safe and that consumers have been victimized by American pharmacies and drug makers charging exorbitantly high prices.
Opponents, including the drug lobby and pharmacy groups, argue that drug importation could expose consumers to contaminated or phony medications, and point out that most Americans take generic drugs, which are less prone to big price swings than expensive patented medications.
The Maine Pharmacy Association was among nearly 170 groups that signed a letter Tuesday opposing Sanders' bill.
The legislation also stipulates that after two years, the federal government could permit importation of medications from additional countries where standards for the approval and sale of prescription drugs are comparable to those in the United States.

Texto completo: ROCKLAND, Maine -- Voters in the regional school district approved a $23.2 million bond in a referendum vote Tuesday that will result in a new, larger school being built in Owls Head and renovations at the district's high and middle schools.
Residents in Regional School Unit 13, which includes Rockland, Thomaston, South Thomaston, Cushing and Owls Head, voted 276 to 200 to approve the bond, for a new community school in Owls Head that is expected to cost about $9.3 million to build. The new school, which will serve students from kindergarten through fifth grade, will replace Gilford Butler School in Thomaston and Owls Head Central School.
The bond will also fund renovations at Oceanside High School and Oceanside Middle School by expanding cafeterias, increasing the number of classrooms and bringing facilities into state and federal compliance. About $7.3 million of the bond will be designated for installing more energy efficient infrastructure across the district.

Texto completo: Taylor Schildroth was somewhat of an aberration during a North region boys basketball tournament with few offensive slugfests.
The junior guard from George Stevens Academy of Blue Hill, who scored 61 points during a regular-season game this winter, remained a prolific scorer while leading the defending state champion Eagles to their second straight Class C regional title and was named a William C. Warner Most Valuable Player Award recipient for the second straight year.
Schildroth averaged 22.3 points during GSA's three tournament victories and battled a fever of 101 degrees in the hours before the undefeated Eagles outlasted Fort Fairfield in the regional final.
Riley Swanson, one of nine seniors who guided Mount Desert Island to its first regional crown since 1995, was named MVP of the "B" North tournament, while senior forward James Mersereau earned top honors in Class D after similarly leading Machias to its first North/East title in 22 years.
Senior guard Nathan Violette of Messalonskee High in Oakland earned the Warner Award for the Class A North tourney held at the Augusta Civic Center.
The BDN did not select a Class AA North squad, but junior guard Terion Moss of defending state champion Portland was honored by Augusta tourney officials as that tournament's outstanding player-sportsman.
Joining Swanson on the Class B all-tourney team were teammate Graham Good, a senior forward, senior guard Nate Desisto of Orono, freshman forward Isaac Varney of Hermon and senior forward Ethan Mailman of Central of Corinth.
Others on the Class C all-tourney team with Schildroth were GSA junior center Max Mattson, senior guard Chris Giberson and junior guard Isaac Cyr of Fort Fairfield and senior guard Justin Thompson of Schenck of East Millinocket.
Junior guard Jordan Grant of Machias joined Mersereau on the Class D all-tourney roster along with senior center Nolan Altvater and senior guard Jackson Mathers of Southern Aroostook Community School in Dyer Brook and senior forward Jacob Flewelling of Easton.
Class A all-tournament choices along with Violette were Messalonskee teammate James Kouletsis, a senior guard, junior forward Michael Norton Jr. and sophomore forward Cooper Wirkala of Oceanside of Rockland-Thomaston, and junior guard Jordan Roddy of Cony of Augusta.
The teams are chosen in voting among tournament personnel, media members and Maine Principals' Association representatives.
In Class B, Swanson, also an all-tourney choice in 2015, led the second-ranked Trojans with 17 points against Central in the semifinals and with 12 points in the final against Orono while also contributing to an MDI defense that yielded just 35.6 points per tournament game.
Good was an interior complement on offense to Swanson's more perimeter-oriented play, scoring in double figures during both the quarterfinals (team-high 13 points) and the semifinals (10).
Desisto, also a 2015 all-tourney choice, averaged 13.3 points in three games for the fourth-ranked Red Riots, highlighted by a 23-point outing in the quarterfinals against Presque Isle.
The 6-foot-5-inch Mailman averaged 16 points while helping third-seeded Central reach the semifinals. He scored a game-high 19 points in a quarterfinal victory over No. 6 Winslow.
Varney made an impressive tournament debut with 25 points in the quarters as No. 1 Hermon held off No. 8 Washington Academy. He followed that with 11 points in the Hawks' semifinal loss to Orono.
In Class C, Schildroth scored 29 points against Dexter in the semifinals before shaking off his illness to score a game-high 26 in the championship game.
The 6-6 Mattson flirted with a triple-double in two of his team's three games while averaging 14.6 points. He had 15 points, 12 rebounds and nine blocked shots in the quarters, then amassed eight points, 15 rebounds and 12 blocks to help GSA fight off Fort Fairfield.
Cyr averaged 15 points and epitomized the fearless play of coach Logan McLaughlin's No. 2 Fort Fairfield club. He had team-high totals of 19 points in the quarterfinals and 14 points in the final.
Giberson, a Warner Award winner in 2014, provided stability to the Tigers' tourney run this year. He joined Cyr as a double-figure scorer in each of the team's three games and averaged 13 points.
Thompson, who joins Schildroth as a returning member of the Class C all-tourney squad, averaged 27.5 points during Schenck's stay in Bangor. The versatile veteran scored a tourney-best 32 points to go with nine rebounds during a semifinal loss to Fort Fairfield.
In Class D, the 6-4 Mersereau was Machias' most consistent offensive presence during the regional, averaging 14 points per game.
His eight points in the semifinals all came during the third quarter as coach Jim Getchell's club outscored Easton 31-9 to pull away. Mersereau tallied a game-high 20 points against Southern Aroostook in the championship game.
Grant scored 15 of his game-high 19 points during the third quarter of the semifinals to help Machias pull away from Easton after leading just 24-20 at intermission.
Altvater and Mathers led Southern Aroostook to the regional final for the third time in four years.
Altvater, an all-tourney choice in 2014, scored a team-high 18 points in this year's regional final and averaged 19 points for the top-ranked Warriors. Mathers, an all-tourney choice in 2016, scored 28 points in the Warriors' quarterfinal victory and averaged 16.3 points per game.
Flewelling, selected for the second straight year, starred for the 2016 regional champions in their return to Bangor. He scored a team-best 18 points in each of Easton's two tourney games.
In Class A, Violette was part of a dynamic Messalonskee backcourt that led the Eagles to their first regional title. He averaged 19.7 points during postseason play and scored eight of his 25 points in overtime of the semifinals as coach Peter McLaughlin's club outlasted No. 8 Skowhegan.
In the championship game, Violette scored 14 of his game-high 21 points in the third quarter to help Messalonskee defeat 2016 champion Oceanside.
Kouletsis was Violette's co-pilot for the Eagles, averaging 11 points -- including a basket with three seconds left to send the semifinal with Skowhegan to overtime. Kouletsis grabbed 11 rebounds in the final.
Norton Jr. stepped into a prime-time position for coach Matt Breen's Mariners this winter, scoring 27 points in the quarterfinals and 24 in the semifinals en route to 17.7 points per contest.
Wirkala displayed his versatility for No. 3 Oceanside, showing himself as an able ball handler as well as a rising scorer and rebounder. Wirkala averaged 11 points with a team-high 16 points in the final.
Roddy was Cony's top one-on-one offensive threat. He averaged 20 points in the tourney, including 24 in the Rams' narrow semifinal loss to Oceanside.

Texto completo: CARIBOU -- Caribou Fire Department will soon receive a brand new MVP Rescue Pumper that will replace both their fire truck and rescue vehicle.
The purchase of a $585,000 vehicle was recently approved by city council, and is currently being manufactured by Ferrara Fire Apparatus, a corporation in Holden, LA.
"Their work is just about done," Susi said on Feb. 22. "We're flying to Louisiana on the 8th, 9th,and 10th to do final inspection, and then we'll have them drive it to the Lewiston/Auburn area."
Ferrara Fire Apparatus, in driving the vehicle from Louisiana, will be able to address any issues or hiccups with the new truck along the way, the chief said. Once it arrives in Maine, all of the lettering specific to Caribou Fire and Ambulance will be applied and then it will be shipped to Caribou. Susi suspects it will arrive in Maine by March 14.
"The new truck is about six and a half feet longer than the original one, and a bit higher," Susi said. "It's two trucks in one: a rescue truck and a Class A pumper. Not only that, but it's so ergonomically correct that you don't have to carry as much, and both fuel and repair costs will be cut in half, since it's only one vehicle."
While Caribou Fire Department was able to trade in their old rescue vehicle to help knock down the overall price of the new one, they are unsure of what will happen to the old pumper.
"That truck isn't safe for the firefighters or the general public," Susi said. "The cab is literally splitting itself apart."
The Chief estimated that it would cost roughly $160,000 in repairs just to be able to certify the old pumper as a fire truck.
"City Council will decide what to do with our current fire truck," Susi said. "They could put it up for bid, since the engine is strong and the rubber is good. If you're not using it as a fire truck, it wouldn't need to pass that certification, but it would still need repairs since it isn't safe or roadworthy. It could go to the Highway Department for parts, tires, and things like that, and some money could be made with the rubber and engine."

Texto completo: ORONO, Maine -- A South Thomaston man who was given a field sobriety test after a police officer smelled marijuana was later charged with operating under the influence, Orono police Chief Josh Ewing said Tuesday.
Joshua Luttrell, 20, was stopped on Mill Street at around 11:15 p.m. Monday by Sgt. Cameron Barrieau, who noticed a defective headlight, the chief said.
The sergeant "smelled marijuana, put Luttrell through field sobriety tests and [charged] him for OUI drugs," Ewing said.
Luttrell, who is a University of Maine student according to school officials, was taken to the station for further testing, which is where he was issued the court summons for operating under the influence. He was then released, Ewing said.
Marijuana has been legal to possess and use in Maine since Jan. 1. Lawmakers are working on the rules for the voter-approved law that is scheduled to go into full effect in February 2018.
Possessing, growing and transporting up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana for recreational purposes is now legal, while buying or selling it is not legal yet. However, using marijuana in public or in a vehicle on a public way -- that goes for drivers and passengers -- is illegal.

Texto completo: UNITY, Maine -- In the yellow-painted music room of their sunlit farmhouse, Johanna Davis and Adam Nordell changed their shoes, pulled out their fiddle and guitar and began to play and sing a toe-tapping song about working hard on the farm with the help of the one you love.
Talk about art imitating life. Davis and Nordell, the musicians behind the popular folk music act "Sassafras Stomp," spent the last few months playing at contra dances, house concerts and other venues all over the country. But when spring comes, they will turn their focus to Songbird Farm, where they grow organic dry beans, grains, flint corn and vegetables on 13 or so acres in cultivation on the Stevens Road in Unity.
"We're really lucky to get to farm and to play music for a living," Nordell said. "Neither thing is easy and fun all the time, but overall they're very rewarding things to do."
Nordell, 33, is a Montana native who came east after high school to attend the College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor. As a student there in the early 2000s, he got pulled into the enthusiasm for the local food movement and small-scale farming that was sweeping through the campus and did internships on several organic farms. But back then, at least, he avoided catching the farming bug.
"I learned a lot and I was done," he said. "I didn't want to be a farmer."
But that was before he met Davis, 28, the sister of one of his college classmates. She had grown up working in the garden and canning food with her family at their home in the Lincoln County village of Round Pond and was interested in that kind of back-to-the-land lifestyle. After high school, Davis didn't really know what she wanted to do with her life, but she suspected it would not include college.
"School is not my thing," she said, smiling.
Instead, she dove into experiential learning, first working on a startup sheep dairy farm in Whitefield and then spending nine months doing woodworking at the Carpenter's Boat Shop in Bristol, where she learned how to build traditional wooden boats. After that, she stayed to help run the boat shop's large garden, which fed the crew, then spent a season working on a diversified organic farm off the coast of Washington state.
"They were growing really great crops in a good way," Davis recalled. "After that farm experience, I thought OK. I want to do this." Following the song of the land
By the time she and Nordell met through her brother, Davis was certain she wanted to be a farmer, just as he knew he wanted to be a musician. Somehow, they have found a way to make their dual dreams work, first beginning their musical collaboration in 2008 with a grant-funded artists' residency in the now-closed Montana Artists Refuge, which led to the formation of Sassafras Stomp. The farming part came a little later, when the couple moved back to Maine in 2010. That year, they started Songbird Farm on a very small scale in Lincoln County, raising vegetables and also a half-acre of dry beans and a half-acre of Hopi Blue corn, a variety that was developed hundreds of years ago on the mesas of northern Arizona. By the following year, they uprooted their farm and moved it to Starks, where they leased land on the Sandy River and figured out how to grow their business.
"We started doing the regular diverse veggies to sell at farmers market and through CSAs," Davis said. "But there are a bajillion diversified veggie farms. We have to stand out."
For them, that meant making the decision to increase their production of beans, grains and corn.
"The local food economy is well set-up for vegetables. People have their CSA farm that they are connected to and love," Nordell said. "It seems the number of farms is growing even faster than the market is, which means people have to get creative."
They noticed there is a lot of attention paid in Maine to local vegetables, meats and dairy products. But right now, few people consider where their carbohydrates come from. The farmers believe that mindset eventually will change. Their cornmeal and flour is fresh and flavorful, they said, adding that is not always the case with the commodities found on supermarket shelves.
"There are things that taste way better than flour that's been sitting there for who knows how long -- although grains are a commodity crop, and people are used to paying nothing for them," Davis said.
There has been a learning curve. Many in Maine don't remember or realize that just a few generations ago, lots of local farms grew and milled grains like wheat, oats, rye and corn. When the Songbird farmers showed up at the Common Ground Country Fair one year selling bags of sweet, nutty cornmeal made from Abenaki Flint, lots of potential customers were curious.
"People were asking where the flour came from," Davis said, adding that the cornmeal has caught on despite that. "It's our best success. It has a little bit of a following, which we're grateful for."
They also grew hard red winter wheat for bread flour, Polish rye, buckwheat, oats and dry beans in a cornucopia of colors. There are red-and-white speckled Jacob's cattle beans, golden-orange Marfax beans, black beans and Soldier beans, which are white with reddish markings that made them look like their namesake 18th-century toy soldiers.
"It's a neat thing about Maine, all the heritage beans. People are so proud of their beans," Nordell said.
During their four years in Starks, the couple learned more about growing grains, corn and beans, achieved organic certification and also established their Pantry Share CSA, which they believe is the first locally-grown flour and bean farm share in Maine.
"It's something we're proud of," Nordell said. Getting to Waldo County
Still, the couple was on the hunt for a farm to buy. In 2014, through the Maine Farmland Trust's Farmlink program, they learned about Tim Christensen's Green Earth Gardens farm in Unity. Christensen, a longtime biology instructor at Colby College in Waterville, was sick and wanted his farm to be in good hands before he died.
"It was kind of a neat transfer," Davis said. "He wanted us to come every week to have meetings with him, about his systems and his land."
Christensen wanted the young Songbird farmers to succeed, they said. He died not long after the purchase was finalized in the fall of 2014. Part of his legacy is his lovingly maintained farm, consisting of 40 acres in Unity, a farmhouse and a significant amount of farm infrastructure, such as the two large greenhouses. The farm's location was also a big draw for Davis and Nordell.
"There's such a strong, warm community of other farmers and homesteaders in Unity," Davis said. "There's a diversity of folks here, the Amish folks, the multi-generational conventional dairy farmers, the back-to-the-land folks and the new young farmers."
The move to Waldo County has allowed them to expand their farm business. This year, they are partnering with Sam Mudge of Grange Corner Farm in Lincolnville to provide more organic grains in their Pantry Share CSA. Last year, Songbird Farm had 35 customers for the Pantry Share and are hoping that number will double now that they've joined forces with Mudge. Customers sign up early in the season -- the list is open now -- and pay for a share, which this year costs $175 for 70 pounds of organic, locally grown and milled beans and grains.
Offerings include Abenaki Flint cornmeal, "Warthog" whole wheat flour, Early Riser cornmeal, rye flour, cracked rye cereal, popcorn, heirloom dry beans, buckwheat flour, yellow grain peas and cracked oatmeal.
While the Pantry Share might cost more in one fell swoop than people are used to paying for flour and beans, the Songbird farmers believe it is a good value. It's also unique in that there is just one pickup in the fall at various locations statewide.
"It's been really cool connecting with people who are excited for local grains," Davis said. "Everything stores well, so we can have a really wide customer base, with folks from all over."
Their busiest time on the farm is in the fall, when they harvest root crops and their corn, which they have to pick by hand. Last fall, they grew four acres of corn and had a harvest party.
"Fifty people came. It was a whole wall of people marching through the field," Nordell said.
After the harvest came the husking, when the farmers sat down to husk a veritable mountain of corn. Then, after the harvest, the processing and the delivery, they take a break from the farm and turn their attention once again to Sassafras Stomp. In the last few months, Nordell and Davis performed in Kentucky, Tennessee, Indiana, Colorado, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, Montana, Iowa, Illinois, Michigan and Pennsylvania. At performances of what they describe as "sweet, high energy folk music," they find that there's a lot of interest in the couple's other life as part of Maine's growing young farmer movement, and they're happy to share stories of their life back home on Songbird Farm.
Turns out, it's hard to separate the farmer from the musician, and that's the way both Nordell and Davis like it.
"I feel like both of these things make the other sustainable for me," Davis said.

"There's a natural toughness and a natural resilience to those guys we have that I think has hardened over the year," said Walsh. "We constantly talk about not allowing the stuff you can't control to affect the stuff you can control and those guys really toughened up as things got more difficult for our program and continued to believe in what we're doing."
The reward for that effort presents eighth-seeded UMaine (7-24 overall, 3-13 in America East) the unenviable task of entering postseason at top-ranked Vermont (26-5), which just completed the first 16-0 regular season in America East men's basketball history.
Game time is 7 p.m. Wednesday at Patrick Gymnasium in Burlington, Vermont.
Coach John Becker's Catamounts won the America East regular-season crown by four games over second-place Stony Brook and own the nation's longest Division I winning streak at 18 games. They haven't lost since falling 81-69 last Dec. 21 at Butler, currently ranked 13th in the latest Associated Press top 25 poll and 15th in the USA Today coaches poll.
"They're an elite team nationally as far as consistent excellence over the last 10 years," said Walsh. "We often take it for granted when you're consistently excellent because we allow it to become routine, but the worst year that program has had over the last eight years was last year when they finished third in the league and then led the championship game by 15 points with 10 minutes to go.
"That's the level they're at."
Vermont swept the individual America East end-of-season awards announced Monday, led by junior guard Trae-Bell Haynes, player of the year, and freshman forward Anthony Lamb, rookie of the year.
In addition, senior guard Dre Wills was named defensive player of the year, senior forward Darren Payen was sixth man of the year and Becker was recognized as coach of the year.
Bell-Haynes (first team), Lamb (second team), sophomore guard Ernie Duncan and junior forward Peyton Henson (third team) each earned All-America East status despite the fact no one on the roster averages as many as 12 points per game.
"They've got 11 good America East players this year," said Walsh. "They're so balanced, they're so well connected, they're so talented, they're so well coached. It's great for our league to have an elite team like that. It's a tremendous challenge for us to try to beat them."
UMaine was shut out of AE's postseason honors save for freshman forward Andrew Fleming earning a berth on the All-Rookie team and sophomore guard Ryan Bernstein on the All-Academic team. And while the Black Bears enter their quarterfinal as a decisive underdog after losing to the Catamounts by 13 and 21 points in two meetings this winter, respectively, they'll seek to build on their most recent basketball experience.
"I was proud of the way we played Saturday and the resilience we showed because it was obvious that we showed up to win," said Walsh, whose team will remain without leading scorer Wes Myers, suspended indefinitely since a locker-room skirmish after practice on Feb. 14. "We didn't show up to play and see how things went and maybe if things worked out our way we'd find a way.
"We talk about winning. We talk about what we need to do to be successful. We're going there with a great mindset of what we have to do to beat them," he added.

Texto completo: AUGUSTA, Maine -- A Republican lawmaker who has been mentioned as a possible challenger to U.S. Sen. Angus King in 2018 laid out a plan Monday to bulldoze many of Maine's convoluted set of business tax exemptions.
In doing so, he showed that while it could be feasible in the current anti-government, anti-tax environment, it's also fraught with political peril. That tightrope is why these tax breaks have survived amid challenges around their efficacy in recent years.
The plan from Sen. Eric Brakey, R-Auburn, is just a concept at this stage, but he told the Legislature's Taxation Committee that it targets 47 tax programs that he termed "corporate welfare," costing the state between $425 million and $448 million over two years. He would use the savings to eliminate Maine's corporate income tax and lower income taxes.
Under the proposal, the two biggest targets are $135 million in just two programs affecting more than 6,000 businesses-- the Business Equipment Tax Exemption and the older Business Equipment Tax Reimbursement -- that help businesses recoup property taxes paid on equipment purchases.
Also among the targets are tax breaks that seem relatively inconsequential in the bigger pictures, including a sales tax refund on windjammer parts that affects 10 taxpayers.
Brakey's plan looks to thread a political needle: He said it's designed to bridge a gap between Republicans who "hate taxes" and Democrats who "hate corporate welfare."
That's a decent political argument and there's a policy case for it, too: Maine has long wrestled with not being able to evaluate the effectiveness of its hodgepodge of tax breaks and the Legislature's watchdog committee is evaluating that now.
Democrats and Republicans praised the idea, but behind each tax break is a constituency, and Rep. Matthew Pouliot, R-Augusta, told Brakey that if the proposal was more fleshed out, there would be a line "out and around the Capitol 10 times" with businesses testifying against it.
The main challenge is that Maine's business community is likely to oppose these changes: Maine State Chamber of Commerce lobbyist Linda Caprara told the committee "there's a reason" that the breaks exist, and the state's package of incentives isn't generous compared to other places.

Texto completo: PORTLAND, Maine -- A federal court has ordered the Lyman-based T&D Timber Products to reunite an Oregon company with $2.2 million worth of timber mats after T&D's owner claimed his company is under IRS investigation and on the verge of bankruptcy.
The Portland, Oregon-based Totem Forest Products won a preliminary injunction against T&D earlier this week, ordering Totem be allowed to inspect the equipment it claims T&D has hidden.
Totem filed the motion for an injunction after a text message exchange on Feb. 13 in which T&D owner Travis Stratton indicated that the company had filed for bankruptcy. Totem said T&D had not filed for bankruptcy as of Feb. 23 and a search of court records shows no corporate or personal filings.
The company is based in Lyman but has equipment stored in Biddeford, Jefferson, Lyman and Lincoln.
According to court records, Stratton told a representative from Totem on Feb. 1 that the IRS is investigating his business for evading payroll taxes for nine months and has frozen his company's assets.
A spokesperson for the IRS said the agency does not confirm, deny or comment on specific investigations.
The injunction order prevents T&D from moving the inventory and requires it to store the Oregon company's 6,124 timber mats separately.
Stratton did not respond to an email seeking comment and a message left Monday at T&D's office was not returned.

Texto completo: BANGOR, Maine -- Two people are facing felony charges after police say they were allegedly involved in an attempted mugging on Third Street and a robbery at a nearby apartment building last week.
Daniel P. Babcock, 50, was charged with Class B robbery, Class C burglary, misdemeanor theft by unauthorized taking, possession of scheduled drugs and refusing to submit to arrest after police -- responding to a reported fight in the street -- found him at about 10:55 p.m. on Feb. 20, Bangor police Sgt. Tim Cotton said Tuesday.
Babcock was inside another man's apartment at 97 Third St., covered with his own blood, when he was located by Bangor police Officer Zach Carey, according to a report the officer filed at the Penobscot Judicial Center.
Kenneth R. Pearson II, 53, of Hermon, also was in the apartment and charged with two counts of burglary, one a Class B crime and one a Class C, as well as misdemeanor theft by unauthorized taking and unlawful possession of drugs, the report states.
The most serious Class B crime is punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
Pearson told responding officers that Babcock noticed a black man walking with another man at the junction of Third and Cedar streets and said, "He owes me money," which led to the reported attempted mugging. After the attack began, witnesses said, one of the two men being assaulted used a taser and he and his friend were able to escape in a nearby car, the police report states.
A woman living nearby called police to report the mugging but by the time Carey, who was followed by 10 other officers, arrived the suspects were gone.
Carey, however, reported hearing and following the sound of yelling to an apartment at 97 Third St., where he found an upstairs apartment door kicked in and blood smeared on it. After Carey announced he was a police officer, Babcock and Pearson, who were inside, came into view and Babcock and the officer reportedly each pushed each other, his report states.
After Babcock failed to listen to Carey's commands to get on the ground, the officer deployed his taser, hitting Babcock in the knee.
"That's not going to work," Babcock reportedly said, according to Carey's report.
It took three officers to handcuff Babcock, the report states.
When officers tried to arrest Babcock, he "would not comply with their orders and then Babcock began to actively fight with officers," Cotton said in an email, explaining why Babcock also was charged with refusing to submit.
Two men inside the apartment told investigators that Babcock and Pearson had broken into the apartment and threatened to hurt them. The two alleged victims said they handed over some cash, which amounted to less than $5.
The blood, which was found on the street and in the apartment, was from mostly superficial wounds to Babcock's chest, the officer's report states. The possession of scheduled drugs charges were the result of searches done by Penobscot County Jail intake officers who found several antipsychotic pills on both Babcock and Pearson, according to the filed police reports. Both men remained in jail on Tuesday unable to post bail which was set at $15,000 for Babcock and $7,500 for Pearson, a jail official said.

The Dope On Cannabis in Connecticut: 5 things to know

Texto completo: Is marijuana a harmless way to relax or a dangerous gateway drug? The science says "No" and "We don't know," respectively. Arguments for and against legalization often misrepresent the medical effects of cannabis, some experts say.
Several bills proposed in the 2017 session of the General Assembly would make recreational use of marijuana legal in Connecticut. Medical marijuana use for conditions ranging from post-traumatic stress disorder to cancer has been legal in the state since 2012, though dispensaries did not open until 2014. As it stands now, marijuana is legal in California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, Colorado, Nevada, Massachusetts, Maine, and Washington, D.C., for recreational purposes.
Here are some of the facts:
- Is marijuana a gateway drug?
That's unproven, according to the National Academies of Science. The group has called for more research to answer that question.
The National Academies recently reviewed 10,000 studies to determine what we do and do not know about marijuana. Its report found that evidence was "limited" to suggest that marijuana causes users to go on to try most other drugs, though the association with tobacco smoking was stronger. The panel also found that cannabis users were more likely to be heavy drinkers, but it did not find that marijuana causes heavy drinking. Some people who use marijuana do progress to using other illegal drugs--but most don't.
- Can you get addicted to marijuana?
Yes, according to the American Psychiatric Association.
Cannabis use disorder is included in the APA's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. A 2015 study shows that 30 percent of users may have some level of the disorder, with people who start at a young age being more likely to become dependent.
- Does marijuana cause cancer?
No, according to multiple studies reviewed by the National Academies.
Some believe that since marijuana is commonly smoked, it would contribute to all the same illnesses that cigarettes do. The National Academies' review did not find a conclusive link between pot smoking and cancers. It also found strong evidence against a connection to lung cancer, as well as head and neck cancers. But use can lead to a chronic cough and other respiratory illnesses, the report concludes.
- Does marijuana have medical uses?
Yes, but scientists say much more research is needed.
"It's like trying to do a study with heroin," said Mark Litt, a professor of Behavioral Sciences, Community Health and Psychiatry at UConn Health. Litt runs a treatment program for people addicted to marijuana. Because marijuana is illegal at the federal level, it has been difficult to get funding to do clinical trials with the drug, let alone legally obtain it, though rules are relaxing. There have been studies showing its usefulness in relieving chronic pain, the spasms associated with multiple sclerosis, and vomiting and nausea caused by chemotherapy.
Medical marijuana is already legal in Connecticut for adults with a long list of debilitating illnesses, ranging from post-traumatic stress disorder to cancer. The list of qualifying illnesses for people under 18 is much shorter,
- Is marijuana bad for your brain?
Yes. "Short-term use of marijuana is associated with short-term memory deficit. So even if you use it just a bit, your short-term memory is going to be affected," Litt said. "Long-term use is associated with a variety of cognitive impairments, particularly frontal-lobe issues, which involve executive functions--decision making, problem solving, judgment, and inhibition; that is, ability to inhibit oneself, which is a major part of emotional control and behavioral control."
Research shows marijuana users earn less than their peers, are more likely to be involved in workplace accidents and are less likely to graduate from high school or college.

Texto completo: NESHKORO - Sparkling blue eyes, a warm and ready smile, an incredibly engaging personality, a quick wit, a spellbinding storyteller, a superb animal handler and trainer, the consummate showman, a talented entrepreneur and businessman, a dreamer who accomplished his dreams, an outstanding teacher; a loving and dedicated husband, father, grandfather, brother, uncle, and friend. These are just a few highlights accurately describing Mark Schoebel, an incredibly gifted, remarkable and much-loved man, now passed from our lives far too soon. Hundreds of us....literally from Florida to Alaska, from Maine to Hawaii, grieve his untimely passing and cherish gratefully our fond memories of his wonderful impact on our lives.
Mark passed away on Thursday, Feb. 23, 2017, at ThedaCare Regional Medical Center in Appleton while undergoing open-heart surgery. He and his twin sister, Maggie, were born on June 11, 1954, in Fond du Lac, WI, the children of Leslie and Patricia Schoebel. Mark grew up on a family operated game farm near Princeton, and graduated from Princeton High School in 1972. He and Alice McAfee, the love of Mark's life, were married in Green Lake, on April 10, 1976, and began a joint career in the wildlife animal business. Over the years, they built and operated several wildlife parks together and operated a wide variety of animal enterprises throughout the United States. In the past few years, Mark, Alice and their son, Matthew, built and operated the Timbavati Wildlife Park in Wisconsin Dells....their realization of Mark's lifelong dream.
Mark was a member of the following professional and business organizations; the Zoological Association of America, the Wisconsin Zoo Association (vice president), the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions, the Wisconsin Fair Association, the International Association of Fairs and Festivals, the Feline Conservation Federation and the Baraboo Chamber of Commerce.
A man of insatiable curiosity, an avid reader, and an astute observer of life around him, Mark never stopped exploring and enjoying the world. He particularly enjoyed designing, creating and landscaping animal enclosures and displays for his own wildlife parks and for other zoos and parks across the United States. Among the many achievements of Mark's incredibly productive career were the four wildlife parks that he designed, built and operated successfully, including the Timbavati Wildlife Park, the consummation of his career. Friends and relatives too numerous to count have enjoyed immensely Mark's (sometimes day long) personal tours of his beautiful wildlife parks....fascinated by the quality and beauty of the displays, the variety and magnificence of the animals and Mark's captivating and comprehensive narrative regarding each and every animal, its habits and habitat, its care and feeding, and its own individual peculiarities.
Mark is survived by his wife of 40 years, Alice McAfee Schoebel; his son, Matthew Schoebel and Matt's wife, Angie Osting Schoebel; his grandchildren, Emma and Lane Schoebel; seven brothers and sisters, Sue (Wayne) Wightman of Fond du Lac, John (Kris) Schoebel of Princeton, Joe (Tina) Schoebel of Montello, his twin sister, Maggie Schoebel of Princeton, Paul (Lisa) Schoebel of Irvine, Calif., Betsy Ladwig of Princeton, PJ (Wendy) Schoebel of Beaver Dam; and his sister-in-law, Susan Schoebel of Las Vegas, Nev. Mark is further survived by 30 nieces and nephews, numerous cousins, a large extended family and countless friends throughout the entire nation. In addition, he is survived by his many in-laws on the McAfee side of the family....all of whom cherish memories of their friendship with Mark and wonderful time spent with him. Mark was preceded in death by his parents, Leslie and Patricia Schoebel; his brothers, Michael and Peter Schoebel; also by his son, Benjamin John Schoebel.
A Funeral Mass for Mark will be held on Thursday, March 2, 2017, at 12 p.m., with visitation beginning at 9 a.m., at ST. JAMES CATHOLIC CHURCH, 315 North Main St., in Neshkoro. Father Dale Grubba will be conducting the Mass and assisted by Pastor Mark J. Hensley. A luncheon will follow the service at the church. In lieu of flowers, if you prefer, donations may be made to the family to continue Mark's favorite cause of assisting those truly poor and in need of help. Those donations may be mailed to W583 Eagle Road Neshkoro, WI 54960. Please visit our website www.wachholzandsons.com to send condolences to the family.

Texto completo: Forward Guerschon Yabusele, who was selected by the Celtics with the 16th pick in last June's draft, is nearing the end of his season with the Shanghai Sharks of the Chinese Basketball Association.
The Sharks will play Game 3 of their best-of-five quarterfinal series against Shenzhen Wednesday night. The series is currently tied at one. Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge said there is a possibility that after the Sharks' season concludes, Yabusele could join the Celtics' D-League affiliate, the Maine Red Claws.
"We've discussed the idea even before the season started this year," Ainge said. "But I think that we'll evaluate it when the time comes. We'll see how healthy he is, how fresh he is, and if it's in his best interest to rest or play a handful of games in Maine."
Yabusele is averaging 21.9 points and 9.6 rebounds per game for the Sharks this year. Even if he does not report to Maine, he likely will rejoin the Celtics' summer league team in July.
Technical foulup
With 4:03 left in the third quarter of the Hawks' 114-98 win over the Celtics Monday, Atlanta center Dwight Howard threw down a dunk to give his team a 10-point lead. Howard briefly hung on the rim and then pulled himself up, and he was whistled for a technical foul.
A few minutes earlier, he had received a technical for shoving Celtics forward Al Horford, so the second technical resulted in his ejection. After the game, though, the NBA released a statement saying that Howard should not have been ejected for the second technical, because it was "non-unsportsmanlike."
At the time, it appeared to be a potential turning point in the game. Howard had already racked up 17 points and 12 rebounds, and then he was gone. But it turned out to be just a footnote, as the Hawks cruised to the easy win.
Celtics fans mercilessly booed Howard after he committed a hard foul on Isaiah Thomas and later shoved Horford. But he praised the atmosphere afterward.
"Boston's a great place to play," Howard said. "I have had some battles here with Kevin Garnett and those guys. Despite the boos, it a great place to play."
At the limit
Celtics guard Avery Bradley, who made his return Monday after missing 22 of the previous 23 games because of a strained Achilles' tendon, will be on a minutes restriction this week.
The plan was for Bradley to play 15 minutes in Monday's game, and when he reached that mark in the first half, coach Brad Stevens acknowledged that it was tempting to bring him back in the second. Instead, they followed the script.
"Both Avery and I, we were both like, 'Maybe five more minutes or six more minutes?' " Stevens said.
"But the plan going in was to play him through that first half, hopefully two good stints -- about 15 minutes -- and then increase that piece by piece over the next few games."
Bradley finished the game with 6 points and 3 steals.
"It felt good to be out there again," Bradley said. "I wish I could have played a little bit more, but it felt good to be out there."
Jerebko unmasked
Celtics forward Jonas Jerebko made no secret of his desire to get rid of the mask that was protecting his broken nose and also disrupting his shooting rhythm. Since suffering the injury Feb. 5, Jerebko had gone just 5 for 21 from the field and 2 for 11 from behind the 3-point line, and he often appeared reluctant to take shots that are normally well within his comfort zone. On Monday night, though, he finally got his wish and was cleared to be mask-free. Jerebko was 2 for 2 from the field, including a 3-pointer.

Shannon Larsen, left, and Sandra Macarthur, UMF education faculty and staff members, announce a $174,848 grant the UMF Maine Mathematics Coaching Project received from the Maine Department of Education's Math and Science Partnership Project.
First launched in 2015, the project is the only mathematics coaching preparation in Maine and one of only a handful nationally that requires participation by both the teacher and their school administrators. This significant component not only helps educators understand and adopt new instructional strategies, but also provides them with the district-level support that can insure their success.
Funds from this highly competitive grant will go to help Maine kindergarten through eighth-grade educators and their school districts strengthen teaching and learning in mathematics with the goal of increasing the math proficiency of Maine students.
"Today's students are continually challenged by the demands of higher level mathematics, as demonstrated by recent test scores," said Shannon Larsen, UMF assistant professor of elementary mathematics education. "Having well-prepared math coaches embedded in their school districts will provide classroom teachers with consistent, cost effective professional development and the skills and support they need to help their students master math."
Educators in the two-year project are nominated by their school districts. Current participants include cohorts that started the two-year project in June 2015 and June 2016 and include 29 teachers from every corner of the state.
The grant will provide participants with three days of professional development at UMF and two regional learning labs and discussion groups for teachers and their administrators in Auburn and Orrington. Funding will also assist with data analysis on student performance to help inform decisions and identify progress.
In addition, $10,000 is allocated for kindergarten through eighth grade mathematics teaching materials including, manipulatives, technology and books for educators and students. These materials will be permanently housed in the Loraine J. Spenciner Curriculum Materials Center located in the UMF Theodora J. Kalikow Education Center.
The next cohort begins this June and still has several openings.

Texto completo: AUGUSTA (AP) -- Retired Coast Guard officer Roger Johnson sometimes notices a harsh buzz when he turns on his amateur radio, and he blames high-powered lighting used to grow pot.
Amateur radio operators say the legalization of marijuana is creating a chronic nuisance thanks to interference caused by electrical ballasts that regulate indoor lamps used to grow pot. The American Radio Relay League wants the Federal Communications Commission to take a stand against devices that give off much more interference than federal law allows in homes.
Ham radio operators generally say they don't have a problem with pot but worry amateur growers may not be aware that cheap ballasts can have phony FCC-compliance stickers. The operators point out they serve as backup communication during emergencies -- but concede it's unlikely any lighting devices would still be on if the power goes out.
Johnson, one of the radio league's 166,000 members, said he worries interference will only become a bigger inconvenience in years to come in Maine, which recently legalized growing up to six flowering marijuana plants, 12 immature plants and unlimited seedlings.
When he recently heard suspicious noisy static, Johnson said, he drove up and down side streets with a spectrum analyzer hooked up to his laptop to determine the source, which turned out to be a licensed grower a mile away who said he had no idea he was causing a disturbance.
"My prediction is that as more and more states legalize marijuana, the number of growers is going to increase exponentially and overwhelm the FCC's ability to regulate it," he said.
The American Radio Relay League has filed four complaints against the FCC and said it hasn't heard back, and says complaints concerning alleged interference continue to trickle in, particularly in Colorado and California. Cultivation of recreational marijuana is also now legal in Maine, Massachusetts, Oregon, Alaska, Washington state and the District of Columbia.
Will Wiquist, an FCC spokesman, said the agency takes all interference issues seriously and sends out warning letters after receiving complaints about unlawful interference, including from lighting. He declined to comment further.
Grow lamps are distinctive because they power on and off for 12 hours at a time, and marijuana grow lighting can be powerful enough to produce the same amount of radio interference as a 1,000-watt AM radio station, said Bill Crowley, the Maine section manager of the Radio Relay League.
One inexpensive ballast sold by big-box retailers produced 640 times the level of interference of a legal unit, said Mike Gruber, the league's resident radio interference expert, who did the test.
The interference often sounds like the kind of harsh, grating static generated by a lightning strike -- except it doesn't stop, said Tom Thompson, an amateur radio operator in Boulder, Colorado.
Thompson said he has dealt with independent pot growers causing interference a half-dozen times. Given the weak federal enforcement and declining FCC manpower, he said, he has created his own solution: a filtering device that almost eliminates the static by suppressing interference from non-compliant ballasts.
"Some won't cooperate, but most do," he said. "I go to their places and give them a filter and give them instructions how to install it."
Last year, Kalkaska, Michigan, began requiring medical marijuana growers to use FCC-compliant lighting equipment. Scott Yost, the village's manager, is an amateur radio operator himself.
In Maine, Johnson wants legislators to get the state to step in and ban ballasts that produce radio frequency noise extending beyond the user's property. Out-of-compliance ballasts could be refunded or replaced with a unit that doesn't produce noise, he suggests.
Several legislators said such a move would likely pre-empt federal law, and a committee recently voted to kill such a bill. Other ham radio operators say the federal government should do its job.
Crowley said he has experienced a disturbance himself, and hopes President Donald Trump's new FCC chairman, Ajit Varadaraj Pai -- who has praised pending federal legislation aimed at helping amateur radio operators -- will be more sympathetic.
Education might be the answer and could make growers more aware of the need to use ballasts approved by the FCC, said Erin Worthing, of Cape Elizabeth, a recreational marijuana caregiver.
The FCC-approved grow lighting he uses for his crops lead to a higher-quality product, he said, as noncompliant ballasts also tend to be cheap and poorly designed.
The White House said last week that the Justice Department will begin stepping up enforcement of federal laws prohibiting recreational marijuana. Noting that marijuana remains federally illegal, Worthing said, "Under the current climate, we don't want feds knocking on doors."

Texto completo: A bipartisan measure to offer legal protection for undocumented immigrants brought into the country as children is likely to have the backing of both U.S. senators from Maine.
U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican, said recently she plans to co-sponsor the bill once she gets some clarification about what happens when someone who otherwise qualifies is charged with a misdemeanor.
The proposal, offered by U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Dick Durbin, D-Ill., would grant temporary legal status for immigrants who are eligible for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival program started by President Barack Obama's administration in June 2012.
The program gives most of those living in the country without proper authorization the right to stay for at least three more years if they arrived as children.
Collins said she supports the principle behind the bill because a lot of the people covered by the measure came to America as "very young" children who had no role in the decision to enter the country without the required authorization.
"There should be some sort of special treatment of people in that group," Collins said.
The proposal has already garnered the backing of three other GOP senators: Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Jeff Flake of Arizona and Dean Heller of Nevada.
"I do not believe we should pull the rug out and push these young men and women, who came out of the shadows and registered with the federal government, back into the darkness," Graham said when he introduced the bill. "Our legislation continues to provide legal status to them for three years as Congress seeks a permanent solution."
Four Democrats in addition to Durbin are co-sponsoring, including the minority leader, Charles Schumer of New York. Also backing the bill are Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris of California and Bill Nelson of Florida.
Maine's junior senator, independent Angus King, "supported provisions in the Senate's comprehensive immigration reform bill that are similar to the legislation proposed by Senators Durbin and Graham," said his spokesman, Scott Ogden.
King "continues to believe that we need a comprehensive solution to fix our broken immigration system, and, to that end, he looks forward to reviewing the details of their bill - but he certainly agrees that it makes no sense to punish these young men and women, who offer so much to this country, for a choice that was out of their hands to begin with," Ogden said.
Collins said her only concern with the proposed legislation is that she's not sure whether it has the right language related to those who have been charged with misdemeanors in the United States.
The measure doesn't cover anyone who has been convicted of a felony or serious misdemeanor. Collins said she wants to know more about what sorts of misdemeanors are considered disqualifying.
The bill defines a serious misdemeanor as a federal, state or local offense unrelated to immigration status for which the maximum imprisonment term is more than five days and no more than one year.
It also bars those who have been convicted of a crime involving domestic violence, sexual abuse or exploitation, burglary, unlawful possession or use of a firearm, drug distribution or trafficking, driving under the influence or a crime that resulted in more than 90 days in custody.
Collins said she is eager to resolve the issue for those covered by the proposal.
As it is, she said, she's worried they may be treated unfairly under President Donald Trump's immigration-related orders.

Sen. Eric Brakey developing plan to end corporate income tax

Texto completo: Sen. Eric Brakey, R-Auburn, laid out a plan to bulldoze many of Maine's convoluted set of business tax exemptions.
Maine Sen. Eric Brakey
The plan from Brakey is just a concept at this stage, but he told the Legislature's Taxation Committee that it targets 47 tax programs that he termed "corporate welfare," costing the state between $425 million and $448 million over two years. He would use the savings to eliminate Maine's corporate income tax and lower income taxes.
Under the proposal, the two biggest targets are $135 million in just two programs affecting more than 6,000 businesses-- the Business Equipment Tax Exemption and the older Business Equipment Tax Reimbursement -- that help businesses recoup property taxes paid on equipment purchases.
Also among the targets are tax breaks that seem relatively inconsequential in the bigger pictures, including a sales tax refund on windjammer parts that affects 10 taxpayers.
Brakey's plan looks to thread a political needle: He said it's designed to bridge a gap between Republicans who "hate taxes" and Democrats who "hate corporate welfare."
Maine has long wrestled with not being able to evaluate the effectiveness of its hodgepodge of tax breaks and the Legislature's watchdog committee is evaluating that now.
Democrats and Republicans praised the idea, but behind each tax break is a constituency, and Rep. Matthew Pouliot, R-Augusta, told Brakey that if the proposal was more fleshed out, there would be a line "out and around the Capitol 10 times" with businesses testifying against it.
The main challenge is that Maine's business community is likely to oppose these changes: Maine State Chamber of Commerce lobbyist Linda Caprara told the committee "there's a reason" that the breaks exist, and the state's package of incentives isn't generous compared to other places.

Texto completo: AUBURN -- Local historian Candace Kanes presented her findings Tuesday night about a small community of freed slaves who made Lewiston their home in 1866.
Doug Hodgkin, president of the Androscoggin Historical Society, was happy with the turnout at the Androscoggin Historical Building.
"It's standing-room only, and we brought out all of our extra chairs," he said.
Kanes started her research almost four years ago on the Civil War, branching into the Emancipation, which eventually led her to communities of freed slaves in Maine.
"My intention is to look at the whole state, but the Lewiston Evening Journal is a fabulous newspaper resource," Kanes said. All of the papers from 1866 to the 1930s are archived on Google newspapers. "And it's a great piece of my piece to delve into."
She said that after the Civil War, many ex-slaves made their way to the Freedmen's Bureau headquarters in Washington D.C.
Bureau Commissioner Brig. Gen. Oliver Otis Howard of Leeds offered employment contracts to several African-American men whom he'd met during the war.
Kanes said she found a lot of her information from newspaper archives, namely the Lewiston Evening Journal (now the Sun Journal), which ran ample features on African-American families.
One man, Robert Creart, was written about a number of times. His obituary, which appeared in the paper on Sept. 27, 1929, read, "Robert Creart, one of Lewiston's best-known colored residents succumbs to long illness."
She talked about how most of the families in the African-American community were connected through marriage, through their children's marriages and by their employers.
"It's a tangled web of biographies and newspaper reports," Kanes said.
Most of the former slaves who came to Maine worked on farms or took other hard labor jobs, and many of the women worked as maids. A couple of men were able to make it as blacksmiths.
Kanes' findings gave the sense that this new community was accepted by most of the white people in Lewiston, although the Irish immigrants didn't like them, and one report said that a group of Irishmen threw stones at one the African-Americans.
Kanes said the language points to a feeling that they were "well-liked and well-integrated. It's condescending but not negative."
Kanes shared some personal stories of the African-American community, including Robert Wilson and Armstead Johnson.
"Robert Wilson was born in South Carolina and worked at a stove store in Lewiston. In 1876 he married Kate Miller, daughter of Abby Thornton, another former slave who came to Lewiston in 1866," Kanes said.
"Armstead Johnson worked as a hostler in 1870 and in 1871 he married another former slave, Susan Cole, who was born in Virginia," Kanes said. "She did washing and ironing. She could read and he could not. He owned his own house at 521 Main St."
"What was life like for the former slaves in Lewiston?" Kanes asked. "It's a challenge to piece it together. I've looked at all kinds of records. Things like probate and census records give you some sense of where people lived, and marriage records show some kinds of relationships."
"If you can't read and write, you don't leave your own records, you don't leave your own stories. With the newspaper stories, at least you get something that might be close to their perspective," Kanes said.
"The newly freed slaves created their own community, but with a fairly small population to begin with," Kanes said. "They did draw from other communities nearby, like Leeds and Monmouth. I'm sure there were lots of connections we'll never know about."
She has been planning to continue her research on freed slaves in Maine and the Civil War for quite a long time.
"It's just so interesting once you get into it," she said of her research.
Those who would like to offer any pertinent information about Kanes' work may contact her by email at cakanes@gmail.com.

In this Aug. 4, 2015, file photo, the Wassataquoik Stream flows through Township 3, Range 8, Maine, on land owned by environmentalist Roxanne Quimby, the founder of Burts Bees. A nonprofit group has been formed to preserve and protect the newly-designated national monument in Maine. Quimby's foundation last August donated 87,000 acres to the federal government for the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument in Maine's North Woods.
The private group, called Friends of Katahdin Woods and Waters, plans to work collaboratively with the National Park Service, which manages the monument. The group's president, Lucas St. Clair, says its initial focus will be on organizing volunteer opportunities, developing education programs and advocating for the monument. Eventually it will raise money for specific projects to supplement federal funding.
President Barack Obama made the designation six months ago, creating the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument on land donated by Burt's Bees co-founder Roxanne Quimby's foundation.
Republican Gov. Paul LePage earlier this month asked President Donald Trump to take the unprecedented step of returning the land to private ownership.

LaBonte works to sell governor's budget

Autor: Rice, Andrew.

Información de publicación: Sun Journal ; Lewiston, Me. [Lewiston, Me]. 28 Feb 2017.

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/labonte-works-sell-governors-budget/docview/1872680408/se-2?accountid=14708

Resumen: LePage's budget seeks to delay implementation of the surtax until 2018, while proposing the surtax be picked up by all Mainers, not just those in the highest tax bracket, despite Mainers voting in favor of the measure. In January, Assistant House Majority Leader Jared Golden, D-Lewiston, said House Democrats are committed to upholding "the will of the voters and improving public education funding in Maine," referring to Question 2.

Texto completo: AUBURN -- Jonathan LaBonte, a staffer for Gov. Paul LePage and mayor of Auburn, gave the first of two scheduled talks on the governor's proposed two-year budget Monday.
He's insisting the $6.8 billion plan will lower Maine's tax burden despite the "dark shadow" caused by referendum questions that raised the minimum wage and added a surtax to fund education.
LaBonte, director of the Office of Policy and Management for the LePage administration, said the passing of referendum questions 2 and 4 in November 2016 made the governor's job to craft the budget even more difficult.
The governor is calling his final two-year budget a "do no harm" spending plan.
"He did the best he could with the tools he was given to ensure that we could do no harm to Maine's budget based on those referendums that passed," LaBonte told the audience Monday.
Question 2 helps fund education by adding a 3 percent surtax to Maine households making more than $200,000 a year, while Question 4 raises the statewide minimum wage.
A small crowd of about 20 people came to the Hilton Garden Inn in Auburn to hear LaBonte. Most were members of the Maine Heritage Policy Center, which is hosting both events this week.
LaBonte said the education surtax makes Maine second in the country in top marginal income tax rate. LePage's budget seeks to delay implementation of the surtax until 2018, while proposing the surtax be picked up by all Mainers, not just those in the highest tax bracket, despite Mainers voting in favor of the measure.
He said his office recently completed an analysis of the impact from Question 2, which he said would result in job losses, a decrease of $600 million in Mainers' disposable incomes and a state GDP hit of $160 million -- all in the first year of implementation.
"What we're seeing from our analysis is that there is real, significant harm," LaBonte said, adding that his office will soon release its official findings to the public.
Approval of Question 4 raised the minimum wage from $7.50 an hour to $9 an hour this year. It will increase $1 an hour per year until it reaches $12 in 2020.
As for raising the minimum wage, LaBonte said his office predicts major costs, especially to the restaurant industry. He said LePage is urging lawmakers to make changes to the bill to "protect those businesses and jobs."
LaBonte is scheduled to speak at another Maine Heritage Policy Center luncheon in Portland on Tuesday, as the LePage administration continues its discussions on the budget.
The governor's next town hall meeting to discuss the budget is scheduled for Wednesday, March 8, in Yarmouth.
Matthew Gagnon, the CEO of the Maine Heritage Policy Center, which advocates for fiscally conservative policies, called Monday's discussion one of the most important -- and topical -- of the year for the group.
"It's an important document, and how we handle it is also very important," he said.
Gagnon said the organization recently crafted a legislative guide book to help "define the conservative agenda" in the coming legislative session.
"Whether they accept it as is, or make radical modifications to it, which is likely, it still sets the agenda," Gagnon said of the proposed budget.
Democratic lawmakers have criticized the governor's budget proposal since it was unveiled in January, saying many of its elements have already been rejected by the Legislature in previous years.
In January, Assistant House Majority Leader Jared Golden, D-Lewiston, said House Democrats are committed to upholding "the will of the voters and improving public education funding in Maine," referring to Question 2.
Both Gagnon and LaBonte pointed to news reports this week on the state maintaining $1 billion in its "cash pool," contributing the numbers to LePage's fiscal policies since being elected.
"The state's not struggling to pay its bills the way it has during previous administrations," Gagnon said.
Rick Holden of Portland, a longtime member of the center, said his chief concern is rising taxes. LePage's budget looks to shift the state to a flat income tax by 2020.
Other questions for LaBonte centered on increases in the cost of education, and crafting regulation following the legalization of recreational marijuana.
During the discussion, LaBonte also touched on LePage's aim at the "welfare state" in Maine. The governor's budget proposes to eliminate the municipal General Assistance program, which assists residents with essential needs such as rent, food and utilities.
The move would have an immediate impact in Lewiston and Auburn, which have both reported increases in their General Assistance budgets.
The budget would also reduce time limits in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program from five years to three years and eliminate MaineCare eligibility for "able-bodied" parents with earnings over 40 percent of the federal poverty level.
The budget also proposes cutting about 500 state employee positions and launching a "vacancy study" to further reduce the size of the workforce.
To take effect on July 1, the start of a new fiscal year, the budget must pass by a two-thirds majority in both chambers of the Legislature.

Texto completo: ORONO -- Dan Kaplan and his family's grass-fed beef operation, Heartstone Farm, in Charleston is the fourth installment in the University of Maine Cooperative Extension "Growing Maine" series of short documentaries highlighting Maine food producers and farm families.
Kaplan, along with partner and farmer Tara Hesseltine and her son, Logan, are relatively new to farming. They quickly learned that the expertise of other farmers could help avoid reinventing the wheel.
In this video, Kaplan introduces his mentor, Fred Sherbourne, a former dairy farmer who has made a big difference to a new family farm.
The Growing Maine video series helps consumers get to know their food sources better, as farmers and producers share their behind-the-scenes perspectives on how decisions are made. For those aspiring to farm, the videos are a way to hear directly from farmers and producers about what is most important to them.
UMaine Extension helps support and grow the food-based economy statewide, and is the only entity that touches every aspect of the Maine Food System, where policy, research, education, production, processing, commerce, nutrition and food security and safety are integral and interrelated.
Videos in the Growing Maine series can be viewed online at extension.umaine.edu/maine-food-system/growing-maine. Viewers also have the opportunity to suggest future story ideas for new videos that will be released throughout the year.

Texto completo: Concert will benefit
UU church, outreach
Troy Bennett, left, and Dave Rowe, the duo known as The Squid Jiggers.
AUBURN--Concerts for a Cause, the new concert series at the First Universalist Church, Unitarian Universalist of Auburn, will host the Squid Jiggers for a special St. Patrick's Day concert at 7:30 p.m., March 17.
The concert, which will feature songs of Ireland, Scotland, songs the Canadian Maritimes and the Maine coast, and original songs by "the Squids," will be held in the church's vestry and will include a cash bar with beer and wine, including show sponsor, Baxter Brewing's offerings.
The Squid Jiggers are Maine-based folk duo comprised of veteran musician-entertainers, Dave Rowe and Troy R. Bennett. They took their name from the A.R. Scammell song "Squid Jigging Ground," which is a wonderful musical depiction of fishing for squid in the waters off Newfoundland. They combine their talents on guitar, bass, bodhran and tin whistles to lay down a thunderous musical base for their robust vocal harmonies.
Rowe grew up on the Maine music scene, learning the music trade literally at the feet of his late father, Tom, while the elder Rowe was traveling the country playing bass guitar with Schooner Fare. Starting out as a young roadie and coffee gofer for his dad, Dave began playing out professionally as a bassist at the age of 15, and hasn't had a real job since! In 1993 the Rowe men got together and formed a duo, which eventually became known as Turkey Hollow when Denny Breau joined. When not performing with the Squid Jiggers, Dave also tours as a solo artist. With the formation of The Squid Jiggers, Dave comes full circle, picking up his dad's trademark Steinberger bass guitar and playing many of the songs he used to hear Schooner Fare perform so many years ago.
Bernnett grew up collecting Schooner Fare ticket stubs and albums. He started his professional career touring with a the Maine Irish band, Rakish Paddy. Upon leaving Rakish Paddy he adopted the gypsy life, traveling Europe with his guitar, collecting stories and busking on street corners. He eventually buckled down, studying Anglo-Irish literature at University College Galway and the University of Southern Maine. On his return to the states, he started a Celtic duo called Bailey's Mistake, as well as the Half Moon Jug Band, a high-octane folk group specializing in new uses for kazoos and banjos. The Half Moon Jug Band continues to tour extensively across New England. When not playing with Jug Band or The Squid Jiggers, Bennett travels southern Maine, making tintypes and collecting rare phonograph records.
Concerts for a Cause is a new concert concept begun recently at the church to bring special concerts to the L-A community while raising money for area charities. The concerts are produced by Rowe, who is also church choir director, with a lot of help from a very involved and capable committee of church members.
Tickets for this concert are $17 in advance or $20 at the door. To purchase tickets or for more information about this special concert with the Squid Jiggers and other Concerts for a Cause, visit <http://www.uuconcerts.org> or call the church at 207-783-0461.

The Continental Mills of Lewiston is now installing a thousand Draper looms. This mill has been operating about 2,700 looms, of which for several years a thousand have been Drapers. The installation now going in brings the equipment up to about 2,200 Drapers and 400 or 500 plain looms.

(Editorial) While we are not overwhelmingly convinced the City of Auburn needs a new city charter, we by no means consider the proposed new charter measure for Auburn an unsatisfactory bill. We think the city would carry on its affairs as well under the new charter as under the existing one, but whether the former would really bring about greatly noticeable improvement in the administration of municipal affairs is open to question. There is a question in our mind as to whether the proposed four-year term for city councilmen represents an advantage over the existing two-year setup. Four years is excellent in those instances where an outstanding individual is elected to the council, but this time span can go against the grain if an elected councilman turns out to be something less than a success as a member of the city's top administrative body.

A local man who plans to start a semipro football team here will go before the Lewiston City Council Tuesday to get access to the Lewiston Athletic Park football field. Vincent Singleton, a painting contractor who coached the semipro Maine Lions, which is based in Old Orchard Beach, thinks there's room enough for two Eastern Football League teams in Maine. "I felt support was very good here in Lewiston-Auburn," Singleton said. "It's an opportunity to establish a team here so the fans could see a good semipro team." The league has teams in New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, he said.

Texto completo: NEWBURYPORT -- Beyond his terms as mayor and city councilor, Alan Lavender was involved in an array of local causes, from manning the table at the library's used book sales to selling hot dogs at high school football games.
He served with his wife, Betty, on the board of the Friends of the Newburyport Public Library and wrote brain-teaser puzzles for the library's monthly newsletter.
Erford Fowler, Lavender's friend and neighbor for more than 30 years, said he never saw Lavender get mad.
"He was one of the kindest, nicest people anyone would ever want to meet," Fowler said Tuesday, just hours after Lavender was killed in a plane crash. "You can't say enough about him."
Fowler said Lavender made a name for himself as city councilor, in part, by advocating for residents at a housing complex flooded by a water main break. He helped speed up repairs, Fowler said, and attended to their concerns.
As a neighbor, he never passed by without a friendly hello, Fowler said, even if he was in a rush.
About two years ago, Fowler saw Lavender beginning to assemble the pieces of an aircraft in his yard. It would take him a year to complete, eventually outgrowing the confines of his quarter-acre yard.
Lavender had loads of technical know-how and ability, Fowler said, and was captivated by the joy of aviation.
"He was thrilled" about getting his plane aloft, he said.
Lavender spent his early years in Thomaston, Maine, according to a 2002 Globe story. When he was in seventh grade, he moved with his family to Barrington, R.I., where his father accepted a teaching job. After graduating Barrington High School in 1961, he received a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Rhode Island in 1965 and a master's degree from Boston University in 1972. Starting in 1965, Lavender worked as an engineer for a number of manufacturing companies. He had lived in Newburyport since 1973.
Police Lieutenant Matthew Simons said he always enjoyed bumping into Lavender and his family while they were strolling downtown in the summer. Lavender always cheerfully reminded him that he had appointed him to the police department as a rookie officer in 2002, upgrading him from reservist, Simons recalled.
Simons said Lavender loved sailing and was often on the water. And he had recently rekindled a youthful love for aviation, one that he had set aside while working as an engineer, raising a family, and holding elected office.
"His wife told me that he was into aviation very early on life and then kind of fell out of it for a period of time," Simons said. "As time went on, he kind of found his love for aviation again and wound up building a plane and flying it."

Texto completo: Plan to create baby eel lottery up for debate
AUGUSTA ï¿½ A plan to create a lottery system for valuable eel fishing permits in Maine is facing a critical test with a public hearing.
Fishermen seek baby eels in Maine, which is the only state with a significant fishery for the animals. They can fetch more than $2,000 per pound at the dock.
The eels are sold to Asian aquaculture companies for use in food.
A group of lawmakers wants to create a lottery system to allow new people to get into the fishery when other fishermen leave it. Right now, itï¿½s closed.
Jury selection begins in service driverï¿½s trial
PORTLAND ï¿½ Jury selection began in the trial of a Portland man accused of inappropriately touching one of his passengers while driving for a ride service company.
WMTW-TV reported Clemente Ilama has denied charges of unlawful sexual contact following his arrest earlier this month.
The victim has claimed Ilama made sexually graphic comments to her and moved his hand up her leg twice while serving as her driver for Atlantic Transportation. The company provides non-emergency rides for MaineCare recipients to medical appointments.
Compiled from wire reports Atlantic Transportation officials said Ilama will not continue to work for the Portland-based service.
Attorneys began selecting a jury for Ilamaï¿½s trial Monday.
Dozens of credit union customers report theft
BELFAST ï¿½ Authorities are urging customers of a credit union in Belfast to check their accounts after dozens of people said hundreds of dollars were stolen from their accounts.
Police said someone apparently installed a skimming device in an ATM at the Down East Credit Union branch on Saturday.
Police Sgt. Daniel Fitzpatrick said more than two dozen people have reported thefts from their accounts, with some accounts losing around $100 and others being emptied entirely.
One person reported that more than $900 disappeared.
Police havenï¿½t found any other skimming devices on other ATMs in the area.
An investigation remains ongoing.
The credit union said the breach didnï¿½t happen internally and it believes less than 100 members were affected. Most of the withdrawals were made in New York.
Lisbon man pleads guilty to leaving scene
LEWISTON ï¿½ A Lisbon man has pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of a fatal crash that killed a motorcyclist.
The Sun Journal reported 24-year-old Zachary Greene entered the plea on Friday. He faces up to five years in prison for the felony.
The June crash left 28-year-old Jeff Sickel, of Brunswick, with severe head injuries. He died at a hospital.
Police said Greene had been returning home when he made a left turn in his pickup truck and collided with the motorcycle.
Greene initially said he thought he heard something hit his truck, but left because he hadnï¿½t seen anything.
Prosecutors said Greene later told police he thought he saw a motorcyclist ï¿½fly over the hoodï¿½ and land in the roadway.
A judge is expected to sentence Greene in April.
Maine gas prices dip, bucking US trend
AUGUSTA ï¿½ Gas prices in Maine have fallen a little more than 2 cents in the past week to an average of $2.30 per gallon.
GasBuddyï¿½s daily survey of 1,228 gas outlets in Maine said the stateï¿½s average differs from the national trend. The nationwide price of gas has increased a half a penny in the last week to $2.28.
Gas prices in Maine were nearly 53 cents higher on Sunday than they were a year ago, but they have fallen 7.5 cents from a month ago. National prices have increased about 54 cents from a year ago and gone up a little less than a penny from a month ago.
Public can weigh in on wind project
The public has the chance to provide input about the environmental impact of a proposed off-shore wind project.
Maine Aqua Ventus intends to install a two-turbine, 12-megawatt project off the coast of Monhegan Island. The turbine generator is designed to last about two decades, and the project also includes underwater and underground cables to connect to power lines.
The U.S. Department of Energy is hosting public meetings about the projectï¿½s environmental impact today at St. George Town Office in Tenants Harbor.
A presentation will be held Wednesday at 5:30 p.m. at Monhegan Island School.
The project shows enough promise that itï¿½s in the running for an additional $40 million federal grant.
Itï¿½s already received $10.7 million from the U.S. Department of Energy.

The plan faced a public hearing on Monday before the state legislatureï¿½s marine resources committee. Some fishermen said the lottery is needed because members of the fishery are aging and someone will need to take their place.

Texto completo: NORRIDGEWOCK ï¿½ Property owners can attend a workshop this weekend to learn more about their tax liability options related to the upcoming town-wide revaluation, which is the first such taxable property review the town has conducted in more than two decades.
Town Manager Richard LaBelle said properties in Norridgewock are valued between 60 and 65 percent of real market values, meaning if a property was sold for $100,000, the town likely has it valued for around $65,000.
ï¿½We really want to try to get up and level off at 100 percent,ï¿½ LaBelle said. The revaluation would create equalization of property values, he said, as some are currently overvalued and some are undervalued.
There are about 2,200 taxable properties in town, LaBelle said.
LaBelle said the last time Norridgewock had a town-wide revaluation was in 1992. The same company that did that revaluation ï¿½ RJD Appraisal of Pittsfield ï¿½ was contracted to do this one as well at a cost of $169,000. Field work lasted from June through October, and RJD will return in the next week or two to verify values.
LaBelle said higher valuations would not mean higher taxes for residents. He said that as property values went on paper, it would actually help reduce the tax rate, which is currently $21.20 per $1,000 of property value. The townï¿½s budget is what determines the tax rate, and he said as property values increase the tax rate should decrease.
As part of the revaluation process, the town is holding a workshop for property owners at 9 a.m. Saturday in the town office.
A key aspect of the workshop, LaBelle said, is explaining that Norridgewock homeowners who qualify for the stateï¿½s homestead exemption on property taxes may not have been receiving the fullest exemption because the town has had lower property values on its books. The homestead exemption is a program that provides property tax relief for qualified homeowners. A homeowner must be a permanent resident of Maine, their home must be their permanent residence and an applicant must have owned a home in Maine for the 12 months prior to applying.
For 2016, the total relief allowed was $15,000. But LaBelle said Norridgewock taxpayers who were approved for the exemption only received a portion of what they could have because of the lower valuation.
ï¿½So as these assessments come to 100 percent, then those eligible will receive the full homestead exemption allowance,ï¿½ LaBelle said.
The townï¿½s assessing agent, Donna Hays, will conduct the Saturday workshop and taxpayers will have an opportunity to learn about the homestead exemption and other exemptions as well, such as the ones for military veterans and for residents with disabilities.
ï¿½A lot of people are eligible and arenï¿½t aware or donï¿½t know theyï¿½re there,ï¿½ LaBelle said.
Additionally, local forester Daren Turner will be at the workshop to discuss the tree growth tax program, which can help reduce taxes for property owners who designate parts of their property as productive forest.
LaBelle said other programs residents can use and how a property needs to be designated will also be discussed.
ï¿½Itï¿½s an opportunity to come learn about these programs and enroll,ï¿½ LaBelle said.
All exemptions take effect April 1, LaBelle said, so this workshop would allow residents to apply ahead of that date.

Texto completo: Trump not a true Republican
Republicans used to believe in smaller government -- the less a government governs the more individual freedom the citizenry enjoys. Republicans used to believe in avoiding federal deficits.
Today's Republicans see a president ruling by executive decision. They see an economic plan to increase spending and cut taxes, a proven recipe for economic disaster, yet so many Republicans are falling in line. No true Republican would argue with my conclusion that endangering national security is an impeachable offense.
My father and father-in-law were registered Republicans, but I fear President Donald Trump for many reasons.
He wants to bring back low-paying, high-labor jobs to make us compete with developing nations instead of economic powerhouses such as Dubai, where they plan to deploy flying, driverless taxis. In Japan and China, they have busses powered by fuel cells, and in the U.S. Trump wants to bring back coal. This old company store mentality breeds dependency, something a dictator would do because when the next meal depends on government, the population can be expected to be loyal.
He wants to limit freedom of the press. Again, what dictators do.
Just a few years ago, the Republican cry was "read your Constitution." Today, Trump fires individuals who have performed their constitutional duties as in the case of former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates when she refused to defend his travel ban. What Trump has done is much worse than losing emails, and he deserves to be impeached. Any true Republican would agree with me.

Plastic bag ordinance weak
While I congratulate the Belfast City Council for passing a draft version of an ordinance to curb single-use plastic bags, the ordinance falls far short of what is needed in order to change our addiction to plastic.
As written, the draft ordinance only applies to three large stores. Also, by placing a 5-cent fee on plastic bags, many people will either pay it or simply ask for paper, which is free and requires resources to make and dispose of. The proposal also has no enforcement teeth, such as a fine for failure to comply.
Plastic bags litter the landscape, clog sewage pipes, break down into microscopic particles in the water and contaminate the atmosphere when incinerated. City government can provide a nudge toward reducing some of this by acting decisively, not timidly. After all, the seatbelt law helped nudge us toward lower highway death rates, and no-smoking laws have helped reduce tobacco use and exposure to secondhand smoke.
Like tobacco, the mindless use of plastic can be controlled, if not eliminated -- but only through courageous political action.
Jeff Shula
Belfast
Hold a town hall
It was very disappointing to hear Sen. Susan Collins tell constituents during her brief Facebook Live meeting on Feb. 21 not to call her office because her phone lines are clogged and constituents needing help can't always get through.
We are also constituents, and we are calling and writing about our profound concerns and worries for our country, health care, education, a rise in hate crimes, Russia's potential involvement in the presidential election, the environment, human rights, animal protection and many other issues.
Collins later told the Associated Press that she didn't mean that her constituents shouldn't call her but to reach out to her office through its website. This is why so many of us keep asking Collins to meet with us. We believe that as a moderate Republican, Collins has one of the most critical and important roles to play at this moment in history, and we want to talk to her.
Hearing a staffer at her office tell me that at town hall meetings only a couple of people get to speak is ridiculous. Such meetings can be moderated and managed well so that many get to speak -- unlike at the Facebook Live meeting, where only a couple people got to ask a question. Collins works for us, and if she wants us to stop calling, the best thing she can do is hold meetings where we can speak to her directly.
Zoe Weil
Surry
Police should avoid lethal force
The recent BDN article about how the Maine attorney general's office investigates police shootings stated that investigations don't look at how a shooting could have been avoided. Shouldn't avoiding a shooting be the ultimate goal in the first place.
As it stands, the attorney general's office has found every officer-involved shooting justified no matter the circumstance and no one tries to determine if the situation could have been avoided. In my opinion, if police knew they would be held accountable for their actions, there would be less shooting of civilians by the police.

Voting restrictions erode democracy
I attended the two recent public hearings on voter restriction bills: LD 121 and LD 155. Maine legislators should be wary of both.
It is important, in this time of misrepresentation and "alternative facts," to be clear that there is no evidence that Maine has any kind of election "integrity" or "voter fraud" problem. No one at these hearings -- including the sponsors -- were able to present any evidence to the contrary. Deputy Secretary of State Judy Flynn testified against both bills, saying "In the 22 years that I have worked for the Secretary of State I am unaware of any evidence being presented to the State of voter impersonation at the polls."
An investigation into double voting by out-of-state college students, who LD 155 specifically targets, by former Republican Maine Secretary of State Charlie Summers found no evidence of voter fraud on the part of students.
A professor at Loyola Law School in a comprehensive 2014 study found only 31 credible instances of impersonation fraud from 2000 to 2014 out of more than 1 billion ballots cast.
In 2014, the U.S. Census Bureau reported that Maine ranks only behind Florida for the oldest population in the United States while also having the smallest population in the country for children under age 5. Wouldn't it make sense -- for the economic health of Maine, for building a future workforce, to address the needs of the state's aging population -- to embrace these young people while they are here and make them more connected to Maine rather than less?

Senior forward Kayli Cunningham contributed 13 points and 10 rebounds and junior Rebecca Batron came off the bench and chipped in with six points and five rebounds for No. 5 Dexter (14-6), who went on to win the regional title on Saturday against George Stevens Academy.
Peach posted seven points and six rebounds in the first 2 minutes, 39 seconds of the game, but sat the rest of the half after picking up her second foul.
The Tigers led by three when she departed and still took a four-point lead into the intermission.
The Owls (17-2) were within five with 4:32 left in the third period but the Tigers scored the final eight points of the quarter. Peach scored six of them and Cunningham had the other basket to go with an assist on a Peach layup.
Madawaska couldn't get any closer than 11 the rest of the way. The aggressive Tigers outrebounded Madawaska 43-24.
"Dexter is a very good team," said Madawaska coach Dean Gendreau. "The Peach girl was really good. They were very aggressive and we aren't used to that constant aggressiveness."
He also said they had to a chance to make some headway when Peach was on the bench, "but we couldn't get our offense going. It was slow in developing."
Energetic point guard Desiree Belanger registered 11 points, three steals and three rebounds for Madawaska and Hannah Nadeau provided five points and seven rebounds. Jenna Dugal added six points and six rebounds. Brianne Thibeault had four points and four rebounds.

Texto completo: SOUTH PORTLAND, Maine -- In her native country, Ghislaine Bola was a doctor. Here, in Maine, she's not even qualified to work in an ambulance. Her medical degree doesn't translate into the U.S. health care system. Plus, she doesn't speak English well enough yet to communicate with most patients.
But a new course at Southern Maine Community College is helping Bola with both problems.
The ESOL-to-EMT program -- short for English for speakers of other languages to emergency medical technicians -- is the first of its kind in the state. It's designed especially for new Mainers. The course teaches students to be language interpreters and state-certified EMTs. It also gives special language support as the students take the class in English.
The program began this semester when a local ambulance company told SMCC it needed bilingual EMTs. Scarborough based North East Mobile Health Services said the skill was vital given greater Portland's growing and diverse immigrant population.
Sixteen students enrolled in the first class. They come from Burundi, Somalia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iran, Cameroon and Honduras. Somali, Kirundi, Lingali, Farsi, French and Spanish are among the students' native languages. They all speak English, as well.
"Almost everybody here has some sort of (previous) medical training," instructor Paul Froman said. "Four members of the course would have been physicians back home, but when they came to the states it didn't mean anything in our medical field, unfortunately."
Bola specialized in pathology while a doctor in the DRC. She's been in the U.S. for a year and a half. She thinks she can become a doctor here, too. She sees this class as a first step. English is her fourth language.
"I have a barrier. The barrier here is the language. English is a barrier," she said. "But I know that with enough English courses I will go through that barrier. I wish to be a doctor, even if it will take more time, much money. I believe, with God's help, I can make it here."
Froman said the learning in his class goes both ways. He's taking the opportunity to learn as much as he can.
"We have more and more immigrants coming. As a paramedic, I'm running into more of them as patients. So, to have that one-on-one, non-emergency interaction with the class, I couldn't pass it up," he said.
A few weeks back, a student in his regular EMT class asked if it was permissible, in Islamic culture, to expose a woman's chest while performing CPR. Froman knew the answer was "yes" after asking the same question to one of his muslim students in the ESOL-to-EMT class.
"Before, I never would have had that knowledge," he said.
North East Mobile Health Services has committed to granting job interviews to all students who successfully complete the program. It expects to hire 15 to 20 EMTs in the coming year. SMCC is offering the class again in the summer.

Texto completo: PORTLAND, Maine -- Shortly after a 16-year-old transgender boy hanged himself while on suicide watch at the Long Creek Youth Development Center last October, a girl at the juvenile prison also tried to take her own life, strangling herself before being rushed to the hospital, according to a citizen group that monitors the prison.
Charles Maisie Knowles was the first person in at least 20 years to die while being held at Long Creek, according to the Maine Department of Corrections. But the pair of suicide attempts -- one of which resulted in a death -- are part of a persistent pattern of self-harm among inmates at Long Creek, according to the South Portland prison's Board of Visitors, a five-member body appointed by the governor and empowered by law to inspect and review the corrections facility.
Long Creek increasingly is being used to house young people with severe mental illnesses, even though the prison is ill-equipped to treat them and struggles to keep them safe, the group said.
"To date, several youth continue to self-harm, have made attempts or threats to strangulate themselves, and require unsustainable levels of constant observation," the Board of Visitors wrote in its 2016 annual report.
Tonya DiMillo, a trained social worker and chair of the board, said the report was based on visits to Long Creek and ongoing discussions with the facility's staff and administration.
[MORE: Transgender teen's suicide raises concerns about Maine youth corrections center]
The findings reflect a trend in recent decades when Maine prisons and jails increasingly house mentally ill inmates who cannot find care in the state's scarce and limited psychiatric facilities. In 2015, more than one-third of adult inmates and nearly half of juveniles were prescribed psychiatric medications, a Bangor Daily News investigation found.
In Long Creek, the rate of mental illness is even higher, according to a Department of Corrections report on the 79 youth who were committed to the facility as of July 1, 2016. Nearly 85 percent of inmates arrived at the youth prison with three or more mental health diagnoses, 42 percent had previously been treated in a residential treatment program -- and 30 percent came directly to the prison from such a facility, the report found.
Department of Corrections Commissioner Dr. Joseph Fitzpatrick acknowledged that "there are some kids coming in with significant mental health issues that are beyond the training of the corrections staff." But in a brief interview he referred the question on why this is happening to the Maine Department of Health and Human Services.
"I don't oversee that part of the system," Fitzpatrick said.
The Department of Health and Human Services does not place people in Long Creek, according to spokeswoman Samantha Edwards. "Only a judge can make a decision of whether to transition a youth or anybody from a treatment setting to a correctional setting and vice-versa," Edwards said.
At a joint meeting of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety and Appropriations and Financial Affairs committees on Feb. 15, DiMillo urged lawmakers to start asking why mentally ill youth are being moved from psychiatric facilities to prison.
"What is going on in the mental health system?" she said.
Knowles hanged himself from the inside door of the isolation room where he was on suicide watch. An investigation by the Maine attorney general's office found nothing criminally suspicious. An outside expert hired to review the prison's suicide prevention policy is expected to submit a report soon, though it is unclear whether that will be made public.
The Board of Visitors, however, suggested that the suicide was a predictable outcome of putting severely mentally ill adolescents behind bars.
Without the resources to treat the uptick of youth with severe mental illnesses, Long Creek can only try to keep them safe, according to the Board of Visitors report.
Attempts to stop young people cutting and strangling themselves include the use of "mechanical restraints," around-the-clock observation and specialized clothing that cannot be torn to make a noose, DiMillo told legislators earlier this month. But the constant efforts are overextending prison staff and "another tragedy could be around the corner," she warned.
"These youth need to be moved out of the facility or we are going to have another incident," DiMillo said in testimony before two legislative committees. "I need to be clear: We will have another incident."
Many months before Knowles succumbed to his self-inflicted injuries on Nov. 1, the Board of Visitors raised the alarm about imprisoning "youth in acute mental health crisis" at a facility that "is not medically equipped to deal with" them, the report states.
Knowles suffered from anxiety, depression, borderline personality disorder and possibly schizophrenia, according to his mother. After her son's death, Michelle Knowles said he wasn't getting the mental health care he needed because he was being detained at Long Creek awaiting trial, rather than being a committed prisoner.
Fitzpatrick challenged this assertion at the time saying that detainees and committed prisoners receive the same " comprehensive treatment services" from the prison's team of psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers and the commercial medical contractor Correct Care Solutions.
Despite the hard work of the prison's "talented, gifted" staff, they just don't have resources or training to treat young people with severe mental illness, DiMillo said.
Fitzpatrick put it bluntly: "We're a correctional facility, not a treatment facility."
The "unsustainable" efforts to protect mentally ill youth who cannot be treated at Long Creek is also taking a toll on the prison's staff, according to the Board of Visitors. The group says it is driving "staff turnover, burnout, or the inability of staff to build positive relationships with all youth residents." It also interferes with the staff's ability to help rehabilitate other young prisoners and detainees, the board said.
On Monday, Fitzpatrick acknowledged that Long Creek inmates' severe mental health issues are putting pressure on its staff.
"The stress at the facility is related to the acuity of the population," he said.
These concerns are becoming public even as Long Creek is looking at cutting staff at its school.
As part of Gov. Paul LePage's proposed budget, the Department of Corrections would to cut 11 positions from the school operated at Long Creek. Although three of the posts were unoccupied when the budget was drafted, cutting 10 of the school's 22 teaching positions, and its assistant principal, might endanger the school's accreditation, corrections officials said.
The cuts would eliminate more than $1 million in annual personnel costs from the facility's overall budget of close to $17 million. Fitzpatrick said that a contractual seniority system shapes which teachers could be cut and that the Department of Corrections is working with the Maine Department of Education to find a way to keep the school accredited if the cuts go through.
"I'm absolutely committed to not losing the school," he said Monday.
Fitzpatrick said his department is working closely with the Department of Health and Human Services to try to solve the problems at Long Creek. DiMillo, who worked in child services for about 20 years, said that part of the problem is that there aren't as many Maine facilities to care for the mentally ill as there used to be.
"If there was a place for these young people to go, I think that Long Creek would be working very hard to place them there," she said.

Texto completo: BREWER, Maine -- Gov. Paul LePage's threatened cuts in municipal and educational funding will be the primary subject discussed when local and state government representatives of Bangor and Brewer meet on Thursday, officials said Monday.
The annual meeting, Bangor City Council Chairman Joe Baldacci said, briefs the area's state representatives and senators on issues dear to the municipalities.
"We want to be sure they hear us loud and clear from both sides of the river," Baldacci said Monday.
Released Jan. 6, LePage's two-year $6.8 billion state budget would eliminate state funding for local public school administration costs in favor of an $11 million fund over the next two years for "regional education service agencies that school districts can contract with to provide services."
LePage proposed cutting the entire $12.1 million allocation for General Assistance in the next fiscal year. The program, which gives poor Mainers vouchers to cover things like rent, food and medication on the condition that most seek work, has long been on the fiscally conservative Republican's chopping block.
LePage also seeks to delay for one year the implementation of Question 2 on November 2016's statewide ballot, which placed a 3 percent surtax on annual income over $200,000 to fund education.
Such cuts will be harrowing to municipalities such as Bangor and Brewer, which already suffer from state underfunding, Brewer Mayor Kevin O'Connell said.
"The big thing is the state budget," O'Connell said. "The one thing that you are going to hear the most of is property taxes. What they are dictating in Augusta will dictate property taxes locally."
Brewer's mill rate is $21.52 per $1,000 of valuation. Bangor's is $22.50 for the 2016-17 fiscal year that ends June 30. The property tax rates mean that owners of homes valued at $100,000 pay $2,152 annually in taxes in Brewer and $2,250 annually in Bangor.
Bangor's mill rate has risen steadily from $17.48 per $1,000 in 2006 while Brewer's has fluctuated between $16.56 per $1,000 in 2006 and the present rate, according to a property tax history at maine.gov.
As an example of underfunding, Baldacci estimated that Bangor had lost at least $5 million in state funding over the last five or six years because of state government failure to meet legally required funding levels for general assistance and education.
Bangor and Brewer have eliminated or left positions unfilled or cut some city services in response, this while state government has m ore than $1 billion in its cash pool, a state record. That surplus "looks good on the books," O'Connell said.
"More power to him," O'Connell added of LePage, "but I wonder if he would support the things he supports now if he were still the mayor of Waterville."
LePage served as mayor from 2004 until being elected governor in 2011, according to a city history.
The Bangor-Brewer meeting will be held at the Brewer auditorium at 5:30 p.m., O'Connell said.

Texto completo: BANGOR, Maine -- What do you get when you combine three high schools and a vocational training facility all together?
You might have what the state is looking for as it plans to fund new high school construction.
Maine Department of Education is promoting a pilot project that would spur consolidation among neighboring high schools and is counting on struggling school districts to be among the first places to try it out.
"This is an opportunity to start with a blank sheet of paper," Robert Hasson, Maine's acting education commissioner, told a group of people Monday night at Eastern Maine Community College.
The department held a meeting Monday at EMCC to promote its Integrated Consolidated 9-16 Educational Facility Pilot Project. It was the third such meeting held across the state this month in advance of the first application deadline in May.
Under the program, the state would provide financial and planning support to school districts to merge multiple high schools with a career and technical, or CTE, school and build partnerships with area higher education institutions. The state would prefer a project that combines at least three regional high schools, likely requiring the collaboration of multiple school districts and the construction of a new school building, which the state likely would fund.
It could prove a tough sell in communities that have a checkered history with consolidation. Disputes over local control, funding shares, tax rates and stances on education policy have prompted many municipalities to break away from one district for another or to go it alone.
Hasson said school districts should "suspend all the assumptions and all the conversations that have gone on before" and use this as a new starting point.
"This is really an opportunity to address this freshly," Hasson added.
As opposed to "forced marriages" of past consolidation efforts, this one relies on a "grass-roots" push by local school leaders, Hasson argued. He hopes the financial incentives and planning supports offered by the state will drive applications and result in a creative proposal.
The state would start by working with one group of towns as a pilot project, but the new model they create could be pushed out to other parts of the state in the future.
Aaron Chadbourne, the governor's policy adviser on education, said this could be an chance to reboot in districts that have seen a continued decline in students in recent years because of demographic trends in places such as Aroostook, Washington and Piscataquis counties.
Alternatively, it could be an opportunity for more populous districts with high schools that are close together, such as Lewiston-Auburn, he suggested.
Pat O'Neill runs the Tri-County Technical Center in Dexter and serves as assistant superintendent in AOS 94, which includes the Penobscot and Somerset county towns of Dexter, Exeter, Garland, Ripley, Harmony and Athens.
O'Neill said towns across the region have struggled with tight budgets and declining student populations in recent years. AOS 94 is already in talks with the Guilford school district about the possibility of forming a plan and applying to become the state's pilot project. That plan likely would involve other Piscataquis County districts as well.
"This could be right up our alley, but everyone's not at the table yet," O'Neill said after Monday's meeting.
The application process happens in two phases. By May 1, the school boards who want to merge must submit the basics of their proposal to the state. If that part is approved, the Department of Education will offer help with the second phase, when the organizers tackle the much more difficult work of designing their new governance and education models, planning the new school, lining up financial support from the state and voting locally on the new plans.
In all, the department expects the process to take about three years to design and plan and another two years to build any new facilities, according to Scott Brown, who runs school construction programs for the state.

Texto completo: WOODLAND -- Close to 15 people gathered in the Woodland Town office on Feb. 21 for a public hearing on retail marijuana in the town, with some standing against the wall in the small space.
Selectmen Tom Drew kicked off the hearing by playing devil's advocate and presenting an argument he has heard from residents in favor of retail pot in Woodland.
"Although I did not vote in favor of making marijuana legal," Drew said, "I've listened and heard from other towns around us that someone is going to grow marijuana around here. All kinds of tax money will be made from this new farming practice, that is going to be legal in the state of Maine."
While Drew believes prohibiting marijuana would be positive, he asked who would enforce that prohibition if law enforcement has yet to deal with the sale and usage of harder drugs in the town.
"We're not going to change the law by prohibiting marijuana in this town," said Drew. "I don't have a moral high horse to sit on, or any self-righteous stones to throw, and I'm not going to make Woodland safer by permitting its legal structured safety. I find it discouraging to be devil's advocate over a subject that, 20 years ago, meant a lot more than it does today."
With that in mind, Drew said that prohibiting retail operations in Woodland will do little to stop farmers from eventually growing pot in other parts of the state, adding that "as a town, we will be laughed at."
Kim Parent, of Power of Prevention, was present at the meeting, and responded by informing selectmen that Caribou, Fort Kent, Frenchville, Linneus, Presque Isle and Littleton are all prohibiting retail marijuana.
Parent says the negative impact of retail legalization could be avoided "If everybody takes a stand and says 'No, we don't want it," adding that "Anyone who works in treatment or recovery will tell you that the people using harder drugs all started with marijuana."
Drew said he appreciated what Parent does, adding that he has a hard time, and as a dairy farmer in a rural town, has employed people who he later discovered had been addicted to drugs and witnessed the impact of illicit substances on an individual.
"I've seen the effects that drugs have," Drew said, "and it enrages me because you have a fully functioning police department paid for next door, and a dozen houses in that town that harbor kids who passed the gateway long ago."
Parent said that, in Caribou, police are conducting an ongoing investigation on drugs and drug houses and are unable to comment on any of their findings.
"I completely understand that," Drew said. "However, someone is going to benefit from the money collected through this farming practice. This is going to be the world we live in whether we like it or not. I don't like it, but there are lot of things I don't like about the world. If you're going to have to live in a world that places these burdens on taxpayers, they should get some form of justice through legal financial restitution.
Selectman Will Barnum contributed by saying the "simple fact remains that this is still against federal law," and that it isn't wise for a "state or municipality to let it happen under their nose."
"I've ran into addicts during my day job," Barnum said, "and have yet to find anyone who didn't start with marijuana. By legalizing it, all we're doing is making the problem easier to get into."
Drew took a moment to clarify his reasons for representing a side in favor of retail legalization.
"When I was elected, I was elected to represent the public whether I agree with them or not," Drew said. "In the past couple weeks, I've received messages from people voicing concerns on the other side and that's what I just presented, because that's my job. It's not my job to vote on any personal bias. I came here to express other people's arguments and concerns, and I have no apologies for it, but I do respect that the consensus in the room is what it is, and that makes me proud."
Residents at the meeting expressed concern with activity already occurring in Woodland, where an individual who allegedly grows pot has a significant increase of traffic on their road has had crop stolen from him. Because of this, public attendants felt that retail legalization could potentially cause a spike in this activity and overall crime in the town.
"The only setup I would endorse is one that grows Charlotte's Web," said Barnum, "which is a strain of marijuana that has no THC and mostly CBD: the medicinal component of marijuana. And (CBD) does work, evidence shows that it can treat neurological disorders. I don't know if smoking it is the best way to take it, though."
Barnum's reiterated the federal illegality of marijuana should not be taken lightly.
"For us to say 'well, the state voted in favor of it, let's let everybody grow weed, smoke dope and chill,' that's not a good idea," Barnum said. "My other argument is based on what I see in my day job. I don't have a problem with stoners, but I do have a problem with meth-heads and bath salters, and they all started out as stoners."
Selectman Carl Grant's primary motivation in voting against legal marijuana is that the majority of Woodland voted against it in the recent election.
"My personal thoughts are that I wouldn't want a facility next to my property or in my neighborhood," Grant said.

Texto completo: JetBlue Airways will soon begin offering service from Worcester to John F. Kennedy Airport in New York City, the Massachusetts Port Authority announced Tuesday.
The route will run on a daily basis, but don't get too excited. There is no scheduled date for when it will start operating. First, work must be completed to install a new $30 million landing system that will allow pilots to land in low-visibility conditions. That is expected by the end of the year, according to Massport spokeswoman Kelly Smith.
The new flight will expand Worcester Regional Airport's reach to JFK, a major international transportation hub. JetBlue, the Worcester airport's only commercial passenger airline, also offers daily flights to Orlando and Fort Lauderdale.
JetBlue has operated out of Worcester since 2013. State subsidies were used to lure JetBlue to the airport, which came under Massport control in 2010.
The airline considers New England a major market. JetBlue is the largest carrier at Boston's Logan International Airport. It also offers flights from Providence, Portland, Maine, and other regional airports.

Texto completo: The Republican mayoral primary is no longer uncontested.
Republican Nevin Young, 48, an Annapolis attorney, filed Friday to run against Mayor Mike Pantelides in the 2017 election. Along with the two Republicans there are two Democrats in the contest, with business owner Gavin Buckley and Sen. John Astle, D-Annapolis, competing against each other.
Young considers himself an outsider candidate. He hasn't held public office since he was junior class president at his high school.
His campaign will focus on the Annapolis Police Department, with an emphasis on updating its technology and focusing on community policing.
This is a major tenet of his campaign. A few areas of emphasis will be maintaining the department's body camera program and also looking to get dashboard cameras for patrol cars.
"When I learned they didn't have cameras in their vehicles to record traffic stops, I was frankly pretty shocked," Young said. "I just think it is really irresponsible to buy the other bells and whistles but not have basic protections both for police officers and motorists."
He also pledged to make city government more responsive to citizens and wants the city to consider moving elections in line with presidential election or gubernatorial election years.
This could help drive turnout, Young said.
And while the city doesn't have authority over the issue, Young wants the city to push for the removal of the Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney statue on the State House grounds.
Taney wrote the 1857 Dred Scott decision, in which the U.S, Supreme Court ruled Scott, a slave, was not free even though he lived in a state that prohibited slavery.
Young said the city could ask to have the statue removed and given to a museum.
"It is certainly historical... but it needs to be put in a proper place today, it doesn't belong on the State House lawn in Annapolis," Young said.
Young first came to Annapolis in 1992 when he attended St. John's College. Originally from Maine, Young said he loves Annapolis because of its architecture and the people.
After leaving college he joined the National Guard where he worked as a electronics technician. He practiced that profession as a private citizen as well, before he finished his degree and pursued a career in law.
He was admitted to the bar in 2005 after attending law school at George Washington University. He practices mostly real estate and commercial law but Young is currently representing a man who has sued the city for racial discrimination.
Daniel Hodges filed the lawsuit Nov. 21 claiming that he was stopped and searched by Annapolis police officers for being a white man leaving a predominately African-American and Latino neighborhood.
Young said if he were to be elected he would recuse himself from that lawsuit, which is ongoing.
An obvious question for a Republican in this era of party politics is: Why run against a Republican mayor?
Young's reasoning for running rests on what he perceives is the city's inability to tackle big problems, such as updating police force technology and practices.
The current mayor doesn't work well with this council, Young said.
Young also positioned himself as a Republican who doesn't tow the party line. He said he has been registered as unaffiliated for years before registering as a Democrat for the Maryland primary presidential election.
Now Young is registered as a Republican because his views align with "more liberty" and "less government."
"That's the first and last time I'll ever be registered as a Democrat," he said with a laugh.
Young's entry into the mayoral race now makes the election more competitive. There are now two "outsider" candidates in Young and Buckley, who could benefit from frustration that voters have shown with long-term politicians.
Pantelides ran as an outsider candidate in his first run, but is now campaigning as an incumbent with a four-year record. He plans to kick off his campaign in early March with rounds of door knocking before his official campaign announcement on March 23.
Astle has yet to file for mayor or announce his campaign kickoff event. He has served in the Maryland legislature for more than three decades.
The primary election will take place on Sept. 19 with the general election following on Nov. 7. Both are Tuesdays.

Legislative Hearing: Highway Tolls Debate Draws Spirited Crowd

Resumen: HARTFORD - Highways in Hartford and Waterbury need hugely expensive maintenance, transit users are tired of steadily rising fares and Fairfield County drivers want relief from ever-worsening traffic congestion. Supporters believe they gained ground last week when the state budget office predicted the special transportation fund will run out of money in about three years. "The only people paying the gas tax are Connecticut residents," said O'Dea, who said out-of-state drivers are getting a free ride on state highways. None of the current toll proposals mention border towns, and instead focus on variable-price congestion tolling - a system with locations most likely in Fairfield County and Greater Hartford. Joseph Sculley, head of the state trucking industry lobby, said truckers are already paying fuel taxes and special registration fees toward the highway system, and suggested the state look to rail commuters in affluent Fairfield County and electric vehicle owners for new...

Texto completo: HARTFORD - Highways in Hartford and Waterbury need hugely expensive maintenance, transit users are tired of steadily rising fares and Fairfield County drivers want relief from ever-worsening traffic congestion.
Those were just a few of the arguments put forward Monday at a five-hour-long legislative debate over the idea of levying tolls on Connecticut highways.
A long line of speakers agreed the transportation network needs plenty of improvements, but virtually nobody - not truckers, commuters, border-town residents or others - is interested in paying more.
Lobbyists and lawmakers dominated the debate, but one resident - retired dentist Bob Hall of West Hartford - showed up to endorse tolls.
"Is this going to be popular? Of course not," Hall told the General Assembly's transportation committee. "But Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maine - they all have toll roads."
Hall dismissed the argument that tolls are just a disguised tax, and said there's a pressing need for revenue.
"I consider this a user fee," he said. "I'm concerned the money is running out and we can't maintain our infrastructure."
Connecticut hasn't charged tolls in more than two decades, and opponents insist that motorists will be furious if they're brought back. Toll proponents say transportation safety is at risk if bridges and highways continue deteriorating faster than the state maintains them.
The committee will decide in March whether to advance a toll proposal to the full General Assembly. Some Democrats endorse the idea, but others - and the vast majority of Republicans - have been leaning against it.
Supporters believe they gained ground last week when the state budget office predicted the special transportation fund will run out of money in about three years. Afterward, several Republican lawmakers indicated they might be open to some compromise for raising new revenues.
"The sins of our fathers are catching up to us. We keep kicking the can down the road," Rep. Tom O'Dea, R-New Canaan, said Monday.
He said he'd oppose tolls unless there's some offset - such as a steep reduction in the gas tax - to benefit residents.
"The only people paying the gas tax are Connecticut residents," said O'Dea, who said out-of-state drivers are getting a free ride on state highways.
O'Dea and others appeared drawn by the prospect of getting money from through traffic.
Bethel First Selectman Matt Knickerbocker countered that Connecticut people who commute on the highways would be hit with a new expense. He and other western Connecticut speakers said they're adamantly against border tolls that would hit their communities but not the rest of the state.
"I have 1,500 to 2,000 commuters who cross the state line daily to get to work. They're young working people - I'm deeply concerned about the equity," he said.
None of the current toll proposals mention border towns, and instead focus on variable-price congestion tolling - a system with locations most likely in Fairfield County and Greater Hartford.
Ridgefield First Selectman Rudy Marconi endorsed tolls, and suggested an income tax credit to offset the cost for commuters. Overall, tolls amount to a fair fee on highway users, he said.
"You're going to pay to ride the train, pay to fly in a plane - you need to pay to use our roads," Marconi said. "We're at the point where layoffs have taken place and we still have a $1.5 billion, $1.7 billion deficit. We cannot cut our way out of this. We have to generate revenues."
Joseph Sculley, head of the state trucking industry lobby, said truckers are already paying fuel taxes and special registration fees toward the highway system, and suggested the state look to rail commuters in affluent Fairfield County and electric vehicle owners for new money.
O'Dea shot back that Connecticut reaps more than $1 billion a year in taxes from Greenwich, New Canaan and Stamford, and said out-of-state drivers should be the ones to pay.
Rick Dunne, chief of the Naugatuck Valley Council of Governments, said drivers aren't subsidizing transit.
"We provide probably the largest subsidy in the state to people who drive motor vehicles. Every [transportation] mode is subsidized, not a single mode pays for itself complete," Dunne said.
Senate Republican Leader Len Fasano revived the GOP's proposal for a roughly $70 billion, 30-year transportation bonding schedule. It would require sharp reductions in state borrowing for other purposes, but wouldn't require tolls or new taxes, he said.
Republican Sen. Toni Boucher, co-chairwoman of the transportation committee, said that's far better than tolls. She contended that variable-price tolls are inherently unfair because they chiefly target rush hour commuters who have no control over their work schedules.
"Connecticut already taxes too much, and this is just another tax. It's unfair," Boucher said of tolls.
Chairman Tony Guerrera, D-Rocky Hill, cautioned that Connecticut is risking another Mianus River Bridge disaster if it doesn't catch up on overdue bridge and highway maintenance.
"I'm telling you if we don't do something, something bad is going to happen. I don't want it on my watch," Guerrera said. "We'll all be sitting here saying, 'Why didn't we do something?' Because we wanted to get elected again."

Our state's Medicaid funding problem

Texto completo: Medicaid is causing major problems for many state budgets, including ours.
Missouri state Sen. David Sater said it best: "Medicaid is eating our lunch!" Louisiana's share of Medicaid has almost doubled in just nine years, increasing from $1.7 billion in 2008 to $3.3 billion in 2016. However, President Trump's recent executive order urging federal agencies to grant waivers and exemptions from Obamacare has changed the game, and many states are now moving to fix Medicaid and save their budgets. Consider the following recent waiver requests:
Maine wants to limit most people on Medicaid to five years of benefits;
Kentucky would require many recipients to work, even if it is volunteer work, if they are physically able;
Wisconsin wants to drug-test enrollees;
Governors in Arizona, Missouri and Ohio are requesting similar waivers.
These proposals provide a picture of how states are being given more power to control their own destiny, and they are moving to pursue innovative approaches to health care that would lower their Medicaid costs and require beneficiaries to have more "skin in the game."
Medicaid benefits and access rules would increasingly depend on what state a beneficiary lives in -- and what is offered in California could be radically different than Texas.
In April, the Louisiana Legislature reconvenes to once again address our budget deficit crisis -- what Medicaid picture will they paint? Will they be sending a Medicaid waiver request to President Trump?

Texto completo: Dick Piper isn't deterred when temperatures hover in the 20s and piles of snow surround Our Lady of Victories in Monument Square. No matter the weather, he parks his brown van in the statue's shadow every Wednesday, ready to sell free-range meat.
The Wednesday edition of the Portland Farmers Market, which draws more than two dozen farmers downtown every week, officially ended in November, but Piper shows up throughout the winter to sell his meats, honey and prepared foods. It's not a big money-maker. Piper, 73, says it's mostly enjoyment that brings him out. He needs to get away from his Buckfield farm and socialize.
"I usually like to talk to cows and pigs," Piper said with a laugh one Wednesday this month. "I guess I am a social guy. I used to be a project superintendent for a large earth-moving company. My job was trying to keep all the workers happy and also the public, the inspectors, the town fathers. So I guess I chatted all my life."
On many Wednesdays, he has another farmer next to him to chat with. Jodie Jordan, 65, from Alewives Brook Farm in Cape Elizabeth, shows up in Monument Square "as long as it's above freezing" and it's not snowing or raining. He says he's there for the majority of winter Wednesdays.
Jordan's products mostly don't overlap with Piper, and Jordan says they have a small but loyal winter clientele.
"Most people are glad we're there," Jordan said. "If they stop by, they buy a little bit of something. Apples, carrots, potatoes, cabbage or something."
The Portland Farmers Market continues on Saturdays throughout the winter at an indoor location in the East Bayside neighborhood. But the Wednesday market ends in November, when most farmers are down to apples and root vegetables.
Piper's meats and Jordan's produce are available year-round. Though the two-man market doesn't generate a lot of business - unlike the summer and fall, when the square is jammed with farmers and shoppers - there are other business opportunities in winter. Piper says he sometimes meets a local chef or store owner and makes a deal that pays dividends outside of the market.
"All it takes is one person in a business deal to make the whole winter worthwhile," Piper said.
An outdoor farmers market used to be a typical scene in Portland. Ramona Snell helps run Snell Family Farm in Buxton and has been coming to the market since the 1980s. She usually goes to the Wednesday market with her daughter Carolyn, "but we go in the normal time," she said with a chuckle.
Snell said Portland's market used to run outdoors in the 1930s and primarily sold meat. A rabbi came down to the Federal Street location and blessed the chickens, and during World War II it was a source of butter and other items that were rationed, she said.
Carolyn Snell works as the marketing coordinator for the group that runs the market. Though the tiny Wednesday market makes for a quirky scene, Ramona Snell said, it makes sense for a few farmers to sit out in the cold Maine winter.
"I think it's economically sound," she said. "They're looking for a revenue stream through the winter. If they can be there dependably, then people will respond to them. If you're just going to be there hit-or-miss, then people don't plan on getting things from you."
Piper has not been hit-or-miss. He's been sitting in Monument Square for about six years, he said. He's there on Wednesdays unless it's snowing, in which case he plows snow in the Buckfield area.
He's still busy into his 70s because he likes to keep moving. Twenty years ago he quit his construction job. He and his wife sold their house on Higgins Beach in Scarborough and bought their ranch in Buckfield, where they raise cattle, pigs, lambs and goats. They've got a greenhouse out back and are adding another this winter. His wife has a commercial kitchen and makes prepared foods like meat pies.
They're growing because Piper is bullish on local farming in Maine.
"A lot more people are starting to think like the Europeans," Piper said. "They're buying local and being healthier. I think it's finally getting around to that."
As he sees demand growing for local products, Piper said his Wednesdays at Monument Square might be getting busier in the winter.
"I'm surprised in a way it isn't bigger. I think the day's coming when it's going to be bigger," he said.
In the meantime, Piper will be there on Wednesdays until the rest of his farmers market buddies join him in April. Jordan will often join him - and get ready for an earful.
"He likes to talk to people, no question about that," Jordan said.
It's a lot about socializing and getting out of the house, Piper said. And of course he'll be there in the winter, Piper says with a shrug. It beats his alternatives.
What else is a farmer going to do in winter?
"I can tell you one thing you can do: that's the honey-do list," Piper said, "but that costs you money." James Patrick can be contacted at 791-6382 or at: jpatrick@pressherald.com Twitter: mesofunblog

Texto completo: Dylan Collins gets 50 years for murdering two men killed in a fire he set in 2014 in Biddeford
Dylan Collins, in an online diary found by authorities after he was charged with setting a deadly apartment house fire in Biddeford in 2014, referred to the two men who died in the blaze as "collateral damage."
The 20-year-old pleaded guilty to murder and arson this month, and at his sentencing hearing Monday, relatives and friends of the two victims told a judge that the two men, friends since childhood, were much more than that.
Michael Moore, 23, and James Ford, 21, grew up across the street from each other.
"They were like peas in a pod," said Paul DeHetre, a family friend who knew the two for years, going back to when he dated Moore's mother, who died a few months before her son perished in the fire. DeHetre said he kept up with the two men, especially Moore, making a point of visiting Moore during his regular visits back to Maine after he moved to New Hampshire.
He told Moore to call him if he ever needed anything. But he said Moore was proudly independent and never picked up the phone to ask for anything.
Another friend of the two men, Douglas Walters, said the pair were both creative. Ford had invented a role-playing game that he hoped might be turned into a video game. Walters and Moore were working on a novel.
"Even the term 'best friends' falls short," Walters said of how close he felt to the pair. "I can only say I lost two brothers. The unfairness of their deaths haunts me every hour of every day," he said, adding that the game materials and book drafts were both destroyed in the fire.
Collins will serve two consecutive 25-year sentences on the murder charges. The two men lived on the upper floor of the 12-unit Main Street building, which Collins set on fire because he was upset about seeing a former girlfriend kissing someone else. He told police he intended to scare her with the fire. The former girlfriend, her family and the other tenants of the building all escaped the blaze.
Collins was sentenced to another 25 years for arson, also to be served consecutively, but that sentence was suspended under a plea deal with prosecutors and Collins' lawyer. Collins will be on probation for the maximum of four years once he is released, and will be subject to psychiatric and substance abuse evaluations.
Collins wrote a brief statement that was read by his lawyer.
"I am so very, very sorry for what happened," it read in part.
York County Superior Court Justice Lance Walker said the callousness of the crime, along with diary entries that indicated Collins planned to engage in a shootout with police if they tried to arrest him, suggested the need for a stiff sentence. Collins was ultimately arrested without incident, despite possessing a duffel bag containing a rifle and ammunition at the time of his arrest.
Collins' history of mental illness might have suggested there was some leeway for leniency, Walker said, but that was offset because Collins "willfully" let his problems go untreated.
The only mitigating factor the judge cited in Collins' favor was the fact that he changed his plea to guilty, sparing everyone the trauma of a trial.
Walker ultimately accepted the sentence worked out between prosecutors and Collins' lawyer.
After the fire, Collins' mother told the Portland Press Herald that her son had had behavioral problems since he was a child and the problems seemed to worsen in the months leading up to the fire.
Relatives and friends said Monday that their lives have been devastated by Ford's and Moore's deaths, but they mostly ignored Collins in their statements before the court.
James Ford, whose son died in the fire, did say that Collins did not appear particularly remorseful about the men's deaths. Ford looked over at Collins, sitting at a table with two lawyers, after he finished his statement, but Collins did not return his glance.
Walters told the judge that he visited with Ford and Moore at least once a week, and chided himself for not being with them on the night the fire broke out. "I should have been there," he said.
DeHetre said he would often spend a few minutes visiting with Moore on Saturday mornings at Shaw's supermarket, where Moore stocked the produce section. A supervisor told DeHetre that Moore would always take the biggest box of produce to stock, he said.
DeHetre said Moore cared for his mother, who was bedridden with diabetes and neck and back injuries from a car crash. The two butted heads, he said, and eventually Moore decided to move out. But even then, he didn't abandon her.
DeHetre said he talked to a landlord he knew who had an apartment for rent and vouched for Moore, but Moore instead found the place on Main Street, just a few hundred feet from his mother's apartment. Despite their occasionally rocky relationship, Moore still planned to be there if his mother needed him, DeHetre said.
Justine DiPietro, Ford's sister, and Tonya Dalbo, Moore's sister, gave their victim impact statements together, holding hands as they walked up to the lectern.
Both talked about their last contact with their brothers and the holes left in their lives by their deaths.
"I have a daughter who will never know her uncle," DiPietro said.
Dalbo said the death of her brother "hurts me every day of my life." Edward D. Murphy can be contacted at 791-6465 or at: emurphy@pressherald.com

Texto completo: Gasoline prices slip to $2.30 a gallon in Maine
Gas prices in Maine have fallen a little more than 2 cents in the past week to an average of $2.30 per gallon.
GasBuddy's daily survey of 1,228 gas outlets in Maine says the state's average differs from the national trend. The nationwide price of gas has increased a half a penny in the last week to $2.28.
Gas prices in Maine were nearly 53 cents higher on Sunday than they were a year ago, but they have fallen 7.5 cents from a month ago. National prices increased about 54 cents from a year ago.
Counterfeiting, piracy cost economy billions per year
Counterfeit goods, software piracy and the theft of trade secrets cost the American economy as much as $600 billion a year, a private watchdog says.
In a report out Monday, the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property says the annual losses range from about $225 billion to $600 billion. The theft of trade secrets alone costs the U.S. $180 billion to $540 billion annually. Counterfeit goods cost the United States $29 billion to $41 billion annual; pirated software costs an additional $18 billion a year.
The commission labels China the world's No. 1 culprit, accounting for 87 percent of counterfeit goods seized entering the United States.
Orders for manufactured goods increase in January
U.S. businesses boosted their orders for long-lasting manufactured goods in January by the largest amount in three months.
Orders for durable goods rose 1.8 percent in January after two months of declines, the Commerce Department said Monday. But excluding the transportation category, orders fell 0.2 percent, the weakest showing since June.
January home sales drop as mortgage rates rise
Fewer Americans signed contracts to purchase homes last month as rising prices, higher mortgage rates and a dwindling supply of available homes appeared to frustrate many potential buyers, especially in the West.
The National Association of Realtors said Monday that its seasonally adjusted pending home sales index fell 2.8 percent to 106.4, the lowest level in a year.
The decline suggests that higher mortgage rates, which have risen by about a half-percentage point since the presidential election, may be starting to bite into sales. And the number of homes for sale has fallen to near-record lows, forcing many would-be buyers to bid up prices. The combination of higher prices and rising mortgage rates are making homes less affordable.

New Gloucester man held after scuffle with officers
Police said a New Gloucester man became combative and tried to grab an officer's holstered weapon during a confrontation early Monday in North Windham. An officer used a Taser on the man before he was finally subdued.
Richard Dean Valliere, 40, was charged with refusing to submit to arrest, assault on an officer and disorderly conduct, according to the Cumberland County Sheriff's Office.
Sheriff's deputies assisted Windham police after being called to investigate a report of a suspicious man trying to break into Little Caesars Pizza, 741 Roosevelt Trail, in North Windham around 2:14 a.m., the sheriff's office said in a news release.
When deputies arrived and made contact with Valliere, "he became confrontational and assaultive towards them," the sheriff's office said. "Valliere was told he was under arrest and he then grabbed onto a deputy's holstered handgun. Valliere continued to struggle and was attempting to pull the handgun out of the deputy's holster."
A second deputy used a Taser on Valliere, but police said he continued to struggle. Officers eventually got him under control before transporting him to the Cumberland County Jail in Portland, where his bail was set at $3,000 cash.
He was still being held at the jail Monday night.
Valliere is scheduled to appear in court on April 12.
Eustis
Snowmobile crash claims life of Massachusetts man
A Massachusetts man died Sunday in Maine's seventh fatal snowmobile crash this year.
Dennis Picard, 60, of South Chatham was killed when he failed to make a sharp turn along a trail in Eustis as he followed his group, the Maine Warden Service said.
Paramedics pronounced Picard dead at the scene.
The state medical examiner's office will examine the body. The incident remains under investigation by the warden service.
Six people have died since Jan. 2 in other crashes in Windham, Oakland, Piscataquis County, Buxton, Sidney and Newport.
AUGUSTA
Defendant completes specialty court program
In the predawn hours of May 31, 2014, Ronald J. Oberst set fire to a home on Pine Knoll Road in Winthrop, sending four people fleeing into the darkness.
Oberst, who had recently returned to the area from Tucson, Arizona, pleaded guilty in January 2016 to two counts of arson in connection with the blaze, as well as a charge of theft for taking a vehicle belonging to a Winthrop woman and to operating without a license.
On Monday, after more than a year in Kennebec County's Co-Occurring Disorders and Veterans Court program, Oberst was able to withdraw his guilty pleas to all but one arson charge.
During the brief hearing at the Capital Judicial Center, Oberst was sentenced to eight years in prison, with all but an initial 259 days suspended - which he already served - and placed on three years probation. He also was ordered to pay $8,000 restitution, which he has already done.
That was the result of his successfully completing the specialty court program. On Monday, Oberst sat at a table in the courtroom next to his defense attorney, Michael G. Keefe, and spoke about his experience in a program that the founding justice once labeled as "probation on steroids."
"Thank you for the program," said Oberst, now 50, of Winthrop. "I've learned a lot, and I've come a long way. It's helped me a lot, and I'm grateful for the program."
District Court Judge Evert Fowle, who was district attorney when he helped co-found the program in 2005, complimented Oberst for completing the program.
"If I'm confident anyone's found the path to success, it's you," he said.
Fowle stepped down briefly from the bench to shake Oberst's hand during the sentencing hearing in front of about a dozen people, many of them participating in the specialty court, who also applauded Oberst.
LEWISTON
Lisbon driver pleads guilty in fatal motorcycle crash
A Lisbon man has pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of a crash that killed a motorcyclist.
Zachary Greene, 24, entered the plea Friday, the Sun Journal reported. He faces up to five years in prison for the felony.
The crash last June left Jeff Sickel, 28, of Brunswick, with severe head injuries. He died at a hospital.
Police said Greene was returning home when he made a left turn in his pickup truck and collided with the motorcycle.
Greene initially said he thought he heard something hit his truck, but left because he hadn't seen anything.
Prosecutors said Greene later told police he thought he saw a motorcyclist "fly over the hood" and land in the road.
A judge is expected to sentence Greene in April.

Texto completo: A legislative committee heard testimony Monday on a proposed constitutional amendment to make it harder for campaigns to place citizen's initiative on the ballot.
AUGUSTA -- A legislative committee heard testimony Monday on another proposed constitutional amendment to make it harder for campaigns to place referendum questions on the state ballot.
Lawmakers are considering at least four bills proposing changes to the Maine Constitution - pending voter approval - in response to the increasing attempts by citizen groups to secure policy victories at the ballot box. The bills come three months after Mainers legalized marijuana, increased the minimum wage and raised taxes on wealthier residents to funnel more money toward education - all controversial policy issues that had failed to pass the Legislature and were opposed by Gov. Paul LePage.
Republican lawmakers and LePage have been calling for the reform of Maine's referendum process. Supporters say the process provides citizens with a powerful policymaking tool for times when politicians or partisanship block an issue that has popular support.
The latest proposal, considered Monday by members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee, would dramatically increase the number of signatures that citizen initiative or "people's veto" campaigns need to qualify for the ballot.
Ballot question committees must gather signatures from the equivalent of 10 percent of the votes cast in the previous gubernatorial election. That currently equates to 61,123 signatures from registered voters. A proposal from Rep. Stedman Seavey, R-Kennebunkport, would both increase that threshold to 15 percent and apply it to the number of ballots cast in the previous presidential election, rather than the governor's race.
Under those standards, campaigns would need 112,189 signatures from registered voters to qualify for the ballot, an increase of 84 percent.
Seavey said he's worried that the current requirement could lead to "competing constituencies" going back and forth every two years, passing and then overturning initiatives at the ballot box.
"I feel this process of signature-gathering should reflect the importance and responsibility of the citizens to directly make decisions that affect all citizens in Maine," Seavey said. "I believe that asking 15 percent of Maine voters to sign onto a citizens initiative is a more appropriate barometer, considering the importance of this process."
TOUGH CLIMB FOR AMENDMENTS
The Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee already has heard arguments for and against three proposals to change Maine's initiative process, although none has come up for a vote in committee. One proposal would permanently exempt wildlife issues, such as hunting rules, from being decided at the ballot box. Another would require petitioners to meet the 10 percent signature threshold in Maine's two congressional districts or in each of the state's 35 state Senate districts, rather than allowing petitions to be circulated in a more limited number of like-minded communities. Another proposal that would require campaigns to hit a 15 percent threshold in each county has yet to have a public hearing.
Lawmakers also are considering other bills to require more disclosure about ballot initiatives, whether through public hearings or by printing the entire language of an initiative on the ballot.
All of the constitutional amendment proposals face a steep climb. First, any proposal must receive two-thirds support in both chambers of the Legislature. Then a majority of voters statewide must endorse the proposal.
Nationwide, progressive or liberal-leaning interest groups have increasingly turned to statewide ballot campaigns to pursue policy changes that they cannot win through legislation. In Maine, interest groups on all sides of the political aisle have used the state's citizen initiative process with mixed success. But the 2016 ballot questions in Maine on marijuana, the minimum wage, gun control, tax hikes and ranked-choice voting were all pursued by liberal groups.
LePage, a Republican, has accused out-of-state liberal activist groups of trying to "hijack" the policymaking process and has warned lawmakers that they are becoming increasingly irrelevant amid the growth in citizen initiatives.
"We need to reform the referendum process and we need to return to a representative government," LePage said during his Feb. 7 State of the State address.
In the meantime, LePage also has urged the Legislature to effectively overturn some of the laws passed at the ballot box, including the 3 percent income tax surcharge on high earners to help fund education.
EXTRA WORK FOR ELECTION OFFICIALS
The Secretary of State's Office took no formal position on Seavey's bill Monday, but it cautioned that the higher signature threshold would not just require more work for the campaigns.
"While we understand the purpose of this bill is to make sure that the process of placing a direct initiative on the ballot does not become too easy, it must be noted that increasing the number of signatures would also increase the workload, not only for the secretary of state but also for municipal elected officials," said Melissa Packard, director of elections in Secretary of State Matt Dunlap's office. "Municipal officials must review petitions to determine if the signers of the petitions are registered to vote."
Two citizen initiatives already have qualified for the 2017 ballot. One asks voters to allow a casino in York County, and the second seeks to force the LePage administration to expand Medicaid coverage as allowed under the Affordable Care Act.

Texto completo: Bill Lessa feels good about what he's accomplished so far as a volunteer for the Waterville Police Department's new program that helps those in the community addicted to drugs get long-term treatment.
But that good feeling isn't without some frustration at the lack of infrastructure in the state to help those with a substance abuse disorder.
"Step one is to get them into detox. After that you can talk long-term treatment somewhere," said Lessa, who helped place two people in residential facilities. "That's where the issue kind of lies. ... It's a lack of detox centers, is what it really is."
The problem gets worse when you're trying to find detox centers for people who don't have insurance, he said.
Operation HOPE, which stands for Heroin Opiate Prevention Effort, is one part of the three-pronged approach the department is using to fight the ongoing drug epidemic, Deputy Chief Bill Bonney said. The goal of HOPE, which focuses on treatment, is not only to help those in need, but also to lower the demand for drugs in the area. During a time when the Attorney General's Office says nearly one Mainer is dying each day from a drug overdose, police departments across the nation, including 11 in Maine, are taking action with similar programs.
"So far there's been nothing easy about it, but we're committed to it," Bonney said.
In a little more than a month, the program has managed to help seven people, four of whom have already been placed in long-term residential facilities. It's also raised more than $6,000 in donations and recruited another volunteer.
Lessa, who suffered from an opiate addiction for years, said giving back feels good.
"Every day, I know what these people are going through," he said. "Hopefully they don't have to go through the extent of what I went through."
The program started on Jan. 15, and the police and volunteers, called "angels," have since worked with seven people, placing four in long-term treatment facilities. The other three have gone through short-term detox centers in Maine.
"The goal, obviously, of the program is to place them in long-term treatment facilities," Bonney said. "But the demand has far outpaced the supply of beds nationwide."
Residential and long-term facilities are ideal because they remove those struggling with addiction from their environments, where they may have easy access to drugs.
But finding the right fit and the right financial package can be tough, Bonney said. If the person struggling with addiction also has other mental health issues, that complicates the process even further because not many facilities are equipped to handle both, he said.
The three men and one woman who are now in residential treatment centers in programs that last about a month were very excited to get the treatment, said Officer Chase Fabian, who is a coordinator of the program along with Officer Ryan Dinsmore. Three people went to facilities in Maine and one traveled to Virginia after the facility waived the majority of the fee.
Some who went through short-term detox are staying clean on their own now, but there is one person who calls weekly to see whether they've found a place for her, Fabian said.
For every person the department has helped, there are many more who want help but aren't quite ready to get it, Fabian said.
He gets five calls each week from people who are interested in Operation HOPE, but who never "commit" and come to the station, he said.
"It requires a huge commitment on the part of the participant," Bonney said. They have to commit to changing their way of life and going to whatever treatment facility will take them.
Some of the volunteers working to match those who need help with the appropriate facilities know about that commitment firsthand.
Two of the angels -- Lessa and Eleanor Trask -- have personal experience struggling with addiction, and a third, Laurie Brown, has watched a family member struggle for years. They all signed on to show people there is hope and to help fight the epidemic.
"I think that's why they're so passionate," Bonney said. "That type of community involvement for people who have involved in opiate abuse is huge."
The department is partnering with the Police Assisted Addiction Recovery Initiative, or PAARI, to match people with residential facilities. Other partners include the Kennebec Valley Community Action Program, MaineGeneral Health, Healthy Northern Kennebec and the Discovery House of Central Maine, which is a program of Acadia Healthcare.
The angels help the department make calls to hundreds of facilities around the country, some of which are partners with PAARI. So far, three of the four trained angels have been involved in placements, Bonney said, and a fifth has signed on for the next training session. The volunteers are essential to making the program work, he said.
The volunteer angels "have spent hours upon hours working to get these people someplace safe," Bonney said. "There's no cookie-cutter way to get these people where they need to be."
But when the department is able to place someone in a residential facility for treatment, it feels great, Fabian said.
"The feeling you get when you're able to help somebody and get them treatment and hopefully change their life for the better -- it's unbelievable," he said. "I can't even describe it."
The department is continuing its strong enforcement efforts, focusing on arresting drug dealers who are moving the majority of drugs into the area, Bonney said. Fabian has just recently been reassigned to the detective division to help with investigations.

Resumen: Sen. Eric Brakey, R-Auburn, said his bill would eliminate an array of 47 state tax credits or exemptions for corporations in a range of industries and would result in as much as $225 million a year in additional tax revenue for the state budget.[...]Linda Caprara, a lobbyist for the Maine State Chamber of Commerce, the state's largest business organization, said Brakey is wrong to call the tax breaks and credits "carve-outs" and "corporate welfare."Among other tax credits and exemptions, the bill would eliminate one that provides a sales tax exemption on the purchase of watercraft in Maine, when the watercraft is moved outside of the state within 30 days of purchase.The bill also would eliminate reimbursements that the state pays cities and towns for property tax exemptions they provide on certain kinds of business equipment.Brakey said that beyond being able to eliminate the state's corporate income tax entirely, the bill also could provide between $50 million and $80 million for lowering the state's personal income tax rate.LePage has long pushed for a reduction and even the elimination of Maine's personal income tax, as well as a reduction in the state's corporate tax rate.

Texto completo: A bill before the Legislature's Taxation Committee would eliminate what the bill's sponsor term's "corporate welfare" in Maine. The savings from the change could be used instead to eliminate the income tax on Maine corporations.
AUGUSTA -- A Republican state lawmaker says he wants to get rid of what he calls corporate welfare - dozens of tax breaks targeted to help specific industries.
In return, he wants to use the additional revenue to eliminate Maine's income tax for all corporations.
Sen. Eric Brakey, R-Auburn, said his bill would eliminate an array of 47 state tax credits or exemptions for corporations in a range of industries and would result in as much as $225 million a year in additional tax revenue for the state budget. Brakey said ending the benefits would give the state the resources it needs to entirely eliminate its corporate income tax.
He said the corporate tax breaks are usually passed under the premise of making Maine a more attractive state for business.
"But I think that what happens, in essence, is the only people who really benefit from these carve-outs are the companies that are big enough to afford the lobbyists to get the carve-outs in the first place, and then the companies who can afford the legal teams to figure out how to use the carve-outs," Brakey said.
His bill, L.D. 311, is currently in draft form before the Legislature's Taxation Committee. It would wipe out a host of sales tax exemptions and other state tax credits for businesses, including everything from windjammer tour operators to two of the largest property-tax credit programs for businesses.
But Linda Caprara, a lobbyist for the Maine State Chamber of Commerce, the state's largest business organization, said Brakey is wrong to call the tax breaks and credits "carve-outs" and "corporate welfare." Caprara told committee members Monday that many of the different tax breaks were put in the law specifically to prop up business and protect jobs.
"These programs exist for a reason," Caprara said. She said the Legislature over the past two decades has carefully considered all the tax breaks Brakey would like to now do away with. "If there are programs that target specific industries, there's a reason for it," she said.
Rep. Gay Grant, D-Gardiner, highlighted one $2.85 million annual tax credit that is earmarked specifically for a shipyard with at least 6,500 employees. Grant noted there was only one shipyard in Maine with those numbers, and suggested that the tax credit was intended to help protect jobs at Bath Iron Works, although she did not mention the shipyard by name.
"As soon as you start looking at some of the devil in the details and you look at that and you want to talk about jobs ... I represent a district (where) there's a lot of employees covered in that 6,500 and that credit is there because we are promoting jobs," Grant said. "So we can't just sort of make a blanket statement."
EXPECTING WAVE OF OPPOSITION
Others on the committee agreed with Grant, saying they suspected there would be a lot of people to testify against the bill when it comes for a second public hearing in the weeks ahead.
Rep. Matt Pouliot, R-Augusta, said that had the bill been released before Monday, opponents would likely be lined up "out and around the Capitol 10 times."
Pouliot said he agreed with taking a comprehensive approach to reviewing tax cuts and whether they were working the way they were intended. He asked Brakey to consider instead forming a task force or working group to do a comprehensive review of those programs in question. "I'm concerned if we try to cram it into this legislative session we are not going to do it justice, frankly," Pouliot said.
He said the business community often reacts in a "knee-jerk" fashion, but if it sees elimination of the corporate income tax as being more to its advantage than what is gained from the tax breaks now in law, Brakey may win allies.
Brakey said he was open to the idea, and also that his bill was largely a starting point. He said he realized the committee and the Legislature may want to keep part, some or none of his proposal as it moves through the public process.
STARTING POINT FOR TAX REFORM
Others on the committee thanked Brakey for the bill, saying it was overdue and needed to attract quality jobs and companies to the state.
Rep. Stephen Stanley, D-Medway, said he's served 22 years on the Taxation Committee and appreciated a proposal that wasn't more of the same piecemeal approach to tax reform.
"This has some bite into it. I'm not saying this is what we should be doing, but it gives us a direction we should be going in," he said. "I think it is a good time that we really start taking a good, hard look at our tax policy. I think we are doing a lot of things that are really not benefiting a lot of people and we could do more. It's time that this Legislature come forward and do what's right for the people of Maine. We have to create jobs in this state."
Among other tax credits and exemptions, the bill would eliminate one that provides a sales tax exemption on the purchase of watercraft in Maine, when the watercraft is moved outside of the state within 30 days of purchase. "This is literally a sales tax exemption for rich people who purchase a yacht in Maine and then take it out of state," Brakey said.
The bill also would eliminate reimbursements that the state pays cities and towns for property tax exemptions they provide on certain kinds of business equipment.
It's estimated that the two programs - known as the Business Equipment Tax Exemption, or BETE, and the Business Equipment Tax Reduction, or BETR - will cost the state $36.9 million and $32 million, respectively, in 2017.
Both programs have been targeted for reductions and elimination in previous lawmaking sessions without success, but no previous bills have suggested erasing tax breaks as a means to eliminating the state income tax for all corporations.
Brakey said that beyond being able to eliminate the state's corporate income tax entirely, the bill also could provide between $50 million and $80 million for lowering the state's personal income tax rate.
He said the change, if approved, would move Maine from being one of the worst states for business, according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, to being tied for first place with states like Texas and Nevada, which have no corporate income tax.
"I think that would be quite a jump, and when we are struggling to compete with other states, both across the country and right here in New England, that could be something that could give us a real competitive advantage," Brakey said.
'SOMETHING IN IT FOR EVERYONE'
He said he believes the shift would help both large and small businesses equally.
"Everyone would benefit, whether you are a big guy or a little guy, rather than the current situation where only the big guys benefit," Brakey said.
He said he hopes Democrats and Republicans will back him.
"We hear a lot from folks on the Democratic side of the aisle that they are opposed to corporate welfare; we hear from folks on the Republican side that they hate taxes. So if we are eliminating corporate welfare to lower taxes, hopefully there's something in it for everyone," Brakey said.
He said he has provided a copy of his proposal to Gov. Paul LePage's office. LePage has long pushed for a reduction and even the elimination of Maine's personal income tax, as well as a reduction in the state's corporate tax rate. Peter Steele, LePage's communications director, declined to comment on Brakey's bill Monday.
The bill will likely be scheduled for a second public hearing and a work session before the committee in the weeks ahead. Scott Thistle can be contacted at 791-6330 or at: sthistle@pressherald.com Twitter: thisdog

Resumen: Tomorrow, Congresswoman Pingree will attend President Trump's first address to the Joint Session of Congress with Banah Al-Hanfy, a young Iraqi woman who was separated from her family due to Trump's executive order banning immigrants from seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States. On Tuesday, the 20-year-old student will be sitting in the U.S. Capitol to personally listen to Trump's first address to a joint session of Congress. Al-Hanfy will be seated in the House gallery with other guests who were directly affected by Trump's travel ban, and she hopes their presence shows the president the value of immigrants like her family. Al-Hanfy's family holds a special immigrant visa because her 48-year-old father worked as an Arabic-English interpreter for the U.S. military and as a public policy adviser for the U.S. government. Pingree's office has one guest ticket for the president's address to the joint session.

Texto completo: From press release: Tomorrow, Congresswoman Pingree will attend President Trump's first address to the Joint Session of Congress with Banah Al-Hanfy, a young Iraqi woman who was separated from her family due to Trump's executive order banning immigrants from seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States. (I'm trying to get in touch with Banah for interview/photos. --Megan)
One month ago, Banah Al-Hanfy was stuck in Iraq and unable to board a Turkish Airlines flight to reunite with her family in Maine because of President Trump's order barring immigrants from seven Muslim-majority nations.
On Tuesday, the 20-year-old student will be sitting in the U.S. Capitol to personally listen to Trump's first address to a joint session of Congress.
"I came here just to have a good life and a good place to live in," said Al-Hanfy, who spoke by phone Monday from Washington, D.C. "He needs to let people like me and others in."
Al-Hanfy will attend the address as a guest of Maine Rep. Chellie Pingree. Pingree's office helped bring the young woman from Baghdad to Boston after the courts temporarily halted the president's order. Al-Hanfy will be seated in the House gallery with other guests who were directly affected by Trump's travel ban, and she hopes their presence shows the president the value of immigrants like her family.
"We're not a threat," Al-Hanfy said. "We will help build the country. We will help to be a part of this country. We need to have a chance."
The White House did not respond to a request for a comment Monday. Trump is expected to issue a new immigration order soon, but it's not clear when that will happen or whether he will address it in his speech Tuesday.
Al-Hanfy's family holds a special immigrant visa because her 48-year-old father worked as an Arabic-English interpreter for the U.S. military and as a public policy adviser for the U.S. government. Labed Al-Hanfy, his wife, Soso, and two daughters, Jumana, 19, and Omaima, 13, arrived in New Jersey from Baghdad on Jan. 24. They flew to Portland the next day to stay with family members. Their oldest daughter, who was a student at the American University in Iraq, was supposed to follow her family within days. Then Trump issued his order Jan. 27 barring immigrants traveling to the United States from the seven countries: Iraq, Iran, Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Libya and Yemen. Banah Al-Hanfy was stranded.
The family had been threatened because of Labed Al-Hanfy's work for the U.S. government and was afraid for Banah's safety. Labed Al-Hanfy contacted the Portland Press Herald to share her story. After hearing about the family's experiences, Pingree's staff and a group of volunteers found an airline that would allow her to come to the United States.
After an 18-hour journey, Banah Al-Hanfy was reunited with her family Feb. 3.
"It's a new life to start," Al-Hanfy said. "Everything has changed since I came here and left my old life in Iraq."
Al-Hanfy and her family are living with relatives in Portland until they find their own housing. She already has become involved with a group called the Global Shapers Community, an initiative to engage young adults in addressing the world's problems. Al-Hanfy was studying accounting at the American University in Iraq, and she hopes to eventually resume her studies. She didn't like the snow at first, but the people she has met warmed her to Maine.
"The people are so, so amazing," she said.
Pingree's office has one guest ticket for the president's address to the joint session. Members of the Portland community who helped bring Al-Hanfy to Maine are paying for the trip to Washington and arranged for her to stay with friends at no cost.
Pingree said she invited Al-Hanfy to put a face to the immigrants affected by Trump's travel ban.
"Banah's father, Labed, helped to keep our service members safe in Iraq by acting as an interpreter, and in doing so he risked his own family's safety," Pingree said in a written statement. "We owe Labed a debt of gratitude and an earnest welcome for his selfless service to our nation. I am appalled that one of President Trump's first actions resulted in so much stress and fear for Banah and her family."
Al-Hanfy flew from Portland to Washington on Monday with the congresswoman and her staff.
"There was simply no excuse for what happened to Banah - she had the correct paperwork and legal status," Pingree said. "I hope the President will make clear (Tuesday) evening that his new immigration orders will not attack people who are coming to our nation legally simply because of their religion or country of origin. I also hope Banah will hear President Trump express gratitude for those who've served our military as her father did."
Labed Al-Hanfy is proud of his daughter and knows she will be a good example for her peers. The week they were separated by Trump's order was difficult, but the support they received convinced the family they wanted to stay in Maine.
"For that hard week, it showed us what kind of people that we are going to live among," Labed Al-Hanfy said.
Adam Burk, the executive director of the Treehouse Institute and founding curator of the Portland Global Shapers Hub, was one of the local residents who helped bring Al-Hanfy to the United States. He also helped arrange her transportation and lodging in Washington.
"I hope the people who have been in support of the unconstitutional Muslim ban have a chance to meet her, have a chance to see what wonderful character she has," Burk said.
Al-Hanfy's trip to the nation's capital will be brief but busy. After hearing Trump address Congress beginning at 9 p.m. Tuesday, Al-Hanfy and Pingree will attend a reception for members of Congress and their guests. Al-Hanfy also will take tours of national landmarks in Washington, which she glimpsed for the first time from the plane Monday.
"It was really amazing seeing it from the air," she said. "I just want to meet the people of D.C." Megan Doyle can be contacted at 791-6327 or at: mdoyle@pressherald.com Twitter: megan_e_doyle

Texto completo: LePage was on Fox News today talking about the ACA, the President's ball, the state's finances and his support for Trump's immigration orders.
During an interview Monday morning on the Fox News talk show "Fox & Friends," Gov. Paul LePage said the federal government should return $800 billion that he claimed it "stole" from Medicare funds to make the Affordable Care Act work.
When asked about President Trump's budget proposals, which would not cut defense spending, Social Security or Medicare, LePage said he was concerned about the stance on Medicare.
"I'm a little concerned that they are not going to touch Medicare," LePage said. "I think what they should be doing with Medicare is return the $800 billion that they stole to put into Obamacare. And I really do believe it was stealing from the American people."
LePage said Americans have been paying into Medicare with payroll taxes, and former President Obama "went in and took $800 billion out to make his program work and I really don't think that's appropriate. I think they should at least return that money."
The governor's claim is similar to one made by former Republican presidential hopefuls Mike Huckabee and Mitt Romney, who have said $700 billion was stolen from the federal medical insurance program that covers health care for those 65 and older. But according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonprofit and nonpartisan Washington-D.C. based think tank on the federal budget, the enactment of the Affordable Care Act did not reduce the amount of money going to pay for Medicare but reduced the amount Medicare spends.
"In fact, Medicare payroll tax revenues increased, increasing the amount that could be spent," a report by the committee notes. "Partially as a result of these changes, the Medicare Trust Fund is expected to be solvent through 2030, 13 years longer than projected before the (ACA) was passed."
Later in the short interview Monday, LePage repeated Trump's point that Congress should "repeal and replace" the Affordable Care Act. He said that instead of having to follow strict federal rules for health care funds under Medicaid, states should be given block grants to design their own health care benefit programs for people with low incomes.
"Get rid of it," LePage said. "One size does not fit all; every state has their unique dynamics."
LePage noted that Maine has the oldest population in the U.S., "so we need to have our own program that we can design to fit our state."
Other topics LePage discussed included the state's budget cash flow balance of $1 billion and his attendance at a ball for U.S. governors that was hosted by Trump at the White House on Sunday night.
"I understand, to your credit, you have $1 billion in the bank, in profit - that's a heck of a rainy day fund. How did you do that?" host Brian Kilmeade asked LePage. The governor responded by saying it was simply "tough management."
"We run it like a business; we have accountability. You know I don't spend a whole lot. I only spend what I need to," LePage said.
But State Treasurer Terry Hayes clarified Monday that the state has just over $122 million in its "rainy day" fund, which is formally called the Budget Stabilization Fund.
In an email in response to a question from the Portland Press Herald, Hayes said the premise of Kilmeade's question to the governor was a misstatement and that the funds do not represent profit or surplus.
"The Treasurer's cash pool has maintained a running average daily balance of over $1 billion to date in fiscal year 2017 - for the first time ever," Hayes wrote. "This money is best described as the state's checkbook - it is used daily for withdrawals to pay the state's bills and for deposits of taxes and other revenues. This is the money already raised through taxation, appropriated by the Legislature, and administered by the Governor and the Executive Branch agencies. It is not extra money or savings. What is 'new' is that this running balance is sufficient for the state to cover its expenses on a day-to-day basis without borrowing from other cash pool components."
Hayes said the $122 million in the rainy day fund is included in the cash pool.
Kilmeade also wished LePage luck with a meeting later Monday, but he did not say with whom the governor was meeting. LePage's press secretary and communications director in Augusta declined to comment on LePage's schedule in Washington.
According to the schedule of the National Governors Association's winter meeting in Washington, a meeting between governors and Trump was planned for Monday morning. Scott Thistle can be contacted at 791-6330 or at: sthistle@pressherald.com Twitter: thisdog

Proposal to apply 15-cent deposit to mini liquor bottles clears first hurdle

Texto completo: Mainers who buy the miniature liquor bottles known as "nips" might have to pay a 15 cent bottle deposit next year under a bill endorsed by a legislative committee on Monday.
AUGUSTA -- Miniature liquor bottles would be subject to Maine's 15-cent bottle deposit next year under a bill endorsed by a legislative committee Monday.
Bill supporters said requiring retailers to collect a 15-cent deposit on the 50-milliliter liquor bottles known as "nips" would encourage recycling and, in the process, help address a growing litter problem. During a public hearing this month, several speakers said nips litter is a growing problem and displayed bags full of empty mini-bottles that they collected along roadsides, on people's lawns or in the gutter.
In a 7-2 vote, members of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee endorsed a bill that would apply the 15-cent liquor deposit on nips beginning Jan. 1, 2018. Consumers could then return empty bottles to redemption centers to receive the 15-cent deposit back, which supporters contend will discourage some buyers from littering and will encourage others to clean up roadsides.
Lawmakers decided to give the Maine Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages and Lottery Operations, or BABLO, additional time to work with the holder of the state's liquor marketing and distribution contract, Pine State Trading Co., to work out the details of applying deposit stickers or labels to bottles.
Sales of the 50-milliliter bottles are soaring in Maine. In fiscal 2016, the bureau sold an estimated 8.4 million nips bottles to agency liquor stores, and that figure is expected to surpass 12 million bottles this fiscal year. Just one brand of liquor, the cinnamon-flavored whiskey product called Fireball, accounted for 42 percent of nips sales in Maine last fiscal year, the bureau said.
Bill sponsor Rep. Martin Grohman, D-Biddeford, was pleased with the outcome.
"We heard from a lot of voices," said Grohman, who was carrying a large plastic bag containing empty nips that he picked up as litter. "This is not a partisan issue, litter."
The two committee members who voted against the bill said they would support increasing the fines on littering in Maine. Panel members absent Monday have two days to cast votes.
The bill now goes to the House and Senate floor for consideration. Kevin Miller can be contacted at 791-6312 or at: kmiller@mainetoday.com Twitter: KevinMillerPPH

Texto completo: Hanover, N.H. — Louise Thorndike (nee Mary Louise Van Dyke), known as Weezie to close family, left this world peacefully on Monday, Feb. 27, 2017, at the age of 94 in Hanover.
Louise was the daughter of Karl Skillman Van Dyke and Lua Stewart Docking. Predeceased by her husband Alan Moulton Thorndike, she was survived by her children Jean Gould of Shelby Township, Mich., Alan Stewart Thorndike of Oxford, Md., Charlotte Furstenberg of Lyme, N.H., Karl Edward Thorndike of Sea Cliff, N.Y. and Margaret Lindberg (Peg) of Maple Grove, Minn.; as well as 11 grandchildren; and 16 delightful great-grandchildren.
Growing up in Middletown, Conn., Louise spent summers on Heron Island off the coast of Maine. She lived in Bellport, N.Y. for 50 years.
Louise found great beauty in the world around her. The curve of a leaf transformed into the lines of a vase or bowl. The color of a petal reinvented in woven threads of wool, cotton, linen and silk. Louise did not like to slow down. She played tennis and cross-country skied until she was 92 and never stopped playing bridge. Marked by kindness and respect for the environment she lived a beautiful life.

Resumen: Valley News Correspondent Lebanon — Little by little, K.J. Matte has regained his old form on the basketball court.

Texto completo: Valley News Correspondent Lebanon — Little by little, K.J. Matte has regained his old form on the basketball court.
The Lebanon High senior is no stranger to offensive outpourings, but he got off to a slow start this season by missing the first 12 games with a broken foot.
Matte broke out Monday with a season-high 25 points, helping the Raiders to a key 74-58 victory over Coe-Brown at Lang Metcalf Gymnasium.
The Raiders improved to 16-1 in NHIAA play (19-1 overall) and moved into a first-place tie with Milford in the Division II standings.
Matte, who scored 18 of his points in the fourth quarter, came into the contest averaging 12 per game.
“Definitely in my element,” Matte said. “I was just trying to let the game come to me, honestly, and my teammates did really good. They got me the ball in places that I could score.”
The damage Matte inflicted on the Bears (14-3) included five 3-pointers and a 6-for- 6 performance at the free-throw line.
Matte, who will play collegiate basketball next year at Maine’s Bowdoin College, said his foot is “sore, but getting better.”
The hosts also got a typical big night from Ryan Milliken (16 ppg), who added 20 points against Coe-Brown, a squad that entered Monday’s showdown as the division’s No. 3 seed.
Lebanon’s two big men, Chris Nulty and Matthew Eylander — underclassmen who came off the bench on senior night — both had strong performances. Nulty had nine points, while Eylander chipped in eight rebounds and eight points.
Nulty delivered back-to-back blocks on the same defensive possession for the Raiders with about 6 minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. The huge momentum play followed an NBA-range 3-pointer by Matte that pushed the score to 47-36.
Lebanon, which led by as many as 20 points in the first half, saw its lead shrink to a mere five-point margin late in the third quarter. The Raiders went scoreless for the first 4 minutes of the third quarter until Eylander scored on a putback.
“We have to go back and watch (film) and analyze how we let these teams back in,” said Lebanon’s 20th-year coach, Kieth Matte. “I think it’s untimely turnovers, we lost some rebounds, transition baskets. They hurt us in a lot of ways and they’re good. They were 14-2 coming into this.”
Lebanon finishes its regular season on Friday at Bishop Brady (9-7). Milford has a Thursday tilt with Hollis Brookline (13-4) remaining on its schedule. The top two seeds in the NHIAA D-II tournament will receive preliminary-round byes.
“We’ve just got to win the next one to get the one seed for the tournament,” Nulty said. “It will be big to have that first-round bye, get to rest a little bit. We’ve got some guys that are really sick. We played well; it was good to have all our seniors play tonight and do well.”

Notes: Senior Night celebrated the high school playing days of Matte and Milliken along with Joshua Graham, Graham Chickering, Paul Slabinski and Noah Didehbani. The senior class has made three consecutive final four appearances. … A crowd-pleasing play came late in the second quarter when Hunter Bienvenu assisted a Slabinski layup with a silky-smooth behind-the-back bounce pass in transition. … Lebanon’s co-ed cheerleading team was honored before the game. … Senior hockey player Nate Gariepy, who recently reached the 100-point mark for his career, was honored along with his team during halftime. … Monday’s game — like many across the region during a disruptively winter season — was rescheduled from today to make way for the top-seeded Raider girls team (18-0 in NHIAA, 21-0 overall), which will host No. 16 Kennett in the first round of the Division II NHIAA tournament tonight.

Minor quake at night startles residents
The brief shaking some New Hampshire residents felt Sunday evening was an earthquake, specialists said. Boscawen, N.H., a small town just north of Concord, experienced a 1.6 magnitude earthquake just before midnight. Boscawen is situated in the "most seismically active area in the region," said John Abel, senior research scientist at the Weston Observatory. There was no reported damage.

Suit tests 20-day cutoff for voter registration
A lawsuit challenging the state's 20-day voter registration cutoff is working its way through the courts with a goal of finding a final resolution ahead of next year's elections. Defenders of the 20-day cutoff say it's an important tool for the orderly management of the election process in Massachusetts. Critics say that ending voter registration 20 days before Election Day is arbitrary. They point to the state's adoption of early voting during last year's election. The early voting schedule allowed voters to begin casting ballots Oct. 24, two weeks ahead of Election Day. Kirsten Mayer, a lawyer challenging the law, says the fact that the state was able to let early voting begin five days after the Oct. 19 registration cutoff shows that the 20-day deadline is unnecessary.

East Windsor site picked for new casino
Connecticut's two federally recognized tribes announced Monday they have chosen East Windsor for the site of their proposed border casino, but not everyone at the state Capitol thinks it's the best location. Some legislators talk of scrapping the idea and locating the state's potentially third casino in southwestern Connecticut, taking advantage of the New York gambling market. "I think building a third casino in northern Connecticut, I just think it's shortsighted," said state Representative Christopher Rosario, who submitted legislation this session that would allow new commercial gambling facilities in the state and impose a 25 percent tax on the gross revenues from slot machines and table games. Rosario and other Bridgeport-area legislators are hoping a casino can instead be built in Bridgeport, the state's largest city and site of previously proposed casino projects that never materialized.

Industry, regulators back plan for baby eel
Fishing regulators and industry representatives support a plan for a lottery system to get new fishermen into Maine's lucrative baby eel fishery, which is a key piece of the sushi supply chain. Maine is the only state with a significant fishery for baby eels. They can fetch more than $2,000 per pound at the dock, after which they are sold to Asian aquaculture companies for use in food. A group of lawmakers wants to create a lottery system to allow new people to get into the fishery when other fishermen leave it. (AP)

Texto completo: HOUSE BLAZE A two-family home in Belmont is uninhabitable after a three-alarm fire heavily damaged the residence, a fire official said Monday. The blaze, which was likely caused by a malfunctioning heating unit, began in the basement of the Grove Street home and extended upstairs through the pipe runs, essentially creating a mini chimney, Belmont Fire Chief David Frizzell said. The occupants of both units were able to evacuate the building safely when the fire broke out around 10 p.m. Sunday, Frizzell said. There were no reported injuries. Firefighters had the fire under control by 11 p.m., Frizzell said.
INCOMPETENCY RULING Charges have been dropped against a New Hampshire man accused of killing his 11-year-old stepdaughter by submerging her in a river. A court in Lancaster ruled Monday that Wendell Noyes, 52, was not competent to stand trial in the death of Celina Cass and that his competency can't be restored. According to one evaluator, his mental illness creates a potentially serious likelihood of danger to others. Noyes is accused of submerging Celina in the Connecticut River, where her body was found six days after she was reported missing in July 2011. Her disappearance led to a search in Stewartstown, a mile from the Canadian border. Noyes was arrested on a second-degree murder charge in June 2016 at a psychiatric hospital, where he had been hospitalized for about six months. (AP)
FIRE ESCAPE Five people were injured during a two-alarm fire at a three-story wood-frame residential building in Brockton, officials said Monday. The fire began just before 6:30 p.m. Sunday on the third-floor porch and spread inside the building on Division Street, Brockton Fire Captain Paul Cosgrove said. He said the fire was mostly confined to the second and third floors. All six of the residential units had working smoke detectors and the occupants were all able to evacuate. Three residents were taken to the hospital with minor injuries, Cosgrove said. One firefighter was taken to the hospital for a minor arm injury and another firefighter was treated at the scene, Cosgrove said. Firefighters were able to extinguish the fire in about 90 minutes. The cause is under investigation, although it is not believed to be suspicious at this time, Cosgrove said.
SNOWMOBILE FATAL A Massachusetts man was killed while snowmobiling Sunday afternoon in Maine after he failed to negotiate a turn on a trail, officials said. Dennis Picard, 60, of Chatham was snowmobiling with a group near Landers Farm Road in the Franklin County town of Eustis just after 3 p.m. Picard was last in the line of snowmobilers when he lost control and hit a tree, Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Corporal John MacDonald said. Picard was pronounced dead at the scene. He is the seventh person to die in Maine this year in a snowmobile accident, MacDonald said.

Texto completo: Latest bill to thwart citizens' initiatives calls for 84 percent increase in signees
A legislative committee heard testimony Monday on another proposed constitutional amendment to make it harder for campaigns to place referendum questions on the ballot.
Lawmakers are considering at least four bills proposing changes to Maine's constitution -- pending voter approval -- in response to the increasing attempts by citizen groups to secure policy victories at the ballot box. The bills come three months after Mainers legalized marijuana, increased the minimum wage and hiked taxes on wealthier residents to funnel more money toward education -- all controversial policy issues that had failed to pass the Legislature and were opposed by Gov. Paul LePage.
Republican lawmakers and LePage have been calling for the reform of Maine's referendum process. Supporters say the process provides citizens with a powerful policymaking tool for times when politicians or partisanship block an issue that has popular support.
The latest proposal, considered Monday by members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee, would dramatically increase the number of signatures that citizens' initiatives or "people's veto" campaigns need to qualify for the ballot.
Ballot question committees must gather signatures from the equivalent of 10 percent of the votes cast in the previous gubernatorial election. That currently equates to 61,123 signatures from registered voters. A proposal from Rep. Stedman Seavey, R-Kennebunkport, would increase that threshold to 15 percent and apply it to the number of ballots cast in the previous presidential election, rather than the governor's race.
Under those standards, campaigns would have needed 112,189 signatures from registered voters to qualify for the ballot -- an increase of 84 percent over the current standard.
Seavey said he is worried the current requirement could lead to "competing constituencies" going back and forth every two years, passing and then overturning initiatives at the ballot box.
"I feel this process of signature gathering should reflect the importance and responsibility of the citizens to directly make decisions that affect all citizens in Maine," Seavey said. "I believe that asking 15 percent of Maine voters to sign onto a citizens' initiative is a more appropriate barometer, considering the importance of this process."
The Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee already has heard arguments for and against three proposals to change Maine's citizens' initiative process, although none has come up for a vote in committee. One proposal would permanently exempt wildlife issues, such as hunting rules, from being decided at the ballot box.
Another would require petitioners to meet the 10 percent signature threshold in Maine's two congressional districts or in each of the state's 35 state Senate districts, rather than allowing petitions to be circulated in a more limited number of like-minded communities. Another proposal that would require campaigns to hit a 15 percent threshold in each county has yet to have a public hearing.
Lawmakers also are considering other bills to require more disclosure about ballot initiatives, whether through public hearings or by printing the entire language of an initiative on the ballot.
All constitutional amendment proposals face a steep climb. First, any proposal must receive two-thirds support in both chambers of the Legislature. Then, a majority of voters statewide must endorse the proposal.
Nationwide, progressive or liberal-leaning interest groups have increasingly turned to statewide ballot campaigns to pursue policy changes that they cannot win through legislation. In Maine, interest groups with a range of views along the political spectrum have used Maine's citizen initiative process with mixed success. The 2016 ballot questions in Maine on marijuana, the minimum wage, gun control, tax hikes and ranked-choice voting were all pursued by liberal groups.
LePage, a Republican, has accused out-of-state liberal activist groups of attempting to "hijack" the policymaking process and warned lawmakers that they are becoming increasingly irrelevant amid the growth in citizen's initiatives.
"We need to reform the referendum process, and we need to return to a representative government," LePage said during his Feb. 7 State of the State address.
In the meantime, LePage also has urged the Legislature to effectively overturn some of the laws passed at the ballot box, including the implementation of a 3 percent income tax surcharge on high earners.
The Secretary of State's Office took no formal position on Seavey's bill Monday, but it cautioned that the higher signature threshold would not just require more work for the campaigns.
"While we understand the purpose of this bill is to make sure that the process of placing a direct initiative on the ballot does not become too easy, it must be noted that increasing the number of signatures would also increase the workload not only for the Secretary of State but also for municipal elected officials," said Melissa Packard, director of elections in Secretary of State Matt Dunlap's office. "Municipal officials must review petitions to determine if the signers of the petitions are registered to vote."
Two citizens' initiatives already have qualified for the 2017 ballot. One asks voters to allow a casino in York County, and the second seeks to force the LePage administration to expand Medicaid coverage as allowed under the Affordable Care Act.

Texto completo: A legislative committee heard testimony Monday on another proposed constitutional amendment to make it harder for campaigns to place referendum questions on the ballot.
Lawmakers are considering at least four bills proposing changes to Maine's constitution -- pending voter approval -- in response to the increasing attempts by citizen groups to secure policy victories at the ballot box. The bills come three months after Mainers legalized marijuana, increased the minimum wage and hiked taxes on wealthier residents to funnel more money toward education -- all controversial policy issues that had failed to pass the Legislature and were opposed by Gov. Paul LePage.
Republican lawmakers and LePage have been calling for the reform of Maine's referendum process. Supporters say the process provides citizens with a powerful policymaking tool for times when politicians or partisanship block an issue that has popular support.
The latest proposal, considered Monday by members of the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee, would dramatically increase the number of signatures that citizens' initiatives or "people's veto" campaigns need to qualify for the ballot.
Ballot question committees must gather signatures from the equivalent of 10 percent of the votes cast in the previous gubernatorial election. That currently equates to 61,123 signatures from registered voters. A proposal from Rep. Stedman Seavey, R-Kennebunkport, would increase that threshold to 15 percent and apply it to the number of ballots cast in the previous presidential election, rather than the governor's race.
Under those standards, campaigns would have needed 112,189 signatures from registered voters to qualify for the ballot -- an increase of 84 percent over the current standard.
Seavey said he is worried the current requirement could lead to "competing constituencies" going back and forth every two years, passing and then overturning initiatives at the ballot box.
"I feel this process of signature gathering should reflect the importance and responsibility of the citizens to directly make decisions that affect all citizens in Maine," Seavey said.
"I believe that asking 15 percent of Maine voters to sign onto a citizens' initiative is a more appropriate barometer, considering the importance of this process."
The Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee already has heard arguments for and against three proposals to change Maine's citizens' initiative process, although none has come up for a vote in committee. One proposal would permanently exempt wildlife issues, such as hunting rules, from being decided at the ballot box. Another would require petitioners to meet the 10 percent signature threshold in Maine's two congressional districts or in each of the state's 35 state Senate districts, rather than allowing petitions to be circulated in a more limited number of like-minded communities. Another proposal that would require campaigns to hit a 15 percent threshold in each county has yet to have a public hearing.
Lawmakers also are considering other bills to require more disclosure about ballot initiatives, whether through public hearings or by printing the entire language of an initiative on the ballot.
All constitutional amendment proposals face a steep climb. First, any proposal must receive two-thirds support in both chambers of the Legislature. Then, a majority of voters statewide must endorse the proposal.
Nationwide, progressive or liberal-leaning interest groups have increasingly turned to statewide ballot campaigns to pursue policy changes that they cannot win through legislation. In Maine, interest groups with a range of views along the political spectrum have used Maine's citizen initiative process with mixed success. The 2016 ballot questions in Maine on marijuana, the minimum wage, gun control, tax hikes and ranked-choice voting were all pursued by liberal groups.
LePage, a Republican, has accused out-of-state liberal activist groups of attempting to "hijack" the policymaking process and warned lawmakers that they are becoming increasingly irrelevant amid the growth in citizen's initiatives.
"We need to reform the referendum process, and we need to return to a representative government," LePage said during his Feb. 7 State of the State address.
In the meantime, LePage also has urged the Legislature to effectively overturn some of the laws passed at the ballot box, including the implementation of a 3 percent income tax surcharge on high earners.
The Secretary of State's Office took no formal position on Seavey's bill Monday, but it cautioned that the higher signature threshold would not just require more work for the campaigns.
"While we understand the purpose of this bill is to make sure that the process of placing a direct initiative on the ballot does not become too easy, it must be noted that increasing the number of signatures would also increase the workload not only for the Secretary of State but also for municipal elected officials," said Melissa Packard, director of elections in Secretary of State Matt Dunlap's office. "Municipal officials must review petitions to determine if the signers of the petitions are registered to vote."
Two citizens' initiatives already have qualified for the 2017 ballot. One asks voters to allow a casino in York County, and the second seeks to force the LePage administration to expand Medicaid coverage as allowed under the Affordable Care Act.

Is the Easter Egg Roll on the chopping block?

Texto completo: Look out, Easter Bunny. You may be next.
President Trump hasn't embraced many of Washington's traditions. No Alfalfa Club dinner; no White House Correspondents' Association dinner; no active first lady; no visits to D.C. schools, businesses or restaurants (except the one in his hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue); no trips to Camp David; and very few weekends even spent in Washington.
And the largest annual public event at the White House - the Easter Egg Roll - is still a big mystery.
The logistics that go into security, crowd control, activities and invitations for something this size are insane. Last year, 35,000 parents and children attended. Yet, no one has heard that any of the work is being done on this year's event with only seven weeks to go.
A website that is not associated with the White House but is obsessed with the Easter Egg roll posted that the roll is set to be held on April 17 and promised that details will soon follow. But go to the official White House website and you get "no results" when you ask about anything Easter-related. And my efforts to reach anyone at the White House about it were unsuccessful.
Parents here in the nation's capital and around the country keep checking. It's kinda like waiting to get concert tickets. Only no one's sure there's going to even be a concert.
And this is driving parents crazy. February is the season for summer camp planning and entering the Easter Egg Roll lottery. Doesn't the White House know this? The Trumps have a 10-year-old, after all.
One hopeful sign: A 2017 commemorative White House Easter egg - a rose-gold filigree confection that is sold at the White House gift shop for $125 - is available online . (Order now! Marked down from $155! Only 1,000 made!)
But the folksy wooden eggs made in Maine and given to all the children who play on the White House lawn on Easter Monday - so far, those aren't happening.
"FYI manufacturing deadlines for the Easter eggs are near. Please reach out!" Wells Wood Turning, the Maine company that has made the wooden eggs for the past five years, tweeted last week, tagging POTUS, FLOTUS and daughter Ivanka Trump.
Held since 1878, the tradition of opening the White House lawn to neighborhood children on Easter Monday offers a chance for the president and his family to present a fun face to the public.
And it basically started because Washington children were annoying the city's adults.
Back in the 1870s, the hottest trend among Victorian kids was egg rolling. It was the bottle flipping or mannequin challenge of that era. And the Capitol grounds were ground zero for the craze, where the lawn was ravaged from the little urchins' relentless rolling. So Congress passed a law in 1877 to ban it.
But rollers gotta roll. And the coolest rollers ran up to President Rutherford B. Hayes while he was taking his morning stroll one day - yes, instead of Twitter, a president could commune with the commoners by just walking outside - and asked if they could roll on his lawn, because Congress had kicked them out.
After asking them to explain this kooky trend, he told them to come on over, totally throwing shade at Congress. And a tradition was born.
Except during wars or really bad weather, the gates at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue have opened every year to Washington children. For many decades, it was mainly the city's white children. In 1953, first lady Mamie Eisenhower saw black children peering in from outside the White House gates and insisted that their families come inside, too.
The event grew larger and larger. It was always a given that families of the administration and connected Washingtonians got in. But eventually, the White House started handing out free tickets to the general public to control the crowds.
The lines for those tickets formed earlier and earlier - dawn, pre-dawn, midnight, early evening. The line started at 5 p.m. during the last Easter Egg Roll in the George W. Bush White House.
The Obama administration killed the campouts and created a lottery system that parents could enter in February. The drawing was quick, and it gave families throughout the country a chance to come - and enough time to plan a trip - to the White House and the iconic event. And a ton of free tickets also went to D.C. schoolkids.
In addition to the egg rolling, the event included crafts, games, celebrity book readings (my kids got to see Shaquille O'Neal read "Green Eggs and Ham"), and characters from PBS, including the "Dinosaur Train" beasts, Clifford the Big Red Dog and Sid the Science Kid.
But so far this year? Clifford is still waiting in his big dog house.
Maria Vera Whelan, director of marketing and communications for PBS Kids, said in an email that the network has yet to hear from the White House. And maybe they won't. Funding for PBS is in the administration's crosshairs. Plus, the network is full of bad hombres.
Take that Sid the Science Kid.
The purple-haired, orange cartoon is now under investigation by Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight Committee.
Voters in his district chanted, "Do your job!" at Chaffetz at a recent town hall after he neglected to scrutinize Trump's ties to Russia, but the congressman launched an investigation into a grant the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention gave to Sid for an episode on the Zika virus.
I doubt that Sid is keeping his Easter calendar open.
Even so, this White House knows from bunnies.
There was the time Sean Spicer wore the bunny costume for George W. Bush's egg roll, the numerous times Trump posed with Playboy bunnies, or the time a pregnant Ivanka Trump posed in a Playboy bunny costume for Harper's Bazaar magazine.
I'll give the president a pass on the insidery Alfalfa Club gathering and the White House Correspondents' Association dinner, which has become a creepy spectacle anyway. I'll even let him slide on Camp David, despite all the history that has been made at the rustic retreat in the Maryland mountains.
But there is only one time a year that the kids of Washington - and the nation - get to frolic on the front lawn of the country's most famous home, the one we all pay taxes to keep green.
Don't be the Easter Grinch, Mr. President. Let the children roll.

Longshoreman Union Leader Stalls Planned Work Shutdown; International Longshoremen's Association president plans emergency meetings with legislators to halt walkout that would disrupt activities at busiest East Coast ports

Texto completo: The president of the International Longshoremen's Association on Monday asked members to hold off on a planned walkout that threatens to disrupt operations at some of the East Coast's busiest ports.
Last week, the head of the union's Charleston, S.C., chapter in a statement claiming to represent "rank and file" called for a one-day shutdown of ports from Maine to Texas to allow members to rally in Washington, D.C. over jobs lost to automation and the use of nonunion labor at the Port of Charleston. He also said union members would pressure lawmakers in Congress to curb the power of the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor, the bistate body tasked with rooting out corruption at the Port of New York and New Jersey.
The call for a shutdown comes as ILA leaders are in the early stages of contract talks with the United States Maritime Alliance Ltd., which represents the employers of unionized Atlantic and Gulf Coast port workers. The current contract expires in September 2018.
On Monday Harold Daggett, the ILA's president, said the union will seek "immediate emergency meetings" with members of Congress and asked members not to engage in the planned walkout.
"We hear your anger, we hear your frustration and we intend to address it," Mr. Daggett said in a statement.
Kenneth Riley, president of the ILA Local 1422 in Charleston, said Monday that the local unions would "follow the direction of our president," adding that a final decision on a walkout would depend on how much progress ILA leaders make in Washington.
Last month a labor slowdown in Charleston, reportedly over automation efforts, brought truck traffic at one terminal to a halt for several hours.
In New York and New Jersey, the Waterfront Commission's effort to increase racial diversity among unionized dockworkers spawned a multiyear legal battle that slowed hiring at the East Coast's busiest port. Last year a federal appeals court judge ruled against the ILA and a group representing terminal operators, saying the commission had not exceeded its authority by requiring employers at the region's container terminals to certify that workers were hired in a nondiscriminatory way.
Calls seeking comment from the two New York-region ILA locals weren't returned. The Waterfront Commission declined to comment.
The prospect of a coastwide shutdown had alarmed importers and exporters.
Any shutdown "for a day would be horribly disruptive," Jonathan Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation, said last week.
The maritime alliance, also known as USMX, issued a statement last week warning the ILA that a unilateral work stoppage would violate the current contract.

Maine's smelts have strong winter season

Texto completo: PORTLAND, Maine - Ice fishing for smelts is a winter tradition in Maine, where the small fish are fried and eaten whole.
Fishermen and fish camp owners say this smelt-fishing season has been a robust one after the mild winter last year produced hardly any smelts. The ice has been thick enough for fishing, and smelts have been abundant.
Jim McPherson, owner of Jim's Camps in Bowdoinham, said the season has been the best for smelt fishing at his camp in at least five years.
"The fish came back this year, more than I've seen in the last few years," McPherson said. "A lot of people caught their quota. I think the cycle is coming around, and they are on the increase again."
Smelts are part of many culinary traditions — from the use of their eggs in sushi to the practice among Italian-American families of incorporating them into Christmas Eve dinners. Maine's rainbow smelts are particularly sought after.
But the nationwide catch has plummeted in recent years. And the stock as a whole in Maine remains far below historical levels, said Michael Brown, a biologist with the Maine Department of Marine Resources.
Although still readily available to seafood lovers partly because of fisheries in California and the Great Lakes states, smelts have declined considerably there, too, since the 1990s.
Federal officials say contributing to the decline is the disruption of habitat, a lack of suitable places for the fish to spawn and warming waters with climate change.
To help rebuild the population, Maine has restricted smelt fishing.
"We remain optimistic that with the right fisheries management and environmental conditions that the coastal smelt population can continue to improve," he said.
The state bans smelt fishing from March15 to June30 along the coast from the New Hampshire border to Owl's Head, Maine. Maine also limits how many smelts can be fished along parts of the coast.

There are plenty of reasons to visit northern New Hampshire – including, for more people than you might think, prospecting for gold in its streams.
But that would be prospecting for gold via panning by hand rather than dredging for gold with machinery, if a bill making its way through the Legislature has its way.
“There's a surprising amount of damage that can be done by one of these things,” said Rep. Lee Oxenham, a Plainfield Democrat, referring to a process known as suction dredging, which would be outlawed under her bill.
The bill also would outlaw similar processes and technologies with names like “rocker box” and “highbanking,” which suck up stones and water from steambeds via small gasoline-powered pumps and filter them in some way to help the users spot tiny flecks of gold that might be there.
New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services says these processes stir up too much silt and mud, “releasing fine sediments back into the stream” that can harm life in the waterway.
“The turbidity can go for thousands of yards – it's not just localized,” said Oxenham. “It's disruptive for fish, insects, the benthic community in all its forms.”
The term “benthic” refers to the lowest point in any body of water.
“We need to try to keep our headwaters as clean and clear as they can be,” she said. “I was surprised to find it is done a lot in the Connecticut River, in the headwaters.”
Further, she added, the noise and smell of the machines “can drive those searching for the unmediated, unspoiled experience of our natural wonders out of the state, along with their tourist dollars.”
The bill, House Bill 591, has passed the House and has been referred to the state Senate's Energy and Natural Resources committee.
A resurgence in small-scale prospecting for gold in recent years has led several states to ban suction dredging, including California, Oregon and Washington state. Maine and Vermont have both put limits on the procedure.
An Associated Press story from October 2016 estimated that 3,000 gold prospectors exist in New England.
Several hundred permits have been issued by the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services to allow dredging for gold on state waterways.
New Hampshire was home to a small gold rush after some veins of the mineral were discovered in Lyman in 1864, but the mines didn't last long.
Gold winds up in streams after the rocks containing it are broken apart by wind or water. Since gold doesn't weather and is much heavier than water, it washes down to the bottom of streams, where it is known as a placer deposit.
Separating the gold flakes from other minerals is usually done by panning or dredging. “Some gold panning and dredging has been done over the last 300 years of New Hampshire's history, with varying degrees of success,” says a state information sheet about gold.
“Those gold panning may not use a shovel to dig into the stream bottom or stream banks. Scooping gravel up with the gold pan is allowed,” notes the sheet.
Legally, all surface water in New Hampshire belongs to the state and is generally open to public use, but the beds of streams or rivers are property of the landowner – including the state or, in the White Mountains National Forest, the federal government.
Panning by hand can usually be done on government-owned waters without a permit, but operating a motorized dredge of any kind requires a permit.
Oxenham said the state DES was in the process of reviewing its rules for dredging when she proposed her bill, which the department supports.

The 2016 elections have passed, but it's still open season on political advertising for opponents and supporters of Obamacare.
As congressional Republicans work toward repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act -- much to the chagrin of Democrats -- advocacy groups are spending millions on Internet, television and radio ads pleading for why Congress should or should not ditch the 2010 healthcare law.
The heaviest spender so far is the American Action Network, which has poured $7.4 million into ads supporting the repeal efforts. The group, which is affiliated with House Speaker Paul Ryan, is running ads and sending out mailers in 41 House districts.
Some of the group's ads seek to encourage the ongoing repeal efforts by GOP leaders, including Ryan and key committee chairmen, while others boost support for Republicans in moderate districts who are facing heavy pressure from constituents to keep the law.
The ads praise Republicans for putting forward an Obamacare replacement, a reference to a proposal Ryan released last summer, and promise viewers that a replacement measure will solve ongoing problems with Obamacare plans, including soaring premiums and deductibles.
"House Republicans have a plan to get there without disrupting existing coverage, giving your family the healthcare it deserves," one ad says.
Another group, this one with ties to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, is running ads in battleground states with key Senate races in 2018. One Nation is spending $3 million for three weeks of radio, print and digital ads, which cast the law as a failure and praise the promised Republican alternative.
The strategy is to hurt Senate Democrats facing tough races, including Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, and boost support for Republicans, including Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, Jeff Flake of Arizona and Dean Heller of Nevada.
"We're paying more and getting less," the ads say. "It's time to repeal and replace Obamacare."
The advocacy groups are spreading their message at a time when more Americans than ever before want to keep Obamacare on the books. While the country has mostly been evenly split over the healthcare law since it passed, recent polls have indicated an uptick in support.
Fifty-four percent of respondents to a February Kaiser Family Foundation poll said they approve of the healthcare law, while 43 percent disapprove, the poll's highest-recorded level of support for the law. One in four adults want Republican leaders to modify the law, while 17 percent want them to get rid of it altogether.
While opponents of the law are spending more heavily on ads, Democrats and supporters of the law are seeking to capitalize on the growing support for keeping the law or at least parts of it.
The Alliance for Healthcare Security, a coalition of groups including leading Obamacare advocate Families USA, is spending $3 million on ads in six states and the District of Columbia targeting moderate Republican senators.
"This is one of those issues where, as time goes on, it gets better for us," Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said recently.
Ads about Obamacare repeal aren't centered on just the healthcare law, but also an accompanying measure to block Planned Parenthood from receiving federal Medicaid reimbursements.
House Republicans are putting language in their bill that says any health provider that performs abortions may not get paid by the Medicaid program. Medicaid dollars already can't be used to pay for abortion procedures, but conservatives want to completely block the taxpayer dollars from any healthcare clinic that offers abortions.
Lawmakers are mostly split down partisan lines on the issue, but a handful of Republican senators, including Collins and Murkowski, have indicated they don't want to defund Planned Parenthood.
The women's healthcare provider is downplaying its abortion services with ads featuring women telling stories of how they were encouraged not to get an abortion but instead carry their pregnancies to full term. And abortion opponents are pressuring some of the more moderate Democratic senators on the issue.
Leading anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List has run radio ads pressing moderate Senate Democrats Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly to support an Obamacare repeal bill that defunds Planned Parenthood.
And last month, the group launched a $500,000 campaign in D.C. and key states to pressure Congress to prioritize defunding Planned Parenthood. The campaign includes 30-second ads airing during Fox News and MSNBC's morning shows that slam the women's health and abortion provider for now providing prenatal services.
"The American people elected a president and Congress committed to stopping taxpayer funding of abortion and abortion businesses," said SBA List President Marjorie Dannenfelser. "We urge Congress to continue working towards this goal."

Texto completo: With our irregular weather patterns of late, it seems appropriate to leadoff with a couple of geology-related news items — one a lecture and one a grant — in this edition of The College of Wooster roundup.
This Wednesday evening, Rob Thieler, the center director of the U.S. Geological Survey’s Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center, will present “Changing Climate, Changing Coasts” at the 36th annual Richard G. Osgood Memorial Lecture. Thieler’s work focuses on sea-level rise impacts, continental shelf sedimentation and applications of web and smartphone technology to coastal problems, and he advises federal and state agencies to develop science and policy plans for addressing coastal change hazards. His lecture will begin at 7:30 p.m. at Lean Lecture Room of Wishart Hall.
Also, it was announced recently that the Keck Geology Consortium has awarded the College a grant for first- and second-year year students at Wooster who are interested in a potential career in the geosciences to participate in a five-week field experience this summer. Nine students will be selected for two research teams, with one group taking a one-week trip to Alaska, where it will sample yellow-cedar trees to identify tree-ring data at various elevations, and the other to Utah, where samples of low- and high-silica lava flows will be collected at a volcanic field site.
“Our project is funded through the Consortium as a Gateway Program — (which) is specifically designed for beginning students, especially those from underrepresented groups,” explained Meagen Pollock, the grant’s principal investigator and an associate professor of geology. “The program engages students in authentic research as an introduction to the geosciences, allowing students to explore the discipline, develop their scientific identity, and deepen their understanding of the intersections between the geosciences and societally relevant issues.”
Food sustainability is the subject of next Great Decisions event: The second-to-last presenter of this year’s Great Decision series is slated for Thursday, March 2, as academic, activist and author Raj Patel will analyze “How Will We Feed 10 Billion People Sustainably?” A research professor in the School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, Patel hopes to bring attention to improving the world’s food system. Early in his career, he worked for the World Bank and World Trade Organization, but has since become an outspoken critic of those organizations. Patel’s speech will begin at 7:30 p.m., at Gault Recital Hall inside Scheide Music Center.
“Almost, Maine” Almost Here: The College’s department of theatre and dance is proud to present “Almost, Maine,” directed by assistant professor Jimmy Noriega, March 2-4. The critically-acclaimed play, written by John Cariani and premiered in 2004, consists of nine vignettes that explore love, loss, confusion, and home coming together one night in a remote, mythical town in Maine.

Texto completo: AUGUSTA, Maine -- Earlier this month, Maine's U.S. senators had been united on the thought that their Senate Intelligence Committee was the proper venue for an investigation into President Donald Trump's ties to Russia.
But weekend events may have made that more tenuous.
That's after a Washington Post report that said the administration tried to enlist intelligence officials and the Republican chairs of the House and Senate intelligence committees to push back on news reports on that issue, which has been under review by intelligence agencies.
On Sunday, Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said he was "deeply troubled" by the reports and said he'll speak to Sen. Richard Burr, R-North Carolina, "to better understand what happened."
King said the committee "must have credibility not only with our colleagues, but also with the American people" and "I will have serious concerns if it seems that we are no longer able to proceed in this manner."
Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican, praised the committee's staff and structure in a statement, but said the committee must "work in a completely bipartisan fashion" to maintain trust in its work.
Neither Maine senator stated specifically whether they would support appointment of a special prosecutor, which some members of Congress called for last last week.
