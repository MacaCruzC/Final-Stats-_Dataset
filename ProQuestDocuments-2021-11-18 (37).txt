Texto completo: Andrew Yang began his closing statement at the last Democratic debate with a charming bit of self-deprecation: “I know what you’re thinking, America. How am I still on this stage with them?”
Yang has never been elected to any office. He is a businessman who has never run a major company. Even so, he is one of the Democratic Party’s seven leading candidates for an election that everybody agrees is desperately important. The other six on the debate stage included another businessman who has never held office and a mayor who has never won an election with more than 10,991 votes.
As funny as Yang’s line may have been, he was highlighting a real problem: Our process for selecting presidential nominees is badly flawed.
It is, as Jonathan Rauch and Ray La Raja recently wrote in The Atlantic, “a spectacle that would have struck earlier generations as ludicrous.” It has come to resemble a reality television show, in which a pseudo-scientific process (polls plus donor numbers) winnows the field. The winner is then chosen by a distorted series of primaries and caucuses: The same few states always get outsize influence, and a crude, unranked voting system can produce a nominee whom most people don’t want.
No wonder the current president is a reality-television star, not to mention the most unfit occupant of the office in our country’s history. “The victory of Donald Trump in 2016 is best understood as a failure of the process,” political scientist Jonathan Bernstein has written, “and a failure of the Republican Party to prevent an outsider from taking its presidential nomination — the most important thing that U.S. political parties have.”
The current system may seem as if it’s simply an expression of democracy, but it’s not. It’s one version of democracy. And it’s one that virtually no other country uses. In other democracies, political parties have more sway in selecting the nominee, and voters then choose among the major nominees. Until recently, the United States also gave party leaders a larger role in selecting nominees.
Today’s leaders have abdicated this job, afraid to do anything that might appear elitist because it substitutes the judgment of experts for that of ordinary citizens. The irony is that the new process may actually do a poorer job of picking nominees whom ordinary citizens like, as research by Dennis Spies and André Kaiser, looking across countries, suggests.
How could this be? When voters are given the dominant role in choosing a nominee — as with primaries here — only an unrepresentative subset tends to participate, which skews the process. Party leaders, on the other hand, have a big incentive to choose a broadly liked candidate. Just think about American history: Nominees chosen by party leaders have included Abraham Lincoln, both Roosevelts and Dwight Eisenhower.
I’m not suggesting we return to the smoke-filled rooms of the past. But the current process puts a higher priority on the appearance of democracy than the reality of it. We’re left with candidates fighting to do well enough in early polls to get into the debates and then to win 30% of the vote in Iowa and New Hampshire, which can launch them toward the nomination.
A better approach would balance snapshots of popular opinion with rules more likely to produce strong, qualified nominees.
The first change should be to the debates. The candidates’ electoral history and qualifications currently count for nothing. The 2020 Democratic field, for example, has included four two-term governors, all of whom have been excluded from debates despite a track record of winning votes and governing successfully. In their place have been candidates, like Yang, who managed to crack 4% in a few polls.
It makes more sense for only the true polling leaders to be guaranteed debate slots. Beyond them, the party could set aside at least one spot for a governor and perhaps one for a senator from a large state or swing state.
A second set of changes would involve the primaries themselves. More states should adopt ranked-choice voting, allowing voters to list their second and third choices. Memphis, Minneapolis, New York City, San Francisco and the state of Maine, among other places, have adopted this system for some elections.
Ranked choice can prevent the Trump phenomenon during the 2016 Republican primaries. Trump may have solid Republican support today, but he didn’t back then. Even though most Republican voters opposed him, his dedicated base let him emerge from a large field.
It’s also past time to end the special treatment that Iowa and New Hampshire receive, by always voting first. They are two overwhelmingly white, disproportionately baby boomer states (and the fact that Iowa voted for Barack Obama in 2008 doesn’t give it a permanent pass). The primary calendar should instead rotate every four years, with the first states always including a mix of states: big and small, young and old, urban and rural, coastal and heartland.
The seven candidates who made the last Democratic debate stage all have their strengths, but as a group, they offer an indictment of the nomination process. There are three candidates in their 70s — and no African American or Latino. There are two people who have never won an election — and zero who have ever run a state.
Of course, the biggest sign that the process is broken isn’t any of those seven. It is the man in the Oval Office.

Texto completo: Trials of all kinds - civil, criminal, impeachment - are supposed to try to get at the truth of the matter at hand. Despite Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s effort to convert the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump into a mere test of party loyalty, new revelations since the House voted to impeach Trump call for a real trial, including witness testimony and documentary evidence.
The House voted Dec. 18 to impeach on two counts, abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Facts supporting both counts are clear. Trump withheld congressionally approved military aide for Ukraine and an official state visit for new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky while insisting that Zelensky announce an investigation of a Trump political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. Then, Trump clearly hindered Congress as it attempted to carry out its constitutional duty to investigate the president’s conduct.
In the ensuing weeks, The Washington Post and The New York Times, using emails among key administration officials, have reconstructed Trump’s decision to withhold the aid against the advice of the Pentagon, the State Department and national security advisers, and the scramble in the White House to concoct a rationale for that decision after it was revealed by a whistleblower.
More so than ever, it would be sham for McConnell to attempt to conduct a trial without testimony from former National Security Adviser John Bolton and White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi should continue to refrain from sending the passed articles of impeachment to the Senate for trial until Mc-Connell agrees to a real trial. And, given the results of the newspapers’ inquiries, Pelosi should continue the House investigations so that the public will know what happened, regardless of whether McConnell continues to promote a charade.

Texto completo: Former Vice President Joe Biden is usually first to bring up the record of the Obama administration in his 2020 presidential campaign. But at the Democratic debate in Los Angeles, Biden had to defend an area where the administration failed.
Obama left office without closing the Guantanamo Bay detention facility.
The facility remains open under President Donald Trump, housing about 40 detainees at an annual cost of about $540 million.
Biden said that the Obama administration tried to close Guantanamo. But it was missing one thing.
“You have to have congressional authority to do it,” Biden answered Dec. 19.
One way Obama wanted to close the facility was by moving detainees to U.S. facilities, which Congress blocked through legislation. Some have argued that Obama did have other options to close Guantanamo, but they were unpopular even within his own party, and it’s not at all clear they would have been successful. We’ll recap the history.
On Jan. 22, 2009, Obama issued an executive order calling for Guantanamo’s closure within one year. That year was Obama’s best chance to close Gitmo since he held large majorities in the House and Senate.
But Obama angered lawmakers after he transferred a detainee to New York, announced a plan to bring the terrorists responsible for 9/11 to the United States, and planned to purchase a facility in Illinois for detainees.
Obama’s moves led Congress to repeatedly bar the use of funds to house Guantanamo detainees in the United States.
Obama officials discussed the possibility of using executive authority to close the detention camp, but ultimately ruled that out.
Obama was forced to “choose between two politically unsavory options: Invoke executive power to relocate the remaining detainees in defiance of a statute, or allow history to say he never fulfilled his promise to shutter the prison,” wrote New York Times reporter Charlie Savage in November 2015.
Obama’s Office of Legal Counsel never bought the argument that these the congressional restrictions were unconstitutional, said Avril Haines, a legal adviser for the National Security Council during the Obama administration. (She was part of efforts to try to close Gitmo but not within the Office of Legal Counsel.)
Legal experts were divided about whether the restrictions Congress imposed were constitutional.
While some during the Obama administration argued that the congressional ban on transfers prevented Guantanamo from closing, Gregory B. Craig, White House counsel in 2009, and Cliff Sloan, special envoy for Guantanamo closure in 2013 and 2014, wrote a Washington Post op-ed in November 2015 arguing that Obama did have authority to close the facility.
“Under Article II of the Constitution, the president has exclusive authority to determine the facilities in which military detainees are held,” they wrote. “Obama has the authority to move forward. He should use it.”
Their op-ed set off a debate among legal scholars and political experts.
Obama did decide on one approach for removing Gitmo prisoners: transferring them to other countries. But he ran out of time.
During the final days of his administration, Obama announced the four final transfers to other countries bringing the total number of international transfers from Guantanamo under Obama to about 200.
On Jan. 19, 2017, Obama wrote a letter to Congress stating that the restrictions “make no sense” given the lack of escapes at supermax and military prisons.
The next day Trump was sworn into office. He has kept his promise to keep Guantanamo open.
Our ruling
Asked why the Obama administration didn’t close Guantanamo, Biden said, “You have to have congressional authority to do it.”
Congress made it hard for Obama to fulfill his promise, blocking Obama from transferring detainees to U.S. prisons. Obama was allowed to transfer detainees to other countries, and did transfer many of them. But he ran out of time at the end of his presidency, keeping the prison open with 41 detainees.
Some legal experts said Obama had the legal right to close Guantanamo but lacked the political willpower. Others questioned if he truly had that power. Ultimately the Obama administration didn’t take that tack, so we’ll never know. Certainly what Congress did made the task much harder.
We rate this statement Mostly True.

A great love remembered at designer Toledo's memorial

Texto completo: New York's creative communities met Dec. 16 in Hell's Kitchen at the Baryshnikov Arts Center. There were writers and dancers, actors and musicians, from uptown and downtown, all drawn together by the memory of one woman: designer Isabel Toledo, who died in August of breast cancer.
She was as close to an artist as fashion had - even if she was best known for designing Michelle Obama's first inaugural parade dress and coat.
On a darkened stage illuminated by a white glow from a sewing machine and hanging ivory gown in one corner there came not only speeches (from journalist Wendy Goodman; Kim Hastreiter, the Paper magazine co-founder and curator; and writer Michaela Angela Davis, among others), but also performances.
The dancer Jillian Davis, of Complexions Contemporary Ballet, extended her limbs in elegy accompanied by a violin played by Ezinma (late of Beychella). Caridad de la Luz, the spoken word poet known as La Bruja, unscrolled a river of paper on which she had scrawled, in looping black pen, her paean. Basil Twist, the puppeteer, flew a marionette like a fluttering spirit. Joey Arias, the performance artist, belted out a love song.
Many of the speakers wore Toledo's designs.
And in the end, Whoopi Goldberg read a letter of skin and blood from Toledo's husband, artist and illustrator Ruben Toledo, to his wife.
The visceral emotion in the letter was reflective of the tenor of the event, because as much as the afternoon was an homage to Toledo and her work, the gathered throng was also there to acknowledge one of fashion's greatest love stories.
Ruben and Isabel Toledo were legend in an industry where individual ego and ambition often seem the norm and the relationships that are known tend to be fraught and soap-opera dramatic. Rarely, if ever, seen apart, the Toledos were each other's muses, with an almost symbiotic need to create.
They were beyond, said curator and retailer Katharina Sand, who met the Toledos when she was a very young journalist, "Yoko and John, Morticia and Gomez."
She realized "he was her missing link," Goodman said.
James Kaliardos, a makeup artist, talked about a dream he had in which he couldn't tell where Ruben stopped and Isabel began.
"He was the fabric, she was the needle, and they stitched it all together," said Aria.
Hastreiter, who knew the couple before they were married, said that Toledo had often painted his wife, and she had raised the possibility of doing an exhibition of his portraits. She guessed, Hastreiter recalled, that he probably had about 1,000. He corrected her.
"More like 10,000 Isabels," he said.
And as guests like Agnes Gund, the philanthropist, and Sandy Schreier, whose wardrobe has just gone on-show at the Met; Cuban American designer Narciso Rodriguez and Simon Doonan, the writer and former Barneys window dresser; Linda Fargo of Bergdorf Goodman and Ikram Goldman from Ikram in Chicago, lined up to hug Ruben Toledo, who had been hovering in the shadows, the image that lingered was the last still from the final film of the afternoon (because there was film, too). It was a moment caught as Ruben and Isabel were dancing - they loved to dance - arm in arm in the loft where they lived.
Her dark hair was flying out behind her, and they were eye to eye, laughing.

Texto completo: A volunteer member of a security team who is running for county commissioner is being hailed for saving lives by quickly ending a shooting Sunday at a North Texas church.
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton described parishioner Jack Wilson as a onetime reserve sheriff's deputy with extensive training who has taught shooting at his own range.
Wilson was one of two congregants who confronted a gunman during an attack that killed two people at West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement, a town of about 17,000 people near Fort Worth. Paxton said Wilson was the one who brought down the suspect with a single shot.
"He's not just responsible for his actions, which ultimately saved the lives of maybe hundreds of people, but he's also responsible for training hundreds in that church," Paxton said at a news conference Monday.
Texas church murders and New York Hanukkah stabbings: Hate, yes, but are they acts of domestic terrorism?
The Texas Department of Public Safety identified the victims as Anton "Tony'' Wallace, 64, of Fort Worth and Richard White, 67, of River Oaks.
The gunman was identified as Keith Thomas Kinnunen, 43. His motive is under investigation.
Investigators searched Kinnunen’s home in River Oaks, a small nearby city where police said his department’s only contact with the suspect came from a couple of traffic citations. “He didn’t exist until yesterday,” Deputy Police Chief Charles Stewart said.
However, Tarrant County records show Kinnunen was arrested in 2009 on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon in Fort Worth and in 2013 for theft. He also had a 2016 brush with the law in New Jersey.
Wilson said he went on high alert when he noticed the suspect walking in wearing a hat, long coat and wig, and he and White — a fellow security volunteer — were reaching for their guns when Kinnunen approached Wallace, who was serving Communion.
The attacker shot White and Wallace, sending parishioners scrambling for cover, before Wilson could get a clear line of fire.
“I didn’t have a clear window because I had members that were jumping, going chaotic,” Wilson, 71, said from his home in nearby Granbury. "They were standing up. I had to wait about half a second, a second, to get my shot. I fired one round. The subject went down. ”
Wilson, who is running for commissioner in Hood County, said in a posting on his campaign's Facebook page that he's thankful to be able to serve as the church's head of security.
He added that Sunday's events "put me in a position that I would hope no one would have to be in, but evil exists. ''
Texas officials lauded a state law that took effect in September allowing weapons in places of worship unless the facility bans them. Paxton said the church’s security team was formally organized once the measure was enacted.
Licensed handgun owners can legally carry loaded weapons into Texas churches that do not have posted signs banning weapons. Church security became a major issue in the state after a gunman walked into a church in Sutherland Springs two years ago and fatally shot 26 people and wounded 20 others.
President Donald Trump offered prayers to the "families of the victims and the congregation" on Monday night, more than 30 hours after the shooting, and praised the actions of "brave" parishioners via Twitter.
He added, "Lives were saved by these heroes, and Texas laws allowing them to carry arms!"
Church officials held a closed meeting and prayer vigil just for church members Monday evening. Britt Farmer, the church's senior minister, told the crowd he had encountered Kinnunen in the past.
“I had seen him. I had visited with him. I had given him food,” Farmer said.
FBI Special Agent in Charge Matthew DeSarno said Kinnunen had roots in the area but is “relatively transient. " DeSarno also said the suspect has been arrested several times but did not specify on which charges.
Parishioner Isabel Arreola told the Star-Telegram that she sat near the gunman and that she’d never seen him before Sunday’s service. She said he appeared to be wearing a disguise, perhaps a fake beard, and that he made her uncomfortable.
Then she saw him take out a shotgun, start firing and get shot himself.
“I was so surprised because I did not know that so many in the church were armed,” she said.
Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said that immediate reaction was crucial.
“This team responded quickly, and within six seconds the shooting was over,'' Patrick said. "Two of the parishioners who were volunteers of the security force drew their weapons and took out the killer immediately, saving untold number of lives. ''
'Nothing is going to stop us being Jewish': New York community rallies after anti-Semitic 'terrorism' attack
There were more than 240 parishioners in the church at the time of the shooting, authorities said, and the service was being livestreamed to countless homes.
Gov. Greg Abbott issued a statement of condemnation for the "evil act of violence" at a place of worship.
"I am grateful for the church members who acted quickly to take down the shooter and help prevent further loss of life," Abbott said. "Cecilia and I ask all Texans to join us in praying for the White Settlement community and for all those affected by this horrible tragedy. "

Texto completo: Images and videos of child sexual abuse don't only exist in the dark corners of the internet. They are hiding in plain sight across New Mexico. From January through Nov. 1, there were 977 investigations in the state into reports of adults creating, possessing or distributing images of child sex crimes, and committing other sex crimes against children, over the internet. That number, experts say, is more than double the number from last year. And while every viewing of those images is a crime, prosecutors say it also is a sign that a person might plan to - or already has - sexually abused a child.
"These are individuals that, generally speaking, are extremely dangerous, and a lot of times, there's this misnomer that these are just images," said state Deputy Attorney General Clara Moran.
Moran and other prosecutors do not like the commonly used term "child pornography" because it likens images of abuse to the legal, somewhat regulated industry of adult pornographic content, she said. Moran makes it plain: Many of these images are of children being raped.
While some people tend to believe such images involve children in faraway places, the reality is much different. Almost 90 percent involve children in the U.S., including New Mexico, said Anthony Maez, special agent and commander of the state attorney general's Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force.
The task force has reviewed about 1,400 cyber-tips received from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, peer-to-peer networks and individuals, Maez said. Of the five types of crimes investigated by the group, the number involving images of child sexual abuse is by far the largest.
Not every tip leads to an investigation.
In 2019, the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force has received 592 documented complaints about possession of images of child sexual abuse, 304 about distribution of such images and 63 about creation of images, according to data provided by Maez.
"The number of tips that we see coming in, the volume is very high," he said, "and unfortunately there isn't enough law enforcement officers around the state to work these types of tips."
State law enforcement agencies have ratcheted up their battle against internet crimes against children. About 276 agents across 90 local, state, military and tribal agencies investigate these crimes. Together, they have received 76 documented complaints of child enticement, 21 complaints of a person traveling to meet a child with intentions of abuse, 52 complaints of adults directing obscenities to a minor and 14 complaints of sex trafficking of children, according to data collected by the task force.
An exploding problem
Maez points to the ever-evolving world of social media and apps that make it easier to exploit children.
A recent investigation by the New York Times revealed many predators connect with children through gaming or social media platforms and chatrooms - venues that weren't as accessible five to 10 years ago. In 2008, the newspaper reported, 3,000 images of child sexual abuse had been reported. In 2018, there were more than 18 million.
Each new app, Maez said, is a new opportunity for child exploitation.
Criminal complaints, grand jury indictments and affidavits for search warrants filed in New Mexico's First Judicial District Court show how prevalent the use of social media and electronic devices is when it comes to the exploitation of children.
One such affidavit, filed Nov. 18, says blogging sites Tumblr and Reddit reported a 24-year-old man from Chimayó had uploaded images of child sexual abuse. A search of online court records shows he has not yet been charged with a crime. Another affidavit, filed in 2017, goes into graphic detail about a series of videos of girls ages 7 to 10 that authorities believe were shared by a Santa Fe man on a peer-to-peer website.
Española police Detective Ernest Saucedo wrote in a Dec. 3 affidavit that he received three tips from the attorney general's internet crimes task force accusing a 21-year-old man of uploading images of child sexual abuse online using three Yahoo email addresses. The man, Austin Martinez, has been charged with one count of possession of a visual medium of sexual exploitation of a child under 13.
There is no overarching profile of a person who views graphic images of children being sexually abused. Offenders live in both rural and urban areas, and while they tend to be male, they can be of any age.
A growing fight
Each month, the task force receives about 110 tips from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the national clearinghouse for all reports made to the cyber-tip line, as well as reports from social media companies, which monitor their sites for potential illegal activity.
Of those 110 reports in New Mexico, Maez said about 63 percent originated from a person who saw an image on Facebook and reported it or from the company's detection software.
Facebook's latest transparency report says the company removed 11.6 million child abuse images worldwide from its social network from July through September of this year. Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, removed about 512,000 images.
"Each time it is shared is a revictimization of that child victim," said Matt Baca, a spokesman for the New Mexico Attorney General's Office. "It is important for people to recognize that the sharing and individual viewing is a reoffense."
Concerns over the spread of images of child sexual abuse on the internet has prompted smaller police departments to become more aggressive. Roger Jimenez, interim chief of the Española Police Department, said his agency recently began working with the task force.
"It definitely does hit closer to home for some of the officers that actually live in a community where they're investigating these specific crimes," he said.
Often, officers will already know victims or the accused, Jimenez said, and that added level of familiarity makes the cases more difficult to handle.
Finding perpetrators
Task force members say the long road to success in prosecuting internet crimes against children is similar to other kinds of sensitive investigations: Extensive interviews and researching a suspect's past are key before executing a search warrant.
You get one shot to find evidence in these types of cases, New Mexico State Police Agent Jessie Whittaker said, because once a suspect knows what investigators are looking for, they often will try to destroy or hide devices containing images - or any trace that they created or distributed them.
He could go into a house armed with a search warrant but minimal information and "get a little bit of evidence for the case - maybe nothing," Whittaker said, and then realize later that he missed something key to prosecuting the case.
"What's the chance it's going to be there that next time coming back?" he asked.
Whittaker said he seizes cellphones or other devices while executing search warrants and takes them to the FBI's Regional Computer Forensics Laboratory in Albuquerque. He either gives the agency the materials to review or reviews the evidence himself.
The internet crimes task force also operates a mobile forensics lab, as well as labs across the state, Maez said, to avoid a bottleneck of cases.
"You can't arrest someone until forensics is completed," he said.
Moran said prosecutors typically will seek detention of a suspect after criminal charges are filed. But they are not always successful. In the case of Martinez, state District Judge Jason Lidyard rejected Assistant District Attorney Ihsan Ahmed's motion seeking a detention until trial, ruling the state did not prove Martinez is a danger to the community.
Such decisions frustrate investigators and prosecutors.
"What you get a lot from the defense is that these are just images, they're just images - and that's just not true," Moran said.
Investigators say they believe people who view graphic photos and videos of child sexual abuse could be - and are likely to be - sexually attracted to children and might physically abuse a child.
"If someone is sexually attracted to children, it is not something that goes away," Moran said.
According to experts quoted in the New York Times investigation on the psychology of pedophiles, one study of 127 online offenders who had been arrested showed that less than 5 percent admitted to having molested a child. During in-depth interviews and polygraph tests, however, another 53 percent admitted to having touched a child.
Moran said this holds true for New Mexico.
"Sometimes prosecutors can ask for a polygraph, and what we find is that these offenders oftentimes disclose ... they have been hands-on abusers and just haven't been caught or that they are planning to put hands on a child," she said.
Prosecutors and investigators say a law passed this year by the Legislature - the Electronic Communications Privacy Act - makes it more difficult to prosecute crimes against children.
The law requires law enforcement to obtain warrants including the specific information they are seeking on electronic devices, as well as the specific person or account targeted. It also requires that any evidence collected under a search warrant that does not fall under the specifications of the warrant be destroyed within 30 days.
That timeline sometimes does not allow for adequate development of a case involving images of child sexual abuse, Moran said.
"It's essential to these types of cases for law enforcement officers to be able to comb through all of the images," she said. In some cases, there can be terabytes of information to sift through.
Whittaker said the tight timelines also can make it difficult to retain exculpatory evidence, which can help establish a person's innocence if the suspect is arrested and his or her case goes to trial.
Privacy concerns and data breaches also have pushed social media platforms and apps to use end-to-end encryption, which makes conversations between a sender and recipient private and unable to be seen by a third party. In March, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced plans to introduce the technology on Facebook Messenger.
"If Facebook decides to encrypt everything and not [see] who is doing what on the site or have that available, the tips will go down, but the exploitation is taking place out there," Maez said.
Awareness of these crimes, though distasteful, is critical, Maez said. While the majority of investigations by the internet crimes task force involve cases in which a child has been abused previously, Maez said the group also pursues local tips to stop such abuse from ever occurring.
Each year, the task force runs a public service announcement advertising the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's cyber-tip line. Maez also holds bimonthly training on investigatory techniques, such as how to mimic a person who is posting or responding to online ads for child exploitation, dark web surveillance and the use of cryptocurrency like bitcoin to purchase images of child sexual abuse.
"We are trying to cover every possible place where an individual may exploit a child," he said.

Texto completo: If there's a teenager in your house, there's a good chance that a gift related to video gaming was part of your Christmas giving.
According to Pew Research Center, nearly every teenage boy - 97% - participates in gaming, as well as about 83% of girls.
The hugely popular Fortnite has roughly 250 million users. PlayStation has nearly 100 million monthly active users.
In 2020, the video games market is expected to be a $90 billion industry in the U.S.
And most teens know way more about all things gamer than their parents do. That's why, no doubt, parents of gamers take the time to review tutorials about parental controls and talk with teens about the dangers of gaming, right?
Maybe, maybe not. Even if parents do talk to kids, that conversation usually is related to limiting screen time and avoiding games with graphic violence. The discussion that parents and kids might not have is warning kids that gaming worlds have become hunting grounds for predators.
A New York Times series this month reported shocking stories of teenagers lured into conversations with predators through multiplayer video games and chat apps. Once the relationship is established, predators - often posing as children themselves - detail a story of hardship, building trust with their victims.
Over time, they are able to dupe children into sharing semi-explicit photos and videos of themselves. Then, the predators have leverage. Threats to send out the photos to friends and family members is the typical bait used to garner more explicit photos - and even photos of other children, in many cases.
The Times combed through court and police records and found reports of abuse skyrocketing, with some predators grooming hundreds and even thousands of teens and children. Multiplayer games were the most frequent target, though similar ploys are happening on social media apps like Instagram.
Like a lot of issues that teens and parents face, addressing this one is complicated, but it usually begins with a conversation. Online safety experts say parents need to know what games their children are playing, and kids need to know the tools available to them - like blocking users, shutting off chat functions and telling an adult if a user asks anything that makes the child uncomfortable.
For most teenagers, gaming will be a part of life. But families need to be aware of the real dangers lurking in the virtual world.
To report online child sexual abuse or find resources for those in need of help, contact the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children at 1-800-843-5678.

Where we stand
Parents and kids should be aware of the increase in predators connecting with kids through gaming.

Texto completo: Economic forecasters got the 2010s wrong. What will the next decade bring?
After the turn of the millennium, the United States suffered its weakest decade of economic growth in the post-World War II era, and served as ground zero of the global financial crisis. Forecasters predicted a long American decline. Instead, over the course of the 2010s, the United States staged a comeback as an economic superpower and, even more, as a financial superpower.
The United States economy grew faster than other rich countries and navigated the decade without suffering a single recession -- a first since records began in the 1850s. Defying the declinists, the United States was one of only two major countries, alongside China, to expand its share of the global economy in the 2010s.
With central banks, consumers and investors around the world increasingly eager to hold dollars, the greenback ruled global money flows as never before. The American stock market rose 200 percent in the 2010s while the rest of the world's stock markets, including those of China and Germany, registered meager gains. Today, seven of the world's 10 largest companies by stock market value are American, up from three in late 2009.
But if history is a guide, the 2020s will be anything but another American decade. Economic trends that define one decade rarely define the next. This cycle has repeated itself throughout the postwar era.
America was the hottest story in the world economy and markets in the 1960s, but gave way to emerging nations in the 1970s and Japan in the 1980s before rising again in the 1990s. After the turn of the millennium, emerging nations made another strong run, and by 2010 forecasters were predicting that emerging markets would be the story of the next century.
Excluding China, emerging countries as a group saw their share of the global economy shrink during the 2010s. The average annual gain for emerging stock markets was close to zero, their worst decade since the 1930s.
Why does this cycle play out in such a predictable way? The answer is straightforward. After a good run national leaders grow complacent and start spending irresponsibly; businesses and consumers run up debts; investors end up overpaying for stocks; and the dominant companies get lethargic and fall back into the pack.
The United States at the dawn of the 2020s is a complacent land with a rising government deficit, spreading corporate debts and swollen prices not only for the stock of megacorporations like Amazon and Alphabet but also for financial assets of all kinds.
Meanwhile, many other countries, particularly in the emerging world, were forced by pressing financial circumstances to spend the last decade reducing deficits and debt, and enacting reforms that should put their economies in a position to grow more rapidly. Quietly, global economic forces are shifting in ways that could set the stage for a comeback by smaller nations and businesses in the 2020s.
As the United States and China battle to contain each other, their titanic struggle is scaring off trade and investment that is instead shifting to smaller countries, including Vietnam, Taiwan, Mexico, the Netherlands and Ireland. To insulate themselves from the superpower trade war, nations like Brazil and Japan are signing regional and bilateral trade deals.
The big American tech companies, in contrast, face a global regulatory backlash against their monopolistic power. These giants have bought out smaller rivals and driven many out of business. But they also enable many others because their platforms allow millions of entrepreneurs to reach wide audiences, often catering to specific national or regional tastes.
It used to be that big companies competed for limited shelf space in retail stores by winning consumer trust in multiyear, multibillion-dollar TV ad campaigns. Now, internet platforms allow small companies to bypass stores, win public trust instantly through consumer reviews, and build a brand on cheap internet ads, even free YouTube videos.
Globalization is thus gradually giving way to localization, which makes this a promising time for countries with domestic markets large enough to support significant expansion in local businesses. That's especially true of countries where the population is still relatively young and fast growing, like Indonesia, the Philippines, Egypt and Mexico.
Though stock markets worldwide are still dominated by "mega caps" -- companies with a market value or "capitalization" above $ 200 billion -- they face an emerging challenge from companies below that threshold. In finance, the hottest companies are digital payment apps and the small banks that back them. In insurance, the hot subsector is mobile internet insurance services -- "insurtech."
The fastest-growing American food and beverage manufacturers are small ones. Search "ketchup," an American staple once virtually synonymous with a single brand, and you will find more than 680 results including local purveyors selling flavors such as bacon. Driven by apps that serve as gateways to food delivery services, a similar rise of the solo chef is underway worldwide.
Many internet platforms also provide cloud computing, which allows entrepreneurs to build back-office operations like customer relations and bill collection much more quickly and cheaply. Barriers to entry are falling, particularly since many of the hottest internet companies own few physical assets. Uber, the world's largest taxi company, owns no taxis -- but that means future rivals won't have to buy them either.
At the same time, the rise of populist nationalism is injecting patriotic fervor into "buy local" movements. In an October survey, Chinese consumers cited "national loyalty" as the main reason they would "rethink U.S. brands." An ad from an Indian food company urged customers to "perform your patriotic duties" and "boycott products made in China, U.S.A., U.K. and Europe."
These forces conspire to unseat the global giants, which are mainly American. The United States market accounts for well over half of the global value of stock markets, and has never been more expensive relative to other national markets. But remember, churn is the norm. Among the world's 10 largest companies today, only one (Microsoft) was on the top 10 list in December 2009.
If the usual pattern holds, it's likely that America will peak and smaller nations and companies will make a comeback. If the 2010s were a golden age for the world's largest economy and its megacorporations, the 2020s are likely to be remembered as the decade when smaller was beautiful again.

Trump national security team attempted to convince him to reverse hold on Ukraine aid

Texto completo: President Trump's national security advisers intervened in an attempt to get the president to release a hold on nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine but were not successful in their endeavor.
A Sunday report from the New York Times outlined the nearly 90 days after Trump initially put a hold on the aid to the country, during which his national security team tried to convince him that releasing the aid was in the best interest of the United States.
Former national security adviser John Bolton, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reportedly met with the president at the Resolute desk in the Oval Office in August — less than a month after the July 25 phone call in which he asked the Ukrainian president to open an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.
“This is in America’s interest,” Bolton said of releasing the aid at the time.
Esper added that most of the money was being spent on military equipment made in the U.S., saying, “This defense relationship, we have gotten some really good benefits from it."
“Ukraine is a corrupt country,” Trump brushed off their concerns. “We are pissing away our money.”
By late summer, top lawyers at the Office of Management and Budget were developing a proposed legal justification for the hold. However, House Democrats soon caught wind of a whistleblower report alleging that Trump was withholding the aid in exchange for the requested investigation into Biden. After three House committees announced investigations into the matter, the freeze on the aid was suddenly lifted.
The president has maintained that no quid pro quo with Ukraine occurred as the aid was released, and the Biden investigations didn't happen. However, he was impeached by the House earlier this month on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress relating to the scandal. Although House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has yet to hand over the articles of impeachment to the Senate, Trump's trial is expected to begin next month.

Mike Tinius , un feligrés que estaba en la iglesia, declaró a The New York Times que la víctima mortal es un guardia de seguridad del templo que respondió al autor de los disparos.
“Estaba tratando de hacer lo que tenía que hacer para protegernos al resto de nosotros”, declaró el hombre, quien prefirió no identificar a la víctima.
Las autoridades desconocen hasta el momento las motivaciones del autor del ataqu e, que tampoco ha sido identificado.
Macara Trusty, portavoz del MedStar Mobile Healthcare , señaló que una persona sufrió un paro respiratorio mientras era traslada a un hospital, pero lograron revivirla antes de ser llevada a cirugía.
En un comunicado, el gobernador Greg Abbott calificó el hecho como un “diabólico acto de violencia”.
“Los lugares de culto están destinados a ser sagrados, y estoy agradecido por los miembros de la iglesia que actuaron rápidamente para abatir al tirador y ayudar a prevenir una mayor pérdida de vidas”, agregó.
El tiroteo ocurre casi doce horas después de que un hombre fuera detenido en Nueva York tras apuñalar a cinco personas en la residencia de un rabino al norte de la ciudad el sábado, en lo que las autoridades han descrito hoy como “terrorismo doméstico”.

Nonprofit boards and your personal liability

Texto completo: In our last two columns you’ve read about some of the responsibilities of a director on a nonprofit’s board. You may now be thinking, “But why? I’m a volunteer!”
And so enters the lawyer to tell you why in two words: personal liability.
When is a board member liable?
While a board member is a volunteer and afforded substantial protection by law, when duties to the organization are violated (whether through acts or omissions), when certain taxes aren’t paid (notably, payroll taxes), or when a board member engages in self-dealing transactions with the organization or allows others to do so, personal liability may arise.
What are their legal duties?
A nonprofit board member, sometimes called a “trustee,” is a fiduciary — a person who must act for the benefit of another. In this case, a board member is charged with acting for the benefit of the public. It is a serious duty, and a breach of the duties can result in both personal liability and the loss of the entity’s tax exemption.
So what are those duties? In general, a board member owes the duties of care and loyalty.
The duty of care
The duty of care requires the following:
Exercising proper business judgment based on the best interest of the organization (not its board members and certainly not yourself)Being properly informed on all matters voted on, and attending the meetings
Appropriate information flow in and out (you’re obtaining all information you need to make an informed decision), and you’re not disclosing confidential information to anyoneFollowing the organization’s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws
A board member who violates their duty of care (for example, does not attend meetings, or ask questions about matters they don’t understand, or who, through inaction, allows a behavior detrimental to the organization to continue) can be held personally liable for any damage that occurs. There is a California case where a board, because they couldn’t agree on which investment adviser to hire, allowed a multi-million-dollar gift to sit in a non-interest checking account for two years. This caused the organization to lose significant income, and the board members were held personally liable for that. And, they were removed from the board by the Attorney General.
The duty of loyalty
This requires a board member’s faithful pursuit of the interests of the organization they serve and not the financial or other interests of the director or another person or organization. California law prohibits self-dealing transactions between board members and non-profits.
Serious fines can be imposed against the organization and board members if a transaction is entered into between the organization and an interested director, without steps taken to assure that the corporation did it for its own benefit in a fair and reasonable way that was approved in good faith by a majority of directors then in office (not just those at the meeting where the vote is taken), Did they know material facts? And, prior to approval, did the board consider and determine in good faith after reasonable investigation that they could not have obtained a better deal elsewhere?
Say, for example, the organization needs to paint its building. Director Dave is a long-term board member who happens to own a painting business. Dave offers to paint the building for $X and get it done in the next 48 hours. Board members cannot simply decide Dave is a good guy and deserves some business in return for his years of service, plus, he’s willing to do it quickly so why bother looking elsewhere.
No, the board needs to get bids from other painters and make sure that Dave’s price and quality is the best deal. Does the building need to be painted quickly or does that just to suit Dave’s schedule? Is the price fair? Is Dave properly licensed and bonded?
In other words, board members need to do the same due diligence they would for their selves. If they don’t, they could be liable for the funds lost by the organization. And abstaining from the vote won’t help you — if you don’t feel the board has done its due diligence, you will only be spared personal liability by voting “No.”
The IRS wants a word, too
Board members can also encounter unexpected tax liabilities. The IRS has its own rules against self-dealing (or what it calls “Excess Benefit Transactions”). If a “disqualified person” (someone who in the previous five years was in a position of influence over the organization, such as major donors, board members and executive staff) engages in a transaction with the organization that was to the benefit of the disqualified person, the IRS can exert a penalty against not just the disqualified person, but the entire board, for as much as 200% of the amount of the transaction. If Director Dave had been paid more than the going rate for his painting services, he and the board could face these penalties.
And finally, perhaps most shockingly, board members can be held personally liable for the unpaid payroll tax liabilities of the organization. If payroll taxes are not paid, the IRS will look to all responsible parties — the CEO, the CFO, and often board members — to recover the taxes. This is a very good reason for checks and balances for non-profit financial matters and regular audits.
Emphasis on service
It’s a privilege to serve on a non-profit board. First and foremost it’s a service to the community. To perform that service, always look out for the organization first. And. you should also be certain the organization carries Directors & Officers Liability insurance. It’s the smart thing to do.

Victimized Billionaires

Texto completo: In 2010, banks foreclosed on a more than a million homes. The jobless rate for the year hovered just under 10%. But billionaire investor Stephen Schwarzman knew who the real injured party was: the wealthy.
When the Obama administration proposed closing the carried interest loophole, a tax break exploited by those in private equity, Schwarzman couldn’t contain himself any longer. “It’s like when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939,” he claimed at a New York City gathering.
This wasn’t the tea party, hiding its elite funders under the cover of representing the common man or woman. This was one of the wealthiest men in the United States stepping forward to loudly, proudly and angrily claim he’d been done wrong.
Schwarzman quickly apologized. But if we want to understand how the Great Recession led not to an economic overhaul but to record-breaking inequality and the election of Donald Trump - a-to-the-manor-born serial con artist and practitioner of the 1% whine nonpareil - it’s helpful to remember Schwarzman, who turned out to be patient zero for what might just be the decade’s ultimate grift: the rise of millionaires and billionaires as victims.
The Great Recession was supposed to embarrass the wealthy into slinking away embarrassed, grateful they didn’t land in jail or worse. “There’s an angry mob with pitchforks assembling, and they want to see some heads on pikes,” Fortune opined in 2009. But as the stock and real estate markets recovered, so did the self-regard of the most moneyed among us. Shame? That was so Dow 7,550. It’s now over 28,000.
Schwarzman has many a compatriot. Elite gatherings such as the Milken Institute’s Global Conference and the annual World Economic Forum in Davos have become all but encounter sessions for misunderstood multimillionaires and billionaires to agree with one another in the face of calls that they pay their fair share. There’s private equity mogul Leon Cooperman, who actually began to cry on CNBC when complaining about Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s proposed wealth tax on fortunes in excess of $50 million. “I don’t need Elizabeth Warren telling me that I’m a deadbeat and that billionaires are deadbeats,” he said.
The rich victims are all around us. Craig Hall, the real-estate tycoon owner of the now infamous ostentatious Northern California wine cave where Pete Buttigieg held a high-dollar fundraiser? He told The New York Times about the criticisms, “It’s just not fair.” Jacqueline Sackler, wife of a Purdue Pharma heir, the company in part responsible for the opioid epidemic that’s taken the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans? The Wall Street Journal got a hold of an email in which she complained of what she calls the “situation” is “destroying” the family’s reputation, and “dooms” her children.
And no one is more practiced at the art of billionaire self-pity than our president. He’s the victim of a Democratic “witch hunt.” Impeachment? “More due process was accorded to those accused in the Salem Witch Trials.” Yet he signed into law a tax plan so favorable to billionaires in general, and real-estate interests in particular, it might as well have been tailored precisely for him.
But according to Republicans, the obscene gains of the wealthy aren’t the problem. In 2012, GOP presidential nominee and multimillionaire Mitt Romney, speaking to a group of big-money donors, referred to 47% of Americans who didn’t pay federal taxes and needed government benefits to get by as “takers,” adding, they believe “they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name it.” (Entitled to food! Imagine that.)
The Trump administration, which boasts the wealthiest presidential Cabinet ever assembled, has spent almost three years attempting to make it harder for people to receive Medicaid, food assistance and even a free lunch at school. They are aided by self-appointed watchdogs, too, such as Minnesota retiree Rob Undersander, who outed himself as a millionaire so he could publicize the supposedly pressing issue of people who have six- and seven-figure net worth receiving food stamps because their income is below eligibility thresholds. (In fact, survey research shows such households account for about 3% of households receiving assistance via the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program).
Meanwhile, of course, the wealthy make out. Studies show, not surprisingly, that their opinions carry much more weight with politicians than those of more ordinary voters. But the claim of victimization is one way they seek to protect themselves from some popular anger and the financial consequences they might otherwise face, ensuring their power, wealth and privilege remains intact while they can continue to promote their self-perceived unique virtue and smarts. Here’s one telling example: Despite Trump’s campaign promises, the carried interest loophole remains a part of the federal tax code. Steve Schwarzman, your infamy was not in vain.

Texto completo: The editor-in-chief of Christianity Today, Mark Galli, wrote an editorial calling for the impeachment of President Donald Trump.
In my view, this editorial only serves to confirm one of the sadder realizations of my life: that religious conviction guarantees neither moral clarity nor common sense.
The gist of the editorial - and of most religious and conservative opposition to Mr. Trump - is that any good the president has done is dwarfed by his character defects.
This is an amoral view that says more about Mr. Galli than it does about the president. He and the people who share his opinion are making the following statement: No matter how much good this president does, it is less important than his character flaws.
Why is this wrong?
First, because it devalues policies that benefit millions of people.
And second, because it is a simplistic view of character.
I do not know how to assess a person's character - including my own - outside of how one's actions affect others. Because I agree with almost all of Mr. Trump's actions as president and believe they have positively affected millions of people, I have to conclude that as president, Mr. Trump thus far has been a man of particularly good character.
Of course, if you think his policies have harmed millions of people, you will assess his character negatively. But that is not what never-Trump conservatives or Christians such as the Christianity Today editor-in-chief argue. They argue that his policies have indeed helped America (and even the world), but this fact is far less significant than his character.
In the words of Mr. Galli: "(I)t's time to call a spade a spade, to say that no matter how many hands we win in this political poker game, we are playing with a stacked deck of gross immorality and ethical incompetence."
This rhetorical sleight of hand reflects poorly on Mr. Galli's intellectual and moral honesty.
Mr. Galli and every other Christian and conservative opponent of the president believe their concerns are moral, and that the president's Christian and other conservative supporters are political.
This is simply wrong.
I and every other supporter of the president I know support him for moral reasons, not to win a "political poker game." Mr. Galli's view is purely self-serving; he's saying, "We Christian and other conservative opponents of the president think in moral terms, while Christian and other conservative supporters of the president think in political terms."
So, permit me to inform Mr. Galli and all the other people who consider themselves conservative and/or Christian that our support for the president is entirely moral.
* To us, putting pressure on the Iranian regime - one of the most evil and dangerous regimes on Earth - by getting out of the Iran nuclear deal made by former President Barack Obama is a moral issue. Even New York Times columnist Bret Stephens, who loathes Mr. Trump, has written how important the president's rejection of the Obama-Iran agreement has been.
* To us, enabling millions of black Americans to find work - resulting in the lowest black unemployment rate ever recorded - is a moral issue.
* To us, more Americans than ever being employed and almost 4 million Americans freed from reliance on food stamps is a moral issue.
* To us, appointing more conservative judges than any president in history - over the same period of time - is a moral issue. That whether the courts, including the Supreme Court, are dominated by the left or by conservatives is dismissed by Mr. Galli as "political poker" makes one question not only Galli's moral thinking but also his moral theology.
* To us, moving the American embassy to Israel's capital city, Jerusalem - something promised by almost every presidential candidate - is a moral issue, not to mention profoundly courageous. And courage is a moral virtue.
* To us, increasing the U.S. military budget - after the severe cuts of the previous eight years - is a moral issue. As conservatives see it, the American military is the world's greatest guarantor of world peace.
Yet, none of these things matter to Mr. Galli and other misguided Christians and conservatives. What matters more to them is Mr. Trump's occasional crude language and intemperate tweets, what he said about women in a private conversation and his having committed adultery.
Regarding adultery, that sin is for spouses and God to judge. There is no connection between marital sexual fidelity and moral leadership. I wish there were. And as regards the "Access Hollywood" tape, every religious person, indeed every thinking person, should understand that there is no connection between what people say privately and their ability to be a moral leader. That's why I wrote a column for the Wall Street Journal 20 years ago defending Hillary Clinton when she was charged with having privately expressed anti-Semitic sentiments.
That the editor of Christianity Today thinks the president's personal flaws, whatever they might be, are more important than all the good he has done for conservatives, for Christians, for Jews, for blacks and for America tells us a lot ... about Mr. Galli and the decline of Christian moral thought.

Texto completo: Investigators hope to link DNA detected on the clothes worn by Ms. Majors, a Barnard student, to the three teenage suspects.
Investigators are focusing on DNA evidence in their efforts to build a case in the killing of Tessa Majors, the Barnard College student who was stabbed during a park mugging in Manhattan early this month, officials said on Friday.
The push for conclusive evidence comes a day after detectives detained and then released a 14-year-old believed to have wielded the knife that killed Ms. Majors.
An official with knowledge of the investigation said the police were banking on pending DNA results they hoped would allow prosecutors to charge all three of the minors suspected of attacking Ms. Majors on Dec. 11 in Morningside Park, near the Columbia University campus.
Investigators have tested Ms. Majors's mouth and the clothes she was wearing the night she was killed, as well as pieces of clothing they managed to recover from the suspects, who are ages 13 and 14, said an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The New York Police Department's chief of detectives, Rodney Harrison, said on Friday that a Manhattan judge had issued an order to obtain forensic evidence from the 14-year-old who was detained on Thursday. He would not say whether that evidence would include a DNA sample.
Chief Harrison said he expected to get results from the forensic evidence testing in three to seven days. Investigators are monitoring the teenagers, he added.
The police charged a 13-year-old with second-degree felony murder the day after the killing and tried to interview one of the two 14-year-olds. But the 14-year-old -- who is not the teenager who the police believe stabbed Ms. Majors -- requested a lawyer and declined to give a statement, officials said.
The 13-year-old, whom The New York Times is not naming because he is not being charged as an adult, will be prosecuted in family court on the felony murder charge, meaning he is accused of taking part in the attack and not of stabbing Ms. Majors.
On Thursday, the police announced a break in the case, saying they had found the second 14-year-old at a family member's home in the Bronx. But a few hours later, he was released. He had been questioned in the presence of a lawyer, the police said.
The authorities believed that the teenager's family was shielding him until a mark on his hand fully healed. An official described the mark as consistent with a bite.
Ms. Majors, who had moved to New York from Virginia to attend Barnard months earlier, was walking in Morningside Park the night of Dec. 11 when at least three teenagers tried to rob her, the police said. She stumbled out of the park and, investigators said, collapsed on a sidewalk near West 116th Street and Morningside Drive. Sometime later, a campus security guard found her bleeding to death.
The next day, the police arrested the 13-year-old. In an interview with detectives, the teenager implicated himself and two 14-year-old middle school classmates in the attack, the police said.
The 13-year-old told the police that his classmates grabbed Ms. Majors from behind, according to two detectives who have testified during court hearings. During a struggle, the 13-year-old said, the 14-year-old wielding a knife stabbed her so forcibly that feathers from her winter coat flew into the air.
Ms. Majors's killing struck a chord in a city experiencing record-low violent crime rates and evoked an era when many people avoided going into parks after sunset.
The shadow of the April 1989 attack on a jogger in Central Park has also loomed over the murder investigation. Thirty years ago, the police and prosecutors relied on tough interrogation techniques to obtain confessions from five teenagers accused of the attack. The confessions were later proven to be false.
From the beginning, police officials have said they have taken extra steps to safeguard the teenagers' legal rights in Ms. Majors's case. All three teenagers, police officials said, have answered questions in the presence of a guardian or lawyer.

Texto completo: When the holidays end, it's tempting to just dump all of your decorations into a box. Don't. Take as much care putting them away as you did putting them up. Everything will last longer, and you'll have an easier time setting it all up again next year. Think of the extra work to do it right as a gift to Future You. Thom Dunn
MAKE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS LAST. You can buy reels or spools to wrap lights, but Jason Woodward from Christmas Designers advises against it. Woodward suggests simply wrapping the lights on their own, without using any kind of mold or guide, and then tying them off in the middle with a twist tie or rubber band. He also recommends that you don't keep them in uninsulated spaces (attics, basements), because extreme temperatures and humidity can reduce the lights' life span.
USE A STORAGE BAG FOR AN ARTIFICIAL TREE. Disassemble the tree carefully, folding the branch tips back toward the trunk to make it compact for storage, and making sure the small branches don't get bent in the wrong direction. Invest in a dedicated storage bag, such as the Elf Stor Premium Christmas Bag, which will help keep your tree safe from dust, moisture or other elements that could wear down its pristine plastic pines. Some companies sell rolling duffel bags, which may be easier to move.
LEAVE YOURSELF CLUES FOR NEXT YEAR'S SETUP. Before putting everything away, keep track of how you installed things and what worked (or didn't). "Before taking down your lights and decorations, take pictures and make notes as to how everything should be reinstalled and how you have the power cords running," says Woodward. "Be sure and attach a label clearly detailing where it was removed from."

Blackface at the ballet highlights a racial divide

Texto completo: Blackface at the ballet highlights a racial divide
Earlier this month, Misty Copeland posted a photo to her 1.8 million followers on Instagram. "This is the reality of the ballet world," wrote Copeland, the first African-American female principal at American Ballet Theater.
The image was from a rehearsal at the Bolshoi in Moscow, one of the world's leading ballet companies. It showed two women, smiling wide, in full dress for "La Bayadere," a 19th-century ballet set in India.
The dancers were in blackface.
Copeland's post, and her later comments on Twitter ("Until we can call people out and make people uncomfortable, change can't happen," she wrote), have led to weeks of debate among ballet fans, highlighting a growing geographic divide on questions of race and representation.
In the United States the use of dark makeup evokes the painful legacy of racism and minstrel shows, in which performers darkened their skin with burnt cork to play characters that perpetuated racist stereotypes about African Americans. But while the practice is increasingly rare in North America - notwithstanding several recent instances in which politicians in the United States and Canada apologized for wearing blackface or dark makeup long after it was widely seen as offensive - it persists in parts of Europe and Russia.
"I've smeared my face and body with a stain a thousand times," Anna Okuneva, a dancer at the Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko company in Moscow, wrote on Instagram. "This is my creative work, and this is not racism."
Some African-American dancers disagree. Calvin Royal III, a soloist at the American Ballet Theater, said in a telephone interview that his immediate reaction on seeing the image was to cringe and ask, "How is it we're heading into 2020 and this is a reality in some places?"
Dana Nichols, a dancer with the Philadanco company in Philadelphia, said that, as a child, she had been made to wear dark makeup by another leading Russian ballet company, the Mariinsky, despite being Black. "It's easy to be trapped into doing things like this in the name of an art form you love," she said of the Bolshoi photo. "But you also have to be a citizen of the world and know this is stereotyping and degrading."
In June, Anna Netrebko, a Russian opera singer, caused a stir by posting a picture on Instagram with her skin darkened for a performance of Verdi's "Aida," in which she was singing the title role, an Ethiopian princess. "Beautiful singing! But is the blackface really necessary?" one commenter wrote.
Maxim Matusevich, a professor at Seton Hall University in New Jersey, who studies cultural exchange between Russia and Africa, said in a telephone interview that blackface was not widespread in Russia, but neither was it taboo. "There Is no symbolic baggage with it," he said, and that allows Russians to consider the makeup as simply part of a theatrical tradition. There are also few people of color there to complain of its use, he added.
In Soviet times, racism was seen as an American problem, said Nikolay Zakharov, the author of a book on racism In Russia, in a telephone interview: "They said that it's America who has the racism, segregation and lynching. We don't have this, so we're anti-racist."
Over the past five years, there has been a conservative turn in Russia's arts world that means people defend politically incorrect actions like blackface more firmly, Zakharov added. And there remains a dislike of being told what to do by the West, he said. "People say It's just scapegoating of Russia, and it's absurd."
These points echoed some comments on Copeland's Instagram post, and in Russian news media. "Russian ballet should not be guided by what an artist wrote on the other side of the world," Nikolai Tsiskaridze, who danced at the Bolshoi for more than 20 years, said in an interview with Izvestia, a Russian newspaper. "This is our culture," he added.
Vladimir Urin, the Bolshoi's general director, said in a statement that the Bolshoi "will not comment on the absurd allegation" of racism. A spokeswoman for the company declined an interview request.
Benjamin Millepied, the a-tistic director of the Los Angeles Dance Project, said in a telephone interview that, when he was the director of dance at the Paris Opera Ballet, he heard similar arguments that blackface In ballet was a tradition and shouldn't be considered offensive.
In 2015, he faced strong opposition when he announced he would change a scene in the company's production of "La Bayadere," that included children In blackface, so they did not wear makeup. He also wanted to change the playbill so the children were listed as "enfants" rather than "négrillons," or "little negroes."
"You don't understand, this is tradition," Millepied recalled being told by the head of the ballet's union. Millepied, who danced for years at New York City Ballet, had the "bewildering" experience of having to call a meeting of the entire company to explain why the blackface was wrong, he said.
"I told them to think of a black family walking into the opera, and seeing themselves shown onstage in this grotesque fashion," Millepied said.
His arguments won out and the changes were made, but Millepied resigned from the Paris Opera Ballet in 2016, citing the struggle over "La Bayadere" as one reason for leaving. The Opera, where staff are currently on strike, did not respond to an interview request.
Awareness of racist stereotypes in ballet productions has been growing among companies in the United States, too. In 2017, the New York City Ballet altered the choreography, costumes and makeup in "The Nutcracker" to remove racial stereotypes about Chinese people. The male dancer in one segment traditionally wore a Fu Manchu-style mustache.
Despite these efforts, the ballet world has been Insular, Millepied said, and "not open to looking at some of these issues staring them in the eye."
He referred to an article in The Guardian in November, in which Jean-Christophe Maillot, the director of Les Ballets de Monte-Carlo, discussed the idea that an ensemble of dancers, or corps de ballet, should look identical onstage. "If you ask me if a traditional 'Swan Lake' at the Mariinsky can have a Black girl in the corps de ballet, I can tell you, honestly, that I don't have the answer," Maillot said. "But I feel like telling you no."
Such comments were upsetting, Millepied said, and showed a lack of empathy and understanding about what dance should be, which is a celebration of human diversity and movement.
In the debate about the Bolshoi's production of "La Bayadere," not all dancers of color have criticized the Russian company. Rasta Thomas, a former member of the Dance Theater of Harlem who described himself as multiracial, said in a telephone interview that we should judge historical and contemporary productions by different criteria.
"It is up to the new artists to make the changes they so desire, not to complain about past traditions, and art being preserved in their original forms," he said.
The complaints about the Bolshoi were "a bit ridiculous," he wrote later in a text message. "No one would be talking about the art form had the Russians not given us these great ballets," he said, adding that anyone "who is not European, performing classic ballets, is guilty of cultural appropriation."
Not all Russians have taken the Bolshoi's side. Alexei Ratmansky, a former director of the company, now an artist in residence at American Ballet Theater, wrote on Facebook that it was time to drop blackface.
"What is the artistic value in black makeup, under which you can't even recognize an artist?" he wrote. "Why provoke?"

As Pelosi plays games with impeachment, what now, GOP?

Resumen: The House of Representatives impeached President Bill Clinton on Dec. 19, 1998. On Wednesday, Dec. 18, at around 8 p.m., the Democratic-controlled House passed two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump. Pelosi acted after a Harvard professor and zealous impeachment advocate, Laurence Tribe, published an op-ed in The Washington Post arguing the Democratic strategy should be "voting for articles of impeachment but holding off for the time being on transmitting them to the Senate."

Texto completo: The House of Representatives impeached President Bill Clinton on Dec. 19, 1998. The votes, in which two articles of impeachment passed, were held around midday. By 3 p.m., the House had named its impeachment managers and physically delivered the articles to the Senate for trial.
Impeachment was on. The House, controlled by a Republican majority, was serious about its ultimately failed effort to remove Clinton from office.
Contrast that to today. On Wednesday, Dec. 18, at around 8 p.m., the Democratic-controlled House passed two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi immediately announced the House would not appoint managers, and the articles would not be delivered to the Senate. The next day, Pelosi told reporters she did not want to talk anymore about it, and the House went into recess until Jan. 7.
Impeachment was not on, or at least a Senate trial was not on. Pelosi was holding out, apparently, for better terms in a Senate trial.
Pelosi acted after a Harvard professor and zealous impeachment advocate, Laurence Tribe, published an op-ed in The Washington Post arguing the Democratic strategy should be "voting for articles of impeachment but holding off for the time being on transmitting them to the Senate."
Withholding the articles, Tribe said, would strengthen Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer’s hand as he negotiates with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on the terms of the trial. It would do so, Tribe speculated, "because of McConnell’s and Trump’s urgent desire to get this whole business behind them."
Without concessions from McConnell, Tribe urged Democrats to withhold the articles indefinitely, because a trial dominated by majority Republicans "would fail to render a meaningful verdict of acquittal."
It seemed a far-fetched idea, to be generous. McConnell and Senate Republicans would be perfectly happy if they never had to hold a trial.
I asked one GOP lawmaker, via text, what the party’s reaction was. He texted back a one-word answer: "Laughter."
Nevertheless, Tribe’s idea took off in some circles of the Democratic left. His column was published on Monday morning, and by Wednesday night Pelosi had adopted his plan.
Just to be clear: Pelosi has no leverage over a Senate proceeding. The Constitution gives the House the "sole power" to impeach, a power Pelosi and her majority used to its fullest. But the Constitution gives the Senate the "sole power" to try all impeachments. The speaker of the House has no role.
Given that, Republicans have been wondering what Pelosi is up to. Crazy theories — at least they seem to be crazy theories — have emerged.
Democrats would impeach the president repeatedly. (That was actually a serious suggestion from a New York Times columnist in October.) Or Democrats would never send the articles to the Senate, to keep impeachment hanging over Trump’s head. Or whatever.
The key Democrats aren’t saying. But one plausible notion came from The Hill columnist A.B. Stoddard. There is, Stoddard said, "a lot of pressure on Democrats to wait this out until there is more to throw at the president."
It’s not clear precisely how that would work, because the House has already passed two articles of impeachment that make specific accusations.
Beyond that, withholding impeachment indefinitely in hopes that a federal investigation will come up with something big — basically what Democrats did in the Trump-Russia affair — might end in disappointment.
In any event, Pelosi is withholding the articles of impeachment. It is unclear how long she will do it, but it seems they will be withheld at least until Jan. 7, when the House returns for business. That alone will delay a Senate trial significantly.
In the limbo Pelosi has created, almost anything seems possible.

Texto completo: You won't hear young Democrats deride Bernie Sanders with the "OK, boomer" dig. At 78, he's actually too old for the cohort, but that's not why he won't get dinged. He's the most popular Democrat among the under-35 crowd, and judging by recent polling, he's the second-most popular Democrat overall. Sanders has raised nearly twice as much money as the frontrunner, Joe Biden, and seems to have scooped up support from a declining Elizabeth Warren in the past 60 days. Despite a heart attack that sidelined him for a week, he marches on, now buoyed by a poll showing that in a head-to-head matchup against Donald Trump, he would do better than Biden -- though within the margin of error.
Sanders' appeal, the experts explain, is founded on "authenticity." Is he humorless, repetitive, cloying and rigid? Sure. But these are signs that he really believes something! He's not a packaged, blow-dried (no argument there), insincere pol cooked up in a political laboratory. He's the real deal.
Let's concede that Sanders is sincere, and that he is, with some small hypocrisies -- did you know he was a millionaire? -- honest. But what people actually believe is kind of important, and Sanders professes and sells a series of prejudices that do him no credit.
Sanders claims to be a democratic socialist in the European mold, an admirer of Sweden and Denmark. Yet his career is pockmarked with praise for regimes considerably to the left of those Scandinavian models. He has praised Cuba for "making enormous progress in improving the lives of poor and working people." In his memoir, he bragged about attending a 1985 parade celebrating the Sandinistas' seizure of power six years before. "Believe it or not," he wrote, "I was the highest ranking American official there." At the time, the Sandinista regime had already allied with Cuba and begun a large military buildup, courtesy of the Soviet Union. The Sandinistas, Sanders had every reason to know, had censored independent news outlets, nationalized half of the nation's industry, forcibly displaced the Miskito Indians and formed "neighborhood watch" committees on the Cuban model. Sandinista forces, like those in East Germany and other communist countries, regularly opened fire on those attempting to flee the country. None of that appears to have dampened Sanders' enthusiasm. The then-mayor of Burlington, Vermont, gushed that under his leadership, "Vermont could set an example to the rest of the nation similar to the type of example Nicaragua is setting for the rest of Latin America."
Sanders was impatient with those who found fault with the Nicaraguan regime:
"Is (the Sandinistas') crime that they have built new health clinics, schools, and distributed land to the peasants? Is their crime that they have given equal rights to women? Or that they are moving forward to wipe out illiteracy? No, their crime in Mr. Reagan's eyes and the eyes of corporations and billionaires that determine American foreign policy is that they have refused to be a puppet and banana republic to American corporate interests."
Sanders now calls for a revolution in this country, and we're all expected to nod knowingly. Of course, he means a peaceful, democratic revolution. It would be outrageous to suggest anything else. Well, it would not be possible for Sanders to usher in a revolution in the U.S., but his sympathy for the real thing is notable. As Michael Moynihan reported, in the case of the Sandinistas, he was willing to justify press censorship and even bread lines. The regime's crackdown on the largest independent newspaper, La Prensa, "makes sense to me" Sanders explained, because the country was besieged by counterrevolutionary forces funded by the United States. As for bread lines, which soon appeared in Nicaragua, as they would decades later in Venezuela, Sanders scoffed: "It's funny, sometimes American journalists talk about how bad a country is, that people are lining up for food. That is a good thing! In other countries people don't line up for food. The rich get the food, and the poor starve to death."
Sanders stopped learning about economics and politics about the age of 17. He still believes that corporate "greed" is responsible for human poverty, and that the world is a zero-sum pie. The more billionaires there are, the less there is for everyone else. "I don't think billionaires should exist," he told The New York Times. So in the Bernie ideal world, we non-billionaires would be deprived of Amazon, personal computers, smartphones, fracking (which reduces greenhouse gases), Uber, Walmart, "Star Wars" movies and very possibly our jobs. Millions of children would be deprived of school scholarships, while the arts, medical research and poverty programs would be that much poorer. Billionaires are not heroes, but by making them boogeymen, Sanders betrays his economic infantilism along with a large dose of demagoguery.

Texto completo: If you are GOP supporters sending donations to the Republican National Committee or you are taxpayers, beware. Why? Your money is being used to enrich Trump and his family. So how is this happening?
Recently Trump Jr. authored a book and the RNC spent $100,000 of donated money to buy thousands of copies, making the book a New York Times bestseller. When asked about this, they lied until confronted with evidence. One wonders what other products are being purchased to funnel donations into the Trump family coffers.
The RNC has spent millions to host official party functions at Trump hotels, resorts and golf courses instead of investing donations to finance the GOP agenda, unless making the wealthy wealthier is their real agenda.
Most individual donations come from people of modest means wanting improved economic conditions and traditional conservative values. Tariffs, tax cuts for the rich, exploding debt, disrespect for truth, the law and the Constitution are hardly what the GOP advocated for decades.
Security for Trumps family who conduct business worldwide, government and military personnel staying at Trump properties, tax reform discriminating against people in blue states because of limits on property tax deductions, farm subsidy dollars unequally dispersed, payments to rich donors who own for-profit detention centers and prisons, upgrades at Camp David making it a posh retreat for Republicans and Barrs legal representation and investigations for Trumps personal benefit waste billions of our tax dollars.
Isnt it time to become independent voters and pledge loyalty to America and stop being Trump chumps?

Texto completo: Often described as an equal partner to the singers he performed with, he preferred to be called simply a pianist.
Dalton Baldwin, an American pianist and recording artist who was acclaimed for nearly six decades as a recital accompanist to major singers, including Elly Ameling, Jessye Norman and especially the French baritone Gérard Souzay, died on Dec. 12 in Kunming, in the Yunnan Province of China. He was 87.
His death, a week before his 88th birthday, was announced by Ben Turman, the vice consul of the United States Consulate in Chengdu. Mr. Baldwin had recently completed three weeks of performances and coaching sessions with students in Japan and was returning from a short trip to Myanmar to visit Buddhist temples when he collapsed on a flight to Tokyo. The plane made an emergency landing in Kunming, where he was taken to a hospital and died.
He had performed on five continents and made more than 100 recordings over his career.
Although Mr. Baldwin was an eminence among accompanists, he was not fond of that word. Like many of his colleagues, he preferred to be called simply a pianist.
Critics affirmed that he was no mere accompanist. While consistently praising the refinement, sensitivity and technical command of his playing, they routinely described him as an equal partner to the singers he performed with.
In a review of a 1978 recital by Ms. Ameling at Alice Tully Hall, John Rockwell of The New York Times wrote that Mr. Baldwin "was worthy of a review all his own." This was "piano playing of a lyrical and dramatic sympathy and a rhythmic energy that superbly partnered the singer," Mr. Rockwell concluded.
Writing about a 1968 recording of songs by Francois Poulenc, featuring Mr. Souzay and Mr. Baldwin, the Times critic Allen Hughes observed that "the two performers work together so superbly that their interpretations are almost inseparable into individual elements."
Mr. Baldwin was 22 when he met and first worked with Mr. Souzay, who was 13 years older and already an admired interpreter of song. Their professional relationship grew into a personal one, though they remained discreet about it; they built a home together in Antibes, on the Riviera, where Mr. Souzay died in 2004 at 85.
The important singers with whom Mr. Baldwin partnered on concert tours inevitably attracted more attention than he did, as he wryly noted in a 1983 interview with The Times. Speaking of a recital at the Salzburg Festival with Ms. Ameling, Mr. Baldwin said that his name was as large as hers on the poster, which gave him "a good feeling" -- though, he added, "of course, I didn't get anything like her fee."
"Accompanists are underrated in every respect -- financially, acclaim," he said. Once, he said, a critic even referred to him in a review as someone else: Gerald Moore, the distinguished British accompanist.
In another Times article, from 1996, Mr. Baldwin was quoted as explaining that being an accompanist required not just musical talent but also a flair for ad hoc psychiatry, because "singers are such vulnerable people." Mr. Baldwin clearly handled this element of the relationship sensitively; some of the major singers of his era were tenaciously loyal to him.
Dalton Baldwin was born on Dec. 19, 1931, in Summit, N.J., to Dalton Graf Baldwin, who worked in the insurance business, and Helen (Cahill) Baldwin. He is survived by a sister, Martha Baldwin Nelson. Another sister, Anne Baldwin Kurtosi, died before him.
Mr. Baldwin was drawn to music early. As a high school student, he attended a recital in Morristown, N.J., by the great English contralto Kathleen Ferrier that proved pivotal.
"You know immediately when a singer has a personal message," he said in the 1996 interview. Ferrier "had lovely rosy cheeks and an enchanting way, and there again was a message, introducing me to the world of song."
After studying at the Juilliard School, he attended the Oberlin Conservatory of Music in Ohio, where he received a bachelor of music degree. In Paris he studied with the renowned pedagogue Nadia Boulanger, began his association with Mr. Souzay and was coached by several composers, including Poulenc and Frank Martin.
Mr. Baldwin is best known for his performances and recordings of French art songs. His extensive discography includes the complete songs of Poulenc, Debussy, Faure and Ravel. He also won high praise for his performances of Schubert and Schumann. And he introduced a number of new works, including, with Mr. Souzay, the 1969 premiere in Washington of Ned Rorem's "War Scenes," a cycle of five songs with texts from Walt Whitman's "Specimen Days," dedicated by the composer to "those who died in Vietnam, both sides."
The illustrious singers he worked with also included Marilyn Horne, Nicolai Gedda, Jennie Tourel, Frederica von Stade and José van Dam. He began his long association with Ms. Ameling in 1970 and, a few years later, began working with Jessye Norman (who died in September).
Mr. Baldwin was a teacher and coach to young pianists and singers and regularly gave master classes at the Salzburg Mozarteum, the national conservatories of Paris and Madrid, a summer academy in Nice and elsewhere. In recent years he taught at Westminster Choir College of Rider University in Princeton, N.J., and had a home near the campus.
Though he also performed with leading instrumentalists like the violinist Henryk Szeryng and the cellist Pierre Fournier, Mr. Baldwin said he liked working with singers best.
"I worship the human voice," he said in 1996. "There's nothing like singing; it's a romance when you share the music and the poem. The voice is God's instrument. I want them to enjoy music making. That's what it should be about: la joie."

Resumen: Here’s some of what it takes: * You need a legislative draftsman, someone who understands the specialized language of bill-writing and how to translate ideas into law; * You’ll almost certainly need several lawyers involved to steer clear of legal shoals, as well as budget experts who can handle cost estimates and projections; * It’s helpful to have someone who understands what constitutes ethical and unethical behavior in the field you’re addressing; * There are a lot of subject matters that play a role in almost any major problem: environmental, financial, security and military, logistics, health, education, international dimensions — and you’ll want to be able to consult with experts in all of them; * Because, almost invariably, you’re dealing with computer systems or actual machinery, it’s helpful to have the appropriate types of engineers on hand; * It’s often helpful to work with a historian or two who can put the problem in context; * You need people who are familiar with the private sector and understand what businesses and corporations can and cannot reasonably achieve, since so many issues today involve both the public and private sectors; * You have to be able to understand and cover the politics of your approach, meaning you need people who can bridge the White House and Congress or the governor’s office and the legislature; * Somewhere along the line you’ll need PR experts who understand radio, print, TV, and social media, since you’ll have to enlist the public, or at least win its support; * And, of course, you’ll need to figure out how to raise the money you’ll need, both through the public purse and from the private and nonprofit worlds. By and large, this country is served by a professional and dedicated group of public employees, whether you’re talking about the National Weather Service, the Foreign Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Defense Department ...

Texto completo: Not long ago, I was in a meeting to talk about a public policy issue. It was a little complex, and as we considered the various angles I began to think about what it would take to translate talk into change on the ground. I wasn’t analyzing the politics of it — I was focused on the types of people who’d have to roll up their sleeves.
What I came away with was a list of skills, none of them unusual, but all of them vital to getting things done in the increasingly complicated world that government faces. Here’s some of what it takes: * You need a legislative draftsman, someone who understands the specialized language of bill-writing and how to translate ideas into law; * You’ll almost certainly need several lawyers involved to steer clear of legal shoals, as well as budget experts who can handle cost estimates and projections; * It’s helpful to have someone who understands what constitutes ethical and unethical behavior in the field you’re addressing; * There are a lot of subject matters that play a role in almost any major problem: environmental, financial, security and military, logistics, health, education, international dimensions — and you’ll want to be able to consult with experts in all of them; * Because, almost invariably, you’re dealing with computer systems or actual machinery, it’s helpful to have the appropriate types of engineers on hand; * It’s often helpful to work with a historian or two who can put the problem in context; * You need people who are familiar with the private sector and understand what businesses and corporations can and cannot reasonably achieve, since so many issues today involve both the public and private sectors; * You have to be able to understand and cover the politics of your approach, meaning you need people who can bridge the White House and Congress or the governor’s office and the legislature; * Somewhere along the line you’ll need PR experts who understand radio, print, TV, and social media, since you’ll have to enlist the public, or at least win its support; * And, of course, you’ll need to figure out how to raise the money you’ll need, both through the public purse and from the private and nonprofit worlds.
My point is simple: To make our system and this country work, we need a lot of experts and competent bureaucrats to deal with the problems that come cascading down on government. And here’s what I can tell you, after decades of close contact with federal civil servants: We have them. By and large, this country is served by a professional and dedicated group of public employees, whether you’re talking about the National Weather Service, the Foreign Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Defense Department ... We’re blessed with a lot of talented people.
Which is why I’ve never shared the contempt and outright hostility toward federal bureaucrats that is so often expressed in the public arena these days. They deal with very tough problems and they’re usually good at what they do. They just don’t toot their own horns about it.
This was on full display in the recent House Intelligence Committee hearings on impeachment. As New York Times columnist David Brooks put it recently, "[T]he civil servant witnesses answering questions inspired a lot more confidence than the elected officials who were asking them." He went on to quote political scientist Hugh Heclo, "It is when you deal with someone who does not perform in a ‘professional’ manner that you learn to appreciate those who do."
This doesn’t mean that there aren’t some bad apples within the bureaucracy. There always are, but they’re rare. And most of the time, inspectors general, administrative processes, and, when it’s working, congressional oversight address the problems reasonably well. Attacking cabinet officials and civil service employees publicly, the way President Trump seems to enjoy doing, seems counterproductive. These are, after all, the very people he has to depend on to move his programs forward.
In the face of the many challenges we confront, the professionalism, talent, and competence of our civil servants matter. We’ve been fortunate: many of them have withstood attacks on themselves and the systems they depend on for support. So far.

Texto completo: By Trump-era standards, Ebenezer Scrooge was a nice guy.
It’s common, especially around this time of year, to describe conservative politicians who cut off aid to the poor as Scrooges; I’ve done it myself. But if you think about it, this is deeply unfair to Scrooge.
For while Dickens portrays Scrooge as a miser, he’s notably lacking in malice. True, he’s heartless until he’s visited by various ghosts. But his heartlessness consists merely of unwillingness to help those in need. He’s never shown taking pleasure in others’ suffering, or spending money to make the lives of the poor worse.
These are things you can’t say about the modern American right. In fact, many conservative politicians only pretend to be Scrooges, when they’re actually much worse — not mere misers, but actively cruel. This was true long before Donald Trump moved into the White House. What’s new about the Trump era is that the cruelty is more open, not just on Trump’s part, but throughout his party.
Now, the conventional wisdom about today’s Republicans is indeed that they are Scrooge-like. That is, the story is that they want to serve the interests of the rich (which is true), and that the reason they want to slash aid to the poor is to free up money for plutocrat-friendly tax cuts.
But is that really why the right is so determined to cut programs like food stamps and unemployment benefits?
After all, the explosion of the budget deficit under Trump shows that Republican claims to care about fiscal responsibility were always humbug, that they’re perfectly willing to slash taxes on the rich without offsetting spending cuts. Furthermore, because America spends relatively little money helping the poor, even harsh cuts — like the Trump administration’s new rules on food stamps, which will hurt hundreds of thousands — will at best save only tiny amounts compared with the cost of tax cuts.
And in important cases, the right is so eager to hurt low-income Americans that it’s willing to do so even if there are no budget savings at all.
Consider the case of Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, which a 2012 Supreme Court decision made optional: States could choose not to participate.
Why would any state make that choice? After all, the federal government will pay 90% of the cost, and experience shows that expanding Medicaid produces indirect cost savings — for example, by letting states reduce aid to hospitals for uncompensated costs.
Furthermore, the federal funds brought in by Medicaid expansion boost a state’s economy, which raises tax revenues. So expansion is, from a state fiscal point of view, neutral or even net positive. Why would any state turn it down?
Yet 14 Republican-controlled states, many among the nation’s poorest, are still refusing to expand Medicaid.
At the same time, a number of states are trying to limit access to Medicaid by imposing stringent work requirements. This may sound like a cost-saving measure, but it isn’t — trying to enforce work requirements, it turns out, costs a lot of money.
The point is that these state governments are only pretending to be penny pinchers. In reality, they’re actively trying to make peoples’ lives worse, and they’re willing to lose money to accomplish that goal. But why?
In 2018, The Atlantic published a memorable essay by Adam Serwer titled “The Cruelty Is the Point,” about the political importance of shared pleasure from other people’s suffering. Serwer was inspired to write that essay by photos of lynchings, which show groups of white men obviously enjoying the show. Indeed, in America, gratuitous cruelty has often been directed at people of color.
But as Serwer also noted, it’s not just about race. There are more people than we like to imagine who rejoice in the suffering of anyone they see as unlike themselves, especially anyone they perceive as weak.
In fact, I suspect that this mentality is part of the explanation for the seeming paradox of strong Republican support in places like eastern Kentucky where large numbers of poor whites depend on programs like food stamps: Those who aren’t receiving aid actually want to see their poorer neighbors hurt.
What Trump has brought to his party is a new willingness to be openly vicious.
I’m not saying that he’s honest about his motivations. He and his aides still go through the motions of pretending that actions like denying aid to storm-ravaged Puerto Ricans or cutting off food stamps for hundreds of thousands are about fighting corruption or enforcing fiscal responsibility.
But their attempts to justify cruelty as being somehow in the national interest are low energy, especially compared with the enthusiastic nastiness Trump exhibits at political rallies. Trump has celebrated and reportedly wants to campaign with servicemen he pardoned after our own military convicted them of or charged them with war crimes, clearly because he likes the idea of indiscriminate killing — and so do some of his supporters.
So I’m going to stop calling today’s Republicans Scrooges. We’d be in much better shape if Trump and company were merely heartless misers. What they really are is much, much worse.

Texto completo: The ongoing growth of the natural gas industry in Pennsylvania and nationally has helped to reduce carbon emissions by more than 10% since 2007, even though carbon output spiked by about 3.4% in 2018, according to the Rhodium Group, a private sector research firm that used data from the Energy Information Administration and several other sources.
Carbon dioxide is the most abundant greenhouse gas but it is less potent than methane - the natural gas that is being used to supplant coal for power production.
It takes far less methane than carbon dioxide escaping into the atmosphere to worsen atmospheric warming. But as the gas industry grows it is clear that state and federal regulators do not have a good handle on just how much methane leaks during gas extraction, processing and transportation.
The New York Times reported Monday that a new satellite, the first designed to detect from space methane emissions on the ground, had recorded a record methane release from a well blowout in eastern Ohio that was more than twice as large as the driller’s estimate. Dutch and American scientists analyzed data from the February 2018 blowout and said it had released more than 120 metric tons of methane an hour for the 20 days that it took to plug the well.
That blowout was atypical. But if the driller and regulators did not know how much methane such a major event produced, that raises the question of how much methane escapes undetected during routine operations.
To help answer it, the Wolf administration has proposed a rule to tighten the state’s methane regulation. It would end an exemption for methane monitoring and repairs on low-producing wells, and would require regular inspections of production facilities regardless of the results of previous inspections.
It makes little sense to press natural gas as a partial answer to carbon pollution if regulators cannot restrict methane, which is more damaging to the atmosphere. Several major producers have agreed to the proposed rule. The administration should implement it quickly.

Texto completo: Several veterans of past Republican campaigns, including the former head of New Hampshire's GOP, have created a committee aimed at defeating President Trump in 2020 and congressional Republicans who have supported him.
Dubbed the Lincoln Project, the group has Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine as one of its biggest potential targets. Collins already faces a Democratic challenger and growing scrutiny from all corners as the Senate prepares for an expected Trump impeachment trial.
“It is my great hope, as this impeachment process unfolds, that she will have the courage to do what is right, to stand up and put the country over party, to be a voice for the people over Donald Trump," said Jennifer Horn, a former head of New Hampshire's Republican Party and a cofounder of the Lincoln Project.
“If that doesn't happen," Horn said, “then, yes, unfortunately, Senator Collins becomes part of this," a Lincoln Project target.
The project is one of several small, but vocal, rebellions against Trump, who has taken over the national Republican Party apparatus and rarely experiences pushback from its members in Congress.
Collins, who has walked a tightrope through roiling partisan politics, has said little about how she intends to vote in the Senate's expected impeachment trial of Trump. Long known as an independent thinker, Collins infuriated members of her party when she helped kill the effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. But she faced criticism from Democrats when she voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court.
Collins, in a statement, offered few clues about how she might vote in an impeachment trial. “I intend to make my decision on whether or not to convict President Trump on the basis of the evidence presented at the trial," she said. “Threats from both the left and the right will have zero influence on that decision."
Trump has remained steadily popular among Republicans across the country, despite his overall low approval ratings and his impeachment last week by the House, all of which makes the Lincoln Project's effort an uphill battle.
When the House voted to impeach Trump for trying to pressure the president of Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden — a potential Trump challenger in 2020 — not a single Republican joined the Democratic majority. In some states, the GOP has maneuvered to keep Trump's primary challengers off the 2020 ballot altogether.
Nonetheless, the Lincoln Project, unveiled in a New York Times op-ed the day before the House impeached Trump, describes the president as a “bogus prophet," whose actions threaten the Constitution and American way of life.
“We do not undertake this task lightly, nor from ideological preference," said the op-ed authors and Lincoln Project cofounders, who include George T. Conway III, an attorney known as an outspoken Trump critic and husband of presidential adviser Kelleyanne Conway.
“Our many policy differences with national Democrats remain, but our shared fidelity to the Constitution dictates a common effort," they wrote.
They envision persuading enough disaffected conservatives, Republicans, and Republican-leaning independents in swing states and districts to vote against Trump and his supporters “even if that means Democratic control of the Senate and an expanded Democratic majority in the House."
Joshua Tardy, a Maine attorney who served as honorary chairman for Collins's last Senate campaign, dismissed the project's goals and chances of success. “There will be a lot of noise makers on both sides and this super PAC will just be another noise maker in a noisy election," Tardy said. (Such political action committees can raise funds from individuals, corporations, unions, and other groups without any limit on donation size or expenditure.)
Collins recently announced she will run for reelection. And while she hasn't said whether she will endorse Trump, the president this week indicated his support for her — via Twitter. When Senator Lindsey Graham encouraged voters to support Collins's reelection, Trump responded: “I agree 100%."
Horn, from the Lincoln Project, said her group raised over $500,000 in the two days after it was announced.
The group's day-to-day activities will be overseen by Horn, who twice ran for Congress from New Hampshire, and by Reed Galen, a longtime Republican strategist. Other members include two former strategists for the late Senator John McCain, Steve Schmidt and John Weaver.
Maine is considered a battleground state in 2020. That's partly because its electorate is divided and unpredictable: The state has a Republican senator, an independent senator, and two Democratic members of the House. The current Democratic governor followed a provocative Republican. Maine is also a key electoral state because it is one of just two (the other is Nebraska) that does not use the traditional winner-take-all method of allocating Electoral College votes. Trump won one of the state's four votes in 2016, the first time a Republican took any of Maine's votes in decades.
Tardy is not worried.
“At the end of the day, Donald Trump and Susan Collins enjoy enormous support by their Republican base," he said.
The Lincoln Project is also focusing on candidates in other states, including Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Colorado, and Arizona.
Former Massachusetts governor William F. Weld, who is challenging Trump for the presidential nomination, said he is focused on beating Trump, but not on targeting other Republicans.
He said, however, that he agreed with the project's mission of defeating Trump.
“I am delighted to see a little hardball on the side of the nice guys," Weld said.
He draws parallels to 1973, when, he said, he was an ambitious young lawyer for the House Judiciary Committee and was advised by others in the Republican Party to steer clear of the impeachment process because of Richard Nixon's popularity, despite the Watergate break-in.
Nixon ultimately resigned in 1974 before the House voted on impeachment, as evidence against him mounted and support from loyal congressional defenders dissolved. Weld believes those who stand by Trump in a Senate trial will suffer politically.
“If the Republicans in the Senate walk the plank silently for Mr. Trump, all of those who are up next year in the 2020 election will lose their seats," he said.
Mark Sanford, a former South Carolina governor and congressman who ended his long-shot campaign for the Republican nomination against Trump last month, had not heard of the Lincoln Project. But Sanford, a fiscal conservative, said he wished the founders well. “I think we need to have a conversation as Republicans as to what it means to be a Republican," Sanford said. “We have lost our way . . . based on a temporary political amnesia that will fade."

California businesses at the breaking point due to minimum wage hikes

Texto completo: California’s minimum wage rises to $13 an hour on Jan. 1, and a number of its localities now have wage rates above $15 an hour.
Labor groups promised that $15 would be an economic boon for the state, while then-Gov. Jerry Brown worried that “economically, the minimum wage may not make sense.” The state’s experience with rapidly rising wage rates show the former governor was right to be concerned.
Consider the impact on the state’s full-service restaurant industry, which faces a double-whammy when the wage floor rises. California is one of a handful of states that doesn’t count tips towards an employee’s income; even if a server earns $300 on a Friday night, an effective wage rate of $60 an hour, his employer can’t count one cent of it towards the minimum wage requirement.
Restaurant owners are forced to give a raise to top-earning employees who take home far more than the minimum, with few options to offset the cost.
Paul Fraga, who announced he’s closing Sacramento diner Original Perry’s after more than 50 years in business, explained the dynamic. “For every dollar that [minimum wage] goes up, it costs me around $40,000…I can’t raise menu prices fast enough to compensate [for] that.” He added: “If they could sign a waiver, 99 percent of my servers would be against a minimum wage increase…”
Fraga isn’t alone in feeling the pinch from a rising minimum wage. Another affordably-priced option in town, the beloved Greek restaurant Opa! Opa!, announced that after 14 years in business it would be shuttering its doors. The owner said that since he first opened, prices have increased over 50 percent as a result of burdensome mandates placed on him by the state. Now, fourteen employees are left jobless right before the holidays.
These aren’t just anecdotes. Census Bureau data suggests the state’s restaurant owners have reacted to scaled-up wage costs by scaling back on hiring. In Los Angeles County, for instance, year-over-year full-service employment growth topped seven percent as recently as 2012; it’s fallen every year since then, and dipped below one percent in 2018. In Orange County, growth last year was near-zero.
A similar trend is seen statewide, with sub-one percent growth replacing five percent growth from as recently as 2013. In San Francisco County, stagnant growth turned negative last year, with the city losing nearly 1,000 restaurant jobs. A study published by Harvard University Business School and Mathematica examined the impacts of wage increases in the San Francisco Bay Area. The results were startling. The research found that each one dollar increase to the minimum wage resulted in a 14 percent increase in the likelihood that a 3.5 star (the median rating) restaurant would be forced to close.
Another study, recently released by my organization, found that in states like California with a high minimum wage for tipped employees, full-service restaurants hired 18 percent fewer tipped workers as a share of the workforce. In practice, that means full-service restaurants embrace self-service alternatives where the customer provides much of the service themselves. (The New York Times chronicled a trend in San Francisco of fine-dining restaurants adopting elements of fast-food style service models.)
Will California legislators wise up? Don’t hold your breath.
The state’s Future of Work Commission, which was assembled by the governor to examine future workplace challenges for employers and employees, is stacked with some of the very parties responsible for those challenges. SEIU president Mary Kay Henry, who co-chairs the governor’s commission, has overseen more than $100 million in spending on the Fight for $15, a policy that has forced countless employers to replace human employees with automated alternatives. Another commission member, labor activist Saru Jayaraman, has encouraged other states to follow California’s failed payment model for tipped employees. She’s been opposed in that goal by thousand of tipped servers, who understand the consequences for their own bottom line should their states make California’s mistake.
Gov. Newsom boasts that California is setting an example for the rest of the country to follow. He’s right; the state is showing the rest of the country why a $15 minimum wage is a bad idea.

History will forget this impeachment

Texto completo: The New York Times, the Democrats, and some others would have you believe that this impeachment is making history. It isn't.
Even a huge, screaming headline in the biggest type possible cannot lend suspense or importance to an event that began three years ago and whose outcome was never in doubt. The war to impeach President Trump has been waged at full throttle since 2016. And so, an inflection point in late 2019 is not all that striking, especially since the next stage in the drama will be to return the whole thing to the status quo ante.
The impeachment proceedings against Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton had been genuine digressions from the traditional politics that had marked their first terms in office, and to which the country would later return. In contrast, our politics has been dialed up to 13 on a 1-to-10 scale since Trump was elected.
No, Jennifer Rubin, "Impeachment Day" will not soon rival Independence Day or Memorial Day in the nation’s affections. This will not be remembered like Saint Crispin's Day. The articles of impeachment will not be read aloud in the public squares of the nation, as children stand awestruck and grown people weep. As with the Clinton impeachment in the late 1990s, people who thought the president had done some good things understand that his moral sense is, in some sense, deficient. Now, as then, they have made their peace with it. Save for the partisans on both sides of the spectrum; they are not deeply invested now, just as they were not then.
People knew Clinton had committed a crime, but the crime in itself hadn’t involved his professional duties. Trump’s talk about people and things could be truly abhorrent, but it’s sticks and stones that break bones, not petulant nicknames, insults, and chatter that fail to rise to a criminal level. Nineteen years ago, people calmly accepted another partisan impeachment in the House. They have accepted this one, too, and they will accept the equally partisan acquittal in the Senate that is sure to follow. Both are predictable exercises in party-line voting, and everyone recognizes this except for the blindest partisans who are caught up in the moment.
The New York Times, the Democrats, and Jennifer Rubin want you to think this is Agincourt, and impeachment is history being made before our eyes. But Democratic Reps. Adam Schiff of California and Jerry Nadler of New York are not the Plantagenets; they are not an outnumbered army (except in the Senate), and they are not facing the fight of their lives for themselves and their country. Rather, they are partisan functionaries involved in a predictable effort to fulfill the demands of Democratic primary voters and small-dollar online donors.
What's more, as they did the work of holding hearings and entertaining journalists, the public's opinion of their impeachment actually declined in the polls. "History’s going to forget this," Peggy Noonan said on Meet the Press Sunday. She’s right.

Texto completo: In early November, a study published in the journal Science claimed to trace the whole social course of modernity — the decline of clan and tribe, the turn to nuclear families, the rise of individualism — back to Roman Catholicism’s opposition to incest.
The medieval church’s sweeping ban on cousin-marriage, the researchers argued, broke up traditional kinship networks and gave rise to new family patterns and eventually a new psychology — a less conformist, more individualist, very clearly modern mindset that according to their research is much more common in regions that had sustained exposure to Catholicism before 1500.
“Practical men who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influence,” runs a famous line from John Maynard Keynes, “are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.” This goes for practical modern people and deceased theologians as well: You may think you don’t want to marry your cousin for sound reasons of genetic hygiene, but in fact you’re just following injunctions laid down by French ecclesiastics in the sixth century after Christ.
The Science study naturally provoked a certain discomfort among people disinclined to credit Western Christendom for anything save stained glass and inquisitions. The more interesting question, though, is what actual believing Christians should make of it, and of the larger genre to which it belongs: Historical accounts that emphasize our religion’s essential role in the making of the modern world, even as that same modernity has obviously been a time of dissolution for many people’s faith.
This is a good Christmas season question, for the time of year when the threads still binding us to the old-time religion shine red and green and silver, and it’s sharpened by an example of the genre that would make a good last-minute Christmas gift: The British historian Tom Holland’s new book “Dominion: How the Christian Revolution Remade the World ,” a galloping tour of Christianity’s influence across the last 2,000 years, with vivid vignettes scattered across the centuries, and a concluding argument that the Christian faith, “the most influential framework for making sense of human existence that has ever existed,” still shapes the way that even the most secular modern people think about the world.
Assume for the sake of argument that Holland’s account is largely true. Does that get actual Christian belief anywhere in contemporary debates? Is anyone persuaded to take up a faith, or consider it anew, because ideas they value are historically and intellectually dependent on its premises?
I think there are historical moments when this can happen: The little renaissance in Christian thought in the aftermath of World War II, for instance, clearly owed something to a desire to get back to the West’s religious roots, after Auschwitz and Hiroshima made a certain kind of secular optimism seem foolish.
But it took a uniquely horrifying moment to produce that impulse — like a person turning to a priest in the aftermath of a literal demonic visitation. In our own era Christians still fear the possibility of a post-Christian totalitarianism, but nonbelievers fear elements of conservative Christianity rather more, and often share the hope expressed in my New Haven, Connecticut, neighbor Samuel Moyn’s review of Holland — that a secular, social-justice left can preserve the best of the Christian ethical inheritance while leaving the metaphysics and a considerable part of the morality behind.
In the long run I am not sure this hope is warranted: Human movements have a drive toward coherence in their world-pictures, and one reason secular utopianism unmoored from Christianity has become radical and murderous so often is that a coherent atheist materialism will tend to exclude as mere sentiment the ideas about inherent human dignity and the “thou shalt nots” that the Christian revolution introduced.
But societies can also live with ideological inconsistency for quite some time before that drive manifests itself — and in the between-time, I don’t expect many secular readers to leap into religious faith because a newspaper columnist complains about their system’s incoherence.
Which is no doubt why the scriptures that inspire this holiday season contain more simple miracles than they do clever arguments about consistent world-pictures. Indeed if I am honest, the key difference between a regretful doubter like Holland, convinced of Christianity’s moral power but unable in his book’s conclusion to quite make the leap of faith, and a fumbling believer like myself, may be as simple as this: I grew up around mystical and supernatural-seeming happenings, which primed me to permanently doubt the reasonableness of materialism in all its forms, both confident and sorrowful.
So as much I enjoy arguing about modernity’s debt to Christianity, what most often sustains faith in a secular age are the surprising answers given to different people every day, with God only knows what patterns and purposes, to W.H. Auden’s Advent prayer:
Nothing can save us that is possible: We who must die demand a miracle.
There’s no harm in asking for yourself, this week. Merry Christmas.

Texto completo: Sin sorpresa para muchos, Nueva York ha sido calificada de lejos como la ciudad con la gente menos amable en todo el país , según una nuevo sondeo realizado por Business Insider.
34.3% de los encuestados dijeron que los neoyorquinos eran los más rudos del país, casi el doble que el segundo clasificado, Los Ángeles (19.7%).
Los resultados se basaron en dos encuestas en línea realizadas en octubre y noviembre de 2019. A más de 2 mil adultos estadounidenses se les pidió elegir las cinco ciudades menos amables de una lista de las 50 áreas metropolitanas más grandes de la nación.
La noticia no es una sorpresa para muchos. En 2011 el historiador de la ciudad de Manhattan, Michael Miscione, dijo a The New York Times que los neoyorquinos han sido considerados groseros desde finales del siglo XVIII.
“No he visto a un verdadero caballero, un hombre bien educado, desde que vine a la ciudad”, dijo el ex presidente John Adams sobre NYC en 1774: “En sus entretenimientos no hay conversación que sea agradable; no hay modestia, no hay atención el uno al otro. Hablan muy alto, muy rápido y en conjunto . Si le hacen una pregunta, antes de que pueda pronunciar tres palabras de su respuesta, se lanzarán sobre usted nuevamente y hablarán”.
Nueva York es además la ciudad más cara del país y la que recibe más turistas.
Detrás de NYC y Los Ángeles, las siguientes ciudades más rudas fueron Washington D.C. (18.9%), Chicago (18.6%) y Boston (14.9%).

Texto completo: A 6-year-old found the note in London while writing Christmas cards to her classmates. "Forced to work against our will," the message read.
A 6-year-old girl in London preparing Christmas cards for her classmates found a message said to be from prisoners forced into labor in China, prompting the Tesco grocery chain to suspend ties with a supplier.
Florence Widdicombe was going through cards her mother purchased about a week ago at a Tesco supermarket when she saw one card had writing in it, her father, Ben Widdicombe, told the BBC.
"We are foreign prisoners in Shanghai Qingpu Prison China," the handwritten note read. "Forced to work against our will. Please help us and notify human rights organization."
The New York Times could not independently authenticate the note, which also suggested that the recipient contact Peter Humphrey, a British journalist who was a prisoner at Qingpu from 2013 to 2015. Mr. Humphrey, who was jailed on corruption charges he says were bogus while working as a fraud investigator, first wrote about the note in The Sunday Times.
Tesco said in a statement that it would stop selling the cards while it investigates. The supplier was independently audited in November and "no evidence was found to suggest they had broken our rule banning the use of prison labor," the company said.
"We abhor the use of prison labor and would never allow it in our supply chain," the company said. "We were shocked by these allegations and immediately suspended the factory where these cards are produced and launched an investigation."
But the supplier, Zhejiang Yunguang Printing, said that it had not heard from Tesco and that it became aware of the accusations only after being contacted by foreign news outlets, according to state-run media.
"We have never done such a thing," Zhejiang Yunguang Printing told The Global Times, a nationalist Chinese tabloid owned by the Communist Party.
China has a poor human rights record -- it has come under criticism for, among other things, its treatment of the Muslim minority in Xinjiang, surveillance of its own citizens and detentions of journalists -- but the printing company insisted that it had "never had any connection with any prison" and suggested that the story was manufactured for political reasons.
Geng Shuang, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, mocked Mr. Humphrey and dismissed allegations that prisoners were subjected to forced labor when asked about the reports at a regularly scheduled news conference.
"His latest plot sounds all too familiar," Mr. Geng said in remarks posted on the Foreign Ministry's website. "My advice to him: If you want to grab more eyeballs, at least come up with some new tricks."
"I can tell you that after verifying with relevant departments, we know for sure that there is no forced labor of foreign prisoners in Qingpu Prison in Shanghai," Mr. Geng added.
Tesco is among the international companies that have publicly vowed to stamp out prison labor. Britain requires large companies to describe the actions they have taken each year to keep modern slavery out of their supply chains.
Former inmates have described brutal abuse in China's labor camps, including beatings, sleep deprivation and untreated illnesses. Finding a note hidden inside packaging tends to attract worldwide attention, though the claims are difficult to verify and are often suspected of being activist hoaxes.
Still, there have been times when former inmates confirmed they had surreptitiously sneaked out notes. In 2013, a former inmate at the Masanjia labor camp said he wrote 20 letters that he hid in packaging that seemed headed toward the West. One of them was found by a mother of two in Oregon inside a package of Halloween decorations.
Mr. Humphrey, the journalist and former inmate, told the BBC he believed the note was "written as a collective message" from the prisoners. He said he believed he knew who wrote the note but would not reveal the person's identity.
He said there were about 250 foreigners kept in Qingpu "living a very bleak daily life." The cells held 12 prisoners apiece, with rusty iron bunk beds and mattresses about a centimeter thick, he said.
When he was there, manual labor work was voluntary, with inmates earning pennies they could spend on soap, toothpaste and cookies, he said.
"What has happened in the last year or so is work has become compulsory," he said.
Mr. Widdicombe said he felt he had a responsibility to pass along the note to Mr. Humphrey.
"The first thought was it must be some sort of prank, but on reflection we realized it was actually potentially quite a serious thing," Mr. Widdicombe told the BBC.

Texto completo: My favorite podcasts of 2019 were those that seemed at first about one thing — Dolly Parton, the reality TV show “Cops,” the mysterious death of New York City punk rocker nearly four decades ago — and carried you away on tangents you never saw coming.
Which, mind you, is not to say I lost all of my ardor for the tried-and-true-crime podcasts, such as “In The Dark,” my favorite of 2018, which just this week resulted in the release on bail of Curtis Flowers, a Mississippi man tried six times who six times had his convictions overturned. There remain plenty of those, though I’ve perhaps become more discerning in my criminal tastes.
The list below presents the dozen podcasts that still resonate for me as the year comes to an end. They’re not in any particular order, so the numbers aren’t rankings, but the first two here are my favorites of the year.
1. Headlong: Running From Cops : Dan Taberski returned this year with his third great podcast in a row – “Surviving Y2K” and “Finding Richard Simmons” preceded this one – and this might be his best. A deep dive into the history of the reality TV series “Cops,” this podcast explores everything from the impact of the show on real-world policing to the way the series may interfere with the rights of the arrested in ways you’d never considered. Entertaining, and it makes you think.
2. The Ballad of Billy Balls : This podcast opens like a typical true-crimer – who killed punk rocker and small-time drug dealer Billy Balls in his East Village apartment in 1982 – but under the empathetic storytelling of host iO Tillett Wright it becomes something much more that incorporates love and grief, family and memory. Billy’s girlfriend Rebecca is an amazing presence throughout the podcast, which reveals one secret after another as Wright seeks the truth of the story.
3. 1619 : This podcast from the New York Times came on the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first slaves in America. No dry history lesson, the anthology-style five-episode podcast looks at ways in which the impact of slavery has rippled across four centuries of our history tot he present day. Topics range from the economy to land ownership to health care. If you’d like to get a sense of it, dip your ears into the episode by the Times’ Wesley Morris who explores the ways in which black American music seeded every genre we listen to today — including yacht rock.
4. Dolly Parton’s America : Host Jad Abumrad grew up in Tennessee where Dolly Parton is everywhere, and, like many, he took her a little bit for granted. Then Abumrad noticed how in these divided times everyone from MAGA hat-wearers to drag queens loves Dolly, and he started to investigate. He got hours of interview time with Dolly, which is wonderful, but it’s the side trips into the stories of those who know her – in person, by her music, her career – that make this story a wonderful narrative about a singular woman.
5. Crime Beat: Mom vs. Murderer : The second season of this true-crime podcast by reporter Keith Sharon, our (full-disclosure) Southern California News Group colleague, tells the story of the murder of Cathy Torrez in 1994 and the 21 years her mother Mary Bennett fought to see the main suspect — who lived across the street — convicted. It’s a story about a terrible crime, the frustrating injustices of the justice system and a mother’s determination that her child not be forgotten.
6. Lost Notes : This anthology series from KCRW-FM/89.9 and host Jessica Hooper explores the lives and work of musicians in ways unlike any other podcast, digging deep into history and meaning with strong standalone narratives. A punk rock musician with a regional hit when he was 17 questions the sexism of its lyrics as a 56-year-old father. The sisters of the now mostly forgotten all-female rock band Fanny share their story. A writer narrates an audio letter to the musician Cat Power about the impact of her work on the lives of him and others. There are more in 2019’s second season.
7. The Clearing : April Balascio had feared for years that her father Edward Wayne Edwards was a murderer, and in 2009, her tip led to his conviction in a decades-old case. In this podcast, she teams with host Josh Dean to explore the legacy of her father’s life and crimes. These included more murders to which he admitted, several more that he likely committed and a few he almost certainly did not. It’s a fascinating tale of a sociopath father and a daughter brave enough to seek the truth.
8. Against The Rules with Michael Lewis : Writer Lewis is responsible for some of the great nonfiction of the past few decades with books such as “Moneyball,” “The Blind Side,” and “The Big Short,” all of which were adapted for film. This debut podcast brings his unique and questioning mind to the topic of fairness. He explores everything from sports to financial markets, law to media, and what happens in a world where fewer people accept the judgments of referees. Smart, funny, thought-provoking — what else you want?
9. Over My Dead Body:Tally : There’s a nasty divorce between two lawyers, and one of them ends up gunned down in the garage at his Tallahassee, Florida home. Host and co-reporter Matthew Shaer takes listeners through the story, which moves from a fairy-tale romance that made the New York Times to the split and crime that followed. This first season of the podcast makes it easy for listeners to come to their own conclusions about who is responsible, but justice isn’t so easily served.
10. Nice Try! : Host Avery Trufelman explores the history of intended utopian communities — the Jamestown settlement, the master-planned modernist city of Chandigarh, India, the Oneida religious commune in New York, among others — and why so often they have failed to find the perfection for which they were intended. Through history, architecture, culture, and beliefs, Nice Try! presents a cool new way of understanding the worlds in which we live.
11. The Thing About Pam : From NBC and “Dateline,” this Keith Morrison-hosted podcast peels back the layers of lies and deceit that led to the wrongful conviction of a Missouri man for the murder of his wife, and the ultimate discovery of whodunnit. “Saturday Night Live” used to skewer Morrison’s intimate style of narration, but it’s a pleasure indeed to listen to him tell this story, which never lags or feels padded like too many “Dateline” episodes do.
12. It’s a Pixies Podcast : The Pixies, one of the great modern rock bands, agreed to something few bands would consider and invited author-turned-podcaster Tony Fletcher into the recording studio for the weeks they worked on their new album, “Beneath The Eyrie.” It’s a fascinating look at the creative process, the collaborative nature of making a record, and the push-and-pull of personalities all working toward the goal of making music together. A must for Pixies’ fans, but almost as essential for fans of any band for the insights it delivers.

He got hours of interview time with Dolly, which is wonderful, but it’s the side trips into the stories of those who know her – in person, by her music, her career – that make this story a wonderful narrative about a singular woman.
5. Crime Beat: Mom vs. Murderer : The second season of this true-crime podcast by reporter Keith Sharon, our (full-disclosure) Southern California News Group colleague, tells the story of the murder of Cathy Torrez in 1994 and the 21 years her mother Mary Bennett fought to see the main suspect — who lived across the street — convicted. It’s a story about a terrible crime, the frustrating injustices of the justice system and a mother’s determination that her child not be forgotten.
6. Lost Notes : This anthology series from KCRW-FM/89.9 and host Jessica Hooper explores the lives and work of musicians in ways unlike any other podcast, digging deep into history and meaning with strong standalone narratives. A punk rock musician with a regional hit when he was 17 questions the sexism of its lyrics as a 56-year-old father. The sisters of the now mostly forgotten all-female rock band Fanny share their story. A writer narrates an audio letter to the musician Cat Power about the impact of her work on the lives of him and others. There are more in 2019’s second season.
7. The Clearing : April Balascio had feared for years that her father Edward Wayne Edwards was a murderer, and in 2009, her tip led to his conviction in a decades-old case. In this podcast, she teams with host Josh Dean to explore the legacy of her father’s life and crimes. These included more murders to which he admitted, several more that he likely committed and a few he almost certainly did not. It’s a fascinating tale of a sociopath father and a daughter brave enough to seek the truth.
8. Against The Rules with Michael Lewis : Writer Lewis is responsible for some of the great nonfiction of the past few decades with books such as “Moneyball,” “The Blind Side,” and “The Big Short,” all of which were adapted for film. This debut podcast brings his unique and questioning mind to the topic of fairness. He explores everything from sports to financial markets, law to media, and what happens in a world where fewer people accept the judgments of referees. Smart, funny, thought-provoking — what else you want?
9. Over My Dead Body:Tally : There’s a nasty divorce between two lawyers, and one of them ends up gunned down in the garage at his Tallahassee, Florida home. Host and co-reporter Matthew Shaer takes listeners through the story, which moves from a fairy-tale romance that made the New York Times to the split and crime that followed. This first season of the podcast makes it easy for listeners to come to their own conclusions about who is responsible, but justice isn’t so easily served.
10. Nice Try! : Host Avery Trufelman explores the history of intended utopian communities — the Jamestown settlement, the master-planned modernist city of Chandigarh, India, the Oneida religious commune in New York, among others — and why so often they have failed to find the perfection for which they were intended. Through history, architecture, culture, and beliefs, Nice Try! presents a cool new way of understanding the worlds in which we live.
11. The Thing About Pam : From NBC and “Dateline,” this Keith Morrison-hosted podcast peels back the layers of lies and deceit that led to the wrongful conviction of a Missouri man for the murder of his wife, and the ultimate discovery of whodunnit. “Saturday Night Live” used to skewer Morrison’s intimate style of narration, but it’s a pleasure indeed to listen to him tell this story, which never lags or feels padded like too many “Dateline” episodes do.
12. It’s a Pixies Podcast : The Pixies, one of the great modern rock bands, agreed to something few bands would consider and invited author-turned-podcaster Tony Fletcher into the recording studio for the weeks they worked on their new album, “Beneath The Eyrie.” It’s a fascinating look at the creative process, the collaborative nature of making a record, and the push-and-pull of personalities all working toward the goal of making music together. A must for Pixies’ fans, but almost as essential for fans of any band for the insights it delivers.

Texto completo: The ongoing growth of the natural gas industry in Pennsylvania and nationally has helped to reduce carbon emissions by more than 10% since 2007, even though carbon output spiked by about 3.4% in 2018, according to the Rhodium Group, a private sector research firm that used data from the Energy Information Administration and several other sources.
Carbon dioxide is the most abundant greenhouse gas but it is less potent than methane - the natural gas that is being used to supplant coal for power production.
It takes far less methane than carbon dioxide escaping into the atmosphere to worsen atmospheric warming. But as the gas industry grows it is clear that state and federal regulators do not have a good handle on just how much methane leaks during gas extraction, processing and transportation.
Last Monday, The New York Times reported that a new satellite, the first designed to detect from space methane emissions on the ground, had recorded a record methane release from a well blowout in eastern Ohio that was more than twice as large as the driller’s estimate. Dutch and American scientists analyzed data from the February 2018 blowout and said it had released more than 120 metric tons of methane an hour for the 20 days that it took to plug the well.
That blowout was atypical. But if the driller and regulators did not know how much methane such a major event produced, that raises the question of how much methane escapes undetected during routine operations.
To help answer it, the Wolf administration has proposed a rule to tighten the state’s methane regulation. It would end an exemption for methane monitoring and repairs on low-producing wells, and would require regular inspections of production facilities regardless of the results of previous inspections.
It makes little sense to press natural gas as a partial answer to carbon pollution if regulators cannot restrict methane, which is more damaging to the atmosphere. Several major producers have agreed to the proposed rule. The administration should implement it quickly.

TWO MOON PARTIES BOTH PARTIES HAVE WEAKENED THEMSELVES

Texto completo: Here's a theory for why our politics are so confusing these days: Neither party wants to be a majority party.
From an ideological perspective, majority parties are, by nature, weird. For instance, the long-dominant FDR coalition included a strange mix of blacks and segregationists, corrupt city machines and the reformers who hated them.
Over the several decades that followed, most major policy questions were hashed out within the Democratic Party. The Republicans factored in mostly as stalemate-breakers. So, for instance, the great intra-Democratic Party fight between liberals and Southern segregationists was only settled when Republicans sided with the civil rights bloc. Eighty percent of Republicans voted in favor of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, while fewer than 70% of Democrats did.
Samuel Lubell, a Polish-born political analyst, famously described this dynamic as the "sun and moon" system of political parties. In our "political solar system," Lubell wrote in 1951, "it is within the majority party that the issues of any particular period are fought out; while the minority party shines in reflected radiance of the heat thus generated."
The Democratic sun started its long arc of descent in 1968. In 1972, Richard Nixon managed to pick off sizable support from the white working class for a massive landslide re-election victory. Ronald Reagan's victories and the subsequent GOP capture of the House in 1994 - after a 40-year Democratic reign - seemed to seal the deal.
But then, as New York Times columnist David Brooks noted in 2011, "something strange happened. No party took the lead." The outcome, he wrote, is "both parties have become minority parties simultaneously. We are living in the era of two moons and no sun."
Nearly a decade later, things are even more bizarre. We may be more partisan than ever, but the partisans tend to dislike their own parties - they just hate the other party more.
There are many reasons for this polarization, but one of them is that the most committed members of each party have a decidedly lunar mindset. Progressives and conservatives alike are convinced they are victims of the Powers That Be. Each side defines the Powers That Be differently, though there is some overlap when it comes to animosity toward economic "elites." Hillary Clinton was the candidate of the establishment, and even though she won the Democratic nomination, nearly all the passion in the party flows to some version of Bernie Sanders' or Elizabeth Warren's radical indictment of the system.
As political consultant Luke Thompson notes, minority parties tend to obsess about unity because without it they are even more powerless. This makes ideological purity a vital source of cohesion. Majority parties have both the luxury and the burden of power. To govern is to make policy choices, and choosing A over B will always disappoint the backers of B.
The problem is that the ideological purity dominating both sides is a kind of righteous victimhood. The result is a Democratic Party suffused with a sense that it should be a majority party but is being denied its rightful status, making denunciations of "white supremacy" and the "oligarchy" simultaneously more intense and comforting. Voter suppression is a legitimate issue, but it is not the unified field theory for Democratic failures some want it to be - nor can voter fraud be blamed for Republican failures.
Meanwhile, the GOP could be a majority party, but the perceived need to be a Trump party prevents it from even trying. Not only are Mr. Trump's politics fueled by culture war resentment and victimology, but his bottomless need for adulation is simply an inadequate rationale for a sun party to hold a majority together.
Both parties are weakened by decades of misguided reforms and the growth of a media industrial complex invested in telling its customers what they want to hear, making it impossible for either moon to achieve the escape velocity required to become a sun party.
As political scientists Steven Teles and Robert Saldin argue, the best way out is for new moderate political factions to organize and demand concessions for their support. But that will require a lot of work, made all the more difficult by the burden of toiling in moonlight.

Lessons from Watergate on what impeachment should be for

Texto completo: After working nights and weekends in an attempt to throw President Trump out of office before the voters can re-elect him, House Democrats declined to send their two articles of impeachment over to the Senate. Instead, they recessed for the holidays and left town.
It looks like everybody got something out of it. Nancy Pelosi got a growling rebuke of the president to satisfy her far-left squad and calm the terrified incumbents who live in fear of a primary challenge from a squad wannabe in their own districts. Adam Schiff got the cover of Los Angeles magazine. And President Trump received a most unlikely Christmas present, Republican unity. He’ll also unwrap fundraising totals for the fourth quarter that will be higher than Trump Tower.
The week featured a lot of thundering about history, and a lot of wailing over what some people think is the unprecedented polarization in our country.
It’s not unprecedented. Drop by the Richard Nixon Library in Yorba Linda and walk through exhibits that bring to life the bitter divisions during the Vietnam War. There you can see a real impeachment inquiry, in a National Archives curated gallery that chronicles the events known as Watergate.
On display is a photograph of a page in an address book. It was the first hint of what would come from the 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington.
The address book belonged to one of the Watergate burglars. On the page marked “H” was the phone number of E. Howard Hunt’s White House office. But why?
The answer would eventually lead to a House Judiciary Committee vote to recommend three articles of impeachment, and to Nixon’s resignation. It’s often said that the cover-up was worse than the crime. You should see what Nixon was covering up.
In May 1971, the White House planned a “dirty tricks” operation. With Nixon’s knowledge, aides hired Donald Segretti to recruit operatives to disrupt Democratic rallies, forge letters on Democratic campaign stationery, and infiltrate rival campaigns with spies. In December 1971, Nixon authorized a phony “write-in” campaign for Sen. Ted Kennedy in the New Hampshire primary, to try to pull votes away from then-frontrunner Sen. Ed Muskie.
These operations were already underway when a former Pentagon analyst named Daniel Ellsberg, who had come to oppose the Vietnam War, leaked a classified study of America’s involvement in Vietnam. The Pentagon Papers were published in the New York Times in June 1971.
Nixon believed he was facing a conspiracy by holdovers from the previous administration who were trying to sabotage his Vietnam policy. He ordered a top aide to have the Internal Revenue Service launch special audits of “political enemies” on a list. The IRS Commissioner and the Treasury Secretary refused to launch the audits, but the attempt was later cited by the House Judiciary Committee.
The House also noted Nixon’s July 1971 order for an investigation into civil servants at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, when he thought they were intentionally misrepresenting monthly unemployment figures and demanded to know how many Jews worked in the unit. That was in the articles of impeachment, too.
In August 1971, the White House asked the FBI to find dirt on CBS News correspondent Daniel Schorr, but the bureau mistakenly thought the president wanted to appoint Schorr to a federal job and conducted a background-check interview. When Schorr complained, the White House put him on the list for IRS harassment, and the House later put that in the second article of impeachment.
In September 1971, the White House “Plumbers” (plumbers stop leaks) broke into the office of Daniel Ellsberg’s former psychiatrist to try to find the confidential notes he had refused to give the FBI.
In early 1972, G. Gordon Liddy and E. Howard Hunt pitched a plan to Attorney General John Mitchell for a $1 million program of counterdemonstrations, bugging and break-ins at the headquarters of the eventual Democratic nominee for president, the convention hotel in Miami, and the DNC headquarters at the Watergate in Washington, D.C. Mitchell told the finance chair of the Nixon re-election campaign to give them $250,000.
The Watergate burglars were caught in June 1972. When the FBI began to trace the money found in the burglars’ hotel rooms, President Nixon ordered the CIA to mislead the FBI into thinking the Watergate break-in was a CIA operation. Hush money was paid to the burglars from the White House’s secret $350,000 political fund.
In November 1972, Nixon won re-election in a landslide, carrying 49 states and 60.7% of the popular vote. But slowly the cover-up was unraveling. Judge John J. Sirica was overseeing a grand jury investigation, the CIA decided to tell the FBI that the burglary wasn’t their operation, Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein reported doggedly on the story, and by early 1973, some of the conspirators were cooperating with prosecutors.
There were guilty pleas and convictions in the first trial, and the Senate voted unanimously to form a Select Committee on Watergate. Nixon passed up a chance to end the cover-up and decided that finding a million dollars in hush money for E. Howard Hunt was the better choice.
White House firings, resignations and denials followed. In May 1973, Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox was hired, and in October, Nixon ordered his firing. The attorney general and deputy attorney general resigned.
In March 1974, Judge Sirica handed over the grand jury materials to the House of Representatives, and in July the Judiciary Committee voted to recommend three articles of impeachment. In August, the public got the first look at transcripts of Oval Office tapes that Nixon had tried to keep secret. The nation learned that Nixon had ordered the CIA to obstruct the FBI’s investigation. Support for the president collapsed. He resigned on August 9, 1974.
A walk through the Watergate gallery at the Nixon Library shows the hazards of abusing the powers of the CIA, FBI and IRS to go after political enemies. But it’s not Trump who did that.
After a number of investigations, we have learned that during the Obama administration, the IRS targeted conservative groups and the FBI misled the FISA court to get authorization to wiretap a Trump adviser. The CIA’s actions are currently under investigation by special prosecutor John Durham.
One day, history will judge the House of Representatives’ vote to impeach President Trump. Maybe we’ll find out that the House’s aim was off by one president.

In November 1972, Nixon won re-election in a landslide, carrying 49 states and 60.7% of the popular vote. But slowly the cover-up was unraveling. Judge John J. Sirica was overseeing a grand jury investigation, the CIA decided to tell the FBI that the burglary wasn’t their operation, Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein reported doggedly on the story, and by early 1973, some of the conspirators were cooperating with prosecutors.
There were guilty pleas and convictions in the first trial, and the Senate voted unanimously to form a Select Committee on Watergate. Nixon passed up a chance to end the cover-up and decided that finding a million dollars in hush money for E. Howard Hunt was the better choice.
White House firings, resignations and denials followed. In May 1973, Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox was hired, and in October, Nixon ordered his firing. The attorney general and deputy attorney general resigned.
In March 1974, Judge Sirica handed over the grand jury materials to the House of Representatives, and in July the Judiciary Committee voted to recommend three articles of impeachment. In August, the public got the first look at transcripts of Oval Office tapes that Nixon had tried to keep secret. The nation learned that Nixon had ordered the CIA to obstruct the FBI’s investigation. Support for the president collapsed. He resigned on August 9, 1974.
A walk through the Watergate gallery at the Nixon Library shows the hazards of abusing the powers of the CIA, FBI and IRS to go after political enemies. But it’s not Trump who did that.
After a number of investigations, we have learned that during the Obama administration, the IRS targeted conservative groups and the FBI misled the FISA court to get authorization to wiretap a Trump adviser. The CIA’s actions are currently under investigation by special prosecutor John Durham.
One day, history will judge the House of Representatives’ vote to impeach President Trump. Maybe we’ll find out that the House’s aim was off by one president.

Texto completo: Vianden, Luxembourg
A rock quarried in Virginia now sits on a plateau in Luxembourg. It's part of a new arch-like monument to the U.S. 80th Infantry Division and its role in the Battle of the Bulge.
The monument also includes stones from Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The 80th Division, in its original configuration, drew men from these three states for service in France during the First World War.
The 80th Division - the "Blue Ridge" - was back at it in Europe during the Second World War and abruptly found itself in Luxembourg as part of the U.S. Third Army's efforts to break the sudden, last, great German offensive on the western front.
It was a bad, cold, horrible, wretched business.
"The Battle of the Bulge was the largest battle ever fought by the United States Army," says the National WWII Museum in New Orleans. More than "83,000 Americans were casualties during the battle which lasted from Dec. 16, 1944 until Jan. 25, 1945, and as a result, the battle occupies a prominent place in our collective minds."
Probably more prominently in some minds than others, judging from the sentiments expressed in the small village of Nocher on Tuesday, site of the new monument's dedication.
The people of Luxembourg have obviously not forgotten a thing. A hard memory - virtually every village in this region was destroyed by the fighting - has been passed forward through the generations and it often gets expressed in our direction as undiluted appreciation.
By one count, there were 15 American veterans on hand for the 75th anniversary ceremony held on Monday at Luxembourg American Cemetery and Memorial. Think about it. That's remarkable. These are all men well into their nineties and they resolved to be here.
Luxembourg wanted them to be here, too.
"The veterans know how very, very grateful we are," said Benoit Lutgen, mayor of Bastogne. "This gratitude is now anchored in a common history, woven by friendship, by meetings with families and by cultural and economic exchanges."
"Far from fading away," the mayor said, "the link has developed over the generations to become a fruitful partnership."
That's no exaggeration. It takes some shared effort and some especially dedicated souls to make something like the Nocher monument happen.
Bill Black of Papillion, Nebraska, got on this project in 2012. He wanted the monument installed on behalf of the 80th Division Veterans Association he leads.
He also wanted it for his dad, William Black, a 34-year-old staff sergeant in 1944, serving in the 319th Infantry Regiment. Sgt. Black, a squad leader, had his elbow shattered by artillery shrapnel on Jan. 23, 1945, in the immediate area of the monument's location.
Initially, there was no one to help the sergeant. Dripping blood across the snow for a mile, Black found a medic, got help and got home. He lived to 92, making his living as a house painter with his one good arm.
A local organization, the Cercle d'Études sur la Bataille des Ardennes (CIBA), commissioned a Luxembourg artist to design and build the monument. Local student historians prepared text for a "reader board."
You find these reader boards scattered about Luxembourg. That's a relatively new development and it makes a difference. "It's important that people understand what took place here," Bill Black Jr. told me.
Yes, it is.
The arch of the monument symbolizes a meeting of the Blue Ridge Mountains with the Ardennes forests. There are some similarities, though the terrain here is more severe. Standing there, looking over toward Germany, you can well appreciate the difficulties of the fighting.
When the locals, during the dedication, began singing "The Star-Spangled Banner," it got a little difficult in another way. Reining in your emotions becomes a challenge. You feel proud of your country.
Of course, as I wrote this on Wednesday evening, the president of the United States was being impeached.
"Mr. Trump, in his divisiveness, is the manifestation of a nation fracturing into warring camps and trying to define what America is about all over again," wrote veteran New York Times reporter Peter Baker.
I know Peter. Smart guy. He covered Virginia politics for The Washington Post 30 years ago.
And how many times did this subject - our president, his fate, all of it - emerge over the past week in Luxembourg? Not once.
Over here, they know exactly what America is - and they have not lost faith in us. If it's time to start defining America again, start here.

Is Anyone Happy Anymore?

Texto completo: We've lost our ability to take comfort in small things.
Recently I have been forced to think a bit about happiness. It's not something I've done before. I have been too busy living. But when an interview with me appeared in The Sunday Times under the headline "Why 'This Is Happiness' Author Niall Williams Is Happily Out of Step," I began to realize that it was not just me but the idea of happiness itself that was out of step with the times, and that it required some mental adjusting, not to say daring, to say aloud the title of my novel.
"How can you be happy now?" the book seems to ask, and it has a point. The catastrophe of climate neglect, the toxic politics, the tangible sense of so many things worsening in your own lifetime, along with a sense of your obscure or outright complicity, all combined to make the idea of any possible happiness seem at best childish, at worse willfully blind. "This Is Unhappiness" seemed a truer epitaph for the times, a sentiment echoed by the recent No. 1 movie in the world, "Joker," which includes the line, "I haven't been happy one minute of my life," with an expletive thrown in for good measure.
Now, some element of being happily out-of-step may come from the fact that for nearly 35 years, my wife, Christine, and I have been living, writing and trying to grow a garden on the outermost edge of Europe, in Kiltumper, on the west coast of Ireland. I don't mean to suggest that from this green vantage we are impervious to what is going on; we are not. In general, thanks largely to a superb national broadcaster, I find that Irish people are very well-informed.
So, being out-of-step is not from ignorance, nor is Kiltumper an idyll. Then again, no one who has reached their 60s can avoid the gathering evidence of their own mortality. And for the past four years we have been in and out of the cool, spirit-crushing corridors of an oncology ward, since Christine was first diagnosed with stage-three bowel cancer.
So, happiness? Really?
A first defense might come from the wonderful Wendell Berry, who in "Think Little," a canonical essay from nearly 50 years ago, wrote, "A person who is growing a garden, if he is growing it organically, is improving a piece of the world." So, in sometimes coming close to despairing of the earth with a capital E, we have focused on the portion with a small e that we are charged with minding, the piece, literally, within our bounds.
All gardens are asking for attention all the time, and the return for that attention is to gift you an essential now, the present moment, where you are face to face with the nature of things. Lest that sound too grand, or abstract, what I mean is the very opposite. There is nothing abstract about the heavy clay growing heavier in the blown rain of Kiltumper, and nothing too grand in "Niall, we need to de-caterpillar the kale now."
But there is a kind of happiness.
I can appreciate that at the beginning of a country -- and one as vast and empty as America was -- the idea of pursuit, both chase and hunt, of happiness had an invigorating appeal to the founding fathers. (I'm not sure the founding mothers would have phrased it the same way.) But the truth is that the longer I have lived, and the shorter my future, the less pursuing I have done. Some of this may come from a peculiarly Irish positive pessimism -- be happy, things will get worse -- more of it from the history of disappointment all artists know and the rest from a remnant Catholic guilt that says you don't deserve happiness anyway. The point is, in my case, happiness seemed a thing that could not be pursued, only realized and chosen.
I found some echo of this in Stephanie Burt's recent essay in The New Yorker about Seamus Heaney, where she writes of his becoming the happiest poet of his generation. Having been a poet of earth and water in his early career, later he "became a poet of air: one who wanted to share with his readers" the feeling of "lightness, the ability to stay pleased." And from the poem "The Gravel Walks," she quotes the line that has been inscribed on his headstone: "Walk on air against your better judgment."
I love the daring and defiance in that, the wonder and the gravity balanced. It is not coincidence that it comes from a collection called "The Spirit Level." With a clear eye, your better judgment sees the world as it is today, and yet chooses to be, as I am literally these days, lightheaded.
The final defense of happiness comes from Michael Dooley.
When I came to write the new novel, I remembered a moment from our early days in Clare. We had left commuter Monday-to-Friday lives in New York to come to a rural farming community, seeking a simpler life that was truer to our natures, not yet knowing what exactly that was. Christine's grandfather had grown up in Kiltumper and left it 70 years earlier to go to New York, so there was a root buried there. In those first heady days, we were welcomed in particular by the older people, and by trial and error were taught the lessons of how to live here.
One of those first welcomers was Michael Dooley, a silver-haired farmer, turf cutter, man of the land of the old kind, who into his 80s, pedaled his big bicycle into the village.
Because Michael seemed to be working on the land all day every day, into the fall of darkness and beyond, and never complained, I once asked him if he ever took a holiday.
"A holiday?" He looked at me like the innocent I was.
"I mean, what do you do to be happy?"
The question was a novelty to him and he considered it from all sides before answering.
"When I want a holiday," he said at last, "I go over the road as far as the meadow. I go in there, take off my jacket, and lay down on it. I watch the world turning for a bit, with me still in it."
He smiled then, and held me in his blue Atlantic eyes, full of the ordinary wisdom of a well-lived life, a wisdom that saw the many failings of the world but our still breathing and dreaming in it, and with a conclusive nod that defeated all arguments said, "That's happiness."
Niall Williams is the author, most recently, of the novel "This Is Happiness."

Colleges Enter Agreement to Allow More Competition for Applicants

Texto completo: An agreement between college counselors and the Justice Department should free up colleges to woo early-decision applicants with financial aid.
WASHINGTON -- The financial aid stranglehold on students who commit to colleges may be broken.
In a proposed agreement announced this month to answer Justice Department antitrust accusations, the National Association for College Admission Counseling said it would allow its member college and university counselors to recruit students even after they have committed to another school and would permit members to encourage students to transfer after they have already enrolled.
Colleges and universities have been heavily criticized for encouraging potential students to enter into agreements, particularly for early admissions, with the understanding that an accepted applicant could not then turn to another school. That understanding, which was not legally binding but was widely followed, prevented universities from competing for applicants by offering more enticing financial aid packages.
Now, colleges will be free to offer perks, like special scholarships or priority in course selection, to early-decision applicants, students who are less likely to need tuition assistance and use the process to secure a spot at their first-choice schools. For many selective colleges, more than half of an incoming freshman class will have been accepted through early admission.
Institutions will also be able to continue recruiting students beyond a widely applied May 1 deadline that is typically imposed for students who have applied through a regular decision process and are considering offers based, at least in part, on financial aid packages.
The changes stand to shake up the admissions process in the next year, affecting some colleges' ability to predict the size of their freshman classes while allowing some students to benefit from competitive financial aid packages, or even bargain for assistance right up until they walk onto a campus.
The agreement brings to a close a two-year investigation into the association's code of ethics by the Justice Department's antitrust division, which enforces laws governing fair consumer and competitive market practices. In a complaint, the Justice Department maintained that the organization's recruitment standards violated antitrust laws because they "substantially reduced competition among colleges for college applicants and potential transfer students and deprived these consumers of the benefits."
The department began investigating shortly after the National Association for College Admission Counseling adopted new recruitment rules in 2017, which sought to protect students and families from undue pressure and aggressive tactics that could be construed as coercive. The rules were part of a broad set of voluntary professional standards that the 82-year organization writes for its members, more than 15,000 high school and college admissions counselors.
The Justice Department took issue with three provisions: Schools should not offer incentives, like prime housing, to persuade students to apply early decision; colleges should not knowingly recruit or offer enrollment incentives to students who are already enrolled, registered or have submitted their deposits to other institutions; and members must not initiate contact with students to lure them into transferring.
In September, the organization preemptively voted to strike the provisions from its ethics code to avoid a costly legal fight with the Justice Department, saying such litigation would have "dire consequences on the association's finances and ability to operate in the future."
The association "continues to believe that the now deleted provisions provided substantial aid and protection to students in their process of choosing and moving from high school to college," the organization said in a statement. "However, the association understands its obligations under the decree and intends to strictly implement and abide by its provisions."
In a statement, Makan Delrahim, the assistant attorney general who leads the antitrust division, called the settlement "a victory for all college applicants and students across the United States who will benefit from vigorous competition among colleges for their enrollment."
"While trade associations and standards-setting organizations can and often do promote rules and standards that benefit the market as a whole, they cannot do so at the cost of competition," he said.
In the early 1990s, the antitrust division investigated the eight colleges and universities in the Ivy League, which used "overlap meetings" to share information and collaborate on financial aid offers.
Last year, the Justice Department began investigating whether colleges and universities were violating antitrust laws by exchanging information about prospective students who make early decision commitments.
Higher education experts anticipate that the changes will be mostly felt by smaller or less- selective institutions, many of which are already forecasting enrollment losses because of a looming "demographic cliff" from falling birthrates and diminishing interest from foreign students. Institutions may also have a harder time predicting their fall enrollment, and that uncertainty could affect their ability to pull from waiting lists or project how many students they lose over the summer.
Jon Boeckenstedt, the vice provost of enrollment management at Oregon State University, anticipated that the changes would prompt colleges and universities to lower costs for some prospective students.
"If there is anything good that comes out of this, it might be that colleges looking to fill their last slots might go and find some low-income students who are extremely price sensitive and would be thrilled to take a slot for a discounted price," he said.
Brian C. Rosenberg, the president of Macalester College, in St. Paul, Minn., said he did not believe there would be enough slots for those students. Affluent students will still disproportionately apply for early decision, Mr. Rosenberg said, and with the increased competition, colleges will rush to recruit tuition-paying students to secure their revenue early.
"It results in more benefit to the people who already benefit," Mr. Rosenberg said. "The problem that it creates, and the problem that's most endemic in our higher education system, is the students that stand to be most harmed are the ones already disadvantaged."

Texto completo: Minnesota U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar "struck a forceful tone" at Thursday's Democratic primary debate, tangling with rival Pete Buttigieg as she sought to once again make the case that a Midwestern moderate will have the best shot at defeating President Donald Trump next November.
The stakes for Klobuchar, trailing the top tier in fifth place in the polls with just six weeks to go until the Iowa caucuses, were higher than ever.
So how'd she do? The Star Tribune's Patrick Condon reports that the debate in Los Angeles marked "her most confident debate performance to date." It also garnered some of her best reviews so far.
Here's what political journalists and pundits are saying about the Minnesota Democrat's time on the stage:
Rankings published by several major outlets, including USA Today, put Klobuchar in the "winners" column.
"Klobuchar strategically acted as a peacekeeper a few times Thursday, touting her Midwestern roots by stopping a few word-battles between other candidates on stage with a, 'come on, you guys.' She then seamlessly dovetailed into her own stance on the issue."
CNN's Chris Cillizza called it an "excellent debate performance when Klobuchar really needed one."
"The Minnesota senator benefited the most from the smaller number of candidates on stage. She got to talk a LOT more than in past debates and used that time very, very well," Cillizza wrote. "Time and time again in answer after answer, Klobuchar drove home her basic message: I'm from the Midwest. I'm a woman. I get things done."
At Fox News, analyst Mary Anne Marsh wrote that Klobuchar "delivered another solid performance with her signature lines, sharp points, and humor … that will help her with some voters."
"While Klobuchar has been making slow, steady point by point progress in the polls but with just 45 days to go until the Iowa Caucuses it's not enough to get her in the top tier. But, she was a substantial presence in the debate on Thursday night," Marsh wrote.
Klobuchar also scored 7.1 out of 10 -- tying Sen. Bernie Sanders for the highest score of any candidate -- in a ranking by New York Times Opinion writers, though the individual reviews were mixed:
"Virtually flawless debate. She attacked effectively and came off as confident, experienced and presidential -- and, yes, likable, something we're told isn't possible for female candidates but that she proved actually is." -- Liz Mair
"She's getting better, but still sounds too much like a senator and not a president. She doesn't need to mention all that legislation. Stay big." -- David Leonhardt
"Effectively presented herself as a unifier who can win elections, jousting with good cheer and optimism." -- Nicholas Kristof
"She relied on platitudes and has yet to appear presidential in the slightest." -- Bianca Vivion Brooks
Politico called the performance her "best yet," concluding it "appeared that Amy Klobuchar might have a chance."
"For months, the Minnesota senator has languished in public opinion polls outside of the top tier -- an ineffectual moderate alternative to Joe Biden. But in one night, she was commanding a second look, and marking a late, sharp-elbowed turn in her campaign."

Kamala Harris: Will McConnell Let the Senate Hold a Fair Impeachment Trial?

Texto completo: By Kamala D. Harris
U.S. Senator (D-CA)
United States Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA)
Sometime early in the new year I will take an oath on the Senate floor to uphold the Constitution, review evidence and follow the facts wherever they lead, regardless of party or ideology. Every one of my colleagues will be required to do the same.
As a former prosecutor, I understand the importance of holding powerful people accountable. I know that every trial requires fairness and truth. Having worked my whole life serving the people, I know that any trial that abandons the pursuit of truth cannot be considered fair or just.
But the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, appears more interested in covering up the president’s misconduct than in pursuing truth and fairness. He is already trying to limit the impeachment trial by preventing witnesses from testifying, and he has all but announced a verdict. In doing so, he showed the American people that he has no intention of honoring his oath.
Let’s be clear: Mr. McConnell doesn’t want a Senate trial. He wants a Senate cover-up.
Fortunately, Mr. McConnell does not have the power to unilaterally undermine this trial. Every single senator will be empowered with an equal vote on how the trial will proceed. Though in just the past year, Mr. McConnell has used his position to unilaterally block legislation to restore the Voting Rights Act, lower the prices of prescription drugs and address the gun violence epidemic, he cannot wield the same authority in a Senate impeachment trial.
In this trial, senators will be far more than jurors.
Every one of us will vote to determine the rules for the trial, decide which witnesses testify and ultimately serve as both court and jury. Each of us will be called on to uphold our oath with every decision we make. We will all be held accountable by the American people if we refuse to discover the facts relevant to the articles of impeachment.
The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, has made a reasonable request to hear from four additional witnesses with firsthand knowledge of the president’s misconduct and to review documents that shed light on why the administration initially decided to cut off military aid to Ukraine.
We need to hear from Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, who admitted to Mr. Trump’s bribery scheme on live television, and from the former national security adviser, John Bolton, who has been shopping stories about Mr. Trump to book publishers instead of speaking with Congress.
Every senator should want to hear from anyone who can speak directly to the president’s misconduct related to the articles of impeachment.
Even Richard Nixon allowed the key figures behind the Watergate scandal to speak to Congress, and he eventually turned over incriminating portions of his Oval Office recordings to investigators. But Mr. Trump has stonewalled Congress and inhibited our ability to seek justice by demanding that those closest to the center of the Ukraine scandal stay silent.
Senators must be allowed to subpoena relevant witnesses and submit questions to them directly. The Senate should not vote on any article of impeachment or consider a motion to dismiss the trial until we have reviewed the additional testimony and evidence that Mr. Schumer has requested.
I have never been in a courtroom where the accused can unilaterally block witnesses from testifying or prohibit prosecutors from asking witnesses questions. No court would allow a trial to proceed this way, and neither should any member of the Senate.
Ensuring the integrity of this trial is a solemn responsibility for every senator, with consequences that extend far beyond any one presidency. My colleagues and I have a duty to use our voice and our vote to insist on a fair trial, rooted in the pursuit of truth. We must demonstrate to the American people that in our system of justice all are equal under law, and that there are not two sets of rules, one for Donald Trump and another for everybody else. We must conduct the Senate impeachment trial in a way that is fair and that reflects impartial justice.
History will judge the actions taken by the United States Senate at a time when our Constitution and the rule of law were at stake. I’ll be fighting for justice and accountability, and my colleagues should too.
Kamala D. Harris is a Democratic senator from California.

‘It’s just not fair’: Billionaire wine cave owner hits back

Texto completo: The billionaire owner of a wine cave that recently hosted a fundraiser for Pete Buttigieg was upset with the attacks that came at his industry after Elizabeth Warren called it out.
During Thursday night’s PBS/Politico debate, Warren, 70, attacked Buttigieg, 37, for having a closed-door fundraiser, saying, “Billionaires in wine caves should not pick the next president of the United States.”
This exchange triggered a flurry of “wine cave” jabs between the Democratic candidates for the remainder of the evening. Craig Hall, the owner of Hall Wines, was upset that the Democratic candidates chose to bash wine caves instead of focusing on policy issues.
“I’m just a pawn here,” Hall, 69, told the New York Times. “They’re making me out to be something that’s not true. And they picked the wrong pawn. It’s just not fair.”
Hall and his wife, Kathryn Walt Hall, have given Democratic causes more than $2.4 million since the 1980s, including donations to candidates like Kamala Harris and Nancy Pelosi. The couple found it offensive that candidates like Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders have spoken down about the party’s billionaire donors.
“These people don’t know who they’re talking about when they throw me in the class that they did,” he explained. “As much as it’s frustrating, it’s more disappointing to me that Democrats are fighting with each other when we have a common goal, which is to get back to the White House.”
The businessman claimed that he would struggle to vote for a Democratic candidate if it ended up being Warren or Sanders.
“I hope I don’t face that question,” Hall explained. “It may be difficult. But I really want to support whoever the nominee is, and I plan to, but there may be some holding my nose.”
Hall noted that Buttigieg was his personal front-runner despite not having completely settled on a candidate to support in the presidential primary.
Although wine caves have had a lot of negative press in the last week, many have noted that caves are essential for the aging process of wine because of the low temperatures and high humidity. The Halls were not alone in their defense of the wine industry. California Gov. Gavin Newsom also condemned the candidates for attacking wine caves, saying, “It’s one of America’s great exports. It’s my business. It’s how I started.”

Power struggle fuels 'Virtue and Vengeance'

Texto completo: "Children of Virtue and Vengeance" (Henry Holt and Co., 416 pp., ) is the highly anticipated sequel to "Children of Blood and Bone," the first book of Tomi Adeyemi's West African-inspired fantasy trilogy, Legacy of Orïsha. Famously, "Children of Blood and Bone" netted the now-26-year-old Adeyemi a seven-figure advance, one of the biggest in the history of young adult fiction. Quickly after that, Fox 2000 picked up the film rights. As of now, "Children of Blood and Bone" has been on The New York Times best-seller list for more than 34 weeks, and has spent 20 weeks on the USA TODAY Best-Selling Books list.
The dynamics of power, corruption and identity are further explored in "Virtue and Vengeance." Where "Blood and Bone" explores how persecuted minorities find ways to retain their culture, "Virtue and Vengeance" places that minority on an equal playing field with their oppressors overnight. The characters are forced to rethink what they know about their culture and exactly who gets to own it.
The first book follows Zélie, her brother Tzain and runaway princess Amari in a quest to return magic to the land of Orïsha, where the maji people who formerly had powers are being ruthlessly persecuted by the monarchy. The monarchy chases the trio as well as Amari's brother, Prince Inan, who also discovers he has powers and a special bound to Zélie. Unlike Zélie, Inan sees his magic as curse rather than a blessing, especially under the rule of his father, who sees the maji only as "maggots."
At the end of "Blood and Bone," Zeilie, Tzain and Amari return magic to the lands of Orïsha, and the once-powerless majis now have the magic they had lost, and with it a desire to reclaim their culture that had nearly been wiped out.
Yet, the majis are not the only ones who wake up with powers. The ruling class also discover they have new powers and even more reason to wipe out the majis for good. And that includes the genocidal queen of Orïsha, Nehanda, who now takes her husband's place on the throne after he is killed by his daughter Amari at the end of "Blood and Bone."
Peace has never been more fragile. The book grapples with the idea of compromise when unspeakable violence has been committed against a group of people who are now returning such violence with a vengeance. The central conflict of the story is the war between the monarchy and the newly empowered maji, but the discord starts in the intimate bonds among the main characters, with characters' actions rippling out from the personal to acts of war.
Adeyemi expands on the strengths of the first book and raises the stakes in both friendships and in war, challenging the loyalties that were strongly cemented in "Blood and Bone." (though some relationships, especially the romances, feel underdeveloped and rushed). "Virtue and Vengeance" also introduces characters and revives old ones, revealing more difficult questions about redemption, power and reparations. Adeyemi does not pull any punches relating the horrors of genocide and war, yet her books still maintain a spirit of fantasy and adventure without her message losing its impact.
It builds to an ending that leaves the reader with a feeling that can only be described as dread. The dread is not a negative point, but adds scope to the series and more complexity to the theme of identity. Adeyemi writes a mean cliffhanger and successfully upends expectations.
The last chapter will undoubtedly leave fans shaking with questions until the final installment of the trilogy is published.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Seven candidates took the debate stage Thursday night, hoping to make a splash at the last debate before the new year.
While the Democratic field has grown and shrunk repeatedly in the past few weeks, the stage held only seven candidates — the fewest of any debate so far this cycle.
Here's a look at the winners and losers:
Winners Joe Biden Former Vice President Joe Biden looked stronger and more relaxed Thursday night than he has in previous debates.
When asked about how to return to "normal" after a President Donald Trump administration, Biden pushed back against the notion of just returning to business as usual, stating, "Look, I didn't say return to normal. Normal is not enough. Normal, in fact, we would have to move beyond normal, whether health care, the environment, whatever it is."
He continued to expand on working with his Republican counterparts, and that he refuses "to accept the notion, as some on this stage do, that we can never, never get to a place where we have cooperation again. If that's the case, we're dead as a country."
"If anyone has reason to be angry with Republicans and not want to cooperate, it's me. They have attacked me, my son, my family," he said, addressing the GOP's unfounded claims that Biden strong-armed the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor in order to thwart an investigation into an Ukrainian energy company company tied to his son, Hunter Biden.
"We have to be able to get things done, and if we can't convince them, we go out and beat them like we did in the 2018 election, in red states and in purple states," he declared
When asked about Obama's comments that there would be "significant improvement across the board" if countries were led by women, and that "old men" needed to get "out of the way," Biden joked that he is "going to guess he wasn't talking about me either," earning laughter from the audience.
But Biden did differentiate himself from the former president by stating he disagreed with Obama's surge of troops in Afghanistan, and firmly quipped that he was the "guy from the beginning who argued that it was a big, big mistake to surge forces to Afghanistan, period. We should not have done it. And I argued against it constantly."
Biden displayed himself to be the strong, experienced and leveled politician his campaign has been trying to present.
"Joe Biden tonight looked like a frontrunner, he fought like a frontrunner, he sounded like a frontrunner, and he deserves the credit," CNN analyst Van Jones said after the debate.
Andrew Yang Businessman Andrew Yang jokingly asked, "I know what you're thinking, America: How am I still on this stage with them?"
While Yang hasn't missed a debate thus far, he had more airtime than previous debates, and was able to expand on his answers with fewer candidates to compete with.
Yang had a forceful answer on a question related to people with disabilities, saying "Special needs children are going to become special needs adults ... . We have to stop confusing economic value and human value... We have to say 'Kyle, you have intrinsic value because you are a human being.'"
Yang also answered firmly on needing more women in leadership and declared, "Our country is deeply misogynist ... money and men are tied together. The fact is, strong societies would elect more female leaders."
He also got some chuckles after saying, "if you get too many men alone and leave us alone for awhile, we kind of become morons."
Amy Klobuchar Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar strategically acted as a peacekeeper a few times Thursday, touting her Midwestern roots by stopping a few word-battles between candidates with a "come on, you guys." She then seamlessly dovetailed into her own stance on the issue.
She then hit Mayor Pete Buttigieg on his lack of experience, accusing him of "denigrating" the experience of the senators on stage.
"We should have someone heading up this ticket that has actually won and been able to show that they can gather the support that you talked about from moderate republicans and independents, as well as a fired-up democratic base," Klobuchar said. "And not just done it once – I have done it three times."
Losers Health care Despite dominating the first half of the past several debates, health care took two hours to even be talked about at Thursday's debate.
A November report by the New York Times found that health care had dominated the debates so far, with 95.4 minutes were spent on the issue, besting the second-most mentioned issue of foreign policy by over 22 minutes.
The topic was brought up at the tailend of the debate, but did not bring forth any new debate.
Julián Castro and Tulsi Gabbard Two Democratic presidential candidates who weren't on stage Thursday night didn't even get name checked.
Castro and Gabbard, who didn't qualify for December's debate, will likely struggle to gain traction and grow their base without the national audience a debate brings. Gabbard campaigned in Manchester, New Hampshire, during the debate, while Castro on Twitter answered what his responses to the debate questions would have been.
Sen. Cory Booker, who also didn't make the stage, was at least mentioned by entrepreneur Andrew Yang.
"I miss Kamala (Harris), I miss Cory (Booker), though I think Cory will be back," Yang said when asked about the lack of people of color on the stage. Castro is the only Latino candidate in the 2020 presidential election. Tulsi Gabbard is Samoan American.
Gabbard is at 1.7% nationally, according to an average of polling by Real Clear Politics. Castro's polling average is at 1.3%.
What about Mayor Pete? Buttigieg is polling ahead of the pack in multiple early states, and came out nearly unscathed during November's match up.
That was not the case Thursday.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren criticized Buttigieg on his recent fundraiser in a wine cave.
"Billionaires in wine caves should not pick the next president of the United States," she said.
But Buttigieg responded that he was the only one on the debate stage in Los Angeles who's not a millionaire or billionaire. He then was hit by Klobuchar for lack of experience.
"If you want to talk about the capacity to win, try putting together a coalition to bring you back to office with 80% of the vote as a gay dude in Mike Pence's Indiana," Buttigieg said to Klobuchar.
But it's unclear whether the mayor will see boost from his performance, and whether the jabs from other candidates will hurt.

Texto completo: Headnote IMPEACHMENT
Speaker Nancy Pelosi deploying new strategy: to delay transmitting articles of impeachment
WASHINGTON - The day after the House cast historic votes to impeach President Donald Trump, Democrats grappled Thursday with when to send the charges to the Republican-led Senate, hoping to gain leverage in a bicameral clash over the contours of an election-year trial.
With some leading Democrats pushing to delay transmittal of the articles and others advocating that they be withheld altogether, it appeared increasingly likely that the limbo could persist until the newyear. The House is poised to leave town Friday for the Christmas and New Year's holidays, possibly without taking the votes that would be required to start the process in the Senate.
"We are ready," said Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who said Wednesday night that she was reluctant to send the charges or name the lawmakers who would prosecute the case against Trump until she was certain of a fair process for a Senate trial. "When we see what they have, we will know who and how many we will send over."
Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the majority leader, has complicated the picture for Democrats by asserting that he has no intention of acting as an impartial juror in a Senate trial of Trump but would instead do everything in his power, working in concert with the White House, to quickly acquit the president.
But if Pelosi was angling for an upper hand in negotiations about how the trial would proceed, McConnell quickly squashed the notion Thursday in a scathing speech in which he denounced her and Democrats for impeaching Trump.
"The vote did not reflect what had been proven; it only reflects how they feel about the president," McConnell said from the Senate floor. "The Senate must put this right. We must rise to this occasion. There is only one outcome that is suited to the paucity of evidence, the failed inquiry, the slapdash case."
And in comments that underscored the risks Pelosi faces in withholding the articles, McConnell effectively argued that the delay reflected a weak case against Trump, a blink by the Democrats in their standoff with the president.
"The prosecutors are getting cold feet in front of the entire country and second-guessing whether they even want to go to trial," McConnell said. "They said impeachment was so urgent that it could not even wait for due process, but now they're content to sit on their hands. This is comical."
Trump, echoing McConnell's remarks, took to Twitter to attack what he called a "pathetic" case.
"Pelosi feels her phony impeachment HOAX is so pathetic she is afraid to present it to the Senate, which can set a date and put this whole SCAM into default if they refuse to show up!" Trump wrote. "The Do Nothings are so bad for our Country!"
The angry tone of the comments reflected what people close to the president have said is a keen desire by Trump to be publicly vindicated in a Senate trial, a prospect that Pelosi now appears to be placing in jeopardy.
Nerves were raw on both sides of the aisle the morning after the House voted to impeach Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress related to his campaign to pressure Ukraine to smear Democratic rivals, making him only the third president to be impeached.
Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., the Democratic leader, called McConnell's speech a "30-minute partisan screed." Later, he met with Pelosi behind closed doors to plan strategy.
In the House, Pelosi shot back at McConnell: "I don't think anybody expected that we would have a rogue president and a rogue leader in the Senate at the same time."
And even as the next step in the process remained murky, she said Democrats had been receiving accolades from people across the country who were buoyed by the House action to charge Trump with high crimes and misdemeanors.
"Seems like people have a spring in their step because the president was held accountable for his reckless behavior," Pelosi told reporters on Capitol Hill. "No one is above the law, and the president has been held accountable."
But the conflict in Congress over how to proceed made clear that rather than rise above the partisan vitriol that permeated the House's impeachment inquiry and its vote Wednesday, the Senate - traditionally the cooler-headed chamber - may replicate it. It did not bode well for negotiations between the two Senate leaders, who were expected to meet later Thursday to discuss the parameters of a trial.
Some leading Democrats have cast doubt on whether a Senate trial will happen at all.
On Thursday morning, Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., the No. 3 House Democrat, said he was willing to wait "as long as it takes" to transmit the two impeachment articles approved Wednesday night.
"Until we can get some assurances from the majority leader that he is going to allow for a fair and impartial trial to take place, we would be crazy to walk in there knowing he has set up a kangaroo court," Clyburn said Thursday morning on CNN.
Pressed on whether Democrats should withhold the articles permanently, pulling the plug on a Senate trial, Clyburn said his personal preference would be to do so unless McConnell relents.
"If it were me, yes, that is what I am saying; I have no idea what the speaker would do," Clyburn said. "If you have a preordained outcome that is negative to your actions, why walk into it? I would much rather not take that chance."
In her own news conference in the House Thursday, Pelosi played down the delay over pressing charges in the Senate but declined repeatedly to offer a timeline for when the House might file its case. Pelosi has indicated she will work with House chairmen and Schumer to determine when the articles should be submitted and what meets her standard for fairness.
Schumer has already set forth his own detailed plan for a trial. In a letter sent Sunday night to McConnell, Schumer proposed a trial beginning Jan. 7 that would give each side a fixed amount of time to present its case, and called for four top White House officials who have not testified - including Mick Mulvaney, Trump's acting chief of staff; and John Bolton, the president's former national security adviser - to appear as witnesses.
McConnell quickly rejected the plan.
"Is the president's case so weak that none of the president's men can defend him under oath?" Schumer asked in a speech on the Senate floor Thursday morning.
Schumer said that Democrats wanted a "fair and speedy trial" and that he had proposed a "very reasonable structure."
"I have yet to hear one good argument why less evidence is better than more evidence, particularly in such a serious moment," he added.
In her news conference after Wednesday night's vote, Pelosi did not indicate that she was contemplating holding the articles forever.
And while she did not say explicitly what she believes would constitute a fair trial, she indicated she would support the plan laid out by Schumer.
"We'd like to see a trial where it's up to the senators to make their own decisions and working together, hopefully, in recognition of witnesses that the president withheld from us, the documents that president withheld from us," Pelosi said.
A top ally of Trump's, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., called the possibility that the House could hold back the articles a "constitutional extortion mechanism that is dangerous for the country."
Graham, who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said he spoke Thursday morning with Trump, who asked him, "What's happening?"
"He's puzzled," Graham said. "I tried the best I could to explain it. I'm puzzled, too."

Texto completo: First came "alternative facts." Now, the Congress and the nation are split into alternative universes, as Rep. Alcee Hastings described our constitutional crisis this week.
Two universes, with irreconcilable views of what is true and false and what is right and wrong.
The universe in which facts are facts and no one is above the law prevailed Wednesday when the House voted, for only the third time in our history, to impeach a president.
If what President Donald Trump did wasn't impeachable, nothing would be.
He abused the power of his office, withholding money Congress had appropriated, in a scheme to coerce a foreign nation into helping him in our ensuing election. That emboldened Russia to maintain its lethal aggression against Ukraine, putting our own security at risk. Caught in the act, Trump openly invited Chinese assistance for his campaign and used all the muscle of his office to thwart the investigation that the House was duty-bound to make.
In that other universe, the one that lost the debate Wednesday, right and wrong depend entirely on who holds political power. Power is a virtue. Nothing else matters.
It is regrettable that the House vote was almost entirely partisan, with no Republicans honoring their oaths to protect the Constitution from "all enemies, foreign and domestic."
To say that an issue is partisan, however, has less to do with the merits of an issue than with the motives of those debating it.
The Senate Republicans, sad to say, seem mired in that same dark-side universe where might is right and power determines what is true or false.
As they're in the majority, the prospects of a fair trial on whether to remove Trump seem dismal. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has virtually promised Trump's acquittal and is not consenting - yet - to calling for the administration witnesses and documents the president wrongfully denied to the House.
That explains why House Speaker Nancy Pelosi isn't saying when - or even whether - she will send the two articles of impeachment to the Senate. Political reality dictates that at some point she must do that, but at the moment, it's the only strategy she has to force McConnell to give the American people a fair trial.
The people are on her side about that. According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll published this week, 70% - including nearly two-thirds of Republicans - think Trump should allow his top aides to testify.
For now, however, it's appropriate to celebrate the courageous leadership of Pelosi and of Adam Schiff and Jerrold Nadler, chairs of the Intelligence and Judiciary committees, who compiled what even the Republicans should have recognized as an ironclad case.
Twenty-eight Democratic freshmen earned their own profiles in courage by resisting fearsome pressure from the other side. Having been elected from districts Trump won in 2016, they were targeted in advertising blitzes. Only two others voted against both articles. Had just 13 of the 28 folded, Trump would have won.
Florida's delegation voted entirely with their parties, as expected, though it was still disappointing to find Republicans Francis Rooney of Naples, who is retiring, and Mario Diaz-Balart on the wrong side of history.
For Broward and Palm Beach voters, however, now is a good time to write or call Reps. Hastings, Lois Frankel, Ted Deutch, Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Frederica Wilson to say "thank you." Voting to impeach a president is difficult, no matter how well-deserved, and Trump's voters won't be forgiving.
What has happened to the Republicans' view of political morality since they impeached Bill Clinton for lying about an affair with an intern? His offenses did not endanger our security or threaten to establish a dictatorship. Trump's do.
Current events seem to fulfill Lord Acton's famous maxim that "Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely."
Yet people can resist that. Many do.
"Politics doesn't corrupt people. People corrupt politics," said U.S. District Judge Amy Jackson Berman on Tuesday while sentencing Rick Gates, the former Trump campaign aide whose cooperation helped convict others in crimes uncovered during the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.
That is certainly true of Trump, who has turned the Republican Party into his personal cult and who puts himself above all else. That sad fact was evident in the six typewritten pages of self-pitying, self-serving rant he sent to Pelosi on Tuesday. He papered the Senate with copies.
Misrepresentations, falsehoods and outright lies have become so common in Trump's bizarre presidency that the letter was remarkable only in two respects.
One was that it packed so many of them into a single document. The New York Times annotated 19 and The Washington Post 21. He attributed to his adversaries every offense against the Constitution that he has committed, a defensive trait that psychologists call projection.
It also laid bare the utter hollowness of his character.
"Even worse than offending the Founding Fathers," he wrote to Pelosi, "you are offending Americans of faith by continually saying, 'I pray for the President,' when you know this statement is not true, unless it is meant in a negative sense. It is a terrible thing you are doing, but you will have to live with it, not I."
Why is it so difficult for Trump, who claims to share the Christian faith, to believe that Pelosi would consider it her Christian duty to pray for his enlightenment?
The only part of the letter on which both universes might agree is that he wrote it "for the purpose of history, and to put my thoughts on a permanent and indelible record."
In that record, historians will be astonished by his claim that "more due process was afforded to those accused in the Salem Witch Trials."
Twenty people were put to death in Salem before that madness subsided, convicted by "evidence" that was allowed to include dreams and hallucinations.
Only in a truly perverse alternative universe could that be called "due process."

Texto completo: Representative Mark Meadows, a Republican from North Carolina, announced that he would not seek re-election at the end of his term.
WASHINGTON -- One of President Trump's most loyal supporters, Representative Mark Meadows, announced on Thursday that he would leave Congress at the end of his term in January 2021.
"For everything there is a season. After prayerful consideration and discussion with family, today I'm announcing that my time serving Western North Carolina in Congress will come to a close at the end of this term," Mr. Meadows said in a statement. "My work with President Trump and his administration is only beginning."
"This was a decision I struggled with greatly," he said.
Mr. Meadows is now the 25th House Republican to leave before the next Congress, citing retirement or ambitions for another political post, an exodus that has been fueled in part by frustration at being deprived of power in the minority and term limits on leadership positions.
First elected in 2012, Mr. Meadows co-founded the conservative House Freedom Caucus, and served as a consistent thorn in the sides of two successive Republican speakers, John A. Boehner and Paul D. Ryan. But he found his most powerful perch as one of Mr. Trump's top allies on Capitol Hill -- and last year was considered for the position of the president's chief of staff.
Mr. Meadows did not elaborate further in a brief interview on Thursday about what his continued work with Mr. Trump might entail.
"There's a number of options, but I'll certainly be helping the president and hopefully helping him get re-elected," he said.
Mr. Meadows added he would miss being able to help his constituents in North Carolina and the "intellectual bantering back and forth" on the House floor.
"I don't mind the combat," he said.
As House Democrats began their impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump over his pressure campaign against Ukraine, Mr. Meadows emerged as one of the president's leading defenders, and was frequently spotted huddling with the president at the White House, proximity that fueled his political power even as Republicans held little power in the House.
Asked by a North Carolina newspaper if the Freedom Caucus was still relevant in a Democratic-controlled House, Mr. Meadows smiled. "Oh, more relevant than you might imagine," he said.
His role as a critical supporter of the president came as a departure for Mr. Meadows, who built a reputation on his hunger to challenge the Republican establishment and its leaders. In an escalation of the bad blood simmering between the right flank of the Republican conference represented by Mr. Meadows and the more centrist leadership, in 2015 Mr. Meadows attempted to overthrow Mr. Boehner, ultimately influencing the then-House speaker's decision to retire early.
Under Mr. Ryan's tenure as speaker, the House Freedom Caucus, led by Mr. Meadows, continued to flex its muscles as the most powerful group of lawmakers in Congress.
While praising his conservative record, Republican lawmakers also underscored another, more unusual aspect of Mr. Meadows' congressional career: his ability to build friendships across the aisle.
"Not only is Mark a top-notch conservative, he's an upstanding individual, who looks to build friendships with all of his colleagues," Representative Andy Biggs of Arizona, the current chairman of the Freedom Caucus, said in a statement. "In a growing partisan climate, Mark's example is a breath of fresh air and one that we all should strive to emulate."
In one of the more improbable alliances in Congress, Mr. Meadows counted as a close friend the late Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, who served as the chairman of the powerful Oversight Committee. The two worked together on prescription drug legislation, and when Mr. Cummings died in October, Mr. Meadows delivered an emotional eulogy.
As Mr. Meadows eyes his next job, it is not immediately clear who his successor might be. Friday is the deadline to file for re-election in his heavily Republican congressional district -- a short turnaround time for any potential candidate.
Mr. Meadows is the third Republican from North Carolina to announce his decision to leave Congress; he made no mention of the newly redrawn districts in his state in his statement. Mr. Meadows was still expected to keep his seat, despite what was expected to be a more challenging re-election campaign.
His announcement comes a day after he voted against two articles of impeachment against the president. Ultimately the Democrats won the vote and impeached Mr. Trump, making him the third president to be impeached in the country's history.
After the vote on Wednesday, Mr. Meadows wrote in a Twitter post, "Today will be remembered as the day your House Democrat majority voted to impeach President @realDonaldTrump for a crime they couldn't find and a case they couldn't prove. You won't forget. And neither will we."

JPMorgan Chief Is Asked
About Racism at Bank
Democratic lawmakers, five from the Senate and two from the House of Representatives, asked Jamie Dimon, right, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, to list steps the bank is taking to combat discrimination against black customers and employees after a New York Times report about racism at some of the bank's branches in Arizona.
In two letters to Mr. Dimon on Thursday, copies of which were also sent to regulators, the lawmakers asked whether the bank planned to change its hiring, lending and other practices to ensure it is treating minorities fairly.
The letter from the Senate was signed by Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Robert Menendez of New Jersey, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland. The letter from the House was signed by Representatives Emanuel Cleaver II of Missouri and Al Green of Texas.
The senators asked Mr. Dimon to provide a list of cases in which regulators have penalized the bank for violating fair lending and employment laws over the last decade. Mr. Cleaver and Mr. Green asked for a breakdown of how many black financial advisors Chase employed in each of its branches.
A spokeswoman for JPMorgan said the bank had not yet seen copies the letters, both of which were reviewed by The New York Times, as of Thursday afternoon.
"We're happy to continue the dialogue," said the spokeswoman, Patricia Wexler.
On Dec. 11, The Times published an article about recordings that a Phoenix-based employee and a customer made of other JPMorgan employees. One employee explained to a black customer why he was not receiving a service he expected from Chase: "You're bigger than the average person, period. And you're also an African-American," he said. Another employee described a different black customer as coming "from Section 8," adding that she did not "respect" her money.
On Dec. 13, Mr. Dimon wrote to the bank's employees that the Arizona incidents did not reflect "who we are as a company and how we serve our clients and communities every day." EMILY FLITTER

Senate Passes Bill
To Hinder Robocalls
The Senate approved a bill Thursday to crack down on robocalls, sending to President Trump a measure meant to combat a persistent and costly problem for Americans.
The bill, which Mr. Trump is expected to sign, would stiffen enforcement and require that phone companies offer free consumer tools to identify and block scam calls. It also calls for tougher fines when individuals intentionally violate the law.
It echoes and builds on preventive measures that the Federal Communications Commission and state attorneys general have pushed for. It potentially speeds up steps the telecom industry is already taking to protect Americans from the billions of scam calls made each month.
Maureen Mahoney, policy analyst for Consumer Reports, said the measure was an important step, though "robocalls are not going to disappear overnight."
Robocalls have flooded Americans' phones because technology makes it cheap and easy to call people. Enforcement is difficult, with many scammers overseas. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Andrew Yang doesn't know why he's the only minority onstage, but the answer is clear

Texto completo: Businessman Andrew Yang asked at the Democratic primary debate, "Why am I the lone candidate of color on this stage?"
Yang was the only racial minority onstage Thursday night because he was the only one who got enough support in polls from Democratic primary voters. Kamala Harris dropped out already. Cory Booker didn't meet the requirements. Neither did Julian Castro.
None of that is because the deck was stacked against them for racial reasons. It's because even black and Latino Democratic voters didn't support the minority candidates in the field. They were demonstrably and overwhelmingly for the old white guys, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders.
Yang might even know that. As detailed in my forthcoming book, Privileged Victims: How America's Culture Fascists Hijacked the Country and Elevated Its Worst People, accusations of racism, genderism, and any other -ism are how you fight in politics today.
It's not obvious to me why black voters don't back Booker over Biden or why Latino voters don't back Castro over Sanders, but that's the math. Yang made the case that it had something to do with "disposable income" and how much those particular voters have to contribute to political action committees, but that's not it.
The other minority candidates can't get sufficient support to win, and that's it.

Bret Stephens: The conservative case for impeachment and conviction

Texto completo: Several years ago, Laurence Silberman, a senior judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and a man widely admired by conservatives for his wisdom and rectitude, spoke of his experience in the mid-1970s looking into the secret files of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover.
“Accompanied by only one FBI official, I read virtually all these files in three weekends,” Silberman, who was then President Gerald Ford’s deputy attorney general, recalled in a speech to a judicial conference. “It was the single worst experience of my long governmental service.”
He continued:
“I intend to take to my grave nasty bits of information on various political figures — some still active. As bad as the dirt collection business was, perhaps even worse was the evidence that (Hoover) had allowed — even offered — the bureau to be used by presidents for nakedly political purposes. I have always thought that the most heinous act in which a democratic government can engage is to use its law enforcement machinery for political ends.” (My emphasis.)
I’ve been thinking about Silberman’s speech in two connections this week, the first regarding the FBI, the second impeachment. They are related.
On Tuesday, Rosemary Collyer, presiding judge on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, issued a stinging rebuke to the bureau for its handling of the counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign’s Russia ties.
“The frequency with which representations made by FBI personnel turned out to be unsupported or contradicted by information in their possession, and with which they withheld information detrimental to their case, calls into question whether information contained in other FBI applications is reliable,” Collyer wrote.
Collyer’s decision should put paid to the notion that this month’s report from Michael Horowitz, the Justice Department’s inspector general, is some kind of ringing vindication of the Russia investigation. Republicans like Devin Nunes were more right about the conduct of the investigation than many of its supporters, including me, care to admit, even if the investigation itself was warranted. And Carter Page is owed an apology by anyone, including me, who cares for the presumption of innocence and objects to trial by media.
But now to impeachment: If conservatives are right to object to the abuse of power by FBI agents, shouldn’t they be far more alarmed at the abuse of investigatory and other powers for political ends by the president of the United States?
According to the public transcript of Donald Trump’s July 25 call with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine, Trump said: “The server, they say Ukraine has it. ... I would like to have the attorney general call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it.”
Trump also said: “There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great.”
Here is a textbook case of Silberman’s “most heinous act in which a democratic government can engage.” The president is unambiguously proposing to employ his chief law enforcement officer to investigate a debunked conspiracy theory that Trump hopes will burnish his political legitimacy. And he also proposes to use the attorney general in an attempt to investigate a political opponent for undeniably political ends.
That Trump didn’t get away with it is a relief, not an exoneration. That he continues to insist the call was “perfect,” as he did Tuesday in his letter to Nancy Pelosi, means that he is likely to do it again. That he attempted to subvert the will of Congress by impounding congressional funds for his political ends threatens the separation of powers in ways that will haunt a future Republican Congress. That he was prepared to endanger an ally and benefit an enemy is not treason, as the Constitution defines treason, but it is a travesty, as any American ought to understand travesty. That Republican leaders are cheering him only serves to define deviancy down and debase our political norms in ways that will surely haunt a future Republican Congress. That conservative pundits claim to be outraged at the FBI’s investigation of the Trump campaign — or the smearing of Carter Page — while being indifferent to Trump’s attempt investigate Joe Biden — and the smearing of Hunter Biden — marks a fresh low in rhetorical sophistry.
There are people who believe that law, morality, traditions and institutions are at least as important to the preservation of freedom as the will of the people. Such people are called conservative. What Republicans are now doing with their lockstep opposition to impeachment — and with their indifference to the behavior that brought impeachment about — is not conservative. It is the abdication of principle to power.
I might think differently about impeachment if Trump had shown any sense of contrition. Or if Republicans had shown any inclination to censure him. But Trump hasn’t, and they haven’t. Whatever the political ramifications of impeachment now, history will judge members of this Congress harshly if they fail to state their revulsion at the president’s behavior in the strongest terms they can. Impeach and convict.

Texto completo: Former Olympic equestrian Michael Barisone, arrested in August after a shooting incident on his Washington Township farm in Morris County, was indicted Wednesday on two counts of attempted murder.
Barisone, 54, a former Sportsman International Horseman of the Year, shot a woman employed and residing at the 53-acre Barisone Dressage Farm in the Long Valley section on Aug. 7, authorities said.
After what police described as a landlord-tenant dispute, Barisone shot Lauren Kanarek twice in the chest with a handgun, records show.
During the incident, Morris County Prosecutor Fredric Knapp said, Barisone also opened fire on a man who was with Kanarek. He missed the man, later identified as Kanarek's fiancé, Robert Goodwin, who tackled Barisone and restrained him until police arrived, according to a source at the scene.
Authorities said Kanarek called 911 at 2:13 p.m. that day and told police, "Michael Barisone shot me."
The indictment includes two counts of first-degree attempted murder and two second-degree counts of possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose. First-degree attempted murder carries a maximum penalty of life in prison.
Kanarek recovered from her critical wounds and is suing Barisone and his company, Sweetgrass Farms. She told The New York Times in October that since the incident, she has been harassed on social media by supporters of Barisone who claim she harassed him and he was acting in self-defense.
Kanarek's lawsuit accuses Barisone and his associates of harassing her and her fiancé repeatedly before their final confrontation.
Kanarek, who was living at the farm with her fiancé, said Barisone, Sweetgrass and barn manager Ruth Cox put her in danger by allowing firearms on the property. The suit seeks unspecified damages for emotional and physical distress.
Kanarek accuses Cox and 10 unnamed possible owners of the black-and-pink 9-millimeter Ruger pistol used in the shooting of failing to prevent her former trainer from getting hold of the weapon.
Barisone was a reserve rider on the 2008 U.S. Olympic dressage team in Beijing. One of his students, Alison Bock, won a bronze medal in the 2016 Olympics in Brazil.
He remains in custody at the Morris County Correctional Facility. Passaic attorney Jeffrey Simms, who represented Barisone at his indictment, said he is no longer representing him. Barisone's current attorney could not be reached.
Anyone with information related to the investigation is asked to call the Morris County Prosecutor's Office Major Crimes Unit at 973-285-6200, or the Washington Township Police Department at 908-876-3232.

Texto completo: Are there new North Carolina books that would be good holiday presents for hard-to-give-to people on my list? I get that question every year about this time. Answering it gives me a chance to spread the word about the work of our state's diverse authors.
Here are some ideas:
First, consider two books that are battling each other for the top position on The New York Times best-selling fiction list: "Where the Crawdads Sing" by Delia Owens and "The Guardians" by John Grisham. Owens set her book in North Carolina, and although Grisham lives in Charlottesville, Virginia, he spends lots of time here "doing the grandfather thing" with family in Raleigh and Chapel Hill. Because both Owens and Grisham are great storytellers, their books would be good choices for almost any reader.
If the prospective gift recipient is a Grisham fan but has already read "The Guardians," consider "The Substitution Order" by Martin Clark. His complicated literary thriller is built on a multi-million-dollar insurance scam and the broken life of a once highly respected lawyer.
Don't forget our state's master literary fiction authors, Ron Rash and Charles Frazier. Rash's "The Risen" and Frazier's "Varina" gained widespread praise throughout this year for their beautiful language and rich storytelling.
For readers who miss the late Pat Conroy's booming fiction, consider Cassandra King Conroy's "Tell Me a Story: My Life with Pat Conroy."
Two debut authors gained my admiration this year: "A Woman Is No Man" by Etaf Rum and "In West Mills" by De'Shawn Charles Winslow. Rum lives in Rocky Mount, but writes about the Palestinian American community in Brooklyn, New York. Winslow grew up near Elizabeth City and writes about people in a nearby fictional African American community.
For speculative fiction fans, "The Crossing" by Columbus County native Jason Mott takes readers to a future troubled America and the travels of teenaged twins, a sister who remembers everything and her brother who remembers almost nothing.
There is also a wealth of nonfiction related to North Carolina.
"The Secret Token: Myth, Obsession, and the Search for the Lost Colony of Roanoke" by Andrew Lawler is a comprehensive and entertaining review of our state's founding myth and the 350-year-old search for clues about what happened to those lost colonists.
"A Delicious Country: Rediscovering the Carolinas along the Route of John Lawson's 1700 Expedition" by Scott Huler and "The Tuscarora War: Indians, Settlers, and the Fight for the Carolina Colonies" by David La Vere take readers back to the struggles between the early colonists and the natives they displaced.
For a worried supporter of the UNC System, "Fire and Stone: The Making of the University of North Carolina under Presidents Edward Kidder Graham and Harry Woodburn Chase" by Howard Covington shows how UNC struggled to gain support from state government in the early days of the last century.
Finally, a surefire gift for North Carolinians who love their mothers, "Mothers and Strangers: Essays on Motherhood from the New South" edited by Lee Smith and Samia Serageldin.

Pelosi, Asking For Fair Trial, Might Hold Articles Back

Texto completo: In declining to say when she might send the articles of impeachment to the Senate, Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested she might keep them as leverage for negotiations on the rules for a trial.
WASHINGTON -- Speaker Nancy Pelosi indicated Wednesday night that the House could indefinitely delay sending the articles of impeachment against President Trump to the Senate, leaving ambiguous the timing of a trial to decide whether to acquit him or convict and remove him from office.
After historic nearly party-line votes to impeach Mr. Trump for two articles, abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, Ms. Pelosi told reporters that she would hold the articles back until it was clearer that the upper chamber would give the case a fair hearing. The strategy suggested she was keeping the charges as leverage in a coming negotiation over the terms of a Senate trial.
But it could leave the matter in limbo until early January, delaying the start of a trial for an unknown period of time.
"We will make our decision as to when we are going to send it when we see what they are doing on the Senate side," Ms. Pelosi said. "So far, we have not seen anything that looks fair to us."
The decision injected a new element of uncertainty into an impeachment process that has already roiled the Capitol and promises profound political implications for Mr. Trump, his party and the Democrats.
With Mr. Trump and his allies said to be interested in a speedy trial and acquittal, Ms. Pelosi believes slowing down the proceeding could force Senate Republicans to set procedures the Democrats find more favorable to their case, according to Democratic officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.
But it is not at all clear that Ms. Pelosi holds much leverage over Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, who as majority leader has broad power to determine the contours of the trial. An adviser to Mr. McConnell, Josh Holmes, signaled the majority leader was in no rush to try the president for impeachable offenses, writing on Twitter that the maneuver "might be the greatest compliment McConnell has ever received."
"They are seriously entertaining holding a grenade with the pin pulled rather than facing what happens when they send it over McConnell's wall," Mr. Holmes said.
Democrats in the Senate had already complained that Mr. McConnell was trying to ram through the president's acquittal by refusing to call witnesses or obtain new evidence. They also took issue with Mr. McConnell's assertions that it was not his role to act as an "impartial juror" during a trial and that he would closely coordinate any trial with the White House Counsel's Office.
"This is what I don't consider a fair trial," Ms. Pelosi said on Wednesday.
Representative Earl Blumenauer, Democrat of Oregon, said he had spoken to at least 40 Democrats who were concerned that Mr. McConnell would not conduct a fair trial, and who wanted Ms. Pelosi to delay sending the articles to the Senate until she learned more about how the proceedings would move forward.
"What is gained by accelerating this process?" he asked. He said Democrats should "let the speaker work her magic" to "get some sort of assurance, if it's possible, that there will be a level playing field."
In addition, some Democrats -- including some of the chamber's most progressive lawmakers -- have advocated simply never sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate, to deny Mr. Trump an almost certain acquittal in the Republican-controlled chamber, where a two-thirds vote -- 67 senators -- are needed to convict. Ms. Pelosi has not ruled that out, but House leaders are not seriously contemplating that course, the Democratic officials said.
The Constitution does not dictate how the process of transmitting articles of impeachment from the House to the Senate should work. It says only that the House has "the sole power of impeachment" and that the Senate, "shall have the sole power to try all impeachments."
But Ms. Pelosi's hesitation departs from the precedent set by the only modern presidential impeachment.
In December 1998, a group of Republicans immediately marched the articles of impeachment against President Bill Clinton across the Capitol to the Senate after the House vote almost exactly 21 years ago. Because the Senate was not in session, the trial did not begin until early January.
The speaker indicated she would also wait to appoint impeachment managers, the House members responsible for prosecuting the case in the Senate, until the matter was resolved.
"We cannot name managers until we see what the process is on the Senate side, and I would hope that would be soon" Ms. Pelosi said.
Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island, said he did not expect Ms. Pelosi to hold onto the articles indefinitely. But he said Mr. McConnell's close coordination with the White House "makes a mockery of the trial."
"I think everyone needs to be assured that there is a process in place that will treat these very serious impeachment articles with the gravity they deserve," he said.
Still, if there is no resolution on Thursday, a stalemate could easily drag on for weeks.
Under the rules adopted to consider the articles on Wednesday, the House must hold a separate vote allowing Ms. Pelosi to appoint the impeachment managers and transmit the articles to the Senate. The House is scheduled to leave Washington at the end of the week for the Christmas and New Year's holidays, meaning if she does not take the action by then, the fate of the articles could be left unresolved until early January, when Congress reconvenes in the capital.

Texto completo: ’Twas the eve of impeachment, when all through the House
No Republicans wavered, each last one a louse.
The articles were drafted by Democrats with care
In hopes that a conscience would soon bloom there.
We pundits were tossing all steamed in our beds,
While Trump’s certain acquittal danced in our heads.
And I in frustration, feeling all solemn,
Wished I could capture my woe in a column,
When out on the web there arose such a clatter,
I signed in to Twitter to see what was the matter.
And there I beheld him, the master of lies,
Weaving fresh falsehoods, to no one’s surprise.
He savaged the Bidens, he smeared Adam Schiff,
And cycled through villains in a furious jiff,
Not to mention distractions, like the teeth of the Speaker
Could a “leader” be cruder, could his morals be weaker?
So now he’s a dentist, in his all-knowing ways?
I prayed for deliverance one of these days.
When what to my cynical eyes did appear
But a raft of excuses pulled by mangy reindeer,
With a weasel-eyed driver, so meek and so zany,
I knew in a moment he must be Mulvaney.
More shameless than con men, the sycophants came,
And Trump gloated, so bloated, and called them by name:
“Now, Rudy! Now, Jared! Now, Lindsey and Mitch!
Please fly this democracy into a ditch!
It is how you will save me. It is how I prevail.
Or else I will join poor Paul in the jail.
That’s the toll of a presidency ended too soon,
So you must sing along to my favorite tune:
‘It’s a witch hunt! A hoax!’ Those are lyrics for me.
That’s the verse, that’s the chorus, for eternity.”
He was dressed in a necktie, from his jowls to his soles.
He had tanned beyond tanning. Imagine the moles.
His hair, how it swirled! His legs, how they splayed!
On such fishy foundations was his confidence laid.
And we couldn’t stop looking — not his fans, not his foes.
That was what he was after: the show of all shows.
Its plot strained belief. Its appeal tested reason.
Still it was soaring toward a second season.
The economy roared. The Democrats whimpered.
Vladimir chortled. Emmanuel simpered.
In the bag that Trump carried, he had goodies galore:
Lower taxes, the Dow, right-wing judges and more.
They weren’t for the many, they favored the few,
But that was obscured by the smoke that he blew.
All was fog, all was mist, all was boast, all was fiction,
As he hid his true airs with bad diet and diction.
He could do as he wanted and never know fear,
For an elf — and a savior! — named Barr hovered near.
And then there was Tucker and of course Hannity
To put an extra-fine gloss on insanity.
What great luck to discover a country so riven
You could smash it and rule it if suitably driven.
You could summon the Russians, you could bully Ukraine,
Just as long as you made “It’s fake news!” your refrain.
I cringed as I watched him and cried for us all,
Our values, our futures hijacked by his gall.
A last bid to preserve them was cause to impeach
But his party’s corruption put him beyond reach.
So then why all his thrashing? His howls of dejection?
It was just a performance for the next election.
It brought more donations. It rallied the base.
You could see, if you looked, a clear smirk on his face.
If you listened, you heard it: a lilt in his voice.
In drama like this, he would always rejoice.
So as history scarred him, he could nonetheless yell,
“Merry TrumpMas to all! I’m the king of this hell.”

Colombia exhuming graves of alleged victims of soldiers

Texto completo: Colombian authorities are exhuming dozens of graves to determine whether the dead were civilians who security forces falsely claimed were guerrillas.
Authorities say soldiers killed thousands of civilians between 1998 and 2014 under pressure from their commanders and then claimed the victims were members of the FARC guerrilla group. They planted weapons on their victims and dressed them in fighters' uniforms in a scandal Colombians have dubbed Falsos Positivos , or 'False Positives.'
The pace of killing increased from 2005 to 2009 under President Álvaro Uribe, who led an offensive against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. The country's Special Peace Tribunal, created under the 2016 peace accords that ended Colombia's 50-year conflict, announced Saturday it had begun the exhumation of more than 50 bodies, the largest such operation to date.
The work began last week at the Catholic Cemetery of Las Mercedes in Dabeiba, a town in the northwestern department of Antioquia, the tribunal said in a statement. It came after the panel heard 'a series of voluntary testimonies,' including one from a former soldier who said he knew of false positives in the town.
The soldier, who was in custody, accompanied authorities to the cemetery, located on a small mountain shrouded in fog, a human rights activist who was at the scene told The Washington Post. He spoke for an hour about his role in covering up civilian deaths.
Activist Adriana Arboleda, who represents victims through the local Legal Freedom Corporation, called the exhumation 'an important step.'
'The tribunal is proving that it's bringing to light cases that had been and would have remained unpunished,' she said. 'It offers hope that the country will be able to know the truth and recover bodies. Things that victims' families have long yearned for.'
The tribunal said the first seven bodies of the more than 50 victims believed to be buried in the cemetery had been recovered. Most victims were between 15 and 56 years old, the panel said; some were disabled.
Colombia's main cities have been beset in recent weeks by mass demonstrations against the government of President Iván Duque " in part, protesters say, because he has failed to fully implement the peace accords signed by his predecessor, Juan Manuel Santos. Duque is a member of Uribe's Democratic Center Party.
Dozens of demobilized FARC members, including some who participated in the peace negotiations, have retaken arms and returned to the jungle to resume the fight. More than 700 activists, indigenous leaders and demobilized FARC guerrillas have been killed since 2016.
Guillermo Botero, Duque's defense minister, resigned in November after evidence emerged that children had died in operations against dissident FARC groups. The New York Times reported in May that military commanders had ordered troops to kill more criminals and militants, suggesting they would accept more collateral damage.
The exhumations had been long awaited by victims of the armed conflict as a next step beyond taking testimony.
Dozens of soldiers have appeared before the tribunal since 2016 to be judged under transitional justice, which offers them reduced punishment if they collaborate. Investigations into false positives started last year.
'We have talked to more than one hundred military men,' Alejandro Ramelli, a tribunal magistrate, told the national newspaper El Espectador. 'They have revealed to us dozens of incidents, but we now have to confirm that what they are saying is true.'
The testimony of more than 160 soldiers has helped authorities identify some 400 victims to date, the tribunal said Saturday.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – A group of conservative critics of President Donald Trump – including the husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, George Conway – have launched a political action committee aimed at stopping his reelection.
The group includes conservative attorney Conway; former adviser to Sen. John McCain Steve Schmidt; former Ohio Gov. John Kasich adviser John Weaver; former New Hampshire Republican Party Chairwoman Jennifer Horn; and conservative pundit Rick Wilson.
"Patriotism and the survival of our nation in the face of the crimes, corruption and corrosive nature of Donald Trump are a higher calling than mere politics," Conway, Schmidt, Weaver and Wilson wrote in an op-ed for The New York Times that ran Tuesday. "As Americans, we must stem the damage he and his followers are doing to the rule of law, the Constitution and the American character. "
In the op-ed, they announced the founding of the Lincoln Project, a super PAC that "will be dedicated to defeating President Trump and Trumpism at the ballot box and to elect those patriots who will hold the line.
"We do not undertake this task lightly, nor from ideological preference. We have been, and remain, broadly conservative (or classically liberal) in our politics and outlooks. Our many policy differences with national Democrats remain, but our shared fidelity to the Constitution dictates a common effort. "
A filing with the Federal Election Commission showed the form to launch a super PAC called Rough Riders for America was filed on Nov. 5. A month later, an amendment was filed to change the group's name to the Lincoln Project.
Though many conservatives have spoken out against Trump since his 2016 victory, few have taken their opposition beyond critical editorials or social media attacks.

Political strategist Reed Galen, who is listed as the group's treasurer, told the Associated Press that the launch of the Lincoln Project represented a "shift from talk into action. " He called it a "big turning point for the political season and for the president’s reelection. "
Weaver told AP that the group plans to focus on winning over Republicans who are wary of Trump in battleground states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona and North Carolina. They also plan to work against Senate Republicans who have supported Trump, such as Sens. Cory Gardner of Colorado and Martha McSally of Arizona.
The group said Trump's "actions are possible only with the craven acquiescence of congressional Republicans" who they say have "embraced and copied Mr. Trump’s cruelty and defended and even adopted his corruption. "
The Lincoln Project's target voters represent a relatively small segment of the electorate. Trump has enjoyed solid support from Republicans since taking office. A USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll published Sunday found the president had an 87% favorability rating among registered Republicans voters.
But the Republicans and former GOP members behind the super PAC say Trump's supporters in the party have "abandoned conservatism and longstanding Republican principles and replaced it with Trumpism, an empty faith led by a bogus prophet. "
"Mr. Trump and his fellow travelers daily undermine the proposition we as a people have a responsibility and an obligation to continually bend the arc of history toward justice," they said. "They mock our belief in America as something more meaningful than lines on a map.
"Our peril far outstrips any past differences: It has arrived at our collective doorstep, and we believe there is no other choice. "

Texto completo: Thanks for memories
of Maryland nuclear
missile base
Thanks to reporter Jon Kelvey on his report on the Nike base in Maryland ("Nukes in the neighborhood: Restoration of Nike missile site near Carroll County continues, years after closure," Dec. 8).
I was stationed in Porter, Indiana (near Chicago and on Lake Michigan) from 1967 to 1970. I was a sentry dog handler and trainer. It brought back a lot of memories.
We used to call the men who worked down underground pit rats. It was a friendly term. We were a close-knit group. B-1-60 was our unit. There were two batteries in Indiana and one right in Chicago.

Misinformation not unique to Trump
or Fox News
David Zurawik's column, "In the age of Trump misinformational chaos" (Dec. 10), places all the blame for misinformation on President Donald Trump, Republicans and Fox News. According to Mr. Zurawik, the only sources of reliable, credible and truthful information are The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN, inferring they never lie.
Misinformation in the press and politics is contagious, and no one source of information is immune. So whom do we believe? The answer is subjective which means even David Zurawik is entitled to his opinion, regardless of whether it's true.

Greta is a hero
When did it begin, this naming of generations? Do we thank Tom Brokaw who first labeled the honorable working class and dutiful warriors of the World War II era as "The Greatest Generation?" It's hard to say, but since then we've galvanized "Gen X," "Boomers," "Millenials" and the rest, herding contemporaries into a part of their existence that apparently deserves a label. Luckily, there are breakout examples, rogue members of their ranks who whip up a frenzy for the good of humankind, who deliberately choose to rise above and, with their tireless efforts, typically succeed. Driven by passion and duty, they determine their destiny and often ours as well. Compelled by a need larger than their own, they are the types who refuse the yoke of labels and strive to make us all a part of the whole.
Greta Thunberg is such a rogue ("As Greta says, we should listen to the scientists and push for a zero-carbon economy," Sept. 25).
And thank goodness for that. In a time when political positions are fortified by the Wheaties of divisive language, when atonement for misdeeds becomes subterfuge and, as the adage goes, "a lie travels the world while the truth laces up its shoes," there is Greta facing down the Boomers and everyone else with a world-resonating "How dare you?" While she peers up through the cesspool of trash left behind by those who came before her, she calls for action not attention. And, true to her convictions, she is an example of what she dares to say traveling inconveniently, eating consciously ever mindful of the impact of her actions and her words.
Youth and wisdom are seldom swirled into one cocktail. But Greta shows us this possibility, and then she boldly asks us to drink up like thirsty sailors. And, by God, we should. Sometimes from small voices come huge requests. Adjusting our focus to truly see the world beyond our noses is a big ask now made by a young person carrying the yoke of those her age who recognize this need. It may be unfair to brand generations, but it isn't unfair to brand Greta as the hero that she is.

Adam Jones should be
in Baltimore, not Japan
I think it is a shame that Adam Jones had to go to Japan ("Former Orioles star Adam Jones announces move to Japan: 'It's now time to move on to my next chapter in life,'" Dec. 10). The Orioles should have brought him back. He played hard, did things for the community and was a very good ball player.
While the Orioles are wasting about $15 million a season on Chris Davis, they could have had Adam Jones for about $4 million a year. He would have been like a player-coach for the young players. I guess they are holding it against him for not agreeing to be traded near the end of the 2017 season.
Speaking of Orioles issues, when are they going to lower prices to the games and for MASN, since they will once again be one of the worst teams in the league? Attendance might even drop below 1 million. I fear that the Angelos family will be like Bob Irsay and threaten to move the team due to poor support like Irsay did our Colts after he ruined them and chased away a great fan base. I was a season ticket holder when they left.

Fact-checking 'Bombshell,' the Fox News movie: Was Megyn Kelly really poisoned?

Resumen: Fox News drama "Bombshell" shows how Megyn Kelly and others toppled alleged sexual harasser Roger Ailes. Here's what the new film gets right or wrong.

Enlaces: https://upfinder.upf.edu/openurl/34CSUC_UPF/34CSUC_UPF:VU1?genre=article&amp;atitle=Fact-checking+%27Bombshell%2C%27+the+Fox+News+movie%3A+Was+Megyn+Kelly+really+poisoned%3F&amp;author=Ryan%2C+Patrick&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;date=2019-12-17&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=USA+Today+%28Online%29&amp;issn=&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Anorthcentralnews_

Texto completo: "Bombshell" exploded into the awards race last week, leading the Screen Actors Guild Awards nominations with four nods, including best ensemble, actress (Charlize Theron) and supporting actress (Margot Robbie and Nicole Kidman).
The drama (in theaters now) goes behind the scenes at Fox News in 2016. It chronicles the efforts of a group of women – including on-the-outs host Gretchen Carlson (Kidman) and star anchor Megyn Kelly – to expose a culture of misogyny, leading to the ouster of Machiavellian CEO Roger Ailes (John Lithgow), who was accused of sexual harassment by more than 20 women.
Fox News spokesperson Caley Cronin declined to comment on the film to USA TODAY beyond confirming that "Bombshell" producers "never reached out to Fox News during any part of the production. ”
The film was directed by Jay Roach ("Trumbo") and written by Charles Randolph ("The Big Short"), who breaks down what's fact, fiction and somewhere in between.
Is Margot Robbie's character a real person?
Robbie plays an ambitious, wide-eyed staffer named Kayla Pospisil. A lifelong Fox News fanatic and young evangelical ("I see myself as an influencer in the Jesus space," she says), Kayla soon catches the eye of Ailes, who promises to promote her to on-air talent in exchange for sexual favors.
Although Kayla is a fictional character, her experiences of harassment are drawn from interviews Randolph and Roach conducted with ex-Fox News staffers (some of whom violated their non-disclosure agreements to speak with filmmakers).
"What happens inside of Roger's office is based on the stories of three women we had access to," Randolph says. The rest is pulled from Randolph's evangelical upbringing. "Her being ideologically fervent like a dedicated Republican, but a little sexually fluid and utterly morally sincere, that's based more on women in my life. "
Review: Charlize Theron transforms into Megyn Kelly, blasts the Fox News patriarchy in 'Bombshell'
'I want my voice back': Gretchen Carlson calls for change on big 'Bombshell' day
Is Kate McKinnon's character fictional, too?
The "Saturday Night Live" favorite is a scene-stealer as Kayla's savvy co-worker Jess Carr, a closeted lesbian and liberal who has complicated feelings about working at a network that preaches against her values and lifestyle.
Jess was "all made up," Randolph says. "I wanted to show the bystander narrative. Megyn's story is the story of someone who comes to discover she is complicit by virtue of the institutional norms and her ability to manipulate them in the predation of a younger generation of women. Likewise with Kayla: Her willingness to look the other way creates this dynamic, and she realizes at the end that it affects herself. "
'You could do worse, right?' Megyn Kelly approves of Charlize Theron's 'Bombshell' casting
Related: Why is Fox News being sued again over alleged sexual harassment?
Did someone actually poison Megyn Kelly?
The film begins with an anxious but steely Megyn en route to moderate the first debate of the Republican primary campaign. She accepts a cup of coffee offered by her driver, only to fall violently ill before the debate is about to begin. Rattled, she later relays the incident to Roger, wondering aloud whether it was nerves or if the man tampered with her drink.
The scene is lifted directly from Kelly's 2016 memoir "Settle for More," although the journalist refuted inferences by the New York Times and others that she was poisoned, tweeting that she contracted a "stomach virus" before the debate. But "Bombshell" leaves the circumstances around her mystery illness intentionally vague.
"Roger said, 'How dare you have a cup of coffee from a guy you don't know. What are you, crazy?' " Randolph says. "Megyn has a good ear for absurdist details. "
Did Roger Ailes consult Rudy Giuliani for legal advice?
"Bombshell" is a who's who of famous faces, including Malcolm McDowell ("A Clockwork Orange") as Rupert Murdoch, Allison Janney as Ailes' legal counsel Susan Estrich, and Connie Britton ("Nashville") as Ailes' wife, Beth. Then there's "Mad About You" star Richard Kind, who portrays Ailes' longtime friend and confidante Rudy Giuliani. The embattled Ailes asks the politician/attorney how to handle the fallout of his sexual harassment allegations.
"Ailes had three different lawyers who we let Giuliani stand in for," Randolph says. "It shows the degree in which Roger was one of the drivers of the Republican establishment. If you wanted to be a Republican public intellectual, all avenues went through Roger Ailes' office, and that mattered in terms of his ability to prey on young people who had aspirations. "
Was Ailes really known as 'the legs man'?
The film shows a competitive work environment at Fox News for female anchors and producers, many of whom rarely spoke or befriended each other. (Kelly and Carlson, for instance, only share the screen once in passing in an elevator – true to real life, where they worked different shifts and "almost never interacted," Randolph says. )
"Bombshell" also illustrates Ailes' predatory behavior: asking women to spin in front of him during meetings, and demanding that on-air talent wear short skirts to show off their legs. Such scenes were drawn from Kelly's book, as well as Gabriel Sherman's 2014 Ailes biography "The Loudest Voice in the Room" and Sarah Ellison's 2016 expose for Vanity Fair, Randolph says.
"All the women who filed complaints about him who have gone public have been really brave in articulating specifically what happened to them," Randolph says.
The film's most chilling scene is a private meeting between Ailes and Kayla when he pressures her to lift her skirt. The camera lingers on Kayla, near tears, as he orders her to inch it higher and higher, revealing her underwear. By letting the abuse play out in real time, Randolph hopes male viewers, in particular, will feel uncomfortable but also feel greater empathy for victims.
"When you're in the room and you appreciate the intonations and context of it, you can see how it could be utterly life-changing and maddening and complicated for a young woman,' " Randolph says.

Texto completo: PORT CLINTON – A Catawba Island beagle named Oscar is one of the dogs featured in the book "Doctor Dogs" by New York Times bestselling author Maria Goodavage
The book highlights medical alert dogs from around the world. Oscar was abandoned by his previous owner before Deanne "DeeDee" Kramer and her late husband, Bill, adopted him as a walking companion. But Oscar did more than become a walking buddy. He saved their lives.
Bill was struggling with complications from diabetes, which kept sending him to the emergency room several times a month. Finally, his doctor told him he needed to get a dog to help him become more active.
"We couldn't handle a lab," DeeDee said. "And then we heard about Oscar."
Oscar's first rescue came before he had any training. When Bill collapsed from a heart attack, Oscar, barking, ran to DeeDee to let her know. The incident exposed Oscar's intelligence and potential, and the Kramers decided to see if he could be trained as a diabetic alert dog to alert Bill when his blood sugar levels changed. Their search for a trainer eventually brought them to Nick and Tammy Blackford of North Coast K-9, who have offices in Sandusky and Monroeville. Nick, who has been training dogs since 1974, has trained many of the area's police dogs.
Oscar excelled through 500 hours of training, which included Canine Good Citizen, therapy dog, and public access training. His training to detect blood sugar level changes was intensive.
"He had to pass three tests before he could even start scent training," DeeDee said. "It's no different than training a drug dog, because it's all about smell."
To prepare for the training, Bill spit on cotton balls when his sugar was high and when his sugar was low. Nick placed those cotton balls, along with other cotton balls, in containers around the training facility. When Oscar found the right cotton ball, he was rewarded.
As a result, Oscar was able to detect when Bill's sugar changed. If it was high, he pawed on Bill's knees. If it was low, he pushed his nose into Bill's face.
"He was 10 minutes faster than the meter," DeeDee said. "After Oscar got trained, Bill had zero emergency room visits."
After Bill died, DeeDee's mourning kept her from caring for herself the way she normally did, and her hypoglycemia began to worsen. Now, Oscar alerts her when her blood sugar reaches dangerous levels.
"If I'm driving, he'll come from the back of the car and make me pull over," DeeDee said.
Dogs can be trained to respond to medical emergencies in a variety of ways that suit their owners' needs.
"Some are trained to bark so if the person is in another room with the door shut, the dog can still alert them," Nick said.
In addition to helping the Kramers, Oscar detected cancer in DeeDee's friend. The story of that miraculous rescue is recorded in "Doctor Dogs."
"He wasn't even trained for that," DeeDee said.
Oscar also accompanies DeeDee when she volunteers at the Ohio Veterans Home in Sandusky each week. He not only spreads love while he's there, but he also detects blood sugar levels in the veterans he visits.
DeeDee said it's not unusual for beagles to be trained as alert dogs because their ability to smell is so acute.
"Basset hounds are good, too," she said. "But if you want a diabetic alert dog, go to trainer, and they will find one suited to you. Don't just go out and get a puppy."

While Oscar's big eyes can melt hearts, his nose can save lives. Even though he was trained as a diabetic alert dog, he detected cancer in his owner's friend.

Texto completo: The thought first occurred to me five weeks ago, while watching the Oakland Raiders’ pass rush treat Philip Rivers like one of those inflatable pop-up dolls – you know, you keep knocking it down, and it keeps bouncing right back up – on the field at whatever they’re calling the Oakland-Alameda Coliseum these days.
It continued to nag at me during all of these weeks the Chargers have been on the road. It kept coming to mind Sunday, when they returned home to play before what would be conservatively estimated as 70 percent Minnesota Vikings fans, at the same time the Raiders were making their own melancholy farewell appearance in Oakland.
Today then, a few days before the Raiders and a chunk of their immense SoCal fan base play the Chargers in Carson, it’s time for some alternate history.
What would have happened, at that fateful NFL league meeting in January 2016 when Stan Kroenke’s fellow owners approved the Rams’ move to L.A. and his Inglewood stadium project, if those owners had given the Raiders the first option to become Kroenke’s tenant, rather than the Chargers?
We start this musing with an opinion that I’d maintained throughout the two decades of the league’s absence from L.A., when the city was no more than a stalking horse for other owners seeking stadium deals in their own cities: If and when a team finally set up shop here, it would have to deal with that huge segment of fans who refused to abandon the Silver and Black even after Al Davis moved the Raiders back to their ancestral home in 1995.
Those are the people you’ve seen in the Southwest Airlines terminals of area airports on Saturdays (or Sunday mornings) of Raiders home game weekends the last 25 seasons, flying up to the games and flying back afterward. Some are clad in their Black Hole costumes, and I’m guessing TSA employees have to remind themselves: These aren’t security risks, these are Raider fans.
(Feel free to insert your own one-liner here.)
Their commutes will be shorter beginning next season when the Raiders move into the $2 billion Allegiant Stadium near the Las Vegas strip.
But stay with me here: What if the Raiders had wound up in L.A. … and the Chargers had wound up in Vegas, a virgin territory with no previous NFL allegiances beyond monetary ones? It’s not that far-fetched.
From the Raiders’ standpoint, I’m guessing they would have found an immediate home somewhere in SoCal. Probably not the Coliseum, likely not the Rose Bowl, but possibly Dodger or Angel Stadium as a short-term abode. They would have had no trouble filling it with their own loyal (and eccentrically costumed) fans, while the Rams would still have been able to rebuild their SoCal fan base in much the same manner they have. There would be less snark about L.A. as an NFL town, and when the Inglewood stadium was ready the new occupants would be on relatively equal footing.
(You think the Raiders aren’t still strong here? There are still Raider Image stores at Universal Citywalk and in Moreno Valley, and the team’s fan club directory lists nine different booster clubs in SoCal, from Fillmore to Hesperia and including two in San Diego.)
But what of the Chargers?
Before I continue, I am fully aware that this column will likely draw a call or a text from the Chargers’ sharp vice president of public relations, Josh Rupprecht, asking what his franchise did to deserve this, and is it really a bad thing that the Chargers are here? We realize this is considered a long-term project to build a fan base. But three years in, you have to wonder if this market – the most diverse, and fickle, in North America – just might be too tough to crack.
Certainly, people in the NFL offices in New York are noticing. And the reports of friction between the Chargers and Rams involving the new stadium, now a $5 billion (and rising) project, don’t help the optics.
The Las Vegas component will not thrill our friends in San Diego, but consider the history of these moves.
When Mark Davis and the Raiders romanced Las Vegas early in 2016, no more than a couple of weeks after (a) their joint project with the Chargers on a new Carson stadium was shot down and (b) the Chargers got the first option to join Kroenke’s project with a year to exercise it, the man who arranged the Raiders-Vegas talks was Mark Fabiani. That is the same Fabiani who is still listed in the Chargers’ organizational chart as a special counsel to controlling owner Dean Spanos, and the same Fabiani who was in charge of the team’s stadium quest in San Diego.
Also, in many eyes – including these two – it’s the same Fabiani who torpedoed any chance of cooperation between Spanos’ organization and the politicians of San Diego with an uncompromising, hardball negotiating style that ultimately led to a total breakdown of relationships with city officials and the fans themselves. The moment the Chargers began openly seeking other alternatives was the moment the San Diego public began to turn away from Spanos and his team.
Fabiani later signed on as an advisor to Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, and it was through that relationship that Mark Davis was introduced to Adelson and the wheels began to turn toward the Raiders’ move to Nevada.
So, in our alternate history, it is entirely reasonable that having been shut out of L.A., Spanos turns his attention north on I-15, with Fabiani smoothing the way for the Chargers in the same way he made things happen for the Raiders.
Those bridge years might still have been spent in San Diego, and it’s possible the composition of crowds in that city would resemble what they are now in Carson. But Las Vegas would ultimately have been a far more hospitable destination for the Chargers, as a one-team town hungry for football. Spanos would have been a hero, rather than an interloper (as he’s considered by many in L.A.) or villain (in San Diego).
Plus it’s a lot closer than London, where reports earlier this season had the Chargers ultimately landing followed by Spanos’ vehement denial.
Instead, back in the real world, this is what we have: Minnesota Vikings fans dominating Dignity Health Sports Park this past Sunday, just like Green Bay Packers fans before them, and Pittsburgh Steelers fans, Denver Broncos fans, Houston Texans fans and Indianapolis Colts fans before that in 2019. It has to be discouraging for players and coaches who never get to play before a true home crowd.
The move to the bigger SoFi Stadium will not be a panacea – it’s more seats available for opposition fans, if anything – and while there will be an attempt to put the teams on equal footing in the shared stadium, it will be hard to forget that Kroenke is the owner and Spanos is the renter.
Meanwhile, SoCal Raiders fans will continue to flock to LAX, Burbank, Ontario, Long Beach and John Wayne airports to catch flights for their favorite team’s home games, or else will make the drive up I-15. As colleague Mark Whicker once observed, it’ll be like eight more championship fights a year in ‘Vegas.
An example: The New York Times quoted Ruben Maya, a law enforcement officer from Riverside who paid $12,000 for two personal seat licenses and $3,000 for 2020 season tickets for Raiders games in Vegas: “I live a six-hour drive from Oakland, but it’s only a 3-1/2 hour drive to Las Vegas. I’m going to come to every home game the first season.”
And, as has been the case for years, the Raiders’ ninth home game will come on the Chargers’ home field. There will be a preview Sunday afternoon.

Texto completo: Washington • It was, all in all, a fine week for Donald Trump.
Sure, he’s getting impeached. And he is agitated about that, judging by his fandango of self-pitying tweets. And he did lose out to a 16-year-old girl for Time’s Person of the Year, which made him so jealous he couldn’t resist mocking her, amplifying just how big a loser he is.
But on a scale of one to prison, it wasn’t a bad week. His disheveled pal, Boris Johnson, won in a landslide over an unappetizing liberal, which many took as a good harbinger for Trump in 2020.
On the Hill, the party of Faust stuck together and vociferously defended their Apollyon. The most twisted defense was offered by Ken Buck, a Colorado Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, who said that it doesn’t make sense to impeach the president for obstructing Congress because “we were sent here to obstruct this Congress.” It was “a campaign promise.”
Even as Democrats declaimed that their hearings were momentous, many deemed them monotonous. The evening news broadcasts demoted impeachment to their No. 4 story, and no one seemed to move a scintilla in either direction.
I’ve often wondered if Trump was even worthy of impeachment. And now it seems as if he is degrading this process just as he degrades everything else.
As Carl Hulse wrote in The New York Times, “fears are mounting that presidential impeachment might, like the filibuster, become a regular feature of America’s weaponized politics.”
Trump is pretending that his pressure on Ukraine’s president was about fighting corruption when we all know that he fosters corruption. He sins in the saintliest areas. It was just announced that he had to pay $2 million to eight charities after admitting that he diverted funds from his foundation to his campaign and to cover business debts.
We see a constant parade of Washington pooh-bahs like James Comey, Andrew McCabe and John Brennan on cable, sounding the alarm and presenting themselves as the white hats to Trump’s black hat. Retired generals grimace at the president’s impetuous, ego-driven foreign policy.
The left keens that the president is destroying our sacred institutions and jeopardizing our national security. But for many Americans, the events of the last week prove that Trump is right to be cynical about a rigged system and deep-state elites.
The inspector general’s report about the FBI’s Russia investigation offered a hideous Dorian Gray portrait of the once-vaunted law enforcement agency. As Charlie Savage wrote in the Times, the report uncovered “a staggeringly dysfunctional and error-ridden process.” The FBI run by Comey and McCabe was sloppy, deceitful and cherry-picking — relying on nonsense spread by Christopher Steele.
With the stunning and sad “Afghanistan Papers,” The Washington Post revealed what we knew in our hearts: We have spent 18 years and $1 trillion in Afghanistan with generals lying and hiding evidence that the war was unwinnable, just as the generals did in Vietnam. As one general conceded, they did not understand Afghanistan and didn’t have “the foggiest notion” of what they were doing.
Even as President Barack Obama escalated the war, poured in more billions and promised to crack down on corruption, the Post said, the United States looked away and let its allies — the Afghan president, warlords, drug traffickers and defense contractors — wallow in fraud, corruption and dark money.
Then there’s “The Report,” streaming on Amazon: the heroic saga of Daniel Jones, played by Adam Driver. Jones is working for Dianne Feinstein on the Senate Intelligence Committee and spends years compiling a report documenting the CIA’s use of waterboarding and other forms of torture in secret prisons — a barbaric, un-American and ineffective system designed by two creepy psychologists who were paid about $81 million by the CIA.
The movie is not kind to Obama and Denis McDonough, suggesting that they protected the CIA and tried to bury grisly details from the report to fend off criticism that Obama was weak on terrorism. It is also a harsh portrayal of Brennan, MSNBC’s Voice of Morality, who, as CIA director, fought the Senate inquiry so hard that his operatives even clandestinely hacked into the computer network of committee staff members to figure out how they were getting their information.
If this weren’t enough institutional perfidy for one week, we had the Boeing hearing in Congress: A Federal Aviation Administration analysis done after the first deadly crash off the coast of Indonesia showed that the agency knew that if it did not act, the Boeing 737 Max was likely to crash 15 times in the 45 years it was expected to fly, theoretically killing more than 2,900 people. But that wasn’t enough to immediately ground it. The government is supposed to protect us from greedy capitalists, not the other way around.
Unfortunately, this climate of confusion and cynicism allows Trump to prosper. He did not come to Washington to clean up the tainted system; he came to bathe in it.

Own skin in the game

Texto completo: Ben Hanson eagerly got his basement studio ready for one of his weekly gaming podcasts with his friends.
He checked the microphones and the lights, switched on the retro Nintendo 64 so Pokmon battle scenes could play in the background, and made sure the fake fireplace was ablaze to look like some sort of PlayStation shrine complete with a golden controller and mini cartoon figurines along its mantle.
Hanson, along with other former employees who recently left the popular Game Informer magazine, have recently launched their own website, MinnMax. The website, which is completely crowdfunded, offers weekly video podcasts on game industry news, reviews and guest interviews providing an entertaining outlet for serious -- and sometimes not so serious -- discussion of the gaming industry.
"We love games," Hanson said simply, last week after MinnMax hosted its first community meetup.
Hanson, 32, had worked at Game Informer since 2010 as a video producer and helped create videos and podcasts including "The Game Informer Show," for which Hanson was able to travel the world to interview game developers and report on other industry news.
Game Informer, which launched in 1991, has more than 6.5 million paid monthly subscribers and has grown to become the fifth largest consumer print publication in the United States and the largest digital publication in the world, according to its official website. In comparison, the New York Times recently reached paid digital and print subscriptions of 4.7 million.
But in August, as part of parent company GameStop's restructuring, 120 employees across the video game retailer's offices were laid off, including seven of the 38 employed at Minneapolis-based Game Informer. Dallas-area-based GameStop, which has seen its stock drop nearly 70% this year, said in a statement that the changes "were necessary to reduce costs and better align the organization with our efforts to optimize the business."
Andy McNamara, the Game Informer editor-in-chief who has been with the magazine since it launched, wrote in an online post, "I'm saddened by yesterday's news; the Game Informer team means the world to me. You, our readers who have supported us over the years -- mean the world to us. I can't thank them or you enough."
While Hanson avoided the ax, some of his friends and co-workers, including Kyle Hilliard, Jeff Marchiafava, and Suriel Vazquez, weren't as lucky.
"It was very abrupt," Hanson said. "It was a lighting strike out of the blue. … I left because of the manner of which they were laid off."
Hanson, who had helped build Game Informer's studio, said he thought he could build a similar studio on a budget in the basement of the duplex he rents in northeast Minneapolis. He spent the last few months slowly buying microphones, cameras and other technology he needed to equip a spare room in his basement.
He officially left Game Informer and launched MinnMax in late October.
To finance MinnMax, a reference to the gaming term "Min Max" that means to optimize your improvement and get better in the most efficient way possible, Hanson went straight to the gaming community and asked for support on the crowdfunding site Patreon.
Hanson said he estimated that if MinnMax could earn about $4,000 a month it would be sustainable and he could work as the website's full-time video producer and pay his former co-workers and other contributors as contractors.
After launching Oct. 24, MinnMax has attracted more than 1,800 patrons or monthly paid subscribers who contribute close to $10,500 total per month. Donor tiers range from $2 a month -- to be able to submit questions to the MinnMax Show podcast and get access to other exclusives -- to $750 a month for plugs of the donor's or company's name with a message. There's even a tier to allow for an hour of online game play with a MinnMax contributor.
"The community just blew me away with the level of support," Hanson said.
"Thanks for taking the courage to quit Game Informer and start this thing, Ben! I'm sure it's scary, but it's awesome. To hear the four of y'all again is the best," one supporter posted on one of Hanson's Patreon posts. "This feels like being reunited with old friends," another commenter said. "I was shocked to hear that Hanson was leaving the [Game Informer] Show but this is probably the best outcome I could imagine," another wrote.
In the future, MinnMax could consider having corporate sponsors, though the funding being decentralized has allowed MinnMax contributors to enjoy a lot of freedom in what they create, Hanson said. More money would allow Hanson to travel to interview game developers and improve the studio.
MinnMax has a regular weekly lineup of videos including Q&As with interesting figures throughout the gaming industry, gameplay streams and walk-throughs, the flagship MinnMax Show, bonus videos such as reactions to games and, recently launched as an idea from members, MinnSnax, a food review show that will include discussions on Twin Cities eateries. Besides video games, contributors also have begun to discuss traditional board games.
MinnMax helps showcase the gaming industry that exists in Minnesota, which is home to several video and tabletop gaming companies and professional e-sports teams and is the birthplace of one of the most well-known computer games, Oregon Trail, Hanson said.
"There's a lot of really talented voices in the area; we just need somebody to pull them in," Hanson said.
Emily Reese, who has her own podcast about video game music and also hosts a morning show on Jazz 88 FM, has been a guest on MinnMax.
"It's just nice to have that highlight here [in Minnesota]," Reese said. "I think it's cool. Super cool."
Vazquez said he is happy to be involved in MinnMax after he lost his job at Game Informer.
"It's nice to have that outlet to be able to have a voice in the conversation about games and stuff. … It was inspiring to have people say, 'Hey, we miss you on the show,' " he said.
Since being let go, Vazquez, 27, has been doing contract work as well as writing reviews and features and search-engine optimization consultation.
Last week, MinnMax had its first event, a Super Smash Bros. tournament it hosted at Minneapolis brewery Bauhaus Brew Labs. MinnMax also collected toys for children hospitalized at HCMC. About 70 people attended and MinnMax was also able to collect about $3,400 online so far for toys.
To Hanson, the support of the community and the freedom to lead his own website has been amazing.
Hanson, who grew up in New London, Minn., graduated in 2009 from the University of Minnesota with a double major in cinema and media culture and cultural studies and comparative literature with a minor in art before he worked for a community television station and Game Informer.
"Having complete freedom … being able to steer this ship is so refreshing," he said.

Bevin fights back amid criticism over pardons

Texto completo: "There's a boatload of legislators who are all outraged right now who sure advocated the crap out of me for the last four years, including some of the loudest ones."
Matt Bevin Former governor
A defiant Matt Bevin says he would welcome a federal investigation into the controversial last-minute pardons and commutations he issued before leaving the governor's office last week, adding he is convinced that some he pardoned of crimes, including brutal murder, rape and child abuse, are innocent.
"This is going to be very cathartic," Bevin told The Courier Journal Saturday night.
"There's nothing more antiseptic than the truth. And the truth is something that needs to be shined into some corners of the criminal justice system, in this state and in this country."
Bevin even suggested that some of the county prosecutors who are the fiercest critics of his pardons may end up as the ones investigated and prosecuted if federal investigators get involved.
"You will see people subpoenaed, you will see people deposed, you will see people convicted," he predicted.
"If the truth comes out, there will be people involved in this process on the other side of the equation that have very good reason to be very concerned right now. And some of them are the loudest people right now, and for good reason."
Squarely in Bevin's sights are state legislators and prosecutors — including Republican Senate President Robert Stivers — who have called on commonwealth and federal law enforcement to investigate some of his more controversial pardons and commutations.
In his interview with The Courier Journal, the one-term Republican governor insinuated his critics are grandstanding for political gain.
"There's a boatload of legislators who are all outraged right now who sure advocated the crap out of me for the last four years, including some of the loudest ones," Bevin said. "Political opportunism is an interesting thing."
The Courier Journal was the first to reveal the political connections related to one of Bevin's most controversial decisions: Pardoning Patrick Baker two years into his 19-year sentence for killing Donald Mills in a Knox County home invasion and robbery.
In the weekend interview, Bevin initially claimed several times that he didn't know and couldn't remember ever meeting or speaking to Patrick Baker's brother, Eric, who held a campaign fundraiser for Bevin at his Corbin home last year that raised $21,500, state public records show.
The Courier Journal last week reported on Bevin's attendance at the July 26, 2018, fundraiser — including publishing a front-page photo of Bevin and Eric Baker talking at Baker's home. The Courier Journal story included a first-hand account from the publisher of the Corbin newspaper of Bevin having a private meeting with the Baker family.
Asked about the fundraiser again, the former governor then conceded he had spoken to Eric Baker before, "But I don't know if I've spoken to him about this."
Bevin added that he could not remember ever being at the Bakers' home.
The former governor also insisted Baker is an innocent man — despite the outcry over Patrick Baker's pardon from Mills' family, the local prosecutor in the case and those questioning if the political donations played a role.
The real killer, Bevin said, hasn't been fully brought to justice.
"I looked at (the Patrick Baker case) for months and months," said Bevin, adding he had "a lot of conversations" with people about the circumstances of Mills' murder and Baker's trial.
"If you truly care about the truth of that story, among others, stay with it, stay on it, ask a lot of questions," Bevin said. "You'll find a lot of people both inside and outside of Kentucky are very aware of that case."
Bevin questioned testimony in the case from Mills' family members who witnessed the murder, saying the testimony suggested the killer had specific physical characteristics different than that of Patrick Baker.
"The way in which these things have gone down has been a remarkable miscarriage of justice," Bevin said.
"There is little that can be done given the existing criminal justice system to undo that which is wrong. There is an appeals process, but it is almost impossible — not just in Kentucky, but in America — for an innocent person, ever, no matter how existent exonerating information is, to get anybody to overturn something that's incorrect."
Defending other pardons Bevin also defended his pardon of Micah Schoettle, who was convicted of raping a 9-year-old in Kenton County last year and sentenced to 23 years.
Bevin claimed Schoettle is completely innocent because there is no physical, medical or eyewitness evidence against him, adding that "not everything that you are told is true, including in a courtroom."
"Go sit down, talk to (Schoettle), talk to the other people involved, talk to the mother of the daughter, who was involved in the accusation," Bevin said. "You dig into that thing and find out what did or didn't happen."
The mother of the victim in the Schoettle case recounted to the New York Times her outrage when learning about the pardon, saying her family had only recently begun to recover from the trial and "it scares me to think that he knows he got away with it."
Bevin's pardon order for Schoettle stated the case "was investigated and prosecuted in a manner that was sloppy at best."
However, Bevin repeatedly disputed that he cited prosecutorial misconduct in this pardon or any of the other hundreds he issued in his final days, saying "that's something either you're making up or someone's making up."
Bevin responds to Stivers Shortly after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Friday called Bevin's pardons "completely inappropriate," Stivers, the Republican president of the state Senate, called for a federal investigation of Bevin's pardons.
"From what we know of former Gov. Bevin's extreme pardons and commutations, the Senate Republican Majority condemns his actions as a travesty and perversion of justice," Stivers said in a press release.
"Our citizens, and especially the crime victims and their families, deserve better."
Asked about the comments from McConnell and Stivers, Bevin said his two Republican critics did not provide any specifics about what wrongdoing he was guilty of, adding that such "broad categorizations make for good press releases, make for good tabloid fodder."
"People like that, they'll never give you specifics," Bevin said. "He'll express outrage, but over what? Specifically, what is the outrage based on?"
Asked about Bevin's comments, Stivers on Sunday stood by his concerns and call for a federal investigation, particularly the circumstances surrounding the pardon of Patrick Baker.
"It has an appearance that calls for individuals to look into the case," said Stivers, citing the overwhelming evidence in the case, "the photos you've seen" of Bevin and Patrick Baker at the campaign fundraiser and "the inconsistencies in the pardons of one but not all three," as two accomplices in the crime are still in jail.
Bevin strongly denied that families of inmates who got meetings or special access to the former governor got preferential treatment.
"People can agree with me, disagree with me, like me, not like me," Bevin said. "I have never in four years done anything based on a political or financial calculation. Never. It's just not how I operate."
Bevin's pardon process In the Courier Journal interview, Bevin said he alone went through all of the pardon and commutation applications and made the determinations of who was worthy of one, writing all of the orders himself.
He added he would also ask for feedback on certain cases from public advocates and officials in the Kentucky Justice and Public Safety Cabinet.
The former governor said he would listen to cases for pardons made by anyone, including legislators, people on this team and "people who might come up to me at a Lincoln Day dinner and say, 'Hey, you know, what about this, that or the other person.'"
"I'll listen to anybody," Bevin said. "Believe me, I talked to people out the wazoo. I'll take anyone's opinion on something."
Bevin also said he had "absolute confidence" that everyone he pardoned would not have a serious future run-in with the law.
"I can't predict the future, but... I'm as confident about these folks as I am about you or me or somebody that passes me on the street next," he said.

Texto completo: Award-winning New York Times bestselling author Karen Abbott adds to her popular lineup of historical nonfiction with "The Ghosts of Eden Park" – a surprising memoir of the life and times of George Remus, the 1920s teetotaling opportunist whose skyrocketing rise to "King of the Bootleggers" during Prohibition would end in tragedy.
An instant New York Times bestseller, Indie Next pick, Amazon best book of August, and a top fall title for both Newsweek and Publishers Weekly, the book is as important for its historical worth (many of the characters in this real-life saga have been practically wiped off the historical map of America's past) as for its entertainment value.
Abbott's work has also appeared in the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, Smithsonian Magazine, and other publications. Her previous books include "Sin in the Second City," "American Rose," and "Liar Temptress Soldier Spy."
A native of Philadelphia, she now lives in New York.
Tell me how you first learned about George Remus's true story, and why it caught your attention and inspired you to write "Ghosts of Eden Park."
I usually get my ideas by perusing old archives and out-of-print books, but this one came through television – specifically the show "Boardwalk Empire," which aired on HBO for five seasons. There was a minor character named George Remus. He spoke of himself in the third person and stole every scene he was in. I wondered if Remus was a real person, and indeed he was! His real story was much more dramatic than the show's portrayal, with a sordid love triangle, a devastating betrayal, a murder, and a sensational trial.
The real Remus also spoke of himself in the third person: "This is going to be a hell of a Christmas for Remus"; "Remus has been betrayed by everyone he had trusted"; and my favorite: "Remus's brain exploded."
In all my years of researching history, I have never come across a more interesting, bizarre, and brazenly outlandish character. He was an impoverished, abused German immigrant kid who, through determination and savvy, became the most successful bootlegger in American history. Within a year of launching his operation, he owned 35 percent of all the liquor in the United States – an astonishing figure. Newspapers at the time compared him to Vanderbilt and Rockefeller.
At the height of Prohibition, Remus lived an "outrageous" lifestyle on many levels, using his background as both pharmacist and lawyer to game the system. Can you give us an example about Remus's story that you would say proves the old saying that "truth is stranger than fiction?"
Remus is said to be a real-life inspiration for Jay Gatsby, mainly because of his lavish parties. The most famous was his 1921 New Year's Eve party, when he unveiled his brand-new Greco-Roman bath, built for $175,000. At one end stood a variety of Turkish and Swedish needle baths, a style and pressure for every taste, and even electric baths – an early version of a tanning bed, heated by incandescent lights and said to make the user "frisky." Remus's glamorous wife, Imogene, put on a daring one-piece and executed a perfect dive. Remus handed out party favors: diamond stickpins and watches for the men, 1922 cars for the women, and a $1,000 bill tucked under everyone's plate. In a gesture emblematic of the times, one what would be remembered in awe decades later, Remus lit guests' cigars with $100 bills. All this in an era when the average annual salary was about $1,200.
Mabel Walker Willebrandt has been called "the most powerful woman in the country" at the time when she became the assistant attorney general of the United States in 1921 and took on the challenging task of enforcing the National Prohibition Act, which prohibited the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages. Tell us about her role in this story.
When President Warren Harding appointed Willebrandt to be the assistant attorney general of the United States, she, along with all other adult female citizens, had only had the right to vote for nine months. She was 32 years old, only five years out of law school, and had never prosecuted a single criminal case – and yet suddenly she was in charge of the thousands of Prohibition cases that began piling up in the courts, including cases against Remus.
To add to the pressure of her job, she had a serious hearing problem, and spent an hour every morning styling her hair to conceal her hearing aids. She was almost inhumanly tough and thick-skinned, qualities that were reinforced by the ice-cold bath she took every morning. Her favorite saying was: "Life has few petted darlings" – and she didn't consider herself one of them. Her formative childhood event: She once bit a pet cat's ear. To teach her a lesson, her father bit her ear back. During her time, she was the most powerful and the most famous woman in the country, and I couldn't believe she'd be so lost to history.
Your astounding research for this book made it possible for you to complete it with "no invented dialogue," thanks to government files, archives, diaries, letters, newspaper articles, books and hearing and trial transcripts, as you listed in your Author's Note. Tell me about this extraordinary investigation and why this level of accuracy of detail was so important to you.
A confession: I have never had so much fun researching a book. When I discovered that the Yale University Law Library possessed a 5,500-page trial transcript, I immediately set out for New Haven. Nearly every page was a treasure trove – all of the details I would need to recreate conversations and craft scenes. I found incredibly intimate details about Remus. For example, he didn't like to wear underwear, which in the 1920s was considered evidence of an unsound mind. It took me four months to go through the trial transcript and compose an outline, which amounted to 85,000 words – nearly as long as the finished book itself.
George Remus's wife, Imogene, fell in love with Franklin Dodge, the very Prohibition agent who put her husband in jail. Who was Imogene, and was she truly in love with Agent Dodge?
Imogene Remus was a classic villain: greedy, conniving, duplicitous – qualities for which she was roundly denigrated and punished. As awful as she was, a man who'd engaged in similar misdeeds likely would have gotten away with them. I think she was aware of this double standard and that it fueled her rebellion. She was the epitome of what the New York Times called the "middle-aged flapper," defined as one who yearns to escape from a monotonous routine and seeks independent adventures.
When Imogene met Remus, she was going through a nasty divorce, supporting herself and her young daughter by working as a "dust girl" in Remus's law office. She'd had a difficult life, and here was this brilliant, doting man who was poised to make millions as a bootlegger.
She was full partners with Remus before she turned on him, and she used all that knowledge to fortify her relationship with Dodge. Trial witnesses testified about Imogene and Dodge's flirtatious phone calls, about their afternoon rendezvous in speakeasys, and about their plans to hire a hitman to kill Remus.
I don't know if Imogene and Dodge were truly in love, but they definitely shared a common goal: to steal Remus's fortune and ruin his life.

Texto completo: "Children of Virtue and Vengeance" (Henry Holt and Co., 416 pp., ) is the highly anticipated sequel to "Children of Blood and Bone," the first book of Tomi Adeyemi's West African-inspired fantasy trilogy, Legacy of Orïsha. Famously, "Children of Blood and Bone" netted the now-26-year-old Adeyemi a seven-figure advance, one of the biggest in the history of young adult fiction. Quickly after that, Fox 2000 picked up the film rights. As of now, "Children of Blood and Bone" has been on The New York Times best-seller list for more than 34 weeks, and has spent 20 weeks on the USA TODAY Best-Selling Books list.
The dynamics of power, corruption and identity are further explored in "Virtue and Vengeance." Where "Blood and Bone" explores how persecuted minorities find ways to retain their culture, "Virtue and Vengeance" places that minority on an equal playing field with their oppressors overnight. The characters are forced to rethink what they know about their culture and exactly who gets to own it.
The first book follows Zélie, her brother Tzain and runaway princess Amari in a quest to return magic to the land of Orïsha, where the maji people who formerly had powers are being ruthlessly persecuted by the monarchy. The monarchy chases the trio as well as Amari's brother, Prince Inan, who also discovers he has powers and a special bound to Zélie. Unlike Zélie, Inan sees his magic as curse rather than a blessing, especially under the rule of his father, who sees the maji only as "maggots."
At the end of "Blood and Bone," Zeilie, Tzain and Amari return magic to the lands of Orïsha, and the once-powerless majis now have the magic they had lost, and with it a desire to reclaim their culture that had nearly been wiped out.
Yet, the majis are not the only ones who wake up with powers. The ruling class also discover they have new powers and even more reason to wipe out the majis for good. And that includes the genocidal queen of Orïsha, Nehanda, who now takes her husband's place on the throne after he is killed by his daughter Amari at the end of "Blood and Bone."
Peace has never been more fragile. The book grapples with the idea of compromise when unspeakable violence has been committed against a group of people who are now returning such violence with a vengeance. The central conflict of the story is the war between the monarchy and the newly empowered maji, but the discord starts in the intimate bonds among the main characters, with characters' actions rippling out from the personal to acts of war.
Adeyemi expands on the strengths of the first book and raises the stakes in both friendships and in war, challenging the loyalties that were strongly cemented in "Blood and Bone." (though some relationships, especially the romances, feel underdeveloped and rushed). "Virtue and Vengeance" also introduces characters and revives old ones, revealing more difficult questions about redemption, power and reparations. Adeyemi does not pull any punches relating the horrors of genocide and war, yet her books still maintain a spirit of fantasy and adventure without her message losing its impact.
It builds to an ending that leaves the reader with a feeling that can only be described as dread. The dread is not a negative point, but adds scope to the series and more complexity to the theme of identity. Adeyemi writes a mean cliffhanger and successfully upends expectations.
The last chapter will undoubtedly leave fans shaking with questions until the final installment of the trilogy is published.

Black Women Reign At Beauty Pageants

Texto completo: When Zozibini Tunzi was named Miss Universe on Sunday, it signified the first time that black women had simultaneously held the top prize in four of the major beauty pageants.
When Zozibini Tunzi of South Africa was named Miss Universe on Sunday, her crowning signified a milestone: the first year that four of the major beauty pageants had simultaneously awarded the top prize to a black woman.
Pageants have long been criticized for their antiquated beauty standards and, in many cases, outright racism or gender stereotyping. Last year, the Miss America Organization announced it would scrap both the swimsuit and evening gown portions of the competition. And while black women have been winners in the past -- notably Vanessa Williams, who in 1984 was the first black woman to be named Miss America -- they have never been as successful as this year.
Supporters of the women -- Ms. Tunzi, Cheslie Kryst (this year's Miss USA), Kaliegh Garris (Miss Teen USA) and Nia Franklin (Miss America) -- say the recognition sends a powerful message that today's beauty standards are evolving beyond Barbie-lite, or an era when contestants were prized solely for smooth hair, light skin color and thin lips.
"Finally the universe is giving value to black skin," read an Instagram post from Leila Lopes, a former Miss Angola who was crowned Miss Universe in 2011. Oprah also praised Ms. Tunzi for her leadership. But perhaps the new Miss Universe put it best in her closing address on Sunday night.
"I grew up in a world where a woman who looks like me, with my kind of skin and my kind of hair, was never considered beautiful," she told the rapt crowd. "I think it is time that stops today. I want children to look at me and see my face. And I want them to see their faces reflected in mine."
Hilary Levey Friedman, a visiting professor of education at Brown University who is writing a book about beauty pageants, said a new definition of what it means to be a pageant winner was being embraced in this era when questions of equality and inclusion are increasingly urgent.
"The idea of what we think is beautiful has expanded," she said. "Skin color. Body type. Curly hair. If you look at all this year's winners, they look like themselves."
This is a far cry from 1968, when women protested outside the Miss America pageant in Atlantic City. Throwing girdles, bras and false eyelashes, they denounced the fact that the pageant had not had a black finalist since its inception in 1921. That night, black women participated in their own pageant several blocks away.
Saundra Williams was crowned Black Miss America at that event, telling The New York Times: "With my title, I can show black women that they too are beautiful, even though they have large noses and thick lips. There is a need to keep saying this over and over because for so long none of us believed it."
Since then, pageant standards have slowly evolved, even as the events' purpose has increasingly been called into question. Black women have also continued to remain severely underrepresented in corporate America and Congress.
Dr. Levey Friedman, who is white and whose mother, Pamela Eldred, was named Miss America for 1970, said that in researching her coming book, "Here She Comes: The Tarnished Reign of the Beauty Pageant in America," she found that the number of women of color participating in beauty pageants was on the rise.
According to her research, few to no women of color were represented in the Miss USA pageant before the 1990s. Then Carole Gist won Miss USA in 1990, and Janel Bishop won Miss Teen USA in 1991. By the 2000s, Dr. Levey Friedman said, the number of contestants of color had risen to double digits each year. She said she expected the trend to continue.
"So many people have the stereotype that beauty queens are blond, have light eyes and a Barbie doll body," she said. "Now you don't have to look like Barbie. There are different versions of beauty and they are being accepted."

Join HK kids in protesting Chinese tyranny

Texto completo: As the largest protests in weeks rocked Hong Kong last Sunday, with hundreds of thousands filling downtown streets, I was struck by the simple statement from Alice Wong, 24, a biology researcher, a protester among the many in the city’s Victoria Park: “We don’t want to become like China.”
That’s it. Well, she also told a New York Times reporter the obvious intertwined truth in what the mostly young constant demonstrators are after: “We want Hong Kong to continue being Hong Kong.”
That is, she wants her city-state, the former British colony, to continue being culturally Chinese in the broader sense of the diaspora, in the way that Singapore is Chinese — but not; that vast parts of Kuala Lumpur are Chinese — but not; that, well, Arcadia is Chinese — but not.
A heritage, common tongues, an entrepreneurial bent — but without the snooping authoritarian leadership with which the Communist Party has merely replaced the ancient Chinese landlord class in a political system that is anything but communal.
If the plutocrats in Beijing were smart about it, were able to let go of their manic goal of roping all the billions of Chinese peoples in the world into one system, they would realize letting Hong Kong be Hong Kong — letting Taiwan be Taiwan, for that matter — would be by far the best thing for the Mainland as well. That way they don’t have to move toward systems like those in HK and Taipei and Singapore that are mildly democratic, with a few more civil liberties. They can let the broader Chinese nation let off a little steam of freedom without becoming more open themselves.
Instead, the People’s Republic has to control all things in the territories of its growing empire, even if that means putting a million Uighur Muslims in concentration camps.
I wish I could say that it was remotely possible to foresee a successful end game in the Hong Kong kids’ mass marches. But I can’t. As there’s something in a scorpion’s nature that leads it to sting, there’s something in Beijing’s emperors that won’t broach dissent. Sooner or later they’ll send in the People’s Army to put down the actual people.
But it’s not just Chinese people Beijing wants to control. It’s the rest of us, too.
Pasadena lawyer Rob O’Brien, President Trump’s new national security advisor, came back to town last week to speak at a defense forum.
Outside it, he gave an interview to NPR from which I was very happy to find he’s leading the administration’s anti-China world domination wing by detailing the dangers of other nations allowing the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei to build the internet’s new 5G networks:
“So every medical record, every social media post, every email, every financial transaction, and every citizen of the country with cloud computing and artificial intelligence can be sucked up out of Huawei into massive servers in China,” O’Brien told NPR.
Inside the meeting, he kept up the theme, telling defense industry and military officials: “This isn’t a theoretical threat.”
It’s not. And, as if in some over-the-top parody of international bad guys, China’s leaders are coming after your kids, too. TikTok, that latest fad you don’t understand, is the most-downloaded app this year, featuring 15-second videos mostly shared by young people. Here’s how Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, puts it: “A company compromised by the Chinese Communist Party knows where your children are, knows what they look like, what their voices sound like, what they’re watching and what they share with each other.” If that sounds like a real-life “The Man in the High Castle” world, then I suggest we join the HK kids, and protest.

Texto completo: The Democratic National Committee announced the next set of primary debates. One will be held in each of the early-voting states.
Democratic presidential candidates will debate four times in January and February as the party's opening quartet of nominating contests approaches, the Democratic National Committee said Thursday.
The committee laid out a packed schedule of debates, caucuses and primaries for early next year, announcing debates in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, the first states to vote. In February alone, there will be seven days with marquee political events -- either debates or the contests themselves.
The party is facing the possibility of an unprecedented scheduling conflict: If President Trump is impeached, a Senate trial early in 2020 could force some of the candidates to stay in Washington.
"If a conflict with an impeachment trial is unavoidable, the D.N.C. will evaluate its options and work with all the candidates to accommodate them," the committee said in a statement.
The D.N.C. did not say Thursday how it would determine which candidates would qualify for the next set of debates. It has ratcheted up its polling and fund-raising standards for the six debates this year, beginning with a low threshold that resulted in 20 candidates qualifying for the first two debates and gradually raising the bar.
The debates announced on Thursday will be divided among familiar television networks, including ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC. But for the first time in the 2020 race, a pair of major technology companies signed on as sponsors, too. Apple News will co-host a debate in Manchester, N.H., on Feb. 7 with ABC News, and Twitter will partner with CBS News and the Congressional Black Caucus for a Feb. 25 event in Charleston, S.C.
Absent from the sponsorship list was Facebook, whose role in allowing disinformation to proliferate in the 2016 race has been criticized by some leading Democrats.
The inclusion of Apple and Twitter could create an awkward dynamic for candidates who have made stricter regulation of the tech industry a component of their campaign platforms. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, for instance, has called for Apple to be broken apart. And some candidates have faulted Twitter for what they see as lax policies toward political speech and unfounded rumors.
Moderators for the debates -- a plum assignment that can be the subject of much internal jockeying at TV networks -- have not yet been announced. The debate in Des Moines on Jan. 14 will be hosted by CNN and The Des Moines Register. NBC News, MSNBC and The Nevada Independent are hosting a Feb. 19 debate in Las Vegas.
In a sign of intense interest in the presidential contest, all four of the early 2020 debates are scheduled for weeknights. In past election years, networks had sought to stage some debates on weekends, to avoid pre-empting lucrative prime-time programming. This time around, politics is a big television draw.
Viewership has been strong for this year's debates, with the first installment in June, a two-night event in Miami, seen by a record audience for a televised Democratic matchup. Since then, the ratings have waned, though network executives expect them to rebound as the critical early contests approach.
Only seven candidates are set to take the stage for a debate next Thursday in Los Angeles sponsored by PBS and Politico, the smallest lineup of 2019. An additional candidate, Senator Kamala Harris, had qualified but dropped out of the race last week.
The party's schedule for the first two months of 2020, including debates, primaries and caucuses, is here:
Tuesday, Jan. 14: A debate in Des Moines, hosted by CNN and The Des Moines Register at Drake University.
Monday, Feb. 3: The Iowa caucuses.
Friday, Feb. 7: A debate in Manchester, N.H., hosted by ABC News, WMUR and Apple News at St. Anselm College.
Tuesday, Feb. 11: The New Hampshire primary.
Wednesday, Feb. 19: A debate in Las Vegas, hosted by NBC News, MSNBC and The Nevada Independent.
Saturday, Feb. 22: The Nevada Democratic caucuses.
Tuesday, Feb. 25: A debate in Charleston, S.C., hosted by CBS News, the Congressional Black Caucus Institute and Twitter at the Gaillard Center.
Saturday, Feb. 29: The South Carolina Democratic primary.

Resumen: Is Iran’s power waning in Iraq? Popular resentment toward Iranian overreach is growing, as the violence at a Najaf shrine showed.

Texto completo: Outside the charred walls of a shrine complex here is ample evidence of the ferocity of a dayslong battle mounted by Iraqi protesters, convinced they were targeting a symbol of Iranian power in Iraq.
Molotov cocktails that failed to explode – their blackened fuses stuffed into bottles of gasoline or spirits – lie scattered amid a carpet of stones, bricks, and broken glass.
They were thrown by men who first stormed and torched the nearby Iranian consulate Nov. 27, chanting “Iran out of Iraq” – the first of three attacks on that building in a week.
Then they moved to the shrine, their anger fueled by rumors of an Iranian intelligence presence at this vast mausoleum, built to deify Ayatollah Mohammad Bakr al-Hakkim, leader of an Iraqi opposition group created by Iran in the 1980s.
“Iran takes all our resources, our funding, our freedom,” charges one protester, explaining why he and others fought at the complex. Beside him, a student, Zain, holds three pieces of metal shot extracted from his bandaged forehead.
“For sure, the protests will help lower this negative Iranian influence,” says Hamed, another young participant.
The protests that have shaken Iraq are first about removing a corrupt, entrenched sectarian system of rule that has failed to provide jobs, services, or hope since the U.S. military removed Saddam Hussein in 2003.
But Iran’s outsize influence has also been a growing target of Iraqis resentful toward what they regard as Iranian arrogance. Tehran’s overt meddling in Iraqi politics is seen as enabling a weak government as well as the rise of dozens of Shiite militias and their parties, which analysts say are corruptly engaged in every aspect of Iraq’s economy.
As a result goodwill toward Iran has been falling from its high of 2014, when Iran’s immediate military assistance and advisers – orchestrated by Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard’s elite Qods Force – were instrumental in stopping the advance by Islamic State (ISIS) militants.
Portraits of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have been defaced and torched. Across southern Iraq, offices of Shiite militias most closely associated with Iran have also been attacked.
Analysts say Iranian   overreach has undermined Tehran’s influence, ambitions, and the popularity of its proxy forces in Iraq. The erosion coincides with another taking place in Lebanon, where veteran fighters of the Shiite organization Hezbollah are questioning their role fighting Iran’s wars in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen.
“If I were in Ayatollah Khamenei’s position, I would put Soleimani in jail,” says Hisham al-Hashemi, a Baghdad-based   security analyst with the European Institute of Peace who advises the Iraqi government.
“He failed in the mission. Iraq should be the last front line [of defense] for the Iranians,” says Mr. Hashemi. Iran’s influence in elections last year and General Soleimani brokering the government that resigned in late November under pressure, he says, means that “Iran achieved lots of things in 2018. But all that it won it has lost in 2019.”
The conversion of the Shiite militias, collectively known as the Popular Mobilization Forces, from fighting ISIS to waging political war as parties last year, meant the PMF “didn’t realize it had become part of the corruption.” But ordinary Iraqis saw it.
“They became like the gods of the temple, and see themselves as sacred people,” Mr. Hashemi says of the PMF. “Without Iran, they wouldn’t be so much in control. The problem is not with Iran, but with the proxies. People are attacking Iran because their proxies mistreated them.”
The Trump administration a week ago issued sanctions on three senior Iraqi militia chiefs, saying they acted under Iranian orders when cracking down violently on Iraqi protests.
Iran’s declining numbers Even by 2018, Iraqis’ attitudes toward Iran were shifting, with polls indicating that those holding favorable views had declined from nearly 90% in 2015 to fewer than 50%. Those who view Iran as a threat to Iraqi sovereignty shot up from 25% in 2016 to 58% in 2018.
Those views have been magnified by the publishing last month of 700 Iranian intelligence reports by The Intercept and The New York Times, detailing Iran’s systematic and successful efforts to co-opt Iraqi leaders, cultivate former CIA informants, and infiltrate every aspect of Iraqi life.
Part of the backlash has played itself out in the attacks on Iranian consulates of Najaf and Karbala – cities with close ties to the Islamic Republic that welcome millions of Shiite pilgrims each year, many from Iran, to visit the shrines of Shiite Islam’s two most important seventh-century saints.
“For sure Iran had a positive stance against ISIS, but it came at a cost,” says Ali Hussein Aboud al-Dhuwayhir, a local activist and head of the Al-Rafidaein Society for Human Rights in Najaf.
He cites Iranian officials speaking as if Iraq were an asset of Iran. Among them, in a speech last April, Hassan Abbasi, a strategist and former Revolutionary Guard officer, said that for every dollar Iran had spent in Iraq and Syria fighting ISIS, “it is now returning $1,000” in contracts.
“In the current government we see the influence of Iran, and Soleimani comes and gives orders like we have no sovereignty,” says Mr. Dhuwayhir.
“Let me ask this question: Can we put any picture of Iraqi politicians or religious figures in Iran, or hold the flag of Iraq in Imam Reza’s shrine [in Mashhad, Iran]? No,” he says, referring to the ubiquitous Iranian flags and portraits of Iranian clerics across Shiite areas of Iraq.
“We can see and are sure that Iraq is about to become a suburb of Iran,” says Mr. Dhuwayhir. “All these things have created hatred against Iran and anyone affiliated with them. ... Because of the bloodshed, there is no way back.”
Video of one nighttime battle at the shrine and prayer complex dedicated to Ayatollah Hakkim, head of the Iran-backed Badr Brigade militia, shows the shrine’s defenders firing heavily amid flames, as the protester recording the scene shouts: “They [the gunmen] are coming from the grave of al-Hakkim, the Iranian!”
Another online video shows one man shouting during the battle: “These people killed our sons! We want revenge.”
“Talking and gossip” Fueling the bloodshed in Najaf were rumors about Iranian use of the sprawling Hakkim complex, which includes the vaulted shrine chamber itself, a mammoth marble mosque, and extensive seminary grounds still under construction.
One rumor was that the complex hosted a secret center for Iranian intelligence. Another was that Mr. Soleimani himself was inside. Or, at the very least, protesters say, captured demonstrators had been imprisoned in the basement.
Hassan al-Hakkim, vice president of the Shahid Al-Mihrab Foundation, which runs the complex, dismissed the rumors as “talking and gossip.”
On a tour of the complex a week after the fight, only one assault rifle is evident, the smell of burning still hanging in the air.
Like many political families in Iraq, the Hakkims maintain their own militia. Dozens of young Iraqi men wearing black balaclavas, to mask their identity during a rare visit by a foreigner, sit anxiously on mattresses laid all around the gilt, ornate cage that encloses the ayatollah’s coffin.
There were no Iranians inside during the battles, they say, adding that they were waiting for a new attack by those bent on turning the legitimate grievances of Iraqi protests into an anti-Iran wave.
Mr. Hakkim, speaking by phone from northern Iraq, says the rumors were meant to tarnish the reputation of the center, which is “just a school” that does charity work and feeds 20,000 “people in need.” But local anger has been developing over the project’s scale saying it appears to portray the late ayatollah as on par with the 12 recognized Shiite imams.
“They managed to create this constant irritation for locals, even locals who are close to them,” says one Najaf native in Baghdad whose grandfather’s house is 100 yards from the Najaf complex. “It was an irritation that was created by the Hakkims out of arrogance.”
Noticing corruption He also notes a shift among Iraqis away from sectarianism, such that by 2014 Iraqi Shiites were asking why Shiite-dominated governments had done so little for them.
After ISIS’s defeat, people found corruption and lack of services, and the emergence of a “new class of nouveau riche” that was “heavily associated” with the PMF, says the Najaf man.
“So people are beginning to realize how much corruption is around,” he adds. “This is where the anti-Iranian sentiment mainly comes from.”
Is that a blow to Iran?
“At the politician level, if you drank the Iranian Kool-Aid, then it really doesn’t matter,” says one Iraqi official in Baghdad, who asked not to be named. “But if you’ve got Iraqi nationalism in your blood, and you’re looking to better this country, then, yeah, you would see this as Iranian overreach.”

What Are Young People Doing? Don't Ask

Texto completo: Taylor Lorenz, who writes about internet culture, explains how she keeps her finger on the pulse.
How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Taylor Lorenz, an internet culture reporter, discussed the tech she's using.
You often write about what young people are doing with tech. (O.K. boomer !) What tools do you use to keep your finger on the pulse?
I spend a lot of time on social media. I'm on Twitter pretty consistently throughout the day to keep up with breaking news and what people are talking about. I also spend a great deal of time on Instagram and YouTube.
On Instagram, I create tons of boards of different things I come across on the Explore tab that I think are interesting. I have several Instagram accounts just for lurking. On YouTube I watch a lot of YouTuber vlogs, recap shows including Philip DeFranco's and drama/tea channels to keep up with the stuff people are talking about.
I'm in a lot of Telegram groups and Discord servers for different meme pages and influencers. I also spend time in Facebook groups about celebrity news and pop culture. My favorite podcast is "Who? Weekly," and I've gotten tips on stories from its Facebook group. Before I go to bed, I usually spend an hour (or more) on TikTok.
In addition to social media, I subscribe to a bunch of great newsletters that help keep me in the loop on things I may have missed. I love Casey Newton's The Interface and this automated one I get of the top links from Hacker News. I am a big Business Insider reader, and it just started a newsletter about the business of the influencer world, which I'm excited about.
I also cruise around a site called Product Hunt every week or so to check out new apps and platforms. I'll sign up for pretty much anything with a login page, and I love talking to product people about what they're building, so Product Hunt is great for finding people like that. It's also just a great community.
So that's how you stay on top of what young people are doing?
One thing I never, ever do is start with the premise "What are young people doing?" I always start with an interesting user behavior, or trend, or meme I see emerging, and look at why it's being expressed in a certain way or how it evolved.
For instance, I would never ask, "What new memes are middle schoolers sharing?" But I might observe a new meme format emerging on Instagram Explore, like niche memes, then interview people on what it is about that particular format that allows them to express themselves in a better way, or what emotions it allows them to communicate better, or what tools they're using and how they could be improved. The fact that mostly middle and high schoolers are the ones sharing niche memes is relevant, but somewhat secondary.
I also don't think young people are the only ones using the internet in new, interesting and creative ways. Probably because I'm in my 30s, I've been really interested lately in the ways parents use tech to connect with one another and just generally parent culture online. For instance, I recently wrote about how pineapples became a meme in the world of in vitro fertilization, and the struggles of parenting a teenage social media star.
What do you do with TikTok?
Honestly, the videos on there are hilarious and super addicting. What you do is essentially sit and watch an endless stream of entertaining videos until you get tired. TikTok also has commenting, messaging and live streaming, so you can engage in those aspects of the app as well.
Part of what makes TikTok so compelling is the "For You" page, which the app opens on. TikTok uses artificial intelligence to anticipate what type of videos you're most likely to engage with, and feeds you a steady stream of that content. This technology has been so effective that the app's owner, Bytedance, a Chinese tech conglomerate, was forced to introduce anti-addiction measures in the Chinese version of the app.
What is the most annoying internet trend?
I'm not sure if this counts as a trend, but I would say the harassment that I and many women in particular deal with online, especially on Twitter, is the most annoying thing.
I believe it's directly tied to the broader trend of people spending more time in closed, moderated spaces, like Facebook groups, group chats, subreddits and so on. I think that shift is a natural consequence of these large, open social networks' failure to create a safer experience for their users.
When you're not working, what tech are you obsessed with?
I don't ever have the latest gadget or iPhone, and my apartment is largely devoid of tech aside from my Apple TV.
I did recently re-buy an old-school Tamagotchi. I kind of wanted to take care of something and I can't get a pet, so I raised a couple of little Tamagotchi animals for a few weeks, which was fun. I feel like there's a big trend around nostalgia tech right now. I got the idea to buy a Tamagotchi from YouTube.
Aside from that, I don't really use tech if I'm fully off the clock. I like to spend time outside or watching horror movies. I watch three or four horror movies a week, and I love Shudder, which is like a horror-only Netflix. It's pretty much the only time I don't check my phone.
In Tech We're Using, Times journalists give us a peek into the technology they love and use for work and life.

Texto completo: ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published.
Video and audio recorded by government surveillance cameras, cell phones, and police body cameras have emerged as a powerful force in accountability journalism.
ProPublica’s release of an audio tape of wailing children separated from their parents at the border last year was so emotionally wrenching, it prompted President Donald Trump to halt one of his signature policies. Our forensic analysis of videos shot in Charlottesville and elsewhere spurred federal prosecutions of four white supremacists who had brutally beaten counter-protestors. We obtained audio that revealed leaders of a heart transplant unit in Newark, New Jersey had kept a vegetative patient alive for more than a year to avoid a federal review of their survival rates. Our story sparked a federal investigation.
The public interest arguments for publishing such material are unassailable. But the handling of such recordings, which may reveal victims of violence or a person’s most intimate and desperate moments, raise ethical issues that journalism has only begun to grapple with.
We faced such a question last week after Robert Moore, a reporter working for ProPublica, obtained cellblock video of the final hours of Carlos Gregorio Hernandez Vasquez, a 16-year-old Guatemalan migrant who died in a Border Patrol holding cell. The video was unquestionably newsworthy, revealing for the first time that Border Patrol officials had not told the truth about a key aspect of Carlos’ death. (The agency said Carlos had been found “unresponsive” during an early-morning welfare check. The tape showed it was his cellmate who awoke, noticed that Carlos wasn’t moving, and summoned Border Patrol officers.)
An array of news organizations, elected officials, advocacy groups and lawyers for Carlos’ family immediately posted links to the ProPublica video, which had been edited into a visual investigation that walked viewers through not only Carlos’ final hours but the layout of the facility where he was held and the discrepancies in the official Border Patrol account. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus issued a statement demanding that the Department of Homeland Security release its investigation of the death, saying “the federal government lying about the death of a minor in their custody is unacceptable and requires immediate and further investigations into the personnel involved in these decisions.’’
The day after the story was published, lawyers for the family announced that they were taking down their link to the video investigation and they urged news organizations to remove the video. “Carlos is a beloved child of his family,’’ they wrote. “His life is not just a story or an example of the U.S. government’s abuses.’’
The lawyers said the widespread sharing of the video had deepened the family’s suffering. And they shared a statement from the family: “It’s been really painful for our family to lose Carlos. We thought that not knowing what happened to him in that cell, whether he was all alone when he died, whether it was preventable, that we don’t know if we can hold the people responsible accountable— that that was the worst grief we could have, but having all these people watching him die on the internet is something we couldn’t have imagined in a movie or a nightmare.”
The lawyers acknowledged that “a free press is critical to the functioning of democracy.’’ But they said that everyone involved in circulating the video, themselves included, had “erred in compounding the trauma our government has already inflicted.’’
The finer points of journalism ethics are more oral tradition than clear written guidelines. Over the past several days, I’ve spoken with colleagues at leading news organizations and within the ProPublica newsroom about this case. It is clear there is no consensus on how such issues should be handled.
Editors and reporters at ProPublica spent considerable time before the story appeared weighing how we could limit the pain we might cause the family while also fulfilling our mission to expose abuses of power.
A ProPublica reporter, who speaks Spanish, described the video to Carlos’ father, who lives in Guatemala, and to a close family member, and told them that ProPublica would be publishing it. During a 25-minute phone conversation, the father expressed his hope that the video would bring out the truth about his son’s death. The other relative asked to see the video before we published it and expressed concern about Carlos’ death being broadcast across the internet. We edited the video with that mind, fast-forwarding through the most graphic scenes.
As the family pointed out in its statement, we did not share the video with them in advance. This reflected our practice, embraced by nearly every news organization, that draft stories, which we considered the visual investigation to be, are not provided to outsiders before publication.
There are good reasons for this rule which I agree with. Sharing advance copies of a story with powerful people or government agencies gives them a roadmap for pressuring sources who have agreed to be quoted by name. It can give rise to a “pre-buttal’’ in which sophisticated public figures push out a distorted version of events before a critical story appears.
There is a broad consensus among journalists that one can share some aspects of the reporting with the people they directly concern. Many journalists think it is appropriate to read back quotations to people who have been interviewed for stories. Some refuse to do this because they fear sources might retract or try to soften what was said in earlier conversations.
As editor-in-chief of ProPublica, I come down on the side of allowing reporters to read back quotes and outline relevant portions of stories to experts who might identify factual errors. I did this myself while a reporter at The New York Times, and it saved me more than once from making errors of fact and omission.
“No surprises” — offering subjects of stories a full and fair summary of what’s coming — is a core value of journalism ethics. It allows people we’re writing about a fair chance to explain or put in context their actions. If we can give CEOs a fair summary of what’s coming, we need to do the same for a grieving family.
The statement from Carlos’ family argues that hearing a detailed description of the video was not enough and that they should have been allowed to see it before it was published. From their perspective, words did not convey the experience of seeing it.
I think they have a point. Showing them the footage we intended to use would have given them a chance to truly understand what the world was about to see of Carlos’ final hours. And it would have given us at ProPublica a better opportunity to weigh the competing tensions of privacy and public interest.
It is impossible to say what might have ensued had we done so. Family members could well have asked us to use nothing from the video. Or they might have suggested we delete the painful scenes that make it clear that no one at the Border Patrol station was keeping watch as their child grew desperately ill. What’s unarguable is that we didn’t have that conversation.
Journalists have a duty to weigh the public interest of a story against the pain it might cause a grieving family. We cannot give subjects of stories veto power over what is reported. But in cases like this one, particularly when a child is involved, we need to do everything we can to understand and be sensitive to what is at stake for everyone involved. I regret that we did not do that.
Knowing everything we know now, I still feel that making the video public was the right decision. The chance to see what really happened in that cell, painful as it is, changed the conversation about Carlos and the five other migrants who died in Border Patrol custody in the last year. It galvanized members of Congress and has significantly raised the possibility that there will be a serious investigation. The growing availability of visual and audio evidence is a godsend for investigative journalists, particularly at a time when truth itself seems under assault. But as we at ProPublica work to figure out how to better handle such material, it’s clear that the issues are deeply complex and that we’ve only begun to sort through them.

Texto completo: Sinclair Broadcast Group will no longer produce commentary programming, including Boris Epshteyn’s show, to focus on investigative local reporting.
In a statement about the change, Sinclair told its staff that both Epshteyn and former Obama campaign staffer Ameshia Cross would no longer host their political commentary shows for the network to provide time for investigative reporting. Sinclair owns 193 stations across the United States and wanted to allow local reporters time to air their investigative findings.
“We have to shine a light on our value proposition every quarter hour, in every newscast. Therefore, we will be expanding our local investigative journalism footprint in our daily newscasts. We are excited to dedicate more time in our newscasts to report on critical and relevant issues,” the company said in the statement.
It added, “To allot additional airtime for this storytelling, we will be ending the commentary segments this Friday, Dec. 13, featuring Ameshia Cross, and Boris Epshteyn.”
Epshteyn had previously worked as a spokesman for President Trump’s White House before leaving his post in 2017. His commentary on the network has sparked controversy, especially his remark comparing illegal immigration to an “attempted invasion” after highlighting footage of border authorities using tear gas on illegal immigrants.
Sinclair issued a statement after that segment, saying, “We'd like to take a moment and address some concerns regarding a commentary segment by [Epshteyn] that was aired on Sinclair stations this week. The opinions expressed in this segment do not reflect the views of Sinclair Broadcast Group.”Tweet
Epshteyn has remained close to the Trump family since departing the White House, even attending a celebration for Donald Trump Jr. after his book landed on the New York Times bestsellers list.
Sinclair claimed Epshteyn, 37, would be “moving into a sales-focused role” within the network.

Jersey City gunman was a Black Hebrew Israelite, so don't expect to hear much more about the shooting

Texto completo: It was only January when certain journalists went way out on a limb to give friendly news coverage to the racist and anti-Semitic Black Hebrew Israelites cult. This very odd editorial decision seemed to come in the service of better sticking it to the high school students from Covington Catholic — boys whom Black Hebrew Israelites had taunted on the national mall, inciting what became a famous incident.

So, now that one of the black nationalist cult's former members stands accused of a deadly shoot-out with police, possibly in an act of anti-Semitic terrorism targeting a Kosher grocery market in Jersey City, we are probably not going to hear much talk about the fringe group in the broader context of radicalization and gun violence. That would be a personal and professional embarrassment for a lot of reporters and editors, some of who are currently in the middle of defending against lawsuits by the Covington teens.

The New York Times, for example, published an entire profile on Jan. 23 describing the Black Hebrew Israelites and their tactics in friendly, playful terms, including “gamely engage,” "blunt and sometimes offensive,” and “attention-grabbing,” but all for the purpose of “drawing listeners near.” The profile is even sure to mention that the cult once got a shout-out in a song by a popular rapper.

Earlier, on Jan. 22, the Washington Post published a profile on the Black Hebrew Israelites that likewise mentions the rapper incident. The profile does not, however, take any time to lay out the cult’s well-known history of racism and anti-Semitism. All that the report says is that the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League have labeled the Black Hebrew Israelites as a “hate group” for their “inflammatory messages about white, LGBT and Jewish people.” That is all the profile says, and even that tiny piece of important background context is not given until the story’s 22nd paragraph. The Washington Post report said also of the Covington episode that a Black Hebrew Israelite presence at the Lincoln Memorial “was, for the group, quite mundane,” adding further that “Israelite street preaching in parts of D.C., Philadelphia and New York is commonplace, a familiar if odd accent to city life.”

It is still possible Tuesday’s shooting spree inspires a broader conversation about gun violence and the dangers posed by radical hate groups like the Black Hebrew Israelites. But don't hold your breath.

Meanwhile, the Covington teenagers, falsely portrayed as hateful bigots in the pages of the New York Times, the Washington Post, and elsewhere, are not known to have shot anyone — at least not in the last 11 months.

Don't let Harvey Weinstein off the hook

Texto completo: Entertainment mogul Harvey Weinstein harassed and assaulted dozens of women over the course of 30 years, and a recently proposed legal settlement might let him get off easy.

After two years of legal back-and-forth, Weinstein and his bankrupt Hollywood studio have reached a tentative $25 million settlement with his accusers. The proposal, which has received preliminary approval from all of the major players, would not require Weinstein to admit wrongdoing or pay his victims out of pocket, according to the New York Times.

If it goes through, the proposal would bring an end to nearly every single one of the lawsuits filed by the more than 30 actresses accosted by Weinstein. It must receive court approval, and Weinstein will still face criminal prosecution in January. But the civil claims against Weinstein should not go unnoticed, which is exactly what will happen if this proposal is approved.

Unfortunately, some of Weinstein’s accusers feel as though their hands are tied. Katherine Kendall, one of the actresses who has accused Weinstein of sexual harassment, said she’s disappointed with the terms of the proposal but agreed to it because she doesn’t know how much more they can realistically expect, given the fact that he and his company are staring down financial ruin.

“I don’t love it, but I don’t know how to go after him,” said Kendall, who alleges that Weinstein lured her to his apartment and chased her around it. “I don’t know what I can really do.”
In regard to financial compensation, this proposal might be the best the victims will get, as Genie Harrison, a sexual harassment lawyer representing one of the victims, has said. But Weinstein’s victims deserve more than a monetary consolation; they deserve an apology, an admission, and a criminal conviction.

Weinstein might indeed find himself behind bars come January. But if this deal goes through, he will never need to admit what he’s done or apologize to the women whose lives he destroyed. Instead, he’ll continue to insist that the accusations against him are “patently false,” as he’s done for years.

Weinstein is a coward, and he should be forced to confront the consequences of his sexual predation — in the courtroom and in legal negotiations. His victims deserve that much.

La extraña aparición de palomas con sombreros por las calles de Las Vegas

Texto completo: Durante varios días, se han visto palomas multicolores con sombrero de vaquero pavoneándose en las calles de Las Vegas. Nadie sabe quién equipa a los pájaros, según publica The Washington Post.
El residente de Las Vegas, Bobby Lee, subió a Facebook un video de dos pájaros con sombreros en miniatura, uno rojo y otro rosado, la semana pasada en Facebook . Los “pájaros tienen sombreros, hermano”, exclama en el clip. La publicación, que se compartió ampliamente, rápidamente se hizo viral en Internet y llegó a Mariah Hillman, cofundadora de un rescate local de palomas llamado Lofty Hopes.
Hillman, de 47 años, y la búsqueda de las aves de su hija de 30 años despegaron rápidamente. Comenzaron investigando áreas conocidas, donde repartieron tarjetas de visita y les dijeron a los transeúntes: “Si las ves, aliméntalas. Estamos a solo tres millas de distancia y podemos llegar bastante rápido “.
I finally found one!!! @LasVegasLocally pic.twitter.com/j2u90R2esL
— ???????? ♥????‍♀️ (@kassandraqueenn) December 9, 2019
Desde entonces, Hillman le dijo a The Washington Post, el dúo recibió dos pistas cada día de personas que vieron las palomas, a menudo adjuntando pruebas de video.
Hillman estaba en casa, limpiando jaulas de pájaros, cuando se enteró por primera vez de un avistamiento. Era demasiado tarde para ir a verlo, pero a la mañana siguiente, tan pronto como Hillman entró en la urbanización cerrada, vio la paloma con sombrero rojo, encaramada a la derecha. Ella desaceleró su auto y dijo: “Hola compañero”.
“Estaba sacudiendo la cabeza, tratando de quitarse el sombrero. Definitivamente es pegamento “, le dijo a The Post sobre el adhesivo utilizado en el pájaro. “Tenemos que mudarlo, lo que llevará tiempo”.
Hillman continuó: “Lo único que no los dañaría es el petróleo, que luego lo convierte en una paloma grasa, como los que están alrededor de McDonalds”.
De cualquier manera, la paloma debe quedarse con Hillman por un tiempo. Durante la persecución de dos horas, la exactivista por los derechos de los animales vio un halcón que rodeaba el área, al que llamó “preocupado”.
El misterio permanece
Aunque la gente ha especulado que los sombreros se originaron con un asistente del Rodeo de las Finales Nacionales, que actualmente se lleva a cabo en la ciudad, la asociación ha negado su participación, según The New York Times, y el Departamento de Policía Metropolitana de Las Vegas dijo que “no parece ser un asunto policial “.
Por ahora, Hillman se centra en localizar a las aves y garantizar su seguridad. Hasta ahora, ella y su hija acogieron a Cluck Norris, que luce un sombrero rojo de vaquero, y Coo-lamity James, que usa uno rosa. Otros avistadores mencionaron pájaros con gorras grises y marrones, aunque Hillman aún no los ha encontrado.
El New York Times entrevistó a un ornitólogo de la Universidad de Cornell, Charles Walcott, que se especializa en palomas. “Disfruté el video”, dijo Walcott al Times. “Solo pensé que esas palomas con sombreros eran lindas”.
Walcott también dijo que no está preocupado por las palomas, que actúan con bastante normalidad y no parecen estar angustiados. Los sombreros son “ciertamente lo suficientemente ligeros”, dijo al Times. “A mí me parecen palomas felices. Es difícil saberlo, por supuesto, porque no nos hablarán”.
Las palomas, dijo Hillman, tienen mucho para ellos: se aparean de por vida, los machos y las hembras producen leche y alimentan a sus crías, pueden vivir hasta 20 años en una unidad familiar, y son una de las diez especies que pueden reconocerse en un espejo.
“Son una gran primera mascota”, agregó, y señaló que tienen picos flexibles y no agudos. “Cuando necesitábamos palomas durante la guerra, eran considerados héroes. Ahora que no los necesitamos, se han convertido en alimañas o plagas. Hacemos eso con muchas cosas en esta sociedad, y eso no está bien”. (Editado por Pelayo Escandón)

Texto completo: The meat industry has a warning for consumers: Beware of plant-based meat.
That is the message behind a marketing campaign by the Center for Consumer Freedom, a public relations firm whose financial supporters have included meat producers and others in the food industry. In recent weeks the group has placed full-page ads in The New York Times and other newspapers raising health concerns about plant-based meat substitutes like the Impossible Burger and the Beyond Burger, which are designed to look, taste and even appear to bleed like real meat.
The ads call them “ultra-processed imitations” with numerous ingredients. “What’s hiding in your plant-based meat?” asks one ad featuring a sad face made of two patties and sausage. Another directs readers to a site that compares plant-based burgers to dog food. In November, the group’s managing director, Will Coggin, wrote an opinion piece in USA Today that labeled fake meats as ultra-processed foods that can spur weight gain, although the research on processed foods has not included plant-based meats. A few days later, the center’s executive director, Rick Berman, wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal criticizing plant-based meats as highly processed and no healthier than meat. Its headline: “ ‘Plant-Based Meat’ Is All Hat and No Cattle.”
Kind of an endorsement
Impossible Foods, which makes a popular plant-based burger, said the campaign was misleading and fearmongering. The company says plant-based meat alternatives are better for consumers and better for the planet, requiring less land and water and producing fewer greenhouse gas emissions than meat from cattle. The new “disinformation” campaign, they say, is a sign that Impossible Foods’ mission - to disrupt the meat industry and replace animals in the food system - is working. “It’s a point of pride to have that organization come after us,” said Pat Brown, the company’s chief executive. “It’s hard to imagine a stronger endorsement.” (The Center for Consumer Freedom did not respond to requests for an interview.)
Unlike other vegetarian meat substitutes, the new plant-based burgers are winning over meat lovers. Market research firm NPD Group says that 90% of the customers purchasing them are meat eaters who believe the products are more healthful and better for the environment, said Darren Seifer, an analyst at NPD, which recently predicted that plant-based meats will have staying power because of their popularity with millennials.
“The two big brands, Beyond and Impossible, have replicated the burger experience without having to sacrifice the taste of the burger,” he said. “So now a lot of consumers feel like they have a healthier option, they are reducing the amount of meat they consume, and they just feel better about that.”
But are plant-based meats really better for you than meat? It depends on how you eat them, said Dr. Frank Hu, chairman of the nutrition department at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Replacing a hamburger with a plant burger is not an improvement in diet quality if you chase it with french fries and a sugar-laden soda, Hu said.
For consumers trying to choose the healthiest option, Hu said studies comparing the metabolic effects of eating beef burgers versus plant burgers are currently underway. In the meantime, he considers the meat substitutes “transitional foods” for people who are trying to adopt more healthful diets.
Room for study
In August, Hu, along with a group of health and climate experts, published a report in JAMA that explored whether plant-based meats can be part of a “healthy low-carbon diet.” Studies show that replacing red meat with nuts, legumes and other plant foods can lower mortality and chronic disease risk, but it’s not possible to extrapolate that processed burgers made with purified soy or pea protein will have the same health benefits, Hu said.
Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat say the building blocks of their burgers are plants. The Beyond Burger has about 18 ingredients, including purified pea protein, coconut and canola oils, rice protein, potato starch and beet juice extract for coloring. Beyond Meat says it uses no genetically modified or artificially produced ingredients.
The Impossible Burger is made with similar basic ingredients, but it gets its protein largely from soy and potato, and it uses an iron-containing compound from soy called heme to enhance the burger’s meaty flavor. Both products use methylcellulose, a plant derivative commonly used in sauces and ice cream, as a binder.
Compared to a beef patty, the Impossible and Beyond burgers have similar amounts of protein and calories, with less saturated fat and no cholesterol. They also contain fiber; real meat does not. But compared to real beef, the two plant-based burgers are considerably higher in sodium, containing about 16% of the recommended daily value. An uncooked 4-ounce beef patty has about 75 milligrams of sodium, compared to 370 milligrams of sodium in the Impossible Burger and 390 milligrams in the Beyond Burger.
This fall, Burger King said it had its most successful quarter in four years, driven by sales of its plant-based Impossible Whopper. Dunkin’ Donuts announced it was rolling out a breakfast sandwich made with Beyond Meat sausages in 9,000 of its stores after a successful trial run in New York City. More than 50,000 grocery stores and restaurants, including fast-food chains like Subway, White Castle, KFC and Carl’s Jr., carry products from Beyond Meat or Impossible Foods.
Despite the popularity of plant-based burgers, beef burgers are still overwhelmingly the more popular choice at restaurants. Americans purchased 6.4 billion beef burgers at quick-service restaurants during the 12 months that ended in May, compared to 228 million plant-based burgers in the same period.
While meat consumption in America is at an all-time high, many Americans have shifted from eating beef to poultry. In the past three decades, beef intake has fallen by about a third, while chicken intake has more than doubled, and pork intake has remained fairly steady. Studies show that cost, convenience and health concerns are among the top reasons Americans have cut back on beef.
Mixed messages
But the health messages about red meat have been confusing. Earlier this year, a group of scientists challenged decades of nutrition advice, saying that warnings linking red meat consumption to heart disease and cancer are not backed by strong scientific evidence, though it was later revealed that the study’s lead author had past research ties to an industry group whose members include fast-food companies and a beef processor.
Meat producers are taking the fight against fake meat to lawmakers. At least 25 states have introduced bills making it illegal to use the words “beef” or “meat” on products made from plant ingredients or cultured meat that is grown in a lab. Missouri became the first state to pass such a law last year, which was initially proposed by the Missouri Cattlemen’s Association.
In October, Rep. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., the top recipient of livestock industry donations in the House, introduced a federal bill that would require companies to put the word “imitation” on their plant-based meat products. The bill calls for the products to carry a statement on their packages “that clearly indicates the product is not derived from or does not contain meat.”
Marshall, an obstetrician, said he introduced the bill after hearing from constituents. Patients of his told him they were confused about the health benefits of plant-based beef substitutes, and beef producers told him they were frustrated that the products are sold in grocery stores next to ground beef. “Kansas has a very large beef industry, and they said, ‘Why are we allowing this fake meat in the meat department?’ ” he said.

ND congressional leaders toe party lines on impeachment

Texto completo: The U.S. House of Representatives' Democratic-led Judiciary Committee on Tuesday released two proposed articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump. If the committee and the House approves the articles, Trump would be the third president in American history to be charged with high crimes and misdemeanors through the formal impeachment process. The members of the North Dakota congressional delegation reacted to the major development in ways that close observers would describe as predictable, promoting the viewpoint of their party. The first article of impeachment charges Trump with abusing his power by soliciting Ukraine to investigate a political rival for personal gain. It also says Trump purposely withheld military aid from Ukraine to compel the eastern European country to abide by his request. The second article charges him with obstructing Congress by blocking members of his administration from testifying and defying subpoenas for documents during the impeachment inquiry. Rep. Kelly Armstrong, R-N.D., said House Democrats are impeaching Trump "on charges they can't prove." The first-term congressman and member of the committee called the obstruction charge "baseless," saying the president had a right to object to subpoenas and the Democrats should wait for the courts to rule on the subject. "In an effort to satisfy their base, House Democrats are dividing the country," Armstrong said. "Today is a sad day for our nation." North Dakota's Republican Sens. John Hoeven and Kevin Cramer chimed in to say that House Democrats have been determined to impeach Trump since he was elected in 2016. Both senators have maintained throughout the impeachment inquiry that there's more important work the House should be doing instead. "The evidence in their articles is underwhelming at best," Cramer said. "House Democrats ought to scrap this fantasy and get back to working for the American people." The committee will debate the articles later this week, and if they are approved, a House vote could come as early as next week, according to the New York Times. If the the articles clear the Democratic-held House, Trump's trial would begin shortly thereafter in the Republican-held Senate.

Loopholes in Russia's Ban for Doping Frustrate Critics

Texto completo: Critics say the World Anti-Doping Agency's banishment of Russia has too many loopholes.
When the world's top antidoping authority announced this week that Russia would be banned from global sports for four years for continuing violations of its rules, it trumpeted the sanctions as suitably severe.
That opinion was not universal.
To some athletes and antidoping officials, the punishments put forth by the World Anti-Doping Agency appeared overly accommodating and, in certain cases, altogether maddening. So now, after years of being at least mildly polite in their critiques of the organization that held Russia's athletic future in its hands, a few of them are no longer holding back.
"With the level of mockery that has taken place, not only of the rules, but those who abide by and safeguard them, it's hard to understand how this could not have warranted the most serious level of sanctioning, " said Beckie Scott, a Canadian Olympian and the chairwoman of WADA's athlete committee. "Especially when they have the power to do so."
Scott and others in the world of international sports said they were frustrated with WADA because they had pressed for a blanket ban of all Russian athletes at next year's Olympics and at other major competitions. They said that such a punishment would have been fitting because multiple investigations had documented how Russia corrupted international sporting events for years.
That cheating culminated with a scheme to substitute dirty urine samples with clean ones at the 2014 Sochi Winter Games. When that operation was revealed, antidoping officials said, Russia manipulated computer databases it had promised to turn over as a condition of lifting sanctions against the country's antidoping agency.
Instead, Monday's ruling most likely means competitors from Russia will continue to participate in the Olympics impeded only by the inability to wear their country's uniforms or see their country's flag raised if they win.
But the limited reach of the ban left some critics scratching their heads. Russia did not, for example, lose the right to participate next summer in the quadrennial European soccer championships, one of the biggest sporting events in the world, nor the right for Saint Petersburg to host games in the tournament. The championship is a continental championship instead of a world championship, rival nations, athletes and fans were informed, and thus Russia's global antidoping punishments did not apply.
Han Xiao, the chairman of the athletes' advisory council of the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee, said many athletes from the United States initially had opposed a blanket ban on Russian athletes and teams because they felt sympathy for their counterparts who may be clean. But Xiao said it was the repetitive pattern of cheating and punishment dating back half a decade -- with no apparent remorse -- that made him believe a harsher punishment was necessary.
"We need some baseline comfort that we're competing on a level playing field," said Xiao, a former member of the American table tennis team. "But with Russia, after all these years, we're still talking about the same thing, which shows that the behavior doesn't change. So at what point are you going to raise the sanctions so they do really hit them?"
Those seeking harsher action could perhaps look at the way the World Athletics, the governing body for track and field, has handled Russia since a 2015 report first confirmed the true scope of Russia's state-run doping program.
World Athletics, then known as the I.A.A.F., immediately banned Russian athletes from all competitions. At the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro -- where the International Olympic Committee had asked each sporting federation to make its own decision about Russia's participation -- only a single athlete from the country competed in track and field, while close to 70 others were suspended. Russia was well represented in other sports, though, and won 19 gold medals.
But track and field officials also stripped Russia of the right to host the 2016 world race walking championships and 2016 world junior championships. The ban on Russia has continued for four years, with only a handful of Russian athletes allowed to compete at the track and field world championships in 2017 and 2019. Each time, the athletes cleared to take part had to do so in neutral uniforms.
"Doping is already hard enough to prove with athletes who aren't coming from countries with systemic doping programs," Xiao said.
The World Anti-Doping Agency does have supporters, too. Dick Pound, the Canadian lawyer who served as the first chairman of the agency from 1999 to 2007, said the agency should be given more credit for its work battling performance-enhancing drug use.
"There's a budding industry of attacking WADA for not being perfect, usually by people who are themselves imperfect and who have no accountability for anyone," Pound said. "I think if you realistically look at the major international progress against doping in sport, it's really been at the hands of WADA in the last two or three years and really no one else."
And yet, some Russian sports officials have sounded unbothered about the prospect that the nation's name, colors, flag and anthem would be absent at the 2020 Olympics, just as they were at the 2018 Winter Games.
"We have done this before at the last Olympics," Dmitry Svishchev, president of Russia's curling federation, said this week, according to Reuters. "There is nothing horrible about this."
The people most frustrated are those who say they have had to watch the same plot unfold time and again, and who fear the new sanctions will do little to alter Russia's behavior.
"The perception of this being a stiff punishment, it's just that: a perception," said Bruce Baumgartner, the president of U.S.A. Wrestling. "It's not the reality."

Texto completo: Jon Schleuss, a 32-year-old data journalist at the Los Angeles Times, has been elected president of the NewsGuild, unseating 12-year incumbent Bernie Lunzer.
After a rerun of an election held in the spring, Schleuss won by a vote of 1,979 to 1,514, said the guild, which is part of the Communications Workers of America, in a statement. The previous election was recast after complaints over failure to ensure that the ballots reached all eligible voters. In that election, Lunzer won 1,282 to 1,021.
Schleuss played an important role in a historic campaign to secure union representation at The Times after 130 years as a nonunion newsroom. The organizing effort helped to spur an increase in union activity in the publishing industry, which has been buffeted by shifts in advertising and consumption.

"While I have won the office of President of the NewsGuild, the real winners here are the members who organized, mobilized, and claimed the future for their union and for themselves," Schleuss said in the statement. He said he planned to work for stronger contracts, to organize more workers and provide more transparency, and better connection between members and leaders.
Schleuss joined The Times in 2013. Previously he was a manager at the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette and worked as a host at the local NPR station.
Schleuss, who starts a four-year term immediately, was also elected as one of the youngest presidents of an international union. Representing some 475 members of its newsroom, the L.A. Times Guild worked on a first collective bargaining agreement for more than a year. It led to pay raises of at least 5% and locked in future increases after years of stagnation in salaries. Other newspapers such as the Arizona Republic and Chicago Tribune also moved to form a union.
The guild represents about 20,000 journalists and other workers in the United States and Canada, including The Times, the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, the Associated Press, Reuters, BuzzFeed News and the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Trump and Attorney General William Barr took aim at the FBI on Tuesday, reiterating attacks on former bureau officials and contradicting the agency's director, Christopher Wray, a day after an independent watchdog concluded that agents were justified in opening an investigation into Russia's possible ties with the Trump campaign.
In an early Twitter post, Trump snapped at Wray for not agreeing with his interpretation of the watchdog report's findings.
“I don't know what report current Director of the FBI Christopher Wray was reading, but it sure wasn't the one given to me," Trump wrote on Twitter. “With that kind of attitude, he will never be able to fix the FBI, which is badly broken despite having some of the greatest men & women working there!"
Wray had said Monday that he concurred with the Justice Department inspector general, Michael Horowitz, who found that political bias did not influence investigative decisions, directly undercutting the president's yearslong accusations.
Barr went a step further and called the findings about the origins of the inquiry “flimsy." He also repeated a longtime refrain of Trump and his allies, saying the FBI improperly used counterintelligence tools to spy on a presidential campaign.
In an interview with NBC News, Barr said there were “gross abuses" and “inexplicable behavior that is intolerable in the FBI."
In July 2016, the FBI opened the investigation after it learned a Trump campaign aide had bragged that he was told that Russia had information that could damage Hillary Clinton's candidacy. At the same time, stolen Democratic e-mails were being released. This prompted the FBI to open the inquiry, the inspector general found, not the salacious dossier of opposition research on Trump by a former British intelligence official.
Horowitz said the bureau was right to open the inquiry, but he recommended additional supervision in the future.
While there was little expectation that the inspector general's conclusions would settle the partisan debate over the legitimacy of the Russia inquiry, the president's suggestion that he lacked confidence in Wray's ability to “fix" the bureau raised the possibility that he was considering replacing Wray, which would give him his third FBI director since he took office.
The director position has a 10-year term limit devised specifically to prevent political interference.
Trump appointed Wray after he fired the previous director, James Comey, in 2017. By the time Wray became director, a special counsel had been appointed to take over the Russia investigation, and Trump was regularly lashing out at the FBI. During his first two years in office, Trump attacked the bureau, the Justice Department and intelligence agencies 277 times.
Trump and some of his allies saw the dense report as proof that their conspiracy theories were in fact true. The president has claimed for years that the Russia investigation was a witch hunt pursued by “deep state" bureaucrats who did not support him politically. And he has been particularly critical of the FBI, calling former bureau leaders “losers."
“I think our nation was turned on its head for three years based on a completely bogus narrative that was largely fanned and hyped by a completely irresponsible press," Barr said Tuesday.
Wray has sought to avoid confrontation with Trump as he navigates the bureau through one of its most turbulent eras. He and his aides had hoped that with the release of the inspector general report, the FBI could finally move past the toxic politics of the last three years.
Standing in disagreement with the president and the attorney general, Wray will now have to decide how to lead the agency while his bosses promulgate the unsubstantiated narrative that the FBI plotted to sabotage Trump's presidential campaign in 2016.
Barr is overseeing a separate Justice Department criminal investigation into the basis of the Russia inquiry.
A federal prosecutor, John Durham, is leading that investigation and supported the attorney general's assessment of the report.
“Last month, we advised the inspector general that we do not agree with some of the report's conclusions as to predication and how the FBI case was opened," Durham said.
Meanwhile, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Tuesday that any foreign interference in American elections is “unacceptable" and warned Russia and others that the Trump administration will protect the integrity of the vote.

Texto completo: When her daughters, Olivia Jade and Isabella, were younger, Lori Loughlin and her husband Mossimo Giannulli loved to give them a white Christmas by packing the family up and flying — presumably by private jet — to Colorado so they could all play in the snow and ski.
More recently, though, the Giannulli family has stayed in Los Angeles in their Bel Air mansion, as the former Hallmark Channel star told Parade magazine in 2017. But Loughlin said they still enjoyed other holiday traditions: picking out a tree and decorating it. She said she and her fashion-savvy, social media influencer daughters also loved to go shopping.
“It’s really about getting together with family,” Loughlin said.
This year, the former “Full House” star and her family again will be in Los Angeles, but things will be far less jolly. That’s because Loughlin, 55, is facing the possibility of years in prison for her alleged role in the college admissions scandal and has been hunkering down in rooms with lawyers to prepare her defense, Us Weekly is reporting in its new issue.
The actress best known as wholesome Aunt Becky is participating in “grueling” mock trials, essentially rehearsals for what could be the biggest, most consequential performance of her life: defending herself in federal court against bribery, fraud and money laundering charges.
According to Us Weekly, Loughlin, 55, is “adamant” that she wants to testify, even though it’s never a requirement for defendants to take the stand and defense attorneys often advise against it.
“Lori has no choice at this point but to take this to trial and hope for an acquittal or a hung jury,” a source told Us Weekly.
Loughlin apparently believes she can convince a jury that she’s a sympathetic figure, another insider said. She and her husband are charged with paying $500,000 in bribes to get Olivia Jade, 20, and Isabella, 21, fraudulently admitted to the University of Southern California.
Perhaps the veteran TV actress and media personality hopes she can use her star power and comfort in the spotlight to present herself as a loving mom who thought she was doing right by her daughters. Loughlin and her fashion designer husband also are expected to argue that they were duped into engaging in a bribery scheme concocted by college admissions consultant William “Rick” Singer.
“She feels they’ll believe that the accusations against her don’t merit criminal prosecution, that she truly thought she was making a legal contribution to charity,” the insider told Us Weekly.
Loughlin and Giannulli reportedly will argue that they believed the money they paid to Singer and to his alleged accomplices at USC were legitimate donations to Singer’s education nonprofit and to the school’s athletic programs.
“Mossimo strongly believes they were victims of a con and did nothing wrong,” an insider previously told Us Weekly.
But as much as Loughlin and Giannulli agree on some issues related to their “united front” defense, they disagree on others. That includes Loughlin’s reported earlier desire to strike a plea deal with prosecutors. Now, Loughlin wants to testify, and her husband doesn’t think it’s a good idea at all, Us Weekly reported.
“Mossimo doesn’t want to testify, but will be forced to if Lori does,” the insider told the outlet.
Another worry for the couple is that Olivia Jade and Isabella may be called as prosecution witnesses to testify against their parents. The indictment alleges that Olivia Jade and Isabella participated in the bribery scheme by posing for photos on rowing machines. The photos were used for fake athletic profiles that Singer and his accomplices created in order to present the sisters to admissions officers as crew team recruits.
The prospect of Olivia Jade and Isabella testifying terrifies Loughlin, Us Weekly reported.
“Lori’s bereft when she talks about the girls being forced to testify at their trial,” the insider said. “She doesn’t understand how it got to this point.”
Legal experts say that the decision to testify is always up to a defendant. Juries are instructed to not hold it against defendants when they don’t take the stand.
“There are so many risks to testifying that every attorney worth his salt thinks long and hard about recommending it,” according to a post on AbovetheLaw.com. “No matter what the prosecutor’s evidence, if a defendant testifies that is what will determine the verdict.”
When a defendant testifies, she loses her right to remain silent. It also shifts the burden of proof, which normally is on the prosecution, the legal site said in its post. After a defendant testifies, juries must now look at two “stories” of the case.
“Whether the prosecution made its case or not, if they don’t like how the defendant came off, either because they don’t believe him or just don’t like him, they’ll generally convict,” the post said.
Defense attorneys may see an advantage to putting certain defendants on the stand, notably professional, educated defendants in white-collar cases who have no prior criminal history, the New York Times said. Attorneys may believe they can adequately prepare these defendants to put their cases in the best light.
“The problem in calling the defendant to testify is the second act: cross-examination,” the New York Times said. “Prosecutors often can hardly contain themselves at the thought of getting a shot at the defendant.”
The prosecutor’s strategy usually involves making the defendant uncomfortable and forcing her to respond to questions she may not want to answer, which puts her credibility on the line, the Times added.
For an attorney to decide whether to put a client on the stand, “it comes down to figuring out how well the defendant can perform on the witness stand, particularly cross-examination, as measured against the strength of the government’s case.”
If it’s a matter of “performing,” Loughlin may have an advantage, since performing in TV and in films has been her livelihood for several decades.
In that sense, Loughlin has begun to treat her trial preparation like a “full-time job,” doing the mock trials, meeting with her lawyers or discussing strategy over email,” Us Weekly reported.
Still, the actress also realizes that this could be her last Christmas at home, if the trial doesn’t go her way. For that reason, Loughlin also is trying to spend as much time with her husband and daughters as possible, Us Weekly said. After all, she also once said, “It’s important to make the effort to see your family around the holidays.”

Rams win big when they stop wasting chances, and roll 7s early

Texto completo: THOUSAND OAKS — The run covered only one yard, but it showed how far the 2019 Rams have come and how much farther they could go.
The Rams had the ball for the first time in their 28-12 victory over the Seattle Seahawks at the Coliseum on Sunday. Passes from Jared Goff to Robert Woods for 18 and 15 yards quickly put them in Seattle territory. This was the kind of early scoring opportunity that a team craves — and that they had been squandering all season.
Then Jared Goff connected with tight end Tyler Higbee for 33 yards to put the Rams at the Seahawks’ goal line, and on the next play Malcolm Brown ran off left tackle for a one-yard touchdown.
It was only the second game this season that the Rams’ first trip across the 50-yard line paid off in seven points. When their next possession also resulted in a touchdown, the night and maybe the season had been transformed.
“It’s just about finishing drives,” Rams coach Sean McVay said Monday.
McVay credited “great individual efforts” by everyone from Goff to receivers Woods, Higbee and Cooper Kupp to running backs Brown and Todd Gurley and left-side linemen Andrew Whitworth and Austin Corbett for what became a three-touchdown first-half burst.
By winning, the Rams (8-5) stayed one game behind the Minnesota Vikings (9-4) in the race for the NFC’s last wildcard playoff berth with three games to play. The Rams face the Dallas Cowboys (6-7) Sunday in Arlington, Texas. The Vikings play the Chargers (5-8) Sunday in Carson.
For their playoff drive to succeed, the Rams have to keep finishing their offensive drives with touchdowns instead of field goals — or nothing at all.
It’s amazing how often this year the Rams have wasted chances to do that and take early control of games.
Before scoring early touchdowns the past two weeks, they entered opposing territory with 13 first-quarter drives and got into the end zone a grand total of once. (That was Woods’ eight-yard carry, the Rams’ only score in the 20-7 loss to the San Francisco 49ers.)
Those drives produced eight field goals, two missed field goals, a punt and an interception. Eight failures to convert downs included four incompletions and a sack in seven passing attempts. Three ill-timed penalties, two of them before the snap, contributed to the problem.
A prime-time example was the Rams’ loss to the Seahawks in Seattle on a Thursday night in October. The Rams crossed the 50-yard line twice in the first quarter, but third-down incomplete passes made them settle for two field goals.
By contrast, in the Rams’ first 13 games on the way to the NFC championship in 2018, they cashed in touchdowns on more than half (12 of 23) of their first-quarter drives across the 50.
Rookie right tackle Bobby Evans blamed penalties for some of the Rams’ stalled drives this season, and said the offensive line seemed “bought-in and focused” Sunday.

— Los Angeles Rams (@RamsNFL) December 9, 2019
“A lot of drives we didn’t finish were because we would get penalties down in the red zone (inside the opponents’ 20),” Evans said. “I think you could just feel it (Sunday), everybody’s on the same page.”
The Rams’ second touchdown, making it 14-3 with 11:28 to go in the second quarter, came on a two-yard pass from Goff on a rollout to Woods, capping a 6 1/2-minute, 85-yard drive on which Goff completed all six passes for 49 yards. Their third, making it 21-3 with 51 seconds left in the half, was a 10-yard pass from Goff to Kupp, at the end of a 72-yard drive on which the quarterback went 5 for 6 for 65 yards.
On the drive to Kupp’s touchdown, Gurley made first-down runs for six, six and seven yards, loosening up the defense for the passing game.
“I think it starts with just being efficient in early downs, staying ahead of the sticks, not getting into second and longs and third and longs,” Kupp said of the first-half efficiency Sunday.
The Rams’ lead forced the Seahawks (10-3) to pass. Knowing what was coming gave the L.A. defense a chance against the elusive Russell Wilson, and it capitalized by sacking the quarterback five times. It was Wilson’s second-worst game of the season; the worst was against the Baltimore Ravens, the NFL’s best team.
“I think the last couple of weeks have really represented playing team football, feeding off one another,” McVay said Monday.
If they’re able to keep it up at Dallas, the signs should be visible early.
Ends and odds
The Rams came out of Sunday’s game without major injuries, although Sean McVay said punt returner Nsimba Webster “got his hip banged up a little bit” while blocking on a kickoff return.
This was the first game for Webster and Darrell Henderson as punt- and kickoff-returner, respectively, since JoJo Natson went on injured reserve with a hamstring pull. McVay said tight end Gerald Everett and tackle Rob Havenstein could return in Dallas from knee injuries. …
Websites that track NFL teams’ likelihood of qualifying for the playoffs said the Rams’ chances climbed above 30% after the win over the Seahawks. Two sites said the Rams’ chances would go above 50% if they beat the Cowboys, other things being equal. As of Monday afternoon, The New York Times had them rising from 34% to 52% with a win in Dallas, and FiveThirtyEight.com had them going from 36% to 54%. …
The Las Vegas point spread for Sunday’s game at Dallas was pick ’em Monday afternoon, with an over-under line of 48 1/2. The Cowboys were three-point favorites Monday morning.

Texto completo: Jesé Milagrosa, líder espiritual de una pequeña iglesia en Bayside (Queens, NYC), ha sido acusado de agredir sexualmente a un pre adolescente en el transcurso de tres años.
Milagrosa (69), líder de la Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de La Salette en la calle 204, supuestamente usó su posición en la iglesia para participar en actos sexuales con el niño de 12 años entre 2011 y 2014, informó Queens Daily Eagle.
La víctima no identificada es miembro activo de la feligresía y se enfrentó a Milagrosa con respecto al abuso en 2018.
El acusado luego admitió a los detectives que tuvo contacto oral y anal con el niño , dijeron los fiscales.
Los fiscales acusaron a Milagrosa de conducta sexual contra un menor de edad y de actos sexuales criminales. Está detenido con una fianza de $250 mil dólares y debe regresar a la corte el 20 de diciembre. Si es declarado culpable, enfrenta entre 10 años y prisión perpetua.
La Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de La Salette, un templo católica fundado en el año 2000, celebra una misa tradicional en latín al menos seis días a la semana, y muchos de los feligreses son inmigrantes de América del Sur.
A raíz de su arresto, un portavoz de la Diócesis de Brooklyn, que incluye Queens, dijo que Nuestra Señora de LaSalette no es una Iglesia Católica Romana y no es parte de la Diócesis de Brooklyn.
“Si bien imita muchas prácticas católicas, no es una parroquia católica romana, y no está asociada con la Diócesis de Brooklyn”, dijo el portavoz. “De hecho, la diócesis ha notificado a los fieles a lo largo de los años que Nuestra Señora de LaSalette no está en comunión con la diócesis o con el Santo Padre”.
El abogado de Milagrosa, Jeffrey Pittell, dijo que él “es amado por su congregación”.
Según una entrevista en 2007 con The New York Times, “Monseñor Milagrosa” se mudó a NYC desde Venezuela en 1985, “después de crear una orden religiosa independiente, ahora con sede en Liberty, Nueva York, con la esperanza de aumentar las vocaciones entre los jóvenes hispanos”.

Texto completo: The coming new year has been widely heralded as the start of a new decade: the 2020s. But an old timekeeping conundrum has led some to contend we're celebrating too early and that we should actually wait until Jan. 1, 2021.
A decade is a period of 10 years — that isn't disputed. But a glitch in our calendar system creates a problem if you think decades should begin in years ending with a zero. If you continue the pattern back about 2020 years, you run into a major issue.
That's because there is no "year zero" in our calendar system, explained Craig Callender, a professor of philosophy at UC San Diego who has studied the physics and experience of time.
The lack of a year zero means the only consistent way to measure decades — or centuries or millennia — is to start them in years ending in one: That’s the theory presented in explanations of the debate published by the Farmer’s Almanac, timeanddate. com, the New York Times and others.
New Year's life hacks: The smallest resolutions with the biggest payoffs
But because a decade is simply a unit of 10 years, there is no right answer, Callender told USA TODAY.
Here’s the argument explained:
The case for beginning the decade in 2021
The basis of this argument is a single calendar year that happened more than two millennia ago.
At that point in time, our current calendar system pivots from years labeled B. C. — “Before Christ” — to years labeled A. D. — “anno Domini” or “in the year of the Lord. ” It’s an attempt to center the calendar around the birth of Jesus, although the historical accuracy of that date has been called into question.
There is no year zero in the switch, Callender said. The B. C. years count down to 1 B. C. , which is immediately followed by A. D. 1.
You may love holiday lights — But there's a good reason why some people don't, experts say
The lack of a year zero means the first A. D. decade started at year 1 and ran until the end of year 10; the second decade started on year 11.
Follow the pattern for 200 more decades, and here we are — still one year away from the start of the next decade, which will begin on Jan. 1, 2021.
The case for beginning the decade in 2020
People who say we should wait a year to celebrate the new decade have a point, but it's not a very good one, according to Callender.
Marking the beginning of a decade in a year ending in one is out of step with how we think and talk about time, he said.
When we count our children’s ages, we start at zero — not one. When we talk about decades such as the 1960s, we start at years ending with zero — not ending in one.
Celebrating the beginning the decade on Jan. 1, 2020, simply makes things easier in the present day, Callender said. It’s a convention that is “pretty good for everything really, unless you run it all the way back. ”
The widely documented argument between timekeeping purists and the average person is “pretty silly,” he commented. The reality: There's no perfect solution that will please everyone.

Texto completo: America should be leading the way on clean energy, not falling behind.
Washington is consumed with discussion about the consequences of a rising China, from trade disputes, to their authoritarian surveillance and oppression of Uighurs, to their aggression in the South China Sea. There's comparably little debate about how the United States can shape the environment into which China is rising, let alone the actions we can take at home to ensure our values prevail. We see more focus on tariffs than building wind turbines and solar farms. We should not be spectators in shaping our own future, or the world's. We should pledge that by the end of the next decade, America will surpass China and win the clean energy race.
We aren't winning the clean energy race today. In many ways, we aren't even trying. China is becoming an energy superpower. Earlier this year, the Global Commission on the Geopolitics of the Energy Transformation reported that China became the world's largest producer, exporter and installer of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries and electric vehicles, followed by Japan and Germany. The United States ranks fourth.
China surpassed us for the lead in renewable energy technology, too, with 150,000 patents -- making up 30 percent of the world's total. We are second with just over 100,000 patents, while Japan and the European Union follow with about 75,000 each.
In 2015, China surpassed us to become the largest electric vehicle market and is on pace to dominate production for the next 20 years. Chinese electric vehicles account for 60 percent of global sales: 876,000 vehicles were produced last year compared with 361,000 in America.
China is doing things we are afraid to do. They offer citizens large subsidies for purchasing electric vehicles from state-owned companies. Municipalities waive fees for electric vehicle owners. The city of Shenzhen, which has a population of 12.5 million people, runs a 100 percent electric vehicle bus fleet and is, by fiat, converting 22,000 taxis to electric vehicles.
High-speed rail also is integral to China's strategy. It has the largest high-speed railway in the world, with 19,000 miles of track and most major cities connected by the network. The United States has less than 500 miles. Our fastest train takes 19 to 22 hours from New York to Chicago, whereas the same distance in China takes four-and-a-half hours.
Unless we have a strategic plan, China may become the OPEC of the 21st-century energy industry. It's folly to replace a world order too dependent on Middle East oil with one that's too dependent on Chinese technology.
America can mobilize around a national strategy to lead the world in clean technology that will attract bipartisan support from both coasts and the heartland.
How? Just think about the options we could explore. We could expand the electric vehicle tax credit, making it fully refundable at the time of purchase. That means a person wouldn't have to wait a year for their tax refund but would receive money back immediately when buying an electric vehicle. If these credits are tied to domestic manufacturing, private sector jobs will return to auto-industry towns.
We could add two zeros to the end of the budget for ARPA-E, the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, taking it from a few hundred million to tens of billions of dollars. We could double the budgets for the Energy Department's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and Office of Science. The aggregate current level for those two would increase to around $ 18 billion from about $ 9 billion. Each support renewable energy research and are critical for the type of disruptive innovation necessary to meet the scale and urgency of the climate challenge.
We could use an infrastructure bank to finance a high-speed rail system to relieve congestion, reduce pollution, increase energy efficiency, and provide alternatives to regional air travel. Although the California experience shows how local zoning concerns and cost overruns present challenges, the lessons learned show that we need a clear road map before implementation, rather than an ad hoc approach.
We could match China's annual investment in public-private partnerships. Whereas China spent $ 126 billion on renewable energy investments in 2016, we spent just over $ 40 billion. We need more examples like the Department of Energy working with the Breakthrough Energy Coalition, a group launched by Richard Branson and 20 other leaders committed to making renewable energy technologies less expensive and more commercially viable. Last month, a Bill Gates-backed start-up achieved a breakthrough using artificial intelligence and mirrors. This new technology harnesses the sun's energy to create heat hot enough for carbon-free industrial processes, like making concrete. Another place for investment is in electric car batteries, which need a range of closer to a thousand miles than a few hundred. Home energy-storage systems and solar cells must also become smaller and more convenient.
Energy is the largest market the world has ever seen. Four to five billion people consume energy today. That figure will increase to nine billion in 30 years. Today we have 2.3 million clean energy jobs. A national strategy focused on winning the clean energy race can create millions of new jobs, considering solar panel installer and wind turbine technician jobs are already expected to grow at around 60 percent over the next decade.
America can claim credit for many of the last century's greatest contributions to humanity. We did not lead simply by opposing great powers, but by setting the standard for scientific and technological advances. Our China strategy should be premised on becoming the undisputed global leader in the new-energy market, and the nation all others seek to emulate in tackling the climate change crisis.

Michelle Goldberg: Please, Democrats, don’t make the impeachment articles too narrow

Texto completo: At Wednesday’s Judiciary Committee hearing on impeachment, the witness called by Republicans, George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, gave a disingenuous, hackish performance.
Turley criticized the impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump as overly partisan, a concern that didn’t seem to trouble him in 1998, when he supported Bill Clinton’s impeachment. He argued that Democrats shouldn’t accuse Trump of bribery for his Ukraine shakedown unless it meets the statutory definition, even though a 2014 Washington Post op-ed essay by one Jonathan Turley made clear that criminal statutes aren’t controlling in the impeachment process.
“While there’s a high bar for what constitutes grounds for impeachment, an offense does not have to be indictable,” he wrote then, when he was discussing whether there were grounds for impeaching Barack Obama.
So there was no reason for Democrats to take Turley seriously when he argued that the impeachment investigation was too truncated, and that more effort should have been made to coerce testimony from key figures like Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal lawyer, and John Bolton, his former national security adviser.
Nevertheless, I wish they had. Democrats had little to lose by taking their time excavating the full record of Trump’s wrongdoing before turning impeachment over for trial to the Republican-controlled Senate.
But that debate became moot on Thursday morning, when Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that she had instructed House investigators to begin drawing up articles of impeachment. Now the question is what those articles will contain. A central point of contention is whether the articles will include Trump’s obstruction of justice in Robert Mueller’s inquiry into Russia’s attack on the 2016 election. It is vitally important that they do.
It is understandable that Democrats from swing districts, whose constituents weren’t persuaded to back impeachment by the Mueller report, don’t want to revisit the murky events of 2016. But to make clear the full gravity of what Trump tried to do in Ukraine, Democrats need to demonstrate that it was part of a pattern.
As the Mueller report showed, the Trump campaign welcomed Russian interference in 2016, expecting that “it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts.” Then Trump repeatedly tried to obstruct the federal government’s investigation into what Russia had done. It was only the day after Mueller’s congressional testimony that Trump made his demand of Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Part of that demand was that Ukraine help Trump obscure Russia’s role in his election by falsely implicating itself. Once the scheme became public, Trump obstructed Congress’s investigation into his solicitation of foreign election assistance.
Either Mueller’s findings or the Ukraine “drug deal,” as Bolton reportedly called it, would merit impeachment on its own. But the urgency of Democrats’ impeachment process — the subject of much bad-faith caterwauling on the right — is best justified by Trump’s recidivism. Impeachment isn’t just about holding Trump accountable for a discrete scandal. It’s about trying, against the odds, to stop an ongoing campaign to subvert the 2020 election, one that is building on tactics from 2016.
Indeed, even as the Judiciary Committee discussed impeachment, Giuliani was in Ukraine seeking meetings with corrupt former prosecutors who, he apparently hoped, would undercut the Democrats’ case. A day before that, Giuliani had been in Budapest where he met with another disgraced former Ukrainian prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, as well as with Andrii V. Artemenko, a pro-Russian former member of Ukraine’s Parliament.
Artemenko’s name might be familiar to those who have followed Trump’s Russia scandal closely. He was the one who reportedly gave Michael Cohen, Trump’s former lawyer, a Russia-friendly “peace plan” for Russia and Ukraine, which Cohen transmitted to Michael Flynn, then Trump’s national security adviser. Artemenko, The New York Times reported in 2017, “sees himself as a Trump-style leader of a future Ukraine.” He had claimed to have evidence of corruption by Ukraine’s president at the time, Petro Poroshenko, a pro-Western figure he was trying to oust. “Mr. Artemenko said he had received encouragement for his plans from top aides” to President Vladimir Putin of Russia, The Times said.
To understand the sociopathic shamelessness of Giuliani seeking Artemenko’s help with Trump’s current domestic political problems, you have to understand how the Russia scandal and the Ukraine scandal intersect.
Given America’s political polarization, public opinion on impeachment is unlikely to move much no matter what Democrats do. Nevertheless, they would be mad to let centrist trepidation stop them from making the strongest possible case for Trump’s removal. Doing that requires a willingness to put Trump’s Ukraine corruption in context.
Democrats have only one chance to impeach the most corrupt and disloyal president in American history. They say they’re rushing through it because it can’t wait. They have a duty to explain not just why Trump betrayed America when he sought to extort election help from Ukraine, but how we know that he’ll nearly certainly try the same thing again.

Impeachment backlash: Poll has Trump trouncing all comers in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan

Texto completo: You don't need a high opinion of President Trump to have a low opinion of the current partisan impeachment process. The reaction of Republican Texas Rep. Will Hurd to the impeachment hearings so far serves as evidence of that. More on Hurd later — suffice it to say that he is retiring and outspokenly unhappy with Trump, and he's also not impressed with impeachment.
It seems a lot of voters feel the same way. Because Trump remains unpopular in every poll I've ever seen, but another set of polls is out showing him running really well — frighteningly well, in fact. The new Firehouse Strategies polls out today complement the recent New York Times polls showing Trump taking leads over most of the potential Democratic nominees in such key states as Florida, Wisconsin, and Michigan.
This time, Trump is leading Biden and all other Democratic comers in Michigan, in Pennsylvania, and in Wisconsin. This data point is consistent with the idea that Democrats took things too far with their visceral hatred for the president.
Firehouse is a Republican firm, and these Trump leads are unusually large — for example, nine points over Biden in Wisconsin? Yet this is confirmation of what the earlier set of nonpartisan polls seemed to hint at. If the 2016 election taught me anything, it is to distrust polls, but even more to distrust conventional ideas about what the polls should say ("why aren't I fifty points ahead?")
If people in swing states are getting sour over impeachment, then Democrats and liberals are completely oblivious to the danger they're in. They seem deluded into thinking that they've got Richard Nixon on their hands. But people widely viewed Nixon as corrupt, across party lines, because he really was corrupt. That's why a bipartisan consensus formed to impeach him.
In contrast Trump ... well, he's just Trump. You don't have to like it, but temporary impoundment of funds is a very weak argument for impeachment, and the abuse of power charge is certainly at least debatable. If people react negatively to this exercise, again, because it's completely partisan, then it shouldn't really come as that much of a surprise.

Texto completo: Getting There
In a brick shed behind his house on Bagley Avenue in Detroit, Henry Ford built his first car.
The 32-year-old Ford produced only one Quadricycle Runabout in 1896, and he built it by hand from four bicycle wheels, steel, wood, rubber, cloth and glass. He fabricated a two-cylinder engine using a design described in the Jan. 9, 1896, edition of American Machinist magazine.
It also ran on ethanol, not gasoline.
The observant motorist may notice that cars now run on gasoline. The savvy driver surely also notes that gasoline commonly contains ethanol.
Look at any gas pump. Unleaded, mid-grade, premium - they all have ethanol added in and have for some time. More and more gas stations, however, are starting to offer another choice: pure, unadulterated gasoline.
There are 11 gas stations in Spokane that sell clear gas, which is pure gasoline with no ethanol added, according to pure-gas.org. Another seven in Spokane Valley offer the fuel. Some of those 18 stations began selling clear gas as early as 2017, but seven of them put the option on the pump just this year.
Without going too much into the science behind it all, ethanol helps reduce tailpipe emissions when it's mixed with gasoline. Ethanol, an alcohol made from corn, brings more oxygen into the chemical equation, allowing the fuel to burn more completely and produce cleaner emissions.
The ethanol addition is required by the 1990 Clean Air Act and the renewable fuel standard described in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. These federal laws give states discretion on how this requirement is met. In Washington, the renewable fuel standard requires that at least 2% of the total volume of gasoline sold in the state must be ethanol.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that nearly 143 billion barrels of gasoline were consumed in the U.S. in 2018. That equates to about 390 million gallons a day, on average. Those many, many gallons of gas contained about 14 billion gallons of ethanol - 10% of the total volume.
But while the gas-ethanol mixture may burn cleaner, ethanol has only about 70% the energy content of gasoline, so it powers fewer miles per gallon. In other words, ethanol begets cleaner air, but pure gasoline begets more miles. With pure gasoline, the more bang-for-your-buck requires more bucks, since pure gas is more expensive than ethanol blends.
So why choose clear gas?
Some motorists may want it in their old cars, and by old we mean pre-1990. Older engines can combust ethanol, but it hastens their wear and tear. Other motorists believe their vehicles need the purity that airplanes require.
But let's be frank. The vast majority of cars don't need pure gasoline. Considering that vehicle emissions are the largest contributor to greenhouse gases in Washington state, the region's many motorists should do as much as they can to lessen their share of air pollution.
Harmful tailpipe emissions go back a long way. In 1921, a General Motors engineer named Thomas Midgley Jr. found a new way to reduce the "knocking" in auto engines: the highly toxic additive called tetraethyl lead.
As James Lincoln Kitman wrote in The Nation in 2000, engine knocking was a sign of an inefficient motor. Such feckless engines by nature created more emissions and, more important for GM's bottom line, customers didn't want a loud, obnoxious car. The engineer Midgley tried everything "from melted butter and camphor to ethyl acetate and aluminum chloride." Ethanol, it turns out, worked great to solve the problem.
But GM didn't like ethanol. It couldn't be patented, and the corporate giant couldn't control its production. What's more, Kitman wrote, "the oil companies hated it, a powerful disincentive for the fledgling GM, which was loath to jeopardize relations with these mighty power brokers."
In February 1923, filling stations began selling so-called leaded gasoline. Midgley wasn't there. He was "in bed with severe lead poisoning," according to a Smithsonian article on leaded gas.
The poisoning was no surprise to Midgley. Lead's toxicity had been known since 1854. It also shouldn't have been a shock that men working in GM's tetraethyl lead factory "showed stunning signs of mental deterioration, from memory loss to a stumbling loss of coordination to sudden twitchy bursts of rage," according to a 2013 article in Wired magazine. By October 1924, 32 of the 49 factory workers were hospitalized. Five died.
Decades passed and engines burned lead with dire consequences. In 1986, the federal government outlawed the use of lead as a gas additive, and the mean blood lead level in the American population dropped more than 75% in 15 years. But the damage had already been done.
A study done in 1985 by the Environmental Protection Agency found that as many as 5,000 people in the U.S. died every year from lead-related heart disease prior to the federal prohibition on leaded gas. A 1988 congressional report done by the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry showed that 2 million children had blood lead levels reduced every year, to below toxic levels, between 1970 and 1987 as the use of leaded gasoline was phased out.
Kitman, in The Nation, said that "one can conservatively estimate that a total of about 68 million young children had toxic exposures to lead from gasoline from 1927 to 1987."
Considering all the toxicity and air pollution, it's tempting to think about how different things could've been.
Ford didn't use leaded gasoline in his glorified bicycle and home-built engine. Though he ended up making all his vehicles run on petroleum-based fuel, he almost didn't use gasoline. In 1925, Ford praised vegetable-derived fuels like ethanol.
"The fuel of the future is going to come from fruit like that sumach out by the road, or from apples, weeds, sawdust - almost anything," Ford told the New York Times. "There is fuel in every bit of vegetable matter that can be fermented. There's enough alcohol in one year's yield of an acre of potatoes to drive the machinery necessary to cultivate the fields for a hundred years."
Spokane bike summit
The annual bike summit by Cascade Bicycle Club and Washington Bikes is being held in Spokane next year, and the organizers are seeking proposals for presentations and workshops.
The 2020 summit, which also focuses on walking, active transportation and disability rights, will be held on April 26 and 27 at the Spokane Convention Center. The theme is "Shift: From Ideas to Action."
The summit's planners want "innovative, thought provoking, action-oriented content related to biking, walking, active transportation, disability rights and transportation justice from Washington state and beyond."
For more information about the summit, visit cascade.org. Questions about presentation and workshop proposals should be directed to Tamar Shuhendler at tamars@cascade.org. The deadline to submit proposals is Sunday.

Texto completo: The holidays are here, and for many parents, it's all about managing their kids' expectations. They think they need to give their kids the biggest presents, the most presents and the coolest presents. But trust me: Little Sally won't be scarred for life if she doesn't get a pony.
It's OK to want the best for your kids — we all do. But you should never put yourself in a financial bind to make their holiday dreams come true. That's not what Christmas is about. While other parents are shelling out hundreds or even thousands of dollars to give their kids the "perfect" Christmas, you can teach your little ones about contentment.
Contentment isn't a money issue, even though it has a huge impact on your child's future. It's a heart issue. Content people may not have the best of everything, but they make the best of everything.
Without contentment, people often try to fill the void in their hearts by cramming it full of more and more stuff. As a parent, you've got to prepare your children to defend themselves against this threat.
There's lots of research out there showing children are aware of what they have in comparison to what others have at a super-young age. Marketers fight for their attention early on, and by default, they're fighting for your money.
Make sure your kids know the newness of stuff isn't what funds their happiness or their value. Their worth goes far beyond a robo-unicorn, name-brand clothes or the iPhone 73 that everyone else has.
If you have teens, let them know if they pursue material things they're going to be a hamster on a wheel for the rest of their lives. They'll keep going around and around, always thinking the next thing is the one that will make them happy. But, of course, it won't. They'll just run in circles, wasting all their time and energy, and ultimately going nowhere. What God has in store for them is so much bigger than that.
One last reminder: Contentment isn't about age. It's about maturity. I've met 8-year-olds who get this, and 48-year-olds who don't.
Your child can probably tell where your heart is regarding material wants and desires. So, be sure to give yourself a heart-check and show your child what real happiness, joy and contentment look like.
If you or your kids are struggling with contentment this season, I have a whole episode of "The Rachel Cruze Show" with advice on how to have more gratitude over the holidays. Remember, more is caught than taught. When your kids see you acting out of gratitude, it can have a huge impact on how they view things, too!

Texto completo: One word was used to epitomize the entire 20th century.
Was it "progress," to mark the march of civilization from buggies to astronauts and the iPhone?
Maybe "upheaval," to delineate genocides and civic unrest?
No.
Try "jazz," to describe not only music, but the sweep and swing of the quintessential American century, and the cultural flows that invigorated it.
Who gets to decide such weighty, wordy things? The little-known American Dialect Society, or ADS, founded in 1889 and dedicated to the study of the English language in North America.
ADS has been picking a word of the year since 1990, longer than any other entity. Its members selected "jazz" from dozens of possible words in January 2000.
Now fast forward to the first week of 2020, when 300 to 400 of the society's language scholars are expected to meet in New Orleans to determine the word of 2019, as well as the even more consequential word of the decade that ends on New Year's Eve. The word of the previous decade, by the way, was "google," meaning "to search the internet."
Words of the year chosen by the ADS are not necessarily new words; they could be old ones used in new ways, said Marianna Di Paolo, emeritus linguistics professor and ADS member from the University of Utah. One example is "occupy," connected to the 2011 Occupy Wall Street protest against inequality.
During the last decade, the words of each year have bubbled out of the high-boiling soup of turbulent and tech-conscious times:
"App" in 2010. "Occupy" in 2011. "Hashtag" in 2012. "Because X" (a modern construction illustrated by the example, "Why would men wear capes? Because fashion") in 2013.
"#BlackLivesMatter" in 2014. "They" as a singular pronoun in 2015. "Dumpster fire" (describing election-related "public discourse and preoccupations") in 2016. "Fake news" in 2017. Last year, "tender-age shelter" (a euphemism referencing the facilities in which some immigrant children were separated from their parents). It beat out "the wall" (at the southern border).
The word of the decade won't necessarily be one of the yearly winners, said Ben Zimmer, the internationally known linguist and language columnist for The Wall Street Journal, who once penned the "On Language" column for The New York Times Magazine. The ADS draws up lists of candidates that may not become words of the year, but might still have a shot at being the 2010-19 representative.
Asked what he thinks the word of the decade will be, Zimmer was initially noncommittal.
"I wouldn't be surprised if 'they' as a singular pronoun does very well," he said.

The season of Adam Driver has been a full decade in the making

Texto completo: Watching a scene primarily concerned with the dynamic between a film's protagonist and his romantic rival, a viewer might not expect the random guy in the corner to attract too much attention. And yet as Oscar Isaac and Justin Timberlake's characters in 2013's 'Inside Llewyn Davis' record a novelty song begging President Kennedy not to shoot them into space, it isn't just their harmonizing or the lyrics that make the bizarre tune work, but the manner in which their screenmate Adam Driver punctuates it with comical noises and refrains " 'Outer … space!' " delivered in his trademark baritone.
That's Driver in a nutshell " someone who, in part thanks to his large presence and general way of being, can't help but command the screen. HBO's 'Girls,' on which he broke out as the volatile Adam Sackler, even features a scene in which another character notes that he 'does sort of look like the original man.' The episode aired in 2012, early in a decade that proved to be star-making for the Oscar-nominated actor, and which he has capped with a robust fall slate: He stars as a lead in two films, 'Marriage Story' and 'The Report,' and plays a villain in the upcoming holiday blockbuster 'Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.'
So how did the season of Adam Driver come to be? There's the aesthetic intrigue mentioned above, which once led the Guardian to ask the lanky actor about 'not being the standard Hollywood McHunk.' He candidly responded, 'I have been told before that I have an unusual face. But my face is my face.' His success is probably due more to how that sense of grounded honesty comes through in his performances. Driver, who trained at Juilliard after serving in the Marines, broadcasts a quiet intensity that can capture a range of feelings, sometimes all at once. In the earlier seasons of 'Girls,' for instance, Adam's mannerisms often display a mixture of pent-up rage and emotional vulnerability.
Driver has already earned accolades for his performance in Noah Baumbach's 'Marriage Story,' released Friday on Netflix; he won the Gotham Award for best actor Monday night, bolstering his stance as a front-runner in the Oscar race. Baumbach cast Driver in three other projects before this one, and it becomes clear while watching 'Marriage Story' that, as was the case with co-star Scarlett Johansson, the character was written with Driver in mind. They play a couple " theater director Charlie Barber and actress Nicole " whose marriage crumbles over misaligned priorities. Charlie's company is in New York, where the Barbers have raised their young son for most of his life. Nicole, who has long indulged Charlie's ego by putting off her dream of returning home to Los Angeles, moves back for work when they separate.
What follows is a meditation on divorce, a compassionate look at how it can liberate two people but still decimate their spirits as they reevaluate their life together. Baumbach infuses his script with comedy, but it's when the tension between Charlie and Nicole climaxes that the actors shine brightest. When an attempt to hash out the details of their divorce without lawyers escalates to a screaming match, Charlie, red-faced with frustration, shouts at Nicole, 'Every day I wake up and wish you were dead.' He immediately bursts into tears, falling to his knees and embracing Nicole's legs.
In a recent Hollywood Reporter interview, Driver said that, with such scenes, 'You don't push for emotion. It either happens or it doesn't.' He credited his ability to so transparently portray clashing feelings like Charlie's to the quality of a script, which rings true " several of his strongest performances are tied to acclaimed writers, including Lena Dunham, Jim Jarmusch, Spike Lee and Martin Scorsese.
The team effort is especially evident with Driver's more understated scenes. His final episode of 'Girls,' given the aptly awkward title 'What Will We Do This Time About Adam?' begins with Adam's desire to prove to his ex-girlfriend Hannah Horvath (Dunham), who he discovers is pregnant, that he has matured into a man who can help raise her child. Following the reunion is a dreamlike sequence that comes crashing down as they sit opposite one another at a diner. Though they continue to discuss the logistics of moving in together " Adam even suggests they get married " it dawns on them that the relationship won't work out. Hannah's eyes well up as Adam smiles wistfully, stuttering until his words come to a halt. They sit in silence for a bit. He comments on the quality of his soup.
Driver's turn as Senate staffer Daniel J. Jones in 'The Report' is similarly internal, this time a relatively restrained depiction of anger as he spends years investigating the CIA's use of torture after 9/11. Driver faces the tough task of anchoring a film that heavily involves sifting through paperwork in a confined space, but he accomplishes it by, as the New York Times put it, expressing that fury 'not in explosive confrontations, but in a gradually hardening resolve to protect and disseminate his findings.'
'With Driver, there's always a sense of something leashed, and his characters seem to be operating on a plane above and beyond everyone else,' reviewer Jeannette Catsoulis continues.
It's true of his Oscar-nominated role in Lee's 'BlacKkKlansman' as Flip Zimmerman, a brooding Jewish cop who goes undercover to take down the Ku Klux Klan. It's also true of his characters in two Jarmusch films: a bus driver devoted to poetry in 'Paterson,' a quiet film about the idyllic rituals of daily life; and a small-town officer in the horror-tinged absurdist comedy 'The Dead Don't Die,' who states from the moment things start to turn upside-down that zombies are to blame. (Or 'ghouls,' as he amusingly deadpans.)
And it's of course true of Kylo Ren, the Force-wielding 'Star Wars' villain who operates on another plane in the most literal sense. 'The Force Awakens' introduced Kylo as a Darth Vader 2.0, the ruthless son of two legends " Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) " who, in his quest for power, struggles to extinguish the light within him. Driver's greatest talent is arguably his ability to keep a character's fiercest emotions brimming beneath the surface, releasing them in bursts both great and small.
He avoids making a cartoonish sci-fi villain of Kylo by approaching him as he would a character in any 'prestige' project. There's a strange sort of kinship between his conflicted performance in 'The Last Jedi,' which allowed for a deeper exploration of Kylo's interiority, and Charlie Barber's reactions to the strain of divorce, or even Adam Sackler's battle with his more primal tendencies. The season of Adam Driver, a compressed display of the actor's talents that will only continue to spark awards buzz through February, has been nearly a decade in the making.

Texto completo: It was Gerald R. Ford who said, “an impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history.”
Ford said that in 1970, and he wasn’t talking about President Richard Nixon. He was proposing the impeachment of a Supreme Court justice.
Then-Congressman Ford, the House Republican leader, “touched off an angry floor debate,” according to a New York Times report, “by suggesting that Justice William O. Douglas might have had ties with gambling and underworld figures.” Ford said the 71-year-old justice was “unfit and should be removed.” He accused Douglas of espousing “hippie-yippie style revolution” in his writings.
The House Judiciary Committee investigated for six months, but there never was a trial in the Senate. Justice Douglas served on the Court until his retirement in 1975. Then it was Gerald R. Ford who appointed his successor, having become president in 1974 when Nixon resigned under threat of impeachment.
Although it may seem that impeachment is a rare occurrence, the subject comes up often in American political history.
“The Framers foresaw that impeachment might be subject to superheated partisanship,” wrote Harvard Law School professor Raoul Berger in his 1973 book, “Impeachment: The Constitutional Problems.” Berger noted that the impeachment of President Harry Truman was suggested during the Korean War, there were repeated demands for Nixon’s impeachment over the war in Vietnam and John F. Kennedy believed that “if he had not moved to expel Soviet nuclear missiles from Cuba at the time of the confrontation with Khrushchev, he ‘would have been impeached.’”
Dive into the scholarly research or take Jerry Ford’s word for it: An impeachable offense is whatever the House says it is, and conviction is whatever two-thirds of the Senate “considers to be sufficiently serious to require removal of the accused from office.”
The House of Representatives can impeach President Donald Trump, even if he didn’t commit any crime. Impeachment trials are nothing like criminal trials. After an impeachment trial, the prosecutors and the jury have to stand trial themselves—in their next election.
One-third of the United States Senate and every member of the House of Representatives will be on the ballot in November 2020, unless they’ve chosen not to run for re-election or somebody knocks them out in a primary.
Impeachment is politically risky, yet House Democrats are pursuing it at the frantic pace of a Keystone Kops chase. The Intelligence Committee’s 300-page impeachment report is a rush job that draws heavily on the opinions and impressions of bureaucratic specialists who clearly are appalled that the president isn’t relying on their advice.
This type of conflict between bureaucratic experts and elected leaders isn’t new. In the early 1980s, President Ronald Reagan sent a handwritten letter to Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev, which is on display at the Reagan Library. A sign next to the letter reads, “Despite the State Department’s many attempts to change it, the President finally demanded that his own personal draft be sent to Brezhnev accompanied by the State Department’s thoughts in a separate document.”
Imagine the news headlines that House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff’s leaky crew could have made from that.
They certainly puffed up the importance of government workers who were never elected by anybody. “NSC staff had prepared a standard package of talking points for the President based on official U.S. policy,” the Intelligence Committee report states in a section titled, “The President’s Misconduct.” The talking points “included recommendations to encourage President Zelensky to continue to promote anti-corruption reforms in Ukraine,” which was “a pillar of American foreign policy in the country” going all the way back to “the 1990s” but — cue the dramatic music — “this call would deviate significantly from that script.”
Of course, the president has a perfect right to deviate from the staff’s script and to make changes in the policy, but House Democrats, most of them, contend that Trump was motivated by the desire for personal political advantage.
Here’s what Trump said to the president of Ukraine: “I would like you to do us a favor, though, because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike … I would like to have the attorney general call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.”
And also, “I would like [Rudy Giuliani] to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the attorney general. Rudy very much knows what’s happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great.”
And also, “The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great.”
In all three of those excerpts, Trump is asking Zelensky to work with the attorney general of the United States, William Barr. The AG is heading up an investigation into the suspicious origins of the Trump-Russia story that was used to justify a secret counter-intelligence investigation, then a secret warrant to spy on an American who was an adviser to the Trump campaign and then a two-year investigation by a special prosecutor that ultimately found nothing that linked Trump to Russia.
Barr’s investigation follows a narrower investigation by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz. The IG has jurisdiction to investigate current employees of the government, but lacks wider authority. Still, Horowitz’s report is expected to shed light on the actions of FBI employees and others who made questionable decisions to investigate Trump during the 2016 campaign.
The report is set for release on Monday, Dec. 9.
Is it possible that the Democrats’ noisy rush to impeachment is a massive misdirection to neutralize the damage from coming reports about the actions of officials during the Obama administration?
We’ll see. Meanwhile, the signs of political damage are beginning to appear.
On Thursday evening, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi held a one-hour televised town-hall meeting on CNN. Thirty-four minutes in, she was pleading with the audience, “Could we not have any more questions about impeachment?”
By November, that may be the Democrats’ campaign slogan.

Ross Douthat: Bernie Sanders and the twilight of the technocrats

Texto completo: In last Sunday’s column, I argued that Democrats looking for someone to unify their fractious coalition should take another glance at Bernie Sanders — on the grounds that he’s more popular across the party’s different factions, more unifying, more exciting and more potentially appealing to non-liberals than his critics tend to assume.
There was one point I gestured at but didn’t stress, which is that in nominating Bernie, the Democrats would be embracing one of the key forces in American politics right now — the distrust of technocracy, the sense that the smartest guys in each political coalition can’t really be trusted, the feeling that the whole model of credentialed meritocracy is corrupt and self-dealing and doesn’t deliver on its promises.
In the Democratic coalition more than the Republican one, meritocracy and technocracy have long been unifying forces. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama represented somewhat different party factions, but they both embodied wonkery , a vision of competence and expertise governing to some extent above ideology, in which there are assumed to be “correct answers” to policy dilemmas that a disinterested observer could acknowledge and the right technocrat achieve.
The candidates carrying on this tradition in the Democratic primary are Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren and the late-entering Michael Bloomberg — Buttigieg and Bloomberg as center-left figures, Warren as the progressive promising to direct her “I’ve got a plan for that!” wonkery to more ambitious ends.
But Sanders is different; he has policy plans, too, but he’s fundamentally a moralist arguing for a politics of righteous struggle, in a way that separates him from Warren as well as from Buttigieg or Bloomberg. And just as Donald Trump benefited in 2016 — and figures like Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush suffered — from a sense that the GOP’s libertarian and neoconservative intelligentsia bore some responsibility for the double disasters of Iraq and the financial crisis, Sanders benefits from a widespread left-wing disappointment with what the Obama-era politics of expertise produced.
This disappointment has been strongest on health care, where Obamacare’s most popular provision was the simple socialism of the Medicaid expansion rather than the complicated, expert-fashioned architecture of the exchanges. But it’s also palpable in education policy, where after two decades worth of technocratic experiments — Race to the Top, Common Core, etc. — we have chronically disappointing test scores, persistent racial gaps, the same basic stagnation despite reformers’ best-laid plans.
On both issues and others, the appeal of Sanders has less to do with the details of his plans and more to do with a simple formulation: The experts had their chance; let the moralists and radicals have theirs.
However, that’s only one possible response to disillusionment with technocracy. The other response is to prefer a return to transactional politics, to dealmakers who keep the system running rather than optimizing for efficiency, to machine politicians who aren’t going to dramatically improve the status quo but also aren’t likely to embrace clever plans that accidentally make it worse.
This is clearly the appeal of the other non-technocrat in the Democratic field, the still-front-running Joe Biden. Of course the former vice president also has plans and policy papers — no Democrat lacks them — but even more than Sanders he’s running as a non-wonk, an anti-technocrat, the guy who’ll shout “malarkey!” when the clever McKinsey guy shows up with the white paper and says you need to overhaul a popular program because there’s a more efficient way.
Despite his constant invocations of Obama, Biden no less than Sanders (and much more than Buttigieg and Warren) is running against the Obama governmental style, and especially the first-term Obamanaut confidence in intelligence and expertise as the essential oil of governance. If Sanders woos voters by saying, why not elect a moralist instead of an expert , Biden woos them by saying, how about we just elect a [expletive] politician?
In this contrast Sanders comes out ahead with the many Democratic voters who don’t think old-fashioned dealmaking is really possible anymore, and also with the important swath of disaffected voters who don’t like politicians or the Democratic Party, but do want to experiment with radicalism in Washington, D.C.
But Biden’s status quo-oriented version of the anti-technocratic pitch is better suited to the economic moment. America has systemic problems, certainly, but institutional sclerosis and futility are much more tolerable when the GDP is running hot and unemployment is at a generational low. As long as that environment persists, there is an obvious constituency, in Biden’s party and in the country, for pushing out Trump but otherwise eschewing grand ambitions, and just letting the expansion run as long as it can go.
So if the exhaustion with technocracy makes a socialist a viable nominee, that exhaustion plus a solid economy explains why the socialist may yet fall to an even more archaic breed — a party politician.

Texto completo: Fans of the late Oxford author Larry Brown need wait no longer to own a collection of his career short works in one volume, with the release of Algonquin's "Tiny Love: The Complete Stories of Larry Brown."
It was fitting that writer Jonathan Miles, (author of the novels "Anatomy of a Miracle," "Want Not" and "Dear America Airlines," and who considered Brown to be both close friend and mentor since they met in Oxford in the early '90s) would be the one to contribute the foreword to the book.
"Larry published six novels, a memoir, a book of essays, and all the stories (in this new book), carving his name, indelibly, onto the thick tree trunk of American literature," Miles states in the foreword. "He strained and he faltered, yes, but he never lost his faith."
Without any training in writing or previous publication of a single piece, Brown literally taught himself to write – and he persevered through seven years of rejections until the publication of his first collection of short stories, "Facing the Music," in 1988. After his first novel, "Dirty Work," was published, he would quit his job as a firefighter in Oxford to devote his efforts fulltime to writing.
Among other recognitions, Brown would go on to win the Mississippi Institute of Arts and Letters Award for Fiction, the Mississippi Governor's Award for Excellence in the Arts, and the Southern Book Award for Fiction – twice.
He died of an apparent heart attack at his home near Oxford in 2004.
Miles, a former columnist for the New York Times, served as a contributing editor to several national magazines, and his journalistic work appeared in the annual Best American Sports Writing and Best American Crime writing anthologies. A former longtime resident of Oxford, he now lives in rural New Jersey.
Miles shares his thoughts and memories about his friendship with Brown below.
How did the idea come about to publish all of Larry Brown's work in one volume, and how were you chosen to write the foreword to this book?
The idea had been bouncing around, among Larry's family and friends, for the last decade or more. The links between his two story collections – "Facing the Music" in 1988 and "Big Bad Love" in 1990 – are so strong that combining them felt like a natural and graceful merger. The greater desire, however, was to finally corral all the stray stories that Larry published in magazines and anthologies, so as to gather the entirety of his short fiction into one definitive volume. Those includes his wild masterpiece, "A Roadside Resurrection," which appeared in the Paris Review, as well as "Tiny Love," the prickly, lovelorn title story, which Larry published in a charity anthology, as well as the early stories he published in biker and horror magazines. I'd been shepherding the idea along, over the years, and was honored when Algonquin, Larry's longtime publisher, asked me to write the foreword.
Tell me about your friendship with Brown. How did you meet him, and what did you learn from him as a writer?
I met Larry in 1992, a very memorable meeting that I wrote about in the foreword. It involves dancing on a table! Despite a 21-year age difference, we were instant pals. The Brown family adopted me, in just about every way, and neither Larry's passing nor my move up north ever changed that – when I'm with them, I'm home.
As for writing, I've often said that my writing classroom was Larry's pickup, and my classes were the hours Larry and I spent riding Lafayette County backroads. He often traced the origins of stories and scenes on those drives, pointing out the location of some real-life event and then explaining how he'd worked it into fiction, how he'd transformed it into art. Sharing the recipe with me, in a sense.
But the greatest lesson Larry gave me, and gave every artist, was the example of his persistence. Despite years of rejection, he never stopped writing. The only failure in art, he taught me, is not making art. You must always keep working.
What do you admire about his work, and what drew you to it?
Larry Brown wrote about human frailties, about people in dire straits – emotional, romantic, financial, existential. The setting was almost always the rougher corners of north Mississippi, but the frailties were universal. Good people doing bad things, bad people doing good things. With limitless compassion, Larry sought to reconcile such human mysteries.
From the first page he liked to load his characters with trouble – he called this "sandbagging" – and then chronicle their struggles to cast off this load, like the Old Testament's God lobbing ordeals at Job. Yet by gauging what they could endure Larry showed what all of us can endure. There was a lot of darkness in Larry's work but tremendous light, too.
Why was it important to finally publish all of Brown's short work into one volume?
The hope is that this big new volume will draw a new generation to Larry Brown's work and will reboot appreciation for one of the most singular voices in American literature. The people Larry wrote about don't often appear in literary fiction, or, when they do, are rarely afforded the breadth of humanity that Larry gave them, the full bandwidth of their existence.
A young novelist from Alabama recently wrote me to say that he'd never met folks like himself and his family in books until reading his first Larry Brown book. Tim McGraw, a huge Larry fan, once told me that, unlike with most books he reads, he "recognized" the people in Larry's work.
I hope this volume kindles more moments like that. I hope it leads more readers into Larry Brown's north Mississippi, down those windy backroads. And I hope it helps to further cement his legacy as one of this state's – and for that matter this nation's – greatest writers.
What are some of your favorites among Brown's work, and why?
In putting this collection together, I was struck, anew, by his story "Samaritans," which appeared in "Facing the Music." The setup for the story sounds like a joke setup: a little kid walks into a bar. But the story veers into dark, unsettling directions, and ultimately just claws at your heart.
I've probably read it dozens of times but each time I do it feels slightly different – tonally, morally, the works. Certain paintings are like that; there's always something new to see. Likewise, certain songs. That's a hallmark of great art: it feels inexhaustibly alive.

Texto completo: Ronan Farrow's "Catch and Kill" (Little Brown) explores corporate culture concealing well-known predators from the consequences of their actions, as winsome women were "thrown under the bus" to protect powerful presences in news and entertainment. Farrow's exposé might be the 2019 Book of the Year.
Rosanna Arquette, who alleges assault by Harvey Weinstein in the early 1990s, assessed the systemic seediness as being "a cabal that was deeper and wider than Weinstein. 'This is the big boys' club, the Hollywood mafia.... They protect each other.'" Millions were spent as hush money to buy victims' silence. Prominent law firm Bois Schiller reaped huge profits to kill coverage by The New York Times while, simultaneously, representing the paper.
NBC Universal, Farrow claims, killed reporting on Weinstein because of his threats — part of supposedly widespread intimidation of parties to camouflage his deviancy — to expose misbehavior at NBC for which the television network entered nondisclosure agreements to silence victims.
NBC News Chairman Andy Lack is no stranger to Mississippi, being involved with the Overby Center for Southern Journalism and Politics at Ole Miss and Mississippi Today. Weinstein was apparently in regular communication with Lack, and Lack had no shortage of internal exposure, given that NBC's morning news poster boy, Matt Lauer, is allegedly a variation on a theme of Weinstein: "Bottom line, it's trouble that the president of NBC News is talking directly with Harvey and lying... about it."
Lack is said to have "pursued sexual relationships with underlings and talent.... Lack was 'almost unrelenting.'" One executive stated of a corporate culture at NBC fostering predation, "The reason that you have these cultural problems — he created that!"
Lack and Lauer are not the only men accused of misbehavior at NBC News: Tom Brokaw, David Corvo, Mark Halperin, and Chris Matthews are also named in "Catch and Kill":
"Six, and then twelve, and then dozens of current and former employees gave me a similar account of a permissive atmosphere when it came to harassment by prominent men at the network. Several of the employees said that they believed the years-long pattern of settlements had allowed the behavior to continue. Some said that the problems deepened under Andy Lack's leadership. When Lack began his first tenure as president of NBC News, in the nineties, 'it was a fundamental shift of, all of a sudden, a tolerance for abusive behavior, whether it was sexually harassing or it was just verbally abusive,' Linda Vester, who raised the first complaint about Brokaw, told me. 'Degrading, humiliating talk, mainly to women. And that became the climate under Andy Lack. It was just — it was very stark.'"
The news and entertainment industry has been seen as a hotbed of sin and inquiry since the Fatty Arbuckle scandal, almost 100 years ago. I cannot speak sanctimoniously: Comcast — which owns NBCUniversal — Founder Ralph Roberts' widow Suzanne Roberts shared first-cousins with three branches of my Alabama family. Comcast's senior executive vice president is the brother-in-law of my younger sister.
Ole Miss faces a bigger conundrum: Given problems with fraternity boys vandalizing the Emmett Till Memorial and the unseemly selection of a new chancellor, Ole Miss needs no questions raised about its journalism school. "Catch and Kill" examines whether the purpose of the Fourth Estate is to protect powerful interests or ferret out truth and promote the public interest.

Texto completo: How Bernie and Biden both channel an exhaustion with the experts.
In last Sunday's column, I argued that Democrats looking for someone to unify their fractious coalition should take another glance at Bernie Sanders -- on the grounds that he's more popular across the party's different factions, more unifying, more exciting and more potentially appealing to non-liberals than his critics tend to assume.
There was one point I gestured at but didn't stress, which is that in nominating Bernie, the Democrats would be embracing one of the key forces in American politics right now -- the distrust of technocracy, the sense that the smartest guys in each political coalition can't really be trusted, the feeling that the whole model of credentialed meritocracy is corrupt and self-dealing and doesn't deliver on its promises.
[ Listen to "The Argument" podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt. ]
In the Democratic coalition more than the Republican one, meritocracy and technocracy have long been unifying forces. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama represented somewhat different party factions, but they both embodied wonkery, a vision of competence and expertise governing to some extent above ideology, in which there are assumed to be "correct answers" to policy dilemmas that a disinterested observer could acknowledge and the right technocrat achieve.
The candidates carrying on this tradition in the Democratic primary are Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren and the late-entering Michael Bloomberg -- Buttigieg and Bloomberg as center-left figures, Warren as the progressive promising to direct her "I've got a plan for that!" wonkery to more ambitious ends.
But Sanders is different; he has policy plans, too, but he's fundamentally a moralist arguing for a politics of righteous struggle, in a way that separates him from Warren as well as from Buttigieg or Bloomberg. And just as Donald Trump benefited in 2016 -- and figures like Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush suffered -- from a sense that the G.O.P.'s libertarian and neoconservative intelligentsia bore some responsibility for the double disasters of Iraq and the financial crisis, Sanders benefits from a widespread left-wing disappointment with what the Obama-era politics of expertise produced.
This disappointment has been strongest on health care, where Obamacare's most popular provision was the simple socialism of the Medicaid expansion rather than the complicated, expert-fashioned architecture of the exchanges. But it's also palpable in education policy, where after two decades worth of technocratic experiments -- Race to the Top, Common Core, etc. -- we have chronically disappointing test scores, persistent racial gaps, the same basic stagnation despite reformers' best-laid plans.
On both issues and others, the appeal of Sanders has less to do with the details of his plans and more to do with a simple formulation: The experts had their chance; let the moralists and radicals have theirs.
However, that's only one possible response to disillusionment with technocracy. The other response is to prefer a return to transactional politics, to dealmakers who keep the system running rather than optimizing for efficiency, to machine politicians who aren't going to dramatically improve the status quo but also aren't likely to embrace clever plans that accidentally make it worse.
This is clearly the appeal of the other non-technocrat in the Democratic field, the still-front-running Joseph Biden. Of course the former vice president also has plans and policy papers -- no Democrat lacks them -- but even more than Sanders he's running as a non-wonk, an anti-technocrat, the guy who'll shout "malarkey!" when the clever McKinsey guy shows up with the white paper and says you need to overhaul a popular program because there's a more efficient way.
Despite his constant invocations of Obama, Biden no less than Sanders (and much more than Buttigieg and Warren) is running against the Obama governmental style, and especially the first-term Obamanaut confidence in intelligence and expertise as the essential oil of governance. If Sanders woos voters by saying, why not elect a moralist instead of an expert, Biden woos them by saying, how about we just elect a [expletive] politician?
In this contrast Sanders comes out ahead with the many Democratic voters who don't think old-fashioned dealmaking is really possible anymore, and also with the important swath of disaffected voters who don't like politicians or the Democratic Party, but do want to experiment with radicalism in Washington, D.C.
But Biden's status quo-oriented version of the anti-technocratic pitch is better suited to the economic moment. America has systemic problems, certainly, but institutional sclerosis and futility are much more tolerable when the G.D.P. is running hot and unemployment is at a generational low. As long as that environment persists, there is an obvious constituency, in Biden's party and in the country, for pushing out Trump but otherwise eschewing grand ambitions, and just letting the expansion run as long as it can go.
So if the exhaustion with technocracy makes a socialist a viable nominee, that exhaustion plus a solid economy explains why the socialist may yet fall to an even more archaic breed -- a party politician.

Texto completo: The American criminal justice system has never been as good about ferreting out truth and justice as most people would like to think. The system relies on the memories and judgments of human beings, which makes it fallible and, worse, subject to manipulation.
A new in-depth look at the career of a single jailhouse informant brings the system’s failings into sharp relief and stands as an irrefutable indictment of capital punishment and the criminal justice system itself.
The article, by investigative reporter Pamela Colloff (published by ProPublica and the New York Times Magazine), follows the life of a two-bit grifter named Paul Skalnik who routinely spun lies about fellow jail inmates - including those facing murder charges - to get special treatment for his own crimes, which included fraud, grand theft and child sexual abuse.
One of the men convicted based on Skalnik’s testimony, James M. Dailey, recently received a reprieve from his scheduled November execution date until Dec. 30 to allow his lawyers time to pursue an appeal based on new evidence that he did not commit murder in 1985.
There was no evidence placing Dailey at the murder scene, and the killer, who initially fingered Dailey, has recanted, saying he acted alone.
That leaves the apparent perjury by Skalnik that Dailey - who says he knew Skalnik was a snitch and refused to talk to him in jail - confessed to the crime.
It would be comforting to say, well, this is an aberration. But it’s not. Skalnik’s testimony helped send dozens of people to prison, and three others besides Dailey to death row.
But it’s not just Skalnik. At least one in five exonerations involve convictions based at least in part on testimony by jailhouse informants. In murder cases, the National Registry of Exonerations reports at least 70% of exonerations involved lying witnesses and official misconduct.
Florida is the nation’s leader in murder exonerations with 29 cases; California has had five convicted murders later exonerated. A study published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of the Sciences estimated that at least 4% of the 2,500 people on death row nationwide are innocent of the crimes for which they have been condemned.
That’s roughly 100 people.
Statistics can be cold. The story of how Skalnik played the system puts it into a human dimension.
As do the stories of Cameron Todd Willingham, Carlos DeLuna and others put to death despite clear signs of innocence, or, at a minimum, significant doubts as to their guilt.

Texto completo: Working out on an empty stomach could amplify the health benefits of the activity, according to a well-timed new study of the interplay of meal timing, metabolic health and moving. The study, which involved sedentary men and moderate cycling, suggests that whether and when we eat may affect how exercise affects us.
In general, any exercise improves our health. But a wealth of recent science and personal experience indicates that different people can respond to similar exercise routines in different ways. Even if everyone completes the same amount of exercise, some people become more fit than others, or lose more weight, or gain greater control of their blood sugar.
Most exercise scientists say that our genetics, diets, physiques, temperaments and other subtle aspects of our lives act in concert to shape how our bodies react to exercise.
But some researchers suspect meal timing matters as well. Working muscles need fuel during exercise, mostly in the form of sugar (glucose) or fat. That fuel can come from our most recent meal, once its component sugars and fats reach our bloodstreams, or from our bodies’ stores of fats and sugars. We all have such stores, especially of fat, some of it residing in our muscles and marbling them like pricey sirloin.
This muscle fat becomes problematic if we accumulate too much of it. Fatty muscles do not respond well to the hormone insulin, which directs sugar from the blood into the muscles. As a result, excess fat can contribute to insulin resistance, high blood sugar levels and increased risks for Type 2 diabetes and other metabolic conditions.
So, researchers at the University of Bath in England and other institutions began to wonder whether meal timing might influence how much muscle fat we burn during exercise, which would then affect the long-term metabolic consequences of exercise and help to explain, in part, why some people get more out of exercise than others.
To look into those issues, they recruited 30 overweight, sedentary men. (They plan to do a follow-up study with women.) The researchers tested the men’s fitness and insulin sensitivity and then divided them into three groups.
One, as a control, continued their usual lives. The other two groups started supervised exercise in the morning three times a week, riding stationary bicycles at a moderate pace while wearing monitors and masks that tracked their heart rates and the amount of fat and sugar they burned. The researchers also asked them periodically how they felt while riding.
One exercise group also downed a vanilla-flavored shake two hours before the ride (with no other breakfast) while the other group swallowed a similar-tasting placebo drink, containing water, flavoring and no calories. In other words, the placebo group rode on an empty stomach, but did not know it.
After exercise, each rider received the drink he had not previously swallowed. The riders who had fasted got the shake and the other group the placebo.
This routine continued for six weeks. Afterward, the scientists crunched numbers and turned up some telling differences between the groups. As expected, the control group’s fitness and insulin sensitivity remained the same, while the men in both exercise groups had improved their fitness and narrowed their waistlines, although few had lost weight.
The riders who had pedaled on an empty stomach, however, had incinerated about twice as much fat during each ride as the men who consumed the shake first. The riders all had burned about the same number of calories while pedaling, but more of those calories came from fat when the men did not eat first.
Those riders also showed greater improvements in insulin sensitivity at the end of the study and had developed higher levels of certain proteins in their muscles that influence how well muscle cells respond to insulin and use blood sugar.
On the whole, these findings suggest that “you can probably get more out of your workout without increasing its intensity or duration by exercising before breakfast,” said Javier Gonzalez, a professor of physiology and nutrition at the University of Bath, who oversaw the new study, which appeared in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism.
The reasons for this extra metabolic boost are complex but most likely involve slimming of muscle fat, he said. The fasted riders’ bodies had to turn to internal energy stores for fuel, including fat from their muscles. (Interestingly, the fasted riders did not feel as if their workouts were more draining than the other group, according to subjective ratings of their exertions.)
This study looked primarily at insulin sensitivity, though, and not other aspects of exercise and metabolism, including weight loss. (Other research by some of the same investigators have looked at how eating before exercise may affect appetite.) The researchers also could not tell whether skipping lunch before an early-evening workout would have the same effects, although it seemed likely, Gonzalez said.
“We believe that the key is the fasting period, rather than the time of day,” he said.
So, if you hope to use exercise to keep you healthy in the coming holiday period, you might try to get up and out early or after not eating for hours. But, Gonzalez said, if your schedule or preferences prevent you from exercising in the morning or on an empty stomach, do not sweat it.
“Any physical activity,” he said, whenever you can fit it in, “is better than none.”

Texto completo: The rare operation has implications for wounded soldiers, accident victims, cancer patients and those undergoing sex reassignment.
A 36-year-old man born without testicles received one transplanted from his identical twin brother in a six-hour operation performed on Tuesday in Belgrade, Serbia, by an international team of surgeons.
The surgery was intended to give the recipient more stable levels of the male hormone testosterone than injections could provide, to make his genitals more natural and more comfortable, and to enable him to father children, said Dr. Dicken Ko, a transplant surgeon and urology professor at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston, who flew to Belgrade to help with the procedure.
The operation was only the third known transplant of this type. The first two were performed 40 years ago in St. Louis, also for identical twins, each pair with a brother lacking testicles.
The absence of testicles is an exceedingly rare condition, but doctors say that the surgery may have broader applications for transgender people, accident victims, wounded soldiers and cancer patients. But the procedure raises questions about the ethics of transplants that are not lifesaving, and about the possibility of recipients' someday fathering children with sperm from donors who may not even be related to them.
The surgery was performed at the University Children's Clinic in Tirsova, a section of Belgrade. The Serbian brothers are doing well, doctors said. By Friday, the recipient already had normal testosterone levels.
"He's good, he looks good, his brother looks good," Dr. Ko said in a telephone interview on Friday. The donor, who already has children, should remain as fertile as he was before, despite giving up a testicle.
Dr. Ko said the brothers, who have been sharing a hospital room, were expected to go home this weekend. They preferred not to be identified or interviewed, the doctors said.
Because the patients are identical twins with the same genetic makeup, there is no concern that the recipient's body will reject the transplant, so he does not have to take the immune-suppressing drugs that most transplant patients need.

Surgeons operated on the brothers simultaneously, in adjoining rooms. The procedure was challenging because it required sewing together two arteries and two veins that were less than 2 millimeters wide.
"Once you remove the testicle from the donor, the clock starts ticking very fast," said Dr. Branko Bojovic, an expert in microsurgery at Harvard Medical School and part of the team in Belgrade.
"Within two to four hours, you have to have it re-perfused and working again," Dr. Bojovic said. Without a blood supply, a testicle is viable for only four to six hours.
It can take 30 to 60 minutes to make each of the four blood-vessel connections. But the team managed to complete them all in less than two hours, he said.
The team did not connect a structure called the vas deferens, which carries sperm out of the testicles. The surgeons could not find the tissue in the recipient needed for the connection, which means that for now, he cannot father children in the usual way.
Another operation to make the connection may be possible. Otherwise, if the recipient wants children, he might undergo a procedure to extract sperm from the testicle for in vitro fertilization. Or his twin brother's sperm could be used.
Dr. Ko and Dr. Bojovic were both part of the surgical team that performed the first penis transplant in the United States, in 2016, on a man whose penis had been removed because of cancer.
Dr. Miroslav Djordjevic, who led the team in Belgrade, specializes in urologic reconstruction and sex reassignment surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York and at the University of Belgrade. He said the brothers approached him after learning that he had performed a successful uterus transplant between twins sisters, which enabled the recipient to give birth.
Dr. Bojovic said that after the penis transplant, the surgical team received inquiries from people undergoing female-to-male sex reassignment who wondered if they might receive transplants instead of the usual surgery, which creates a penis from the patient's own tissue.
But a transplant from any donor other than an identical twin would require immune-suppressing drugs to prevent rejection. The drugs have side effects that lead some experts to argue that the bar for such transplants must be very high.
"It's becoming more of a popular topic for these patients," Dr. Bojovic said. "They say, 'If immunosuppression is getting safer, I don't want to use a big piece of tissue from my forearm or thigh or back for something that looks like phallus but isn't."'
He added that in patients having male-to-female reassignment surgery, the penis and testicles that were surgically removed are discarded, but in theory could be used for transplants.
The lead surgeon, Dr. Djordjevic, said that he had developed a surgical plan for transplanting a penis onto a body that is anatomically female, and that he hoped to begin performing that surgery within the next year or so.
"We have to do this as soon as possible, to stop putting healthy organs in the garbage," he said.
But he would not transplant testicles as part of transgender surgery, he said. Doing so would open up the thorny possibility that the recipient could have children produced by the donor's sperm. If the idea were extended to deceased organ donors, special permission would be required from them before death, or from their families.
"Then the offspring is technically whose child?" asked Dr. Ko, who is also chief medical officer at St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Boston. "It raises much debate in the literature of medical ethics."
Last year, when surgeons at Johns Hopkins Hospital transplanted a penis, scrotum and other tissue to a young soldier who had been maimed in combat, they deliberately left out the testicles. The idea that he might father children who were genetically someone else's was considered unacceptable.
The first report of a testicle transplant, by Dr. Sherman J. Silber, a fertility specialist in St. Louis, was published in a medical journal in 1978. In that case, the twin brothers were 30 when they consulted Dr. Silber.
The brother without testicles had not reached puberty until he was given testosterone at age 18, which caused a growth spurt that left him four inches taller than his brother. He needed regular testosterone injections to maintain his masculine characteristics, but the hormone levels fluctuated and sometimes caused mood swings.
He spent five years searching for a doctor who could perform a testicle transplant before he found Dr. Silber, after reading a New York Times article about his work published in 1975.
Dr. Silber said that he had performed more than 2,000 kidney transplants in rats, which required microsurgical techniques to sew together minute blood vessels the same size as those in human testicles.
"So doing a testicle transplant was not a big deal," he recalled in an interview on Thursday. "It was like just another kidney transplant in a rat." He said the operation took two hours.
Dr. Silber said that the donor was gay and the recipient straight, and that the brothers told him they wondered if the transplanted testicle might somehow alter the recipient's sexual orientation. There is no scientific reason for such an effect, and none occurred.
The transplant was a success, and the recipient eventually had five children, Dr. Silber said. A year or so later, he performed the surgery again for another pair of identical twin brothers, though he did not write up their case in a journal.
Regarding the operation in Belgrade, Dr. Silber said, "I imagine these surgeons must be pretty good, because most people wouldn't dare to try this."

Texto completo: The U.S. government had better forget about any kind of intervention in Mexico.
MIAMI -- Mexico should not agree, under any circumstances, to host United States troops -- or those from any other country -- in its territory. It's a matter of principle, sovereignty and history.
This issue arose in the aftermath of the brutal killing in Sonora state of nine members of a local Mormon family -- six children and three women, all with dual Mexican-American citizenship. Shortly after the November massacre, the family asked President Trump to designate Mexican drug traffickers as terrorists; and Mr. Trump, in an interview, said he would.
Such a designation could have severe consequences, ranging from the imposition of tariffs and sanctions on Mexico to the increasing militarization of America's southern border and more delays in the passage of the revised North American Free Trade Agreement.
However, Mexico's main concern should be the stationing of American soldiers on its soil.
For millions of Mexicans, nothing could be more worrying than the United States military operating in Mexico on the orders of a president as unpredictable as Mr. Trump, someone who has made several racist remarks about their countrymen.
According to President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Mr. Trump called him and offered to help. But it's clear that President Trump doesn't know Mr. López Obrador very well or the long history between the two countries. All Mexican schoolchildren are taught that their nation lost half its territory to the United States in 1848, and the pain of that loss remains fresh. The last time foreign troops were seen in Mexico was in 1914, when the Americans lay siege to the city of Veracruz -- and Mexicans don't want to see them again. President Trump had better forget about sending soldiers or troops of any kind to Mexico.
If the United States really wants to help Mexico in its war against drug traffickers, there are two very important steps it needs to take: First, control the flow of weapons from the United States into Mexico, and second, lower the American demand for narcotics.
Of course, neither of these is an easy or politically viable task. Given that the United States failed to control the spread of firearms after the school shootings at Columbine in 1999 (13 killed), Sandy Hook in 2012 (26 killed) and Parkland in 2018 (17 killed), the government will be unlikely to do anything now to stop the huge flow of firearms into Mexico. Seventy percent of the 106,000 guns seized as part of criminal investigations in Mexico between 2011 and 2016 were legally bought in the United States, according to a recent report by the Center for American Progress. But Congress hasn't done anything about the problem.
It would also help Mexico if Americans would use fewer drugs. It all comes down to the dynamics of supply and demand: Mexican cartels are simply filling the orders of American consumers. Over 11 million Americans misused opioids in 2017, according to a national health survey. That same year, 5.9 million people used cocaine, and nearly 41 million people smoked marijuana. Mexican drug dealers are exploiting a vast drug market that isn't about to shrink anytime soon.
Drugs are smuggled into the United States mainly through its ports of entry. Mexican drug traffickers, particularly the Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels, quickly adapt to changes in consumer taste and represent "the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States," a 2018 study conducted by the Department of Justice concluded.
In this distressing political landscape, how can Mexico and the United States work together to fight drug cartels?
Both countries must continue to share strategic and financial information on criminal groups, push for extradition (nothing scares Mexican drug dealers more than the thought of spending the rest of their lives in an American prison) and tone down the criticism on social media. President Trump tweeted that it was time "to wage WAR on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth." But posting on Twitter is no way to rule.
President López Obrador -- who has high approval ratings after one year in power -- has been very cautious when it comes to his relationship with Mr. Trump. However, Mr. López Obrador's image as a leader would be seriously damaged if he were to accept the presence of American troops on Mexican land. His better bet is to stand firm, resist American pressure and hope for change with the 2020 election.
Unfortunately, a new president won't solve the terrible problem of drug-related violence in Mexico. Mr. López Obrador must humbly accept that his strategy -- summed up as "hugs, not bullets" -- isn't working and that urgent action is required. Instead of stopping Central American refugees from entering across Mexico's southern border, the National Guard should focus on bringing peace back to Mexico.
This year may turn out to be the most violent in Mexico's modern history. More than 33,000 homicides were recorded in 2018, with one person killed every 15 minutes. This year, 28,000 people were killed between January and October. If Mr. López Obrador doesn't make adjustments to his crime-fighting strategy soon, his six-year term could end up covered in blood.
The evident pride Mexicans feel in their president strongly opposing any foreign intervention may be undermined if Mr. López Obrador fails to crack down on drug traffickers. Saying no to President Trump's troops is a good first step. Now, Mexico's president needs to take on the other challenges confronting his country.
Mr. Trump will soon realize that he can't rule with tweets alone. His digital ruses have no effect on drug traffickers or drug-related violence in Mexico. Even someone like him, who seems to have no knowledge of history, can't take the United States back to a time when it invaded other countries whenever it wanted. As the situation in Mexico clearly shows, not everything can be solved by force or by tweet.

Texto completo: Results for the latest administration of the Program for International Student Assessment, a key exam given to 15-year-old students worldwide, show poor performance in reading and math among U.S. students, with the Common Core national standards and aligned curriculum a likely significant contributing factor.
The PISA exam tests reading, math, and science. Among the 79 countries where the exam is administered, the top scorers were students in four provinces in China — Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zheijiang.
According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which oversees the PISA exam, the Chinese students not only outperformed students in all other countries in math and reading, but “the 10% most disadvantaged in these four provinces showed better reading skills than those of the average student in OECD countries, and performed on par with the 10% most advantaged students in some of them.”
“What makes their achievement even more remarkable,” says the OECD, “is that the level of income in these four Chinese regions is well below the OECD average.”
Such results should be concerning to every American given that Communist China’s goal, according to Liu Mingfu, a retired Chinese army colonel and highly influential professor at China’s National Defense University, “is to surpass the United States in overall national power in terms of the economy as well as science and technology.”
Indeed, in comparison, U.S. students’ math scores were not just below the Chinese scores, but behind many other countries, including Portugal, Slovakia, and Lithuania.
In reading, the United States did slightly better, but still scored far below the Chinese. As the New York Times noted, “The performance of American teenagers in reading and math has been stagnant since 2000.”
And unlike the high performance of disadvantaged students in China, the Times pointed out that the “achievement gap between high and low performers [in the U.S.] is widening.”
According to an OECD official quoted by the Times, about one-fifth of American 15-year-olds scored so low on the PISA test that it appeared they had not mastered the reading skills expected of a 10-year-old.
Those students, said the official, face “pretty grim prospects” on the job market.
The PISA trends mirror the results on the recent National Assessment of Educational Progress exam, America’s so-called report card.
Not only did large majorities of students fail to perform at the proficient level in reading and math on the NAEP exam, but the gap between high-performing and low-performing students widened in places such as California.
In fact, in California, the gap between high and low performing students widened by a full-grade's worth on the eighth-grade NAEP math test.
There is a possibility that Common Core may have something to do with the widening performance gap between high and low achievers. That's because the gap has increased since 2012, which was around the time that Common Core was first implemented.
The Times cited a Harvard education professor, who said that the blame lies partly with states and school districts, which did not effectively carry out Common Core, and recommended that low-income students be provided with social workers.
Please.
First of all, such apologies for Common Core sound like the old discredited leftist refrain that communism has never succeeded because it has never truly been tried and that all communist catastrophes are the result of poor implementation. Second, remember that the most disadvantaged Chinese students performed as well as the most advantaged students in many countries — and it is a sure thing that those Chinese students were not provided social workers to raise their achievement.
Third, it is simply obvious that Common Core is having a negative impact on U.S. student performance.
Ze’ev Wurman, former senior policy adviser at the U.S. Department of Education under President George W. Bush and one of the most informed critics of Common Core, has observed: “In addition to being mediocre in its academic expectations, Common Core dragged in its unscientific and discredited pedagogy,” such as the “de-emphasis of fluency with arithmetic and number manipulation [in math].”
Pacific Research Institute’s 2018 report “An American Education Agenda” recommends that states should repeal their Common Core standards and replace them with proven standards, such as Massachusetts’s previous state standards, and should enact comprehensive school-choice programs to give parents and their children the opportunity to access better schooling alternatives.
The bottom line: We cannot afford to let China eat our education lunch.

Texto completo: With the conclusion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s 70th anniversary summit in London, it’s fair to say that Donald Trump thinks that most alliance members, starting with France and Canada, are a bunch of ungrateful and unhelpful freeloaders. Fair to say, also, that most of those members see Trump as an erratic, pompous, dangerous simpleton.
There’s no reason they both can’t be right.
The tone of the summit was set several weeks ago, when Emmanuel Macron gave an interview to The Economist, warning of the “brain death” of NATO and wondering whether the alliance’s mutual defense commitments still meant anything. “If the Bashar al-Assad regime decides to retaliate against Turkey, will we commit ourselves under it?” the French president wondered, imagining a scenario in which Ankara could demand that other NATO members play a supportive role in its barbaric adventure in northern Syria.
Macron was widely rebuked for the remarks, most of all by Trump, who this week called them “very disrespectful,” “very, very nasty,” and “insulting to a lot of different forces.”
Yet they were also very true. Trump announced his withdrawal from Syria without bothering to consult France or Britain, both of which had special forces on the ground fighting the Islamic State. It’s Trump, not Macron, who once called NATO “obsolete,” just as it’s Trump who has repeatedly cast doubt on whether the U.S. would defend NATO states from an attack.
Words have consequences. Trump’s domestic political base may think it’s just fine to take the president seriously but not literally. Treaty allies like France can’t be so cavalier. If Macron is now exploring France’s options by talking up the prospect of a European army while talking down the threat from Russia, it’s because that’s where Trump’s wild rhetoric and behavior have led him.
But then we get to the other side of the ledger.
In 2011, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates warned of a “dim if not dismal future” for the alliance if states such as Germany continued to underspend on defense. Nearly eight years later, a German parliamentary report found that fewer than half of the country’s fighter jets, and not one of its six submarines, were combat worthy. The German defense minister recently announced that she does plan to meet NATO targets on military spending, but not until 2031.
To American policymakers of any administration, that sounds like something between a bald insult and a bad joke.
Most other NATO members are no better. Canada, for instance, spends just 1.27% of its gross domestic product on defense (the NATO target is 2%) and cannot meet its obligations to defend North America’s airspace. When Justin Trudeau was overheard at the summit belittling Trump for taking too long with his press conference, the Canadian prime minister sounded to many Americans like a child whining that a working parent had kept him waiting for supper.
All of this means that when Macron and other European leaders muse about creating an autonomous European defense force, they are, as one seasoned Parisian observer put it to me, “playing with cards they don’t have.” Even sizable increases in defense spending wouldn’t fill the gap that an American departure from Europe would leave: Roughly half of European defense spending goes to salaries and pensions, not warfighting capacity.
This is worse than brain death. It’s a philosophical failure, the result of a long-term attenuation in the idea of an Atlantic community — the West — united not only by a shared history or common enemies, but also by a unifying set of ethical and political ideals, and the sense that those ideals entwine our destinies.
That attenuation preceded Trump and Macron, and it has causes that go beyond any two leaders, including fundamental changes in the demographic makeup of both sides of the Atlantic. Even so, it is being accelerated by them. On Trump’s side, through his coarse nationalism, crude transactionalism, and soft spot for strongmen. On Macron’s, from an excess of political opportunism and a dearth of strategic sense. Anti-Americanism will always find a receptive audience with much of the French public. But a Europe without American protection is a continental disaster waiting to happen.
The good news is that an institution as large as NATO can run on autopilot for a long time, certainly beyond either Trump’s or Macron’s tenure of office. At some point, however, real pilots will be needed.
Is there a leader in Europe who can persuasively make the case that NATO isn’t just the cheapest available option for European security, but also the best vehicle for a liberal and democratic identity — and therefore worthy of far greater investment? And is there a leader in the U.S., Democratic or Republican, who can explain that America’s interests must be shaped by our values, and that the ultimate value, the defense of the free world against its common and perennial enemies, is our ultimate interest, too?

Everybody out of the car until you're ready to roll to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning

Texto completo: It happens every year after a snowstorm. And it's always devastating. A well-meaning parent will have a child warm up in the car while he or she digs it out. And when done with the chore, the parent gets in the toasty vehicle and sees that the child has dozed off. But tragically, that's not the case at all. The child is dead.
This nightmare scenario can even occur if the snow is not covering your tailpipe. Deadly carbon monoxide can build up underneath the car if the snow surrounding your car is higher than your exhaust pipe is. In a case such as this, you can still see your exhaust pipe, but there's a significant depression where there's hardly any snow at all under your car. Again, surrounding your car, the snow is higher than the height of the pipe. Carbon monoxide can fill the depression under the car, and seep into the passenger compartment.
Fortunately, it is very easy to avoid this horrific accident. The rule is simple. Do not start the car until it is completely dug out and you are ready to start out. Period. The kids can wait inside the house. Or, if they are helping and get cold, have them warm up in the house, NOT in the car.
Here is one awful example from the New York City area, as it first appeared in the New York Times:
"A woman and her 1-year-old son died of carbon monoxide poisoning in Passaic, N.J., on Saturday after sitting in their parked car with the engine running, the police said.
The car's exhaust pipe was buried in snow, and the woman's husband was working to shovel the car out. (Remember, in my example, above, this can happen if the pipe is not fully buried.)
Their 3-year-old daughter, who was also in the car, was in "very critical condition" on Sunday, said Detective Andy White, a spokesman for the Passaic police. Their names were not released."
Carbon monoxide is no joke. And if you don't have a carbon monoxide detector in your home, please get one. Remember, carbon monoxide cannot be seen, and has no odor. Many think that a smoke detector is sufficient. It is not.
While on the subject of vehicles, I have already seen photos this season of smashed windshields caused by ice and snow flying off of other cars or trucks. Every year, people are injured by this, and insurance claims are very significant. It is a law in New Hampshire that vehicles must be cleared of ice and snow. You can be ticketed in Maine as well. After every storm, please be courteous and take the extra few minutes to completely clear your car or truck of snow and ice.
The other thing that can happen is that the snow and ice can slide forward from your roof and then slide right down your windshield while you are driving, blinding you while you are covering the distance of a basketball court every second. That's close to the distance you travel every second when you are driving at 60 mph.
Switching gears now, I want to look at this past November in terms of heating use, which we measure by Heating Degree Days. The higher the HDD, the colder it has been. This November there were 1,100 Heating Degree Days, while last November, we saw 1,112. Normal for November at Caribou is 1,005. So each of the past two Novembers has been about 10 percent colder than normal. That means for every 10 gallons of oil you'd burn in a normal November, you've burned 11 in each of the past two Novembers.
For those who want to know how to calculate Heating Degree Days, you add the high and the low temperature observed over a midnight to midnight period (this is a climate day) and divide by two to get that day's average temperature. You then subtract it from 65 to get that day's Heating Degree Day total. The daily totals are then summed to get monthly and annual values. Here's an example. Daily high of 30, overnight low 14. Add them together to get 44. Divide by two to get the average, which is 22. Subtract 22 from 65 to get 43 Heating Degree Days. Again, the colder it is, the more Heating Degree Days you have,
One more climate note about November. It was the ninth snowiest November on record at Caribou, with 23 inches, and was one of only 13 Novembers to exceed 20 inches. Records at Caribou go back 80 years, to 1939.
And finally, a late-breaking update to our snow season before I have to hit "send" for this column. Each of the past two snow seasons have gotten off to a roaring start. Through Dec. 4, the Caribou average is 14.8 inches. Last year though Dec. 4, Caribou was already approaching three feet (35.8 inches). This year, through Dec. 4, Caribou is not far behind last year, with 33.2 inches for the season thus far.
Here's a refresher on what "normal" means. It is calculated based on a 30-year period that is recalculated every decade. So we are using 1981-2010 data, next we will be using 1991-2020 data. By the way, when talking about climate numbers, "normal" and "average" mean the same thing. So whereas I said that Caribou averages 14.8 inches of snow through Dec. 4, I also could have said that the normal snowfall through Dec. 4 for Caribou is 14.8 inches.

Hathaway on 'heartbreaking' drama 'Dark Waters'

Texto completo: Anne Hathaway didn't have to dig deep for her latest role in "Dark Waters."
In Todd Haynes' whistleblower drama, the Oscar winner plays the real-life Sarah Bilott, whose husband, lawyer Rob Bilott (Mark Ruffalo), helped expose decades of environmental contamination by chemical company DuPont.
"It's heartbreaking and infuriating on a human level," Hathaway says. "There wasn't really any acting required, in terms of playing someone who was learning of (corruption) and was equal parts aghast and terrified and angry and emotional."
Based on a 2016 New York Times Magazine article by Nathaniel Rich, "Dark Waters" begins with Rob taking on a new client: a West Virginia farmer (Bill Camp) who believes his cows' mysterious deaths are caused by a toxic runoff from a DuPont landfill, which contaminated a creek on his land.
Rob's work eventually leads to a study that finds roughly 70,000 people were drinking tainted water with traces of PFOA, a toxic chemical used in the production of Teflon products such as non-stick pans until 2013. DuPont was allegedly aware for years that PFOA exposure is linked to illnesses such as kidney cancer and thyroid disease, and the company was forced to pay out $671 million in personal injury lawsuits in 2017.
The story hit close to home for Hathaway, 37, already a mom to son Jonathan, 3, with husband Adam Shulman, and now "a thousand months pregnant" with a second child, she says good-naturedly by phone.
After reading the script, "I opened the drawer where I keep my pans and pots, and there was a non-stick pan," Hathaway says. "And despite reading an article when I was pregnant with my first child that said 'don't use non-stick,' there was one that had somehow slipped through the cracks and I'd been feeding my family with it for years.
"I try not to blame myself too hard in those circumstances, because I believe that we as human beings and as Americans should never be put in that position where we're just trying to do our best, and we're inadvertently poisoning ourselves and the people we love."
Hathaway has always had an activist spirit, which is part of the reason why Haynes thought of her to play Sarah.
"Anne has this incredible vitality and intelligence and compassion, and you see that in her work," says the director, best known for the Oscar-nominated "Carol" and "Far from Heaven." "Sarah is an essential part of the story of Rob and how he was able to do what he did, but also how hard it is on a domestic relationship when somebody takes on the system."
A vocal member of the Time's Up movement against sexual harassment and workplace discrimination, Hathaway credits her activism to her parents, who instilled the importance of equality and inclusivity from an early age.
"I was born in the early '80s, and there were still things I was told I couldn't do because I was a girl," Hathaway says. "I was really lucky I was raised in a household where that sentence was never uttered. It seems strange to me that anybody would try to put me in a box based on the way I was born, when it's so much easier to just accept other people for how they are. So I guess that was my first awareness that the world wasn't a fair place for everyone."
The actress says she is grateful for her "Dark Waters" co-star Ruffalo, who has long spoken out about climate change and fracking. She also feels encouraged by the work of 16-year-old Greta Thunberg and other young environmental activists.
"I'm so inspired by them – their priorities are exactly right," Hathaway says. "They are focused and doing all the things we tell young people to do. So I don't understand people's negative reaction to this generation, except to say they must be very comfortable with the greed innate in the status quo."
After roles in "Serenity" and "The Hustle" earlier this year, Anne Hathaway is back on the big screen this fall with "Dark Waters," pictured, which tackles industrial pollution.

Stephen Cleobury, 70, Leader of Celebrated Choir and Its Beloved Holiday Concert

Texto completo: He led the King's College Choir of England for 37 years, including during its famous Christmas Eve performances.
Stephen Cleobury, who for 37 years was music director at King's College, Cambridge -- which among other things meant he led one of the most beloved holiday musical events on the planet, the Christmas Eve performance by the college's celebrated choir -- died on Nov. 22 in York, England. He was 70.
Robin Tyson, his manager and a former choir member, said the cause was cancer.
Mr. Cleobury, who had stepped down from his post just this past September, was a well-regarded organist when he was named to the King's College position in 1982. In addition to leading the Choir of King's College, he oversaw assorted other choral groups and from 1995 to 2007 was chief conductor of the BBC Singers, the noted chamber choir.
But he was most often in the news in connection with the Christmas Eve performance, part of A Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols, a service in the King's College Chapel broadcast on hundreds of radio stations around the world.
Mr. Cleobury recorded numerous albums with the choir and toured with it regularly, maintaining and enhancing its standing as one of the great guardians of a choral tradition stretching back centuries. "The consistency and excellence of King's Choir over the years is testimony to the benefits of standards and tradition," Jeremy Eichler wrote in The New York Times in 2004, reviewing a performance at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola in Manhattan.
The choir is made up of boys from the King's College School and undergraduates (known as choral scholars) from Cambridge University. The Christmas Eve performance begins with a single boy stepping forward and singing the opening of "Once in Royal David's City." Mr. Cleobury, after preparing several boys for the role, would choose the soloist just moments before the performance began.
"What lies behind it is the idea that if you nominate a chorister a week or two weeks beforehand he's got quite a lot of time to get wound up about it, which we don't want to happen," Mr. Cleobury said in "A Year at King's," a BBC One film that documented the choir's 2018, culminating in the Christmas Eve concert. "And moreover, even if you do that, that particular one might wake up on Christmas Eve with a sore throat. It's really down to who's in the best voice on Christmas Eve."

A Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols was a century old last year, and the choir itself dates to the 1400s, when Henry VI created it. Mr. Cleobury was supremely conscious of the tradition, and at first, as he acknowledged to NPR in 2004, felt weighed down by it.
"But I managed to get over that," he added. He had his various choirs explore new music.
"I felt that a tradition must be nourished with new material, otherwise it fossilizes," he told the British newspaper The Telegraph in 2012. "Part of what I've had in mind is to try to go to composers who would not normally be thought of as writing for church choirs but who are working in mainstream music -- operas, symphonies, chamber -- and say, 'Here's a choir, would you like to write for us?"'
As part of that exploratory spirit, each year at the festival he would introduce a new carol. Some went over better than others with a certain tradition-steeped segment of the audience.
"Could you tell me who had the idea of commissioning that carol," someone wrote to him one year when he included a carol by the modernist composer Harrison Birtwistle, "because whoever did should be locked in a dark room and never let out."
Stephen John Cleobury was born on Dec. 31, 1948, in Bromley, southeast of London. His father, John, was a doctor, and his mother, Brenda (Randall) Cleobury, was a nurse.
As a boy he was part of the choir at Worcester Cathedral. He also began studying the organ. He continued those studies at St. John's College, Cambridge, and served as organist and head of music at St. Matthew's Church in Northampton. He also taught at Northampton Grammar School.
He became sub-organist at Westminster Abbey in 1974, a position whose duties included playing for daily services and assisting in conducting the choir. In 1979 he became master of music at Westminster Cathedral.
He continued to perform on the organ after taking the King's College job and recorded numerous albums of organ music playing the King's College Chapel instrument. He was knighted this year.
Mr. Cleobury's first marriage, to Penny Holloway, ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, Emma (Disley) Cleobury, whom he married in 2004; their daughters, Frances and Olivia; two daughters from his first marriage, Susannah and Laura; a brother, Nicholas; and a sister, Julia.
The King's College Chapel, where many of Mr. Cleobury's recordings were made, is renowned for its acoustics; it is said that a note can reverberate for five seconds when the chapel is empty.
When it's packed with hundreds of people, as it is for the Christmas Eve festival, the resonance is not so pronounced. But, Mr. Cleobury told The Boston Globe in 1986, it has a different sort of ambience that enhances the music: "the darkness, the candlelight, the large number of people, and the curious sort of silence you get from a large number of people being quiet."

Texto completo: As the billionaire's defamation trial in Los Angeles entered its third day, a professor testified that the Twitter message had generated hundreds of articles.
The billionaire Elon Musk's Twitter post calling the cave explorer Vernon Unsworth "pedo guy" led to hundreds of articles online, a Penn State University professor testified on Thursday.
The professor, Jim Jansen, a web analytics researcher, said that according to his research, from July to September 2018, 490 articles from 361 websites representing 33 countries were published in English referring to "pedo guy" and "pedophilia." They represented major companies, such as The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, Time, Fox News and Breitbart. Mr. Jansen said that Mr. Musk never referred to Mr. Unsworth as a pedophile but that the word might have appeared in those articles.
The testimony came on the third and final day of the trial over Mr. Unsworth's defamation lawsuit against Mr. Musk in Los Angeles. Jury instructions and final arguments were scheduled to be given on Friday.
The trial has centered on a bitter exchange between Mr. Musk and Mr. Unsworth from summer 2018, as each separately sought to help rescue a group of boys trapped in a cave in Thailand.
As international attention on the trapped children intensified, Mr. Musk, the billionaire founder and chief executive of Tesla, sent a team of engineers to the scene and proposed an unusual rescue strategy: a minisubmarine.
Mr. Unsworth, a veteran cave explorer with experience navigating the very system in which the group was trapped, dismissed the idea as impractical in a CNN interview, saying that Mr. Musk could "stick his submarine where it hurts."
Mr. Musk, who at the time had 22 million followers on Twitter, responded with the "pedo guy" post.
On Thursday, lawyers for Mr. Musk argued that the comment, however impolite, did not cause Mr. Unsworth any reputational damage.
Bill Price, one of Mr. Musk's lawyers, pointed to a photograph of Mr. Unsworth standing next to the British prime minister at a ceremony at 10 Downing Street, as well as a Daily Mail video of a smiling Mr. Unsworth celebrating the cave rescue.
Since the Twitter exchange, the lawyer said, Mr. Unsworth has been approached by a music producer seeking to represent him in book or movie deals and has participated in two documentaries about the rescue. "Nothing Mr. Musk tweeted got in your way," Mr. Price said.
So far, Mr. Musk's defense has rested largely on the claim that "pedo guy" is a generic insult common in his childhood home of South Africa rather than an actual accusation of pedophilia.
"It's quite common in the English-speaking world," Mr. Musk argued from the witness stand on Tuesday, the opening day of the trial. "I'm quite confident if you do a search, it will just say 'creepy old dude."'
Mr. Unsworth and his lawyers dispute that notion, arguing that Mr. Musk was actively trying to damage the explorer's reputation. In an interview, Mr. Unsworth's lawyer, L. Lin Wood, declined to say how much his client was seeking in damages from Mr. Musk, but added, "We believe the evidence justifies a substantial award."
The final witness on Thursday was Vanessa Unsworth, Mr. Unsworth's wife, who appeared in a recorded deposition. While they are still married, the two separated in 2013 and they have only limited contact. She said Mr. Unsworth might have come across as aggressive during the Thai rescue effort because "he was extremely concerned about getting the kids out" of the cave.
After the jury was excused, the judge said that it could find negligence even without malice.
Mr. Musk deleted the tweets in July 2018, explaining in a subsequent post that he had written them in anger.
Still, Mr. Musk later told a BuzzFeed News reporter in an email that Mr. Unsworth was a "child rapist" who had married a 12-year-old -- claims that Mr. Unsworth vehemently denies.
While the judge supervising the trial, Stephen Wilson, has said the BuzzFeed episode is not the subject of the case, the story has come up repeatedly as a potential window into how Mr. Musk understood the term "pedo guy."
Mr. Musk has had plenty to say. On the stand this week, he lamented the chain of events that his tweets had set in motion. "It should've just been, 'Here's a rescue, and that's great,"' he testified.
"I apologized," he added. "And I apologize again."

Ex-Playboy model who alleges affair with Trump sues Fox News for defamation

Texto completo: A former Playboy model who claims to have had an affair with President Trump prior to his inauguration filed a defamation lawsuit against Fox News on Thursday.
The model, Karen McDougal, alleges that network host Tucker Carlson intentionally defamed her on his show on Dec. 10, 2018. Carlson accused the former model of extortion and claimed, in part, that she "approached Donald Trump and threatened to ruin his career and humiliate his family if he doesn't give them money." He also classified her behavior as "a classic case of extortion," however he did not mention her by name during the show, only showing a photo of her.
McDougal's lawsuit, which was filed in New York, seeks damages from Fox for tarnishing her reputation, however, it does not name Carlson as a defendant in it, according to the New York Times. She claimed the network is responsible for his comments because they were verifiable, while her lawyer argued that a reasonable person watching Carlson's show would've thought she was a criminal. McDougal also claimed in the suit that she never threatened Trump.
"FOX News will vigorously defend Tucker Carlson against these meritless claims," a Fox News representative told the Washington Examiner.
McDougal has said that she and Trump met at the Playboy Mansion in 2006, and they began a 10-month affair that ultimately ended when she felt guilty about Trump cheating on his wife. The president has denied the affair.
Prior to the 2016 presidential election, the National Enquirer purchased the rights to McDougal's story for $150,000 and proceeded not to publish it — a practice that's commonly known as "catch and kill." She was restricted from discussing the alleged affair until she came to a settlement agreement with American Media, Inc. in April, 2018.
Trump has denied knowing about the payment from the National Enquirer, however, he caught discussing the story with his then fixer Michael Cohen, but the conversation was revealed through a secret recording made by Cohen.

Daily Mail's Online Reinvention Relieves Pressure Amid Newspaper-Industry Woes; British paper's web edition, known for photo-heavy stories about vacationing celebrities and other tabloid fodder, has become one of the world's most-read news sites

Texto completo: The Daily Mail's transformation from a tabloid little known outside the U.K. to one of the world's most-read news websites is playing a key role in helping its parent company weather the downturn affecting newspapers world-wide.
The site's potent mix of web aggregation and original celebrity, scandal and breaking-news reporting has long proved popular with readers and is beginning to show its impact on the balance sheet of its corporate parent, Daily Mail and General Trust PLC.
On Thursday, the company reported that revenue from its digital arm—known in the U.S. as DailyMail.com and in the U.K. as MailOnline—grew by 15% to £140 million ($183.5 million) in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30.
The site is now "solidly profitable," DMGT Chief Executive Paul Zwillenberg said in an interview. A person familiar with the matter said the site's profit margin was greater than 10% for the year.
The website's revenue growth is notable because it is almost entirely driven by digital advertising, an area in which it has become increasingly difficult for many publishers to compete as big tech companies like Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Facebook have grown to control close to 60% of all digital ad spending.
Many big news outlets have sought to diversify their online revenue streams through subscription, events and affiliate sales businesses. The Mail has mainly stuck to its core model of boosting ad impressions by bringing in a large number of regular readers.
"It doesn't matter if you are going the subscription route or the free way like us, or a hybrid of the two—it won't work unless you have a substantial, committed audience willing to pay with their money or their time," Mr. Zwillenberg said.
The company has also built up a small e-commerce operation selling clothes featured in celebrity photos published on the sites.
He said about 70% of DailyMail.com's traffic comes directly to its home page or through its mobile app, a high number in a market where many sites rely on readers coming to stories through web searches, external links and social media.
"We have focused on building this great audience of really engaged users who come back to our home page and app day in and day out. We didn't chase the shiny things of [search engine optimization] or social or building studios," Mr. Zwillenberg said.

Do you read the Daily Mail? What do you think about it? Join the conversation below.
Launched in the U.K. in 2008, the site expanded to the U.S. in 2010 and has since become one of the largest online news destinations in the world. In October, it attracted around 218 million global unique visitors, according to the company's internal traffic figures. In the U.S., the site drew in 85 million uniques that month, up 27% compared with the same month a year earlier, and putting it on par with the New York Times, according to Comscore Inc.
The site is well known for publishing photos of bikini-clad celebrities and delving deep into scandals involving notable figures. It has broken some consequential stories, such as revealing Anthony Weiner's online relationship with a teenager in 2016. Mr. Weiner ended up in jail, and the scandal prompted the FBI to reopen an investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails.
The site has often skirted the edge of controversy. In 2016, the Daily Mail settled a defamation lawsuit with first lady Melania Trump for $2.9 million after publishing a story claiming she had once worked as a high-end escort.
In October, former U.S. Rep. Katie Hill sent a cease-and-desist letter to the site demanding it take down nude photos it published of her related to a sex scandal that led to her resignation . A spokesman for the company declined to comment.
The site employs more than 500 reporters in offices in London, Los Angeles, New York and Sydney, churning out an average of 1,700 stories, 14,000 photos and 900 videos every day. While content from the Daily Mail newspaper does appear online, the website operates as a separate business with its own reporters.
The Daily Mail newspaper is the second-largest by circulation in the U.K., just behind the Sun, which is owned by News Corp, the parent company of The Wall Street Journal. Like all newspapers, revenue from the print edition of the Mail has been steadily declining over the past decade as readers and advertisers have moved online.
Revenue from the print operation has fallen 25% since 2014 to £406 million. At the same time, online revenue has more than doubled to £140 million. In fiscal 2019, revenue from the web accounted for 25% of the Daily Mail's revenue overall. For the year, DMGT reported adjusted operating profit for its media unit of £67 million.
On Thursday, DGMT said for the fiscal year, it recorded revenue of £1.41 billion and a pretax profit of £145 million.
While advertising revenue at the paper fell 8% year over year, it grew 12% on the Web, and advertising revenue from DailyMail.com and its related DailyMailTV operation accounted for 57% of the newspaper business' total ad revenue.
"While many others have been forced to pivot out of desperation, I'm pleased to say that the only pivot we have made in the last decade is a pivot to profit," Mr. Zwillenberg said.

Kevin Dowd's Defense of President Trump

Texto completo: Readers react to the annual Thanksgiving column by Maureen Dowd's conservative brother.
To the Editor:
Maureen Dowd's brother, explaining why he supports President Trump ("Kevin Talks Turkey," column, Dec. 1), begins the litany of reasons with "I support the president for his economy, the jobless rate ..." From what I hear, that view is not only to be expected from Mr. Trump's immovable supporters but also, I fear, from so many who are undecided about whom they'll vote for.
What bothers me a lot is that there's so little effort by the Democratic candidates and like-minded others to correct the false impression that the low jobless rate is President Trump's doing. It is rather a continuation from 2009, when it began declining soon after President Barack Obama's massive economic stimulus took effect, turning back the Great Recession and perhaps preventing a depression. Is that so hard to tell people?

To the Editor:
Yes, yes, it's all very well and good to print a conservative's view of liberals, of politics, of Hillary. But then at the end of the fun comes the portrayal, as usual, of people concerned with the climate crisis as tsking schoolmarms ruining everyone's fun by asking them to "consider curbing 'the carbon footprint' of our turkeys and travel."
I am really sick of this. Grow up and read a United Nations climate report, will you? I didn't invent the science in order to "turkey-shame" you.
Republicans like to snicker at Democrats for getting their "panties in a knot," but ignoring science is turning them into the party that is increasingly out of touch.
Jane Warden
Malibu, Calif.
To the Editor:
Like his sister Maureen, Kevin Dowd writes with wonderful vigor. While I disagree with him heartily in his support of Donald Trump, it is refreshing to read commentary from "the other side" that is rational and not terrifying. I would welcome more of the same.
Ann Vehslage
Skillman, N.J.
To the Editor:
The annual column by Maureen Dowd's brother so deftly avoids the "big issues" -- the sheer inhumanity of the Trump administration. Thousands of children separated from their families at the border. Tax cuts resulting in a huge budget deficit, leading to cuts in safety net programs. Glorifying war criminals and white nationalists. Abandonment of the Kurds. And gross disrespect for the Constitution. Shameful and terrifying.
Dianne R. Sagner

To the Editor:
Please let Maureen Dowd know that we'll set a place for her at our Thanksgiving table next year, with not one Donald Trump apologist in sight.

Re "How Juul Got a Generation Hooked" (front page, Nov. 24):
I was amazed to learn that Juul Labs is now worth more than the Ford Motor Company.
We once had a manufacturing economy, then a service economy and now, it seems, an addiction economy. The big winners are those who can get consumers hooked on their products (opiates, video games, e-cigarettes), never mind the personal and social costs.
For whom is this economy working, exactly?

Texto completo: The showdown had been years in the making, Bill Clinton's personal lawyer confronting the lead investigator pushing for the second-ever impeachment of a sitting president.
'Mr. Starr, good evening,' David Kendall, the presidential attorney, said in November 1998.
'Good evening,' replied Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel investigating Clinton. 'How are you, David?'
'I'm very well, Ken,' Kendall said.
For the next hour, the two legal giants squared off in a prime-time clash exactly a month before the House voted to impeach Clinton for his effort to cover up an affair with a White House intern. They debated the facts of the case and the merits of impeachment, as both Republicans and Democrats barely said a word.
It was the sort of legal battle royal that President Trump would probably love to see from his legal team: one that is feisty and carried live on national cable TV.
But Trump, unlike Clinton and President Richard Nixon in 1974, has opted against having legal advisers present for the House Judiciary Committee's first impeachment hearing Wednesday.
The White House decision, delivered to Democrats on Sunday evening, accused them of a 'complete lack of due process' but left open the possibility that his legal team 'may consider participating' in future hearings if they are deemed a true process.
That move relinquishes Trump's side of the fight to Republicans on the committee, an unusual move for a president who loves to see his own top aides in public sparring with Democrats and the media. Many of those GOP lawmakers are his closest allies, and they plan to vigorously fight Democrats over committee procedures.
Some Republicans have quietly wondered whether this is a mistake, that it leaves out another combatant in the room who would be on Trump's side. Besides, this president's go-for-the-jugular instincts would normally call for putting as many fighters on his side as possible, making for the biggest splash on TV.
But some of his allies believe this is the right strategy, to dismiss these hearings as illegitimate. 'I'm sure his gut instinct was to go in there himself, but no, to me the best advice is to not to " don't give this thing any more credibility than it deserves,' said Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.).
King, who sat ringside with Trump last month at Madison Square Garden at a mixed-martial arts title fight, does not believe the president's team should only consider participating in the likely Senate trial overseen by the GOP majority there.
Still, King wonders how Trump will respond as the hearings unfold and whether, like a showrunner on an old reality-TV show, the president will want to inject new characters. 'It's his combative nature. I don't know how he will react,' he said.
This week marks the third Judiciary Committee impeachment consideration over the past 45 years, and each is quite different from the others. The Richard Nixon impeachment was a long, slow process starting with the 1972 Watergate break-in and including more than a year of congressional hearings before Nixon's resignation in August 1974.
In the Clinton impeachment, an Arkansas land deal made while he was serving as that state's governor eventually spawned an independent counsel probe. That investigation, expanded after the affair revelation in 1998, led to a fast-breaking impeachment with several weeks of hearings to review Starr's report.
The 2019 investigation was entirely handled by the House Intelligence Committee for two months in closed-door depositions and then public hearings, in which Republicans had equal time to question witnesses.
After Wednesday's hearing with constitutional law professors, the Judiciary Committee will probably hear from the House Intelligence Committee " Daniel S. Goldman, the top counsel for the Democrats, and Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) " to present their roughly 300-page report.
For now, it appears there will be no high-profile questioning by the president's lawyer.
That's not what Nixon decided in 1974, when he sent his top defense lawyer, James D. St. Clair, to impeachment proceedings. The highest-profile clash came July-11, when the president's legal team finally got the chance to cross-examine its biggest foe, John Dean, the former Nixon counsel who provided damaging testimony saying Nixon knew of the coverup early on and did nothing to stop it.
One lawmaker told the New York Times that St. Clair's cross-examination was a 'bloodletting' of Dean, while another jokingly asked for a 'sponge' to clean up the mess as Nixon's lawyers punched at inconsistencies in the former aide's timeline.
Twenty-four years later, Clinton sent Kendall into the lion's den of a Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee.
Kendall, a major legal figure at the esteemed firm Williams - Connolly, and Starr, a former federal judge, had already clashed behind closed doors, including at Clinton's grand-jury testimony in August 1998.
But Kendall's cooperation with the Judiciary Committee gave him the chance to pepper his longtime adversary in public. First Starr gave a two-hour summary of his staff's report, followed by questioning from Democrats and Republicans.
Finally, the nighttime exchange went from Kendall asking about details of his investigation to questions about how Starr's inquiry grew into examining an extramarital affair. At times, the attorney cut Starr off when he was filibustering.
'Mr. Starr, I have only 30 minutes,' Kendall said.
When time was up, Republicans agreed to give Kendall an additional 30 minutes, without any objections.
King, who opposed Clinton's impeachment, said that Trump's lawyers would not offer much to this month's hearings if there are no fact witnesses to question, the way Kendall could question Starr.
'Now you just have one politician against another. It's Adam Schiff against Devin Nunes,' he said, referring to the chairman and the ranking Republican of the Intelligence Committee.
And as feisty as the St. Clair and Kendall cross-examinations were, their work did little to stall the momentum for impeachment.
Less than three weeks after the fierce session with Dean, the House Judiciary Committee approved three articles of impeachment against Nixon, who resigned less than two weeks later.
In 1998, as his session with Starr concluded, Kendall pleaded for more time to question his nemesis. 'It's been a long day,' he said. 'I would come back tomorrow if that were appropriate.'
Republicans said no. Two weeks later, Clinton's legal team sent a more good-cop set of lawyers to present the final argument to prevent impeachment, arguing his behavior was personally reprehensible but not a high crime or misdemeanor.
On Dec.-19, 1998, the full House approved two articles of impeachment against Clinton.

New York Times writer says Democrats shouldn't pass USMCA because it would help Trump

Texto completo: House Democrats don't need advice from journalists on how to be ruthlessly partisan, because that's their natural state. But left-wing writer Jamelle Bouie is here to help where he can.
In an opinion piece for the New York Times on Wednesday, Bouie cautioned Democrats against voting in favor of the Trump administration's new trade deal with Mexico and Canada solely because it would be politically helpful for the president:
Bouie wrote, "Passing a bill only validates Trump’s oft-made claim that he’s an expert deal-maker, and as the presidential election nears, bolstering the president means you’re boosting his party."
Naked partisanship is usually cloaked in some kind of faux outrage or feigned concern about consequences of some particular action. But not this time. Not Bouie. The only thing Democrats need to consider is their prospects in 2020.
This comes, by the way, after most liberals in the media belittled the new trade deal, known as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, as a slightly tweaked version of NAFTA.
The deal, which is awaiting a vote in Congress while Democrats play around with impeachment, actually makes significant changes to the existing agreement, particularly when it comes to the auto industry, which was crushed by NAFTA.
From the Wall Street Journal:
The USMCA requires a greater portion of cars—75%, up from 62.5% under Nafta—be made in North America to qualify for tariff-free trade. ... The new deal also requires that 40% to 45% of automotive content be made by workers earning at least $16 per hour, a new provision aimed at shifting production from Mexico back to the U.S. and Canada. U.S. officials say Mexican pledges in the deal to boost the power of its labor unions will have a similar effect. The pact also weakens protections for multinationals investing in other countries, a change Trump officials say will discourage outsourcing. It sets de facto quotas on Mexican and Canadian auto exports to the U.S. It requires the countries to conduct regular reviews of the USMCA, including a prospect for termination.
Unlike NAFTA, the USMCA would also penalize governments that manipulate their currency, according to the Wall Street Journal, as China has been known to do.
All of that would be a needed, positive change to trade with our neighboring countries. Every working American would win.
But Democrats don't want to do that, because, as Bouie said, certifying the deal "only validates Trump’s oft-made claim that he’s an expert deal-maker." And they just can't stand to give him the win, even if it's good for the country.

Paul Krugman: America’s red-state death trip

Texto completo: “E pluribus unum” — out of many, one — is one of America’s traditional mottos. And you might think it would be reflected in reality. We aren’t, after all, just united politically. We share a common language; the unrestricted movement of goods, services and people is guaranteed by the Constitution. Shouldn’t this lead to convergence in the way we live and think?
In fact, however, the past few decades have been marked by growing divergence among regions along several dimensions, all closely correlated. In particular, the political divide is also, increasingly, an economic divide. As The New York Times’ Tom Edsall put it in a recent article, “red and blue voters live in different economies.”
What Edsall didn’t point out is that red and blue voters don’t just live differently, they also die differently.
About the living part: Democratic-leaning areas used to look similar to Republican-leaning areas in terms of productivity, income and education. But they have been rapidly diverging, with blue areas getting more productive, richer and better educated. In the close presidential election of 2000, counties that supported Al Gore over George W. Bush accounted for only a little over half the nation’s economic output. In the close election of 2016, counties that supported Hillary Clinton accounted for 64% of output, almost twice the share of Trump country.
The thing is, the red-blue divide isn’t just about money. It’s also, increasingly, a matter of life and death.
Back in the Bush years I used to encounter people who insisted that the United States had the world’s longest life expectancy. They hadn’t looked at the data, they just assumed that America was No. 1 on everything. Even then it wasn’t true: U.S. life expectancy has been below that of other advanced countries for a long time.
The death gap has, however, widened considerably in recent years as a result of increased mortality among working-age Americans. This rise in mortality has, in turn, been largely a result of rising “deaths of despair”: drug overdoses, suicides and alcohol. And the rise in these deaths has led to declining overall life expectancy for the past few years.
What I haven’t seen emphasized is the divergence in life expectancy within the United States and its close correlation with political orientation. True, a recent Times article on the phenomenon noted that life expectancy in coastal metropolitan areas is still rising about as fast as life expectancy in other advanced countries. But the regional divide goes deeper than that.
A 2018 article in The Journal of the American Medical Association looked at changes in health and life expectancy in U.S. states between 1990 and 2016. The divergence among states is striking. And as I said, it’s closely correlated with political orientation.
I looked at states that voted for Donald Trump versus states that voted for Clinton in 2016, and calculated average life expectancy weighted by their 2016 population. In 1990, today’s red and blue states had almost the same life expectancy. Since then, however, life expectancy in Clinton states has risen more or less in line with other advanced countries, compared with almost no gain in Trump country. At this point, blue-state residents can expect to live more than four years longer than their red-state counterparts.
Is this all about deaths of despair in the eastern heartland? No. Consider our four most populous states. In 1990, Texas and Florida had higher life expectancy than New York and almost matched California; today, they’re far behind.
What explains the divergence? Public policy certainly plays some role, especially in recent years, as blue states expanded Medicaid and drastically reduced the number of uninsured, while most red states didn’t. The growing gap in educational levels has also surely played a role: Better-educated people tend to be healthier than the less educated.
Beyond that, there has been a striking divergence in behavior and lifestyle that must be affecting mortality. For example, the prevalence of obesity has soared all across America since 1990, but obesity rates are significantly higher in red states.
One thing that’s clear, however, is that the facts are utterly inconsistent with the conservative diagnosis of what ails America.
Conservative figures like William Barr, the attorney general, look at rising mortality in America and attribute it to the collapse of traditional values — a collapse they attribute, in turn, to the evil machinations of “militant secularists.” The secularist assault on traditional values, Barr claims, lies behind “soaring suicide rates,” rising violence and “a deadly drug epidemic.”
But European nations, which are far more secularist than we are, haven’t seen a comparable rise in deaths of despair and an American-style decline in life expectancy. And even within America these evils are concentrated in states that voted for Trump, and have largely bypassed the more secular blue states.
So something bad is definitely happening to American society. But the conservative diagnosis of that problem is wrong — dead wrong.

U.S. Program Would Offer Drugs for H.I.V. at No Cost

Texto completo: A new government program will provide donated drugs through major drugstore chains.
With donated drugs and services provided by major pharmacy chains, 200,000 uninsured Americans will gain access to H.I.V.-preventive medicines at no cost, the Trump administration announced on Tuesday.
The announcement, by Alex M. Azar II, the health and human services secretary, essentially explained how the government plans to distribute the drugs for pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, that were promised in May by the drugmaker Gilead Sciences.
PrEP describes a strategy of preventing infection with H.I.V. by taking a single pill a day, either Truvada or Descovy. Both are made by Gilead. The strategy is 99 percent effective at preventing infection, studies have shown, and is a mainstay of the administration's campaign to end the H.I.V. epidemic.
Some American cities with high H.I.V. rates, such as San Francisco, already have programs that pay the costs of PrEP for the uninsured. Gilead itself offers the drug at no cost to those who cannot afford it, or picks up insurance co-pays for patients who qualify.
But the new program -- called Ready, Set, PrEP -- marks the first time the federal government is supplying PrEP to patients not enrolled in Medicaid, the Veterans Health Administration or any other federal health program.
Under the new program, any patient who lacks health insurance, has had a recent negative H.I.V. test and has a prescription for PrEP -- presumably obtained from a doctor -- can call 855-447-8410 or sign onto a new government website, getyourprep.com, to apply for free H.I.V.-prevention drugs.
They can also apply in person, Mr. Azar said, through a participating health care provider, such as a community clinic.
Until March 30, the government will pay Gilead $ 200 per bottle -- each bottle of Truvada contains 30 pills -- to cover the cost of moving donated drugs from factories through the supply chain to patients, Mr. Azar said.
After that, he said, the Walgreens, Rite Aid and CVS chains will donate dispensing services and offer counseling to patients, and the government will seek cheaper ways to get the drugs from Gilead to those chains.
About 1.2 million Americans could benefit from PrEP because they are at high risk of getting H.I.V. from unprotected sex or needle-sharing, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Only an estimated 270,000 people are now taking the drugs.
Truvada and Descovy are now mired in billion-dollar patent lawsuits pitting H.H.S. against Gilead. The federal government and the company both claim ownership of patents covering the use of the drugs to prevent H.I.V. infection.
But Mr. Azar said the new program was "not related" to the lawsuits. "That matter will be resolved in the court system," he said.
Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, leader of a team at Massachusetts General Hospital that has analyzed the costs of the H.I.V. plans of the Obama and Trump administrations, said she was "having a hard time understanding why the government is paying $ 200 a month per bottle to dispense these drugs."
Truvada does not need refrigeration or special handling, and it is distributed free in France and Norway. The drug costs patients only $ 96 a year in Australia, $ 384 in Germany and $ 720 in Ireland.
The company has promised to donate enough of the drugs to cover as many as 200,000 people for 11 years in the United States.
Mr. Azar described the $ 200 per bottle payments as a stopgap measure that will enable rolling out the drugs as soon as possible. The amount is what Gilead claimed it pays the pharmacy supply chain to distribute its drugs, he said.
After March 30, Mr. Azar said, with a combination of donated pharmacy costs and competitive bidding for distribution contracts, "I think we'll be able to do better."
Gilead makes no money from the distribution arrangement, said Ryan McKeel, a company spokesman. It will reimburse vendors but not charge the government for the time of any Gilead employees involved.
Any tax deductions the company takes for its donation, he added, will be based on the cost of making the pills, not on their market value or distribution costs.
James Krellenstein, a founder of the advocacy group Prep4All Collaboration, said the government's plan "is poised to repeat the errors of Gilead's own medication
assistance program."
While uninsured patients may get free drugs under the program, he said, they get no help paying for the medical exam and laboratory tests needed to get and keep renewing the prescription, which can cost up to $ 1,000 a year.
Instead of focusing on paying Gilead up to $ 6 million for high pharmaceutical supply chain costs, the government could pay for lab tests for 6,000 patients, Mr. Krellenstein said.

Mr. Azar said that some of those costs are already covered by public clinics, and that his department is seeking $ 291 million this year from Congress to defray other fees in about 50 high-risk areas, beginning with Baltimore; Baton Rouge, La.; DeKalb County, in Georgia; and Cherokee Nation reservations.
To increase awareness of PrEP, Mr. Azar said, Walgreens and Health Mart, a coalition of independent pharmacies, will publicize the program.
In some cities, including New York, posters and billboards encouraging gay men and other people at risk to use PrEP are ubiquitous. But in more conservative parts of the country -- including the rural South, which is now one of the epidemic's hottest zones -- awareness campiagns are uncommon.

Texto completo: Annie Karni, Maggie Haberman, and Sheila Kaplan of the New York Times describe US president Donald Trump’s proposed ban on flavored e-cigarette products as “a swift and bold reaction to a growing public health crisis affecting teenagers” that Trump backed away from “under pressure from his political advisers and lobbyists to factor in the potential pushback from his supporters.”
Maybe they’re right about Trump’s motivations, but they’re wrong about pretty much everything else.
E-cigarettes are not a “public health crisis.” That supposed crisis is not “growing.” And to the extent that teenagers are negatively affected by e-cigarettes, the very “bold reactions” the three writers seem to favor are far more culpable than e-cigarettes themselves.
E-cigarettes are, according to all credible evidence, safer than burning sticks of tobacco — sorry, FDA, you don’t get to tell me I can’t say so.
A few cases of lung injury from black market “street vapes” have been reported, the cause (use of vitamin E in the “juice”) seems to have been identified, and that problem is already disappearing in the rear-view mirror.
Who buys “street vapes?” People who can’t buy the e-cigarette products they want legally, either because of content (cannabis) or age (the teenagers the Times authors imply they care about so much).
Banning flavored e-cigarette products wouldn’t stop teenagers, or anyone else, from getting flavored e-cigarette products. It would just send even more of them to the “street vape” market for those products.
If Trump reconsidered his proposed ban due to political pressure and the desire to be re-elected, so what? A good decision is a good decision.
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt once told a group of lobbyists, who were pushing a policy change at him, “Okay, you’ve convinced me. Now go out and bring pressure on me.”
That’s how politics works. Politicians appease voters and activist groups who can help or harm their careers. Sometimes that works out well for the public, sometimes it works out badly.
In this case it works out well — certainly for the public, and possibly for Trump. Much of the “I Vape and I Vote” demographic presumably falls outside his existing electoral “base,” and for at least some the issue matters enough to swing their votes.
Now Trump’s Democratic opponents need to decide which they value more: Their desire to run everyone’s lives at the expense of actual public health, or public health and those votes.

Senate confirms Dan Brouillette to lead Department of Energy

Texto completo: Washington • The Senate on Monday confirmed Dan Brouillette, a former lobbyist for Ford Motor Co., to be President Donald Trump’s second secretary of energy, replacing Rick Perry, who has become embroiled in the impeachment proceedings against Trump.
Senators voted 70-15 in favor of Brouillette’s confirmation. Several Democrats, including Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, Tom Udall of New Mexico and Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, joined Republicans in approving him.
Since 2017, Brouillette has been Perry’s second in command at the Department of Energy. He has pressed the Trump administration’s policy of “energy dominance,” which includes the rapid expansion oil and gas drilling and a bolstering of U.S. fossil fuel exports.
“I’m proud to have been a small part of the incredible success we have seen in American energy,” Brouillette told lawmakers at his Senate confirmation hearing in November.
While Brouillette sailed through a confirmation vote before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee last month, lawmakers on Monday criticized him for not answering questions about Perry’s dealings in Ukraine. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said that Brouillette “failed to provide substantive answers to key questions about Mr. Perry’s dealings.” He called Brouillette’s lack of response a “full-court stonewall.”
Other Democrats came to Brouillette’s defense.
“He’s up to this enormous task. He’s a good man,” Manchin said.
Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., said he hoped to see continued funding increases for Energy Department research centers such as the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in his state. “He understands the important work being done there,” he said.
Brouillette has promised to fight for the Department of Energy’s budget, even though the administration in the past has proposed cutting some agency programs by more than half and eliminating key research and development programs like the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy. The bulk of the department’s budget goes to nuclear weapons research, development, maintenance and cleanup.
He also has walked a fine line on climate change. Brouillette has described planetary warming as “something we need to work on” but has questioned the scientific consensus that climate change poses a serious threat. He has promoted statistics that show U.S. emissions have fallen 13% since 2005, but he also is a critic of the Paris Agreement, a pledge among nearly every nation to curb emissions that Trump intends to abandon.
Brouillette has argued that reductions of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions in the United States are being nullified by rising emissions in China.
In replacing Perry, Brouillette becomes the latest lobbyist and seasoned second-in-command to take over for an embattled Cabinet secretary.
Last year Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist who worked as the deputy administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under Scott Pruitt, took the helm when Pruitt resigned amid ethics scandals. David Bernhardt, an oil and gas lobbyist, served as deputy to Ryan Zinke, Trump’s first secretary of the Interior Department, then assumed the top position when Zinke departed, also facing ethics investigations.
Perry, a former Texas governor who once embraced abolishing the Energy Department, has largely avoided scandal, and Trump has at various times reportedly considered him for other high-profile posts in the administration. Perry has returned the admiration, saying recently that Trump was “ordained by God” to lead the country.
But in recent weeks, Perry has emerged as a player in the impeachment proceedings against Trump, facing scrutiny over his role in promoting energy exports to Ukraine and whether he was involved in the withholding of military aid to the country.
Before becoming deputy energy secretary, Brouillette was chief of staff to the House Energy and Commerce Committee and was assistant secretary of energy for congressional and intergovernmental affairs in the George W. Bush administration. He also worked as an executive at the United Services Automobile Association, a financial services provider to members of the military, and Ford.
Brouillette is a Louisiana native and a graduate of the University of Maryland. He and his wife, Adrienne, are Army veterans and longtime Republican donors. According to OpenSecrets.org, a website that tracks money in politics, Brouillette and his wife gave $30,000 to the Republican National Committee in 2012 and more than $50,000 to Republican candidates, including Perry, between 2005-16.

America's Red State Death Trip

Texto completo: Why does falling life expectancy track political orientation?
"E pluribus unum" -- out of many, one -- is one of America's traditional mottos. And you might think it would be reflected in reality. We aren't, after all, just united politically. We share a common language; the unrestricted movement of goods, services and people is guaranteed by the Constitution. Shouldn't this lead to convergence in the way we live and think?
In fact, however, the past few decades have been marked by growing divergence among regions along several dimensions, all closely correlated. In particular, the political divide is also, increasingly, an economic divide. As The Times's Tom Edsall put it in a recent article, "red and blue voters live in different economies."
What Edsall didn't point out is that red and blue voters don't just live differently, they also die differently.
About the living part: Democratic-leaning areas used to look similar to Republican-leaning areas in terms of productivity, income and education. But they have been rapidly diverging, with blue areas getting more productive, richer and better educated. In the close presidential election of 2000, counties that supported Al Gore over George W. Bush accounted for only a little over half the nation's economic output. In the close election of 2016, counties that supported Hillary Clinton accounted for 64 percent of output, almost twice the share of Trump country.
The thing is, the red-blue divide isn't just about money. It's also, increasingly, a matter of life and death.
Back in the Bush years I used to encounter people who insisted that the United States had the world's longest life expectancy. They hadn't looked at the data, they just assumed that America was No. 1 on everything. Even then it wasn't true: U.S. life expectancy has been below that of other advanced countries for a long time.
The death gap has, however, widened considerably in recent years as a result of increased mortality among working-age Americans. This rise in mortality has, in turn, been largely a result of rising "deaths of despair": drug overdoses, suicides and alcohol. And the rise in these deaths has led to declining overall life expectancy for the past few years.
What I haven't seen emphasized is the divergence in life expectancy within the United States and its close correlation with political orientation. True, a recent Times article on the phenomenon noted that life expectancy in coastal metropolitan areas is still rising about as fast as life expectancy in other advanced countries. But the regional divide goes deeper than that.
A 2018 article in The Journal of the American Medical Association looked at changes in health and life expectancy in U.S. states between 1990 and 2016. The divergence among states is striking. And as I said, it's closely correlated with political orientation.
I looked at states that voted for Donald Trump versus states that voted for Clinton in 2016, and calculated average life expectancy weighted by their 2016 population. In 1990, today's red and blue states had almost the same life expectancy. Since then, however, life expectancy in Clinton states has risen more or less in line with other advanced countries, compared with almost no gain in Trump country. At this point, blue-state residents can expect to live more than four years longer than their red-state counterparts.
Is this all about deaths of despair in the eastern heartland? No. Consider our four most populous states. In 1990, Texas and Florida had higher life expectancy than New York and almost matched California; today, they're far behind.
What explains the divergence? Public policy certainly plays some role, especially in recent years, as blue states expanded Medicaid and drastically reduced the number of uninsured, while most red states didn't. The growing gap in educational levels has also surely played a role: Better-educated people tend to be healthier than the less educated.
Beyond that, there has been a striking divergence in behavior and lifestyle that must be affecting mortality. For example, the prevalence of obesity has soared all across America since 1990, but obesity rates are significantly higher in red states.
One thing that's clear, however, is that the facts are utterly inconsistent with the conservative diagnosis of what ails America.
Conservative figures like William Barr, the attorney general, look at rising mortality in America and attribute it to the collapse of traditional values -- a collapse they attribute, in turn, to the evil machinations of "militant secularists." The secularist assault on traditional values, Barr claims, lies behind "soaring suicide rates," rising violence and "a deadly drug epidemic."
But European nations, which are far more secularist than we are, haven't seen a comparable rise in deaths of despair and an American-style decline in life expectancy. And even within America these evils are concentrated in states that voted for Trump, and have largely bypassed the more secular blue states.
So something bad is definitely happening to American society. But the conservative diagnosis of that problem is wrong -- dead wrong.

Trump Bars Bloomberg News From Campaign Events

Texto completo: President Trump's re-election campaign said on Monday that it would bar Bloomberg News journalists from attending its rallies and political events, an attempt to retaliate against the news organization's decision to cease investigating Democratic candidates in the wake of its billionaire owner's entry into the 2020 presidential race.
The Trump campaign broke from years of precedent in 2016 by revoking the press credentials of journalists from outlets like The Washington Post, Politico and BuzzFeed News, an early sign of the efforts to demonize the news media that have become a hallmark of the Trump presidency.
But Bloomberg News is facing a fraught situation, too. After the company's owner, Michael R. Bloomberg, decided last month to pursue the Democratic nomination, editors at the news outlet instructed their reporters to avoid "in-depth investigations" of Mr. Bloomberg or any other Democratic candidate. It was an attempt at fairness that some journalists called stifling.
On Monday, Mr. Trump's campaign manager, Brad Parscale, called it something else: biased.
"Bloomberg News has declared that they won't investigate their boss or his Democrat competitors, many of whom are current holders of high office, but will continue critical reporting on President Trump," Mr. Parscale wrote in a statement, calling the decision "troubling and wrong."
"Since they have declared their bias openly, the Trump campaign will no longer credential representatives of Bloomberg News for rallies or other campaign events," Mr. Parscale wrote. The campaign said it would decide "on a case-by-case basis" whether to respond to inquiries from individual reporters on stories.
The editor in chief of Bloomberg News, John Micklethwait, quickly fired back.
"The accusation of bias couldn't be further from the truth," Mr. Micklethwait wrote in a statement. "We have covered Donald Trump fairly and in an unbiased way since he became a candidate in 2015 and will continue to do so despite the restrictions imposed by the Trump campaign."
Howard Wolfson, a top campaign adviser to Mr. Bloomberg, also weighed in, pithily. "One week in and Mike is already under Trump's skin," Mr. Wolfson wrote on Twitter.
Mr. Trump and his senior aides routinely disparage individual reporters and entire news organizations for coverage they deem unfavorable. Press advocacy groups say the president's attacks have contributed to one of the more hostile domestic environments for journalists in recent memory.
Dean Baquet, executive editor of The New York Times, criticized the Trump campaign's move in a statement on Monday. "We condemn any action that keeps quality news media from reporting fairly and accurately on the presidency and the leadership of the country," Mr. Baquet wrote.
At the same time, Bloomberg News's approach to covering its owner's candidacy has proved divisive.
Roughly 2,700 journalists work at Bloomberg L.P., the financial data company that is the wellspring of Mr. Bloomberg's fortune, and this is not the first time that Mr. Bloomberg's ambitions have placed his employees in an awkward spot. During Mr. Bloomberg's 12 years as mayor of New York City, coverage of the billionaire's wealth and personal life were considered off limits at Bloomberg News.
In a memo last month, Mr. Micklethwait acknowledged that "there is no point in trying to claim that covering this presidential campaign will be easy," but added that the newsroom would continue to investigate Mr. Trump's administration "as the government of the day."
On Monday night, Mr. Trump, who had flown to London for a conference, added his own thoughts on the matter, deriding Mr. Bloomberg in a Twitter post as "Mini Mike Bloomberg" and describing Bloomberg News as a "third rate news organization." (He also accused The Times of "hatred & bias.") The president wrote that "It's not O.K.!" for Bloomberg News to skip investigations of Democratic candidates.
While Bloomberg News has pledged to continue covering polls, policies and "who is winning and who is losing" the 2020 race, the prohibition against investigative reporting -- considered among the most valuable forms of campaign journalism -- has caused some uproar.
Megan Murphy, a former Washington bureau chief at Bloomberg News, wrote on Twitter that it was "staggering" for the news outlet to prevent "an army of unbelievably talented reporters and editors from covering massive, crucial aspects of one of the defining elections of our time."

Re "A Working Holiday" (Business, Nov. 30): Can't Americans go even one day without shopping? Is it really necessary to have any number of retail stores open every day of the year?
Consumerism is becoming an addiction; let's restrain ourselves, folks, please.

To the Editor:
I worked in broadcast news for 30 years, mostly weekends and holidays. What's the big deal? I didn't feel a sting at all, and I got overtime on holidays. What I didn't get was an article on the front page of the business section written about me and my compadres, nor did we merit one.

Texto completo: Just over 1,000 miles from the coast of Australia lies New Caledonia, an island archipelago where the waters teem with life. This French territory, in the heart of the Coral Sea, is home to more than 9,300 marine species, including dugongs, manta rays and venomous sea snakes.
Among them is the greater sea snake, which can reach nearly 5 feet in length and is more than capable of killing a human with a single bite. But such a fearsome capability doesn’t bother Monique Zannier, 75, one of a group of seven women, ages 60-75, who snorkel regularly in Baie des Citrons, a bay in New Caledonia’s capital, Noumea.
“The Baie des Citrons is our playground,” she said. “We are in it almost daily, and we know all its nooks.”
What started as good regular exercise for Zannier has turned into a bounty of information for scientists studying the aquatic snakes. Researchers seeking new insights into the ecology of these reptiles have come to rely on the women, nicknamed the “fantastic grandmothers,” to help keep track of the hundreds of greater sea snakes that visit Noumea’s shallow-water bays.
An article published in October in the journal Ecosphere highlights the fruits of this collaboration between the team of snorkeling, senior citizen scientists and the study’s lead authors, Claire Goiran, a marine biologist at the University of New Caledonia, and Rick Shine, an evolutionary biologist at Australia’s Macquarie University.
“The grandmothers should be congratulated,” said Harold Heatwole, professor of zoology at the University of New England in Australia who was not involved in the study. “They’ve made a great contribution to science.”
Their diligent data collection, he said, has resulted in more detailed information on the ecology of greater sea snakes than is available for any other wide-ranging sea snake worldwide.
Unlike their terrestrial cousins, sea snakes are largely understudied. Most sea snakes live far offshore and are dangerous to handle, so few scientists have the means or desire to study them.
“We know very little about sea snakes,” Shine said. “Almost everything we know about them comes from ones that were accidentally caught in fishing nets.”
In 2013, Shine and Goiran set out to learn what they could about the mysterious greater sea snake. They chose the Baie des Citrons as the venue for this study, despite greater sea snakes having been seen there only six times in the past eight years. Greater sea snakes have distinctive markings on their tails, so individuals can be easily identified from photographs.
With limited time to survey the bay and no full-time volunteers to assist them, Goiran and Shine got off to a slow start. During the first three years of the study, the pair managed to catalog only 45 greater sea snakes.
But that all changed in June 2017 when Goiran met Aline Guemas, a 61-year-old retiree. One morning, while Goiran was snorkeling, she saw Guemas photographing the reef with her camera.
“We started chatting in the water and I explained to her what I was doing and she told me she wanted to help,” Goiran said.
Guemas started joining Goiran on her weekly surveys, photographing sea snakes and recording their location on the reef.
“I was very happy,” Goiran said. “She did exactly what I needed her to do.”
She encouraged Guemas to recruit other retirees and, before long, she had assembled a team of seven.
“She told a friend and that friend asked another friend. It really came together by chance,” Goiran said.
Among the first to join the group was Zannier, who had taken up snorkeling as a form of physical therapy, as well as Sylvie Hebert, a 62-year-old retired nurse who has circumnavigated the globe by sailboat, and Marilyn Sarocchi, a 63-year-old gymnast with a fear of snakes.
“We meet every morning between 8 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. We wear our diving equipment and we swim for one hour or two. Sometimes in summer, we can swim for three hours,” Sarocchi said. “Back on the beach we have tea and enjoy the beauty of the site. It is very relaxing.”
Since the group’s inception, the “fantastic grandmothers” have conducted hundreds of snorkel surveys in the Baie des Citrons and identified hundreds of greater sea snakes.
“As soon as the grandmothers set to work, we realized that we had massively underestimated the abundance of greater sea snakes in the bay,” Goiran wrote in the study.
The relationship between the grandmothers and the researchers seems to be mutually beneficial.
“We are very grateful to the scientists who let us have a part of their research,” said Genevieve Briancon, a 75-year-old retiree who joined the group shortly after its inception. “It’s very exciting. We learn a lot about sea life, and we are happy that our passion can be useful.”

Texto completo: A climate policy advisor for presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg has come under attack for criticizing an ambitious vision of the Green New Deal aimed at dismantling the fossil fuel industry.
David Victor, professor of international relations at UC San Diego, caused an uproar among environmental activists last month after saying in a New York Times article that Sen. Bernie Sanders' proposed climate plan "can't work in the real world."
The blowback centered on the fact that much of Victor's research over the last decade has been funded by the British oil and gas company BP and the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit representing the interests of prominent energy companies.

Critics also pointed out that Victor has been paid by the Trump administration to testify in defense of the federal government in a lawsuit brought by youth claiming a failure to act on climate change violates their constitutional rights.
In response, many academics came to Victor's defense, saying the internationally recognized researcher has dedicated his life to addressing global warming. Victor has been a leading contributor to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and was a player in the 2015 Paris agreement aimed at capping warming at 2 degrees Celsius.
"Based on my interaction with David, he's been extremely professional," said Veerabhadran Ramanathan, a renowned climate researcher at UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography, who has worked with Victor on a number of scientific papers and newspaper editorials.
"I've never thought that he's bringing any baggage to the table when we write," he added.
The Buttigieg campaign issued a statement to the Union-Tribune saying that Victor was a volunteer and just one of dozens of experts that contributed to the candidate's climate plan.
Victor's views on how to solve climate change highlight a significant rift among the Democratic Party and its supporters. While some see the fossil fuel industry as the enemy, others view oil and gas companies as potential partners in preventing catastrophic warming.
Victor -- who is also the co-chairman of the Brookings Institution's Initiative on Energy and Climate -- embodies the latter view.
"Some of the fossil fuel industry is going to be part of the solution," he said in a recent interview with the Union-Tribune, adding that his views were not necessarily those of the Buttigieg campaign. "We need to find as many allies in reducing carbon as possible."
In stark contrast, Sanders' climate plan -- dubbed the Green New Deal in coordination with the House resolution of the same name -- says the presidential contender will "face down the greed of fossil fuel executives and the billionaire class who stand in the way of climate action."
Victor said Sanders' approach is "guaranteed to fail politically."
Specifically, he took issue with the candidate's $16.3-trillion blueprint's goal of reaching 100% renewable energy for transportation and electricity by 2030 and fully decarbonizing the economy by 2050.
Pursuing such a vision, which calls for building government-run solar and wind farms, could waste valuable time, Victor said.
"Unless Bernie Sanders would win the presidency and win both houses with a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, I don't see how he's going to get that done," he said. "These are the kinds of things that are a concern."
Rather, Victor would like to carve out room to further explore biofuels, nuclear power and carbon capture technology.
He argues that such technologies could help limit warming in the most cost-effective way possible, a crucial step for encouraging developing nations to follow suit.
"If electrification of all end uses is extremely expensive, then it might be a fun thing to do in California, but it's not relevant for a global solution," he said.
Victor's skepticism of renewable energy's potential has made him enemies -- most notably Mark Jacobson, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, whose research provided inspiration for Sanders' climate plan.
Jacobson's work has suggested that the U.S. electrical grid can run on 80% clean energy by 2030 and 100% by 2050. According to his research, the shift -- which would include electrifying everything from cars to buildings to shipping -- is not only feasible but economical.
"In fact, if we transition to 100% renewables, the aggregate annual energy cost to all consumers would be 60% lower than it is under a fossil fuel regime," Jacobson said in an interview.
"Victor is not an expert on climate or energy plans," he added. "He's a shill for the fossil fuel industry."
Victor first raised the ire of Jacobson by co-authoring a 2017 paper that attempted to debunk the Stanford researcher's work on the feasibility of reaching 100% renewable energy.
The report, led by mathematician Christopher Clack of grid modeling firm Vibrant Clean Energy, said that Jacobson's analysis "used invalid modeling tools, contained modeling errors, and made implausible and inadequately supported assumptions."
Jacobson vehemently contested the paper authored by Clack, Victor and others.
When Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences declined to retract or make certain changes to the paper, Jacobson filed a lawsuit arguing that the article had damaged his credibility as a scientist by using false and misleading information. The complaint also alleged that the paper's authors failed to fully disclose their ties to the fossil fuel industry.
Citing the time and expense of the litigation, Jacobson dropped the suit in February. But the tension with Victor and others over the paper didn't end there.
Jacobson is now testifying in a federal lawsuit on behalf of 21 young people, organized under the nonprofit Our Children's Trust, who claim a failure to act on climate change violates their "rights to life, liberty, property, and public trust resources."
At the same time, Victor and two other authors on the paper are being paid by the Trump administration to testify in the case, which is known as Juliana vs. United States.
The federal government has argued that "there is no fundamental constitutional right to a stable climate system."
If the youth prevail, the government could be forced to take dramatic action to curb greenhouse gas. It would also probably set a legal precedent expanding the power of the judicial system in the context of climate change.
Victor said he opposes the lawsuit because it would violate the separation of powers between the branches of government.
"The case here is not whether the United States should make big reductions in greenhouse gases," Victor said. "Everyone agrees with that. The case here is whether the doctrine of public trust should be interpreted in an expansive way to create sort of a new set of human rights and legal obligations that would then result in the courts being able to determine large sections of energy policy."
Ann Carlson, co-director of UCLA School of Law's Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, said the litigation has been divisive even among those who support strong action on climate change.
"Many scholars think the litigation is ill-advised, including some highly prominent progressives," she said in an email. "Serving as an expert in the litigation does not make him ... a tool of the fossil fuel industry."

Texto completo: Kyle Fuller was there when the Bears needed him. In the fourth quarter of a tie game Thursday afternoon in Detroit, the Bears defense faced a defining moment.
On the previous play, safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix had lined up offside, shortening a third-and-5 for the Lions to third-and-inches. When running back J.D. McKissic took a handoff and bounced toward the outside, the Bears appeared to be in big trouble.
McKissic had room. The Bears held their breath.
Fuller had no help, little margin for error and one prevailing thought. "Just get a piece," the Bears cornerback said.
And a piece he got.
With an aggressive burst and a precise dive, Fuller got a piece of McKissic's right knee, then a bit of his right ankle and finally enough of his shoe top to send the running back stumbling for no gain.
Fourth down.
"It happened so fast," Fuller said. "You just shoot your gun and hope to get a piece. And I got enough of him."
Disaster averted.
"Probably the biggest play of the game," Bears coach Matt Nagy said. "An absolute game-changer."
The Lions still scored, using Matt Prater's 24-yard field goal to take a 20-17 lead with 10:47 remaining. But Fuller had proved clutch. And a little while later Mitch Trubisky followed suit, leading a 90-yard touchdown drive for a 24-20 victory.
Trubisky's two longest completions of that drive went to Anthony Miller for 35 and 32 yards, the latter featuring an athletic grab inside the Lions 5.
Nagy saw something in his quarterback. He saw conviction throws. Crisp timing. Confidence.
Nagy also saw something in his young receiver.
"The thing I love about Anthony is he plays with extreme passion," Nagy said. "And he's ultra-talented."
With the game in the balance, with the season's hopes on the line, each big contribution seemed to feed the next. The Bears made a series of game-winning plays, finished off a game-winning touchdown drive and left Ford Field with a jolt of confidence.
"I don't know where this is going to go in the next four weeks," Nagy said. "But if it goes well? You could look to that drive ..."
A narrow victory over a free-falling, last-place Lions team quarterbacked by third-stringer David Blough must be put in proper context and filtered accordingly. One dramatic division win doesn't suddenly revive the Bears' season or awaken a city's dashed Super Bowl dreams.
The Bears remain a middle-of-the-road team with a 6-6 record. And there's enough evidence within their Thanksgiving Day triumph -- blown coverages, dropped passes, foolish penalties, general sloppiness -- to remind everyone why this season is where it is.
Still, the come-from-behind win -- in a short week, on the road, with an extra level of resolve and toughness and togetherness required -- provides something to build on. And that certainly beats the alternative.
The Bears don't belong in the NFC playoff picture, but they at least enter December with a chance to photobomb it. And even the prospect of playing meaningful games during the final month of the regular season should provide players and coaches some added juice. Theoretically, there's still something to chase.
Even though the New York Times' playoff probability tracker gives the Bears just a 3% chance of playing into January, the folks at Halas Hall can use that 3% to adopt the mindset of Lloyd Christmas courting Mary Swanson in "Dumb and Dumber."
So you're telling me there's a chance.
Don't forget, the 2018 Eagles, the team that eliminated the Bears from last season's playoffs, started 4-6 yet found a way to keep grinding.
And that, for Nagy, has been an important part of this season's cleanup process. The Bears understand the mess they made for themselves with a four-game losing streak in October and early November. But they've stayed together and retained an important level of belief.
"I just think it's a credit to our players for battling through," Nagy said. "And that's what I like most about it. That's why last night felt so good in that locker room: because we understand that we're continuing to fight.
"Is it perfect? No. Can we be better? Yes. We know we have our hands full with the coming games. But as long as we just home in on (playing) the Dallas Cowboys at home (Thursday), who knows?"
Nagy has tried to describe what he felt in the Ford Field locker room Thursday. Before the game, he sensed his players' readiness: "I could tell our guys were laser focused."
And after the win? After Fuller's critical tackle and Miller's big catches and Trubisky's final-drive poise and win-sealing splash plays from Roquan Smith and Eddie Jackson? There seemed to be a heightened spirit, an energized fulfillment in the way they had all clawed for that win.
Players danced in Club Dub and exuded a collective pride.
"You could just feel an organic fun," Nagy said.
It's up to the Bears to carry that forward, to recognize the difficulty of their December schedule -- Cowboys, Packers, Chiefs, Vikings -- and embrace the opportunity to attack each game with the proper energy and focus.
The chances of writing a storybook ending to this disappointing season remain slim. But at Halas Hall, anyway, there's a belief that there's still something valuable to squeeze from this season.

Texto completo: At 55, John Leguizamo may technically be a baby boomer, but you won't often find him on the "get off my lawn" side of the generational divide. Take the debate over the gender-neutral identity marker "Latinx." "I love the term Latinx, because it makes me think that being Latin is a superpower," Leguizamo says, even though he didn't use it in the title of his latest one-man show, "Latin History for Morons." "I want Latinx youth to succeed," he says. "They're my target, and they're my protectorship, because they're the most vulnerable. 'Latinx' to me protects young Latin girls from being excluded, because the masculine side of the word does exclude them."
A quest to find Latin heroes Leguizamo brings his "Latin History" tour to Tempe's ASU Gammage on Dec. 7. It's his sixth one-man show, and the fourth that he has taken to Broadway (starting with 1998's "Freak").
A filmed performance has been streaming on Netflix for a year, but Leguizamo continues to add new material to his rapid-fire tour through a historical hall of fame.
The show wasn't inspired so much as provoked by the lack of Latino history in the textbooks his two kids were reading at school, and by his son's experience of being bullied over his ethnic heritage. Leguizamo set out to find the Latin American heroes that had been erased from history — and he found plenty, including the soldiers who fought in every U.S. war since 1776.
"The beautiful thing that happened was I was the one who was empowered and changed by doing all this research," he says.
"We are the sons and daughters of the American Revolution. Why isn't that everywhere, and statues and parades for us? How come we're not in 'Band of Brothers'? It's outrageous how we're marginalized, overlooked, erased. And I've had enough."
'I love identity politics' This kind of in-your-face identity politics will come as no surprise to anyone who has followed Leguizamo's wide-ranging career, and not just his performances in mainstream fare such as "John Wick" or the "Ice Age" movies (as the voice of Sid the giant sloth).
"I love identity politics," he says. "The only thing that I'm not cool with is the term 'people of color,' because at first I thought it was unifying, and now I'm realizing it's become a way of making quotas and further excluding Latin people."
He cites a call he says he made to his hometown newspaper — that would be the New York Times — about the lack of Latinos on its pages.
"And they say, 'Well, we have the largest (representation of) contributors of people of color,'" he says. "I go, 'That's incredible, I'm so happy for you. How many of those are Latin?' Quiet. 'We'll get back to you with those numbers.'"
Crowdfunding a Latin superhero For his next project, Leguizamo is moving on from historical heroes to superheroes. He is in the midst of a crowdfunding campaign to publish a comic book series he's writing titled "PhenomX," about an ex-con trying to clear his name.
"All the money goes to the artists, none to me," he says. "They're all Latinx, some women, some men."
So no, John Leguizamo isn't particularly worried about getting "OK boomered" by younger generations.
"If you're reading and you're talking to them and you're changing as you get older, you're not going to be that 'OK boomer,' " he says. "You're going to be a hip, woke boomer. But if you're not growing and changing and you're stuck in your ways? Goodbye, boomer."

Texto completo: Anger over corruption and Iran's influence on the country has driven weeks of unrest in Iraq's streets. But choosing a successor may be a long, arduous task.
NAJAF, Iraq -- Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi of Iraq formally submitted his resignation to Parliament on Saturday and asked lawmakers in a televised national address to quickly agree on a successor.
But Mr. Mahdi's resignation may not spell the end of the turmoil that has racked the nation over the past two months. Parliament is scheduled to meet Sunday and will vote on accepting his resignation, but it has yet to agree on an alternative.
"The resignation of the government is a method of peaceful handover of power in democratic systems," Mr. Mahdi said in his brief speech, adding that the government had tried to meet the demands of the country's widening protest movement.
Protests driven by anger over political corruption and Iran's influence over Iraqi politics -- coupled with the government's violent response -- had put Mr. Mahdi under intense pressure to step down. At least 400 people have been killed in the unrest, according to the United Nations and hospital sources.
Assuming Parliament accepts Mr. Mahdi's resignation, the formation of a new government could go quickly, but it will more likely take weeks, if not months. That realization quickly dissolved protesters' initial jubilation over Mr. Mahdi's announcement on Friday that he would step down.
Mr. Mahdi and his ministers would still serve in a caretaker government until President Barham Salih requests that the largest bloc in Parliament name a new prime minister and that person's ministers are then approved by a majority. History shows that agreeing on a prime minister can be a long, arduous process of balancing competing political factions.
It became so protracted in 2018 that Iranian officials helped set up the current government, brokering an agreement that brought in Mr. Mahdi and Mr. Salih as well as the Parliament speaker, Mohammed al-Halbousi.
One significant question is whether Iran will play the same role this time around. Since Iraqis are now openly expressing resentment toward Tehran, its direct involvement might be a liability.
Across the Shiite-dominated south of Iraq, as well as in the capital Baghdad, the chant "Out, Out Iran, Baghdad Remains Free" is part of the daily protests. If one thing is clear, the fact that Iraq is majority Shiite and so is Iran does not mean that Iraqi and Iranian Shiites have shared views.
In Najaf, a city that hosts several million Iranian pilgrims annually at its shrines and where Iranian clerical students train in its religious universities, the resentment of Tehran's insertion into Iraqi affairs is running so high that protesters burned the Iranian Consulate there on Wednesday night.
Three days later, the walls of one office in the complex were still faintly warm from the flames. A wall of file cabinets had been burned to a shell and the papers that had been inside were little more than a pile of ashes. The door had been ripped off a safe.
In the courtyard, the smell of burned wires and rubber drifted in the air as half-blackened documents blew in the autumn breeze and a single, charred sandal lay on its side. A carton of lemons, most of them covered with ash, rolled about on the tiles.
The complex's metal-frame buildings were so warped by the heat and looked so ruined that while they had not burned to the ground, their reconstruction would be a major undertaking.
No one was inside when the complex was set afire because the only two Iranian employees left through the back door when security guards realized they would not be able to hold off the protesters, said Abu Rusol, one of the guards.
Just a few hundred feet away, the shrine of Mohammed Baqr al-Hakim, a cleric assassinated in 2003, was a scene of tension on Saturday, with protesters facing off against Shiite militiamen protecting the site.
Mr. al-Hakim, although an Iraqi, spent years in exile in Iran and was part of the opposition to Saddam Hussein. Now his links to Iran have made his shrine a target of demonstrators.
Skirmishes continued at the shrine late Saturday afternoon. Protesters, who were largely unarmed, were coming into emergency treatment tents with gunshot wounds, said Muahin Yasseen, a fifth-year medical school student who had volunteered to help.
The United States -- though it has sought political reforms in Iraq, especially on corruption -- had wanted Mr. Mahdi to remain in office, worried that his departure could lead to even more extensive bloodshed.
Mr. Mahdi, however, has been unable to control the violence and the pressure on him to step down has built for some time. He resisted until the latest spate of killings and a looming threat of a no-confidence vote in Parliament.
On Friday, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the senior Shiite cleric in Iraq, urged Parliament to stop procrastinating or "the country will pay a high price, and everyone will regret it."
It was in the hours after Mr. Sistani's message that Mr. Mahdi announced his intention to resign.

Texto completo: The pledge of ranking Republican member of the House Intelligence Committee Devin Nunes to sue CNN and the Daily Beast is just the last such threat coming from the White House and its allies. President Donald Trump has publicly called for changing the libel laws, a repeated demand that ignores that the defamation standard rests on constitutional not statutory authority. While such threats may be cathartic and popular, Nunes may be doing greater damage to the White House than the media in declaring his intent to sue.
Nunes is aggrieved by the coverage of a breaking story that he used a congressional trip to meet with Ukrainian officials to dig up dirt against the Bidens in 2018. CNN and the Daily Beast cite Lev Parnas' lawyer as the source. Parnas, a former Rudy Guliani associate, was indicted in October for conspiring to violate the ban on foreign donations.
Nunes vehemently denied the stories and declared that "we actually caught them" in advancing a false story and a defamation lawsuit will soon follow.
At the outset, it is worth noting that I agree with the White House that there is a great deal of distorted and biased coverage of this president. However, that does not justify the president's reckless attacks on the media as "the enemy of the people" or his desire to roll back protections for the free press. More importantly, in this matter, Nunes proceeded to make statements that could easily be viewed as attacking the defenses raised not only by the White House but Nunes himself.
"This is criminal in nature." Nunes states, "The problem with this week's fake news story is – we actually caught them. And we caught them badly and it also involves criminal activity ... We are going to take both CNN and the Daily Beast likely into federal court, right after Thanksgiving and we hope they cooperate."
One possible meaning is that Nunes is referencing one of the "per se" categories for defamation in asserting that someone is committing a criminal offense. That would be a reference to a member of Congress using a public funds for political purposes. Yet, that is very similar to what Democrats are accusing President Trump of doing in pushing a quid pro quo by withholding aid or other official acts. One defense (raised by acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney) is that such quid pro quos have always been part of foreign policy so, "I have news for everybody: Get over it." If the criminal matter is the intermixing of politics with public-funded work, Nunes could find himself in the unenviable position of rivaling Mulvaney as one of the most quoted Republicans in this scandal.
Nunes stated "It is not OK to work with someone who has been indicted on [a] serious federal crime, to build a media narrative and dirty up a member of Congress."
One can certainly understand the desire to avoid association with Parnas or his equally dubious associate Igor Fruman. Parnas and Fruman bear striking resemblance to Flotsam and Jetsam – the craven and ingratiating henchmen for the sea witch Ursula in The Little Mermaid. Both men were arrested trying to leave the country at the airport shortly after meeting with Giuliani (who makes Ursula look like a public minded citizen).
The problem is that these two alleged felons, to use Ursula's description, were Giuliani's "poor little poopsies" in Ukraine. They worked with Giuliani who was (according to Giuliani and various witnesses) working for President Trump in pursuing matters in Ukraine. If it was untoward to be working with them, Nunes could have a problem in explaining why Giuliani maintained his own association with them in Ukraine.
Moreover, it is bizarre to suggest that the media should not work with accused felons. Many major stories are based on accounts from not just indicted but convicted felons. That is particularly the case when you are covering possible unethical or criminal acts. The association with such individuals is a problem for people like Giuliani, not the media.
This is why the premise of this defamation lawsuit is so potentially damaging to the narrative supporting the president. You cannot allege that it is per se defamatory to associate you with two individuals who have only two degrees of separation from the president himself. Indeed, the president has associated directly with a number of proven felons including his former personal counsel Michael Cohen and his former campaign chair Paul Manafort. They both displayed the same ravenous corrupt appetites in mixing government and private interests.
Nunes has insisted that he will file the lawsuits against CNN and the Daily Beast after Thanksgiving and added "we hope they cooperate." They may be more cooperative than he expects. With such a lawsuit will come depositions and discovery into Nunes' travel, associations and efforts. That could prove a treasure trove for two organizations with diminishing access to Republican sources. Moreover, Nunes will have to satisfy the standard that Trump has repeatedly denounced: the New York Times Company v. Sullivan standard of "actual malice."
That decision imposed a higher standard of proof for lawsuits by public officials based on the First Amendment's protection of free speech and the free press. During the civil rights movement, various southern states were using their defamation laws to hit media companies with huge damage awards to coerce them into silence. The court mandated that officials like Nunes must show that the media was acting with either knowledge of the falsity of their reporting or reckless disregard for the truth.
That standard is designed to be difficult to prove and meant to give protection to the media in publishing allegations against high-ranking officials. What may be easier to prove is that these two individuals are not the types with whom any responsible and reputable official would associate. The problem is that a couple of notable figures did precisely that.

Trolls may be behind that buzz you hear; They're growing in the Philippines -- and could be coming to an election near you.

Texto completo: As public anger mounted last year over delayed plans to shake up the Philippines' outage-plagued telecommunications sector, angry comments and one-star ratings flooded a government-run Facebook page.
When employees suspected online trolls, President Rodrigo Duterte's digital mastermind offered a solution.
"I'll handle this," said Nic Gabunada, the architect of the social media strategy that powered Duterte's 2016 election victory, according to a government employee who managed the Facebook page.

Pro-Duterte comments soon poured onto the page, with users defending the president's handling of the situation or blaming the problems on the previous administration. Many of the new commenters had only basic profile information on their pages, which featured mostly generic posts with religious or pro-government messages.
"It was Nic," said the employee, who was interviewed on condition her name not be used for fear of retribution. "The fact that he had a troll army was known by everyone, but not openly talked about."
In the Philippines, candidates and government officials routinely pay vast cyber-troll armies that create multiple fake social media accounts to smear opponents and prop themselves up.
It's all part of the online propaganda wars shaking politics in the country.
And it could soon be coming to the U.S., according to election officials and disinformation scholars who are watching closely. They warn that the Philippine epidemic probably will spread here, given Filipinos' proficiency in English, facility with social media and the lure of money from campaigns looking for a new way to get an edge over the competition.
Already, U.S. operatives in both parties have made early efforts at using trolls for political gain. Rogue progressives stealthily launched fake social media campaigns against Roy Moore, the GOP nominee for Senate in Alabama, during a 2017 special election. Their campaign aimed to confuse voters into thinking Moore supported banning alcohol and that Russian bots were working on his behalf.
The New York Times revealed the plot, along with an earlier, aborted plan developed by a firm run by former Israeli intelligence agents to engage dozens of paid trolls in swaying delegates to Donald Trump during the 2016 GOP convention. The plan was requested by a senior Trump campaign official but was not carried out.
"The presence of a large for-hire market looking at all the disinformation online that you can buy and people are selling is quite disturbing," Camille Francois, the chief innovation officer of Graphika, a firm that helps tech companies and government investigators find and confront online disinformation, said at a Federal Election Commission symposium in September.
"What these troll farms are reporting is a growth of global business.... What do we do about that?"
Manila alone has hundreds of active troll farms. The shadowy networks act as weapons that, for the right price, can build artificial buzz around a product, a celebrity -- or a political figure.
Those troll techniques "will be used more and more," said Malou N. Tiquia, chief executive of the Manila political strategy consultancy Publicus Asia. "When Facebook said it won't ban political ads, that was already a signal to everyone that anything goes."
U.S. regulators have barely begun to consider the mounting threat, and Silicon Valley has shown itself lacking the tools and will to effectively confront it. Tech firms are making little headway stamping out the scourge where it has emerged, even after Facebook in March removed from its platform 200 pages for "inauthentic" activity and took the rare step of identifying Gabunada's network as the culprit.
The Philippine digital propagandist has denied trafficking in misinformation and did not respond to texts seeking comment about his work for the Duterte administration.
Such moves by Facebook are doing little to slow the trolls.
Filipinos spend so much time online -- they average a staggering 10 hours a day, according to industry data -- and disinformation has spiraled so quickly that Katie Harbath, Facebook public policy director for global elections, during a 2018 talk in Berlin branded it "patient zero in the global disinformation epidemic."
"The propaganda looks really organic and it often doesn't trip any of the flags" that alert tech companies, said Jonathan Ong, a professor of global digital media at University of Massachusetts Amherst whose research has taken him inside Philippine troll farms.
"The best strategists know how not to get caught."
Political campaigns contract out their digital efforts to consultants, who in turn pay up to $1,000 per month to college students and recent graduates who are charged with launching multiple fake Facebook pages designed to look like they were created by actual voters or grass-roots groups.
"It is so easy to be enlisted in these jobs," Ong said. His recent study on the industry includes an interview with one paid troll who fell into the work when the chief of staff of the political campaign she was working on ordered everyone to start creating fake accounts and posting on them.
Others have fleeting loyalties politically but are attracted to the cash. Consultants running troll farms have been known to switch sides in the middle of an election.
"The alliances are very shifty," Ong said. "Strategists will switch in the middle of a campaign to join who they think will be the winner. They will betray their client. It happened in the last election."
Most often, the operations are run through contractors separate from the actual campaigns so the candidate has no fingerprints on the weapon. And the trolls often don't trigger attention from tech platforms because they know how to avoid detection. The algorithms that tech companies use to detect phony accounts tend to focus on dozens of commenters posting the same message around the same time, or users with a stock photo on their profile page. The trolls don't do these things.
"You can look like legitimate Facebook users to trick the [company's] artificial intelligence," said Ross Tapsell, a researcher at Australian National University who documented the surge of paid troll activity in the Philippine province of Cebu.
Some trolls, he said, get offered a rate of $1 per social media post. In some cases operatives contract the work out to troll farms in far-off places, including Saudi Arabia.
"We have only scratched the surface of what a lot of this involved," he said.
The government employee who last year watched what she believed were trolls swarm to the defense of Duterte on Facebook said her suspicions were confirmed when her boss later talked openly at a meeting about Gabunada's troll operations. She also met colleagues who had visited an office building in metropolitan Manila that housed the troll farm.
She quit soon after.
"It was very scarring," she said. "I don't know if these practices will end. It's very normalized in the Philippines, and advertising professionals are not ashamed that they use these strategies."
Among those who have been in the trenches is Joyce Ramirez, a publicist who ran social media for one of Duterte's rivals, Grace Poe.
Ramirez, who specializes in promoting films and celebrities, at one point controlled an army of 50 social media loyalists who together had 45 million Twitter followers on accounts that didn't use the owners' names. With a few strokes, she said, she could make any entertainment-related topic trend on Twitter in the Philippines. The tweeters were sometimes paid in cash, sometimes in cellphones and other gifts.
Such a network is politically potent, as in the Philippines, "there is a thin line that separates politics from showbiz," Ramirez said.
When a pro-Duterte blogger accused Ramirez of secretly working for another opposition candidate in 2017, she was attacked on social media by a blogger who was echoed by thousands of pro-government users; Ramirez believes they were paid trolls. The blogger was under contract at the time as a social media consultant for the Philippine department of foreign affairs.
"They hammered fake news against me again and again, with 5,000 to 7,000 people writing against me," Ramirez said. "It was all made up."
Ramirez quit politics. Her army of young influencers disbanded, some switching sides to defend Duterte's government, others leaving Twitter after their accounts were deleted or suspended. What the experience taught her, she said, is that Filipinos "thrive greatly in manufactured noise."
"Nothing is ever real," she said. "Whatever you hear in the news is most likely to deflect people from the truth."

Texto completo: New York Times columnist David Brooks was roasted on Twitter after he claimed that candidates for national office face a harder time if they are from an urban area on either coast.
Brooks theorized that it's more difficult for a candidate to run for national office if they're from California or New York because those areas are not representative of the rest of the country.
"It’s hard to run for national office from California or New York. The urban parts of those states are so unrepresentative you don’t understand what you’re about to face," he tweeted on Thursday and included a link to a New York Times story about the downfall of California Sen. Kamala Harris's presidential campaign's downfall.
Many on social media were quick to point out fallacies in Brooks's theory: mainly that President Trump long lived in New York before recently changing his residence to Florida while he ran against Hillary Clinton, who served as New York senator from 2001-2009.

Texto completo: Both the New York Times and Washington Post published stories arguing that Sen. Kamala Harris's presidential campaign is on uneasy footing and nearing a collapse.
Harris, despite declaring her candidacy in front of over 20,000 people in January, has experienced a significant dip in the polls in recent months in part because voters still have questions about who she is and what she supports.
The Post reported, "As a result, her candidacy is now teetering, weighed down by indecision within her campaign, her limits as a candidate and dwindling funds that have forced her to retreat in some places at a moment she expected to be surging," and labled her campaign "flailing."
The Harris campaign recently laid off staffers to the ire of those left in the offices. Campaign manager Juan Rodriguez was pelted by questions from other members of the campaign following those layoffs earlier this month. Kelly Mehlenbacher, the Iowa operations director, roasted Rodriguez and Harris's sister Maya, who's also the campaign chairwoman, in her resignation letter. She has since joined the Bloomberg campaign.
The Times obtained Mehlenbacher's resignation letter, in which she claimed, “This is my third presidential campaign and I have never seen an organization treat its staff so poorly," and added that, “With less than 90 days until Iowa we still do not have a real plan to win."
They also reported that factions have been created within the Harris campaign and that she is no longer on good terms with Rodriguez. Rep. Marcia Fudge, who has endorsed Harris and is a former chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, argued that while Harris is not absolved of responsibility, she needs to get rid of Rodriguez in order to regain her footing in the primary.

Texto completo: BY ROBERT BURNS
The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - Richard Spencer, who was fired as Navy secretary for his handling of a SEAL war crimes case championed by President Donald Trump, wrote that the commander in chief "has very little understanding" of how the American military works.
The extraordinary accusation came in an opinion piece published on The Washington Post's website Wednesday evening, three days after he was fired. Spencer called Trump's intervention in the case of Navy Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher "shocking" and unprecedented.
Spencer was fired Sunday by Defense Secretary Mark Esper for working a private deal with the White House to ensure that Gallagher be allowed to retire without losing his SEAL status.
In his Post article, Spencer acknowledged his mistake but also asserted that Trump's actions were detrimental to the military.
Spencer said Trump had involved himself in the Gallagher case "almost from the start," by telephoning Spencer even before the SEAL's court martial started to ask that Gallagher be moved out of confinement at a Navy brig. Spencer said he resisted Trump because the presiding judge had decided that confinement was important. Nonetheless, Trump ordered Spencer to transfer Gallagher from the brig to the equivalent of an enlisted barracks.
Spencer said he believes Trump's interest in the case stemmed partly from the way Gallagher's defense lawyers and others "worked to keep it front and center in the media."
After Gallagher was acquitted of most charges but convicted of posing with the corpse of an Islamic State extremist in Iraq, he submitted his request to retire. In Spencer's telling, that raised three questions for the Navy, including whether Gallagher should be allowed to retire at his current rank. The military jury had said he should be demoted.
Trump, who had tweeted support for Gallagher and stated that his case had been "handled very badly from the beginning," short-circuited the Navy's administrative review of Gallagher's status by ordering Spencer to restore Gallagher's rank.
"This was a shocking and unprecedented intervention in a low-level review," Spencer wrote. "It was also a reminder that the president has very little understanding of what it means to be in the military, to fight ethically or to be governed by a uniform set of rules and practices."
Spencer's scathing commentary echoes the thrust of an opinion piece published two days earlier by two of his predecessors, Richard Danzig and Sean O'Keefe.
Danzig, who led the Navy under President Bill Clinton, and O'Keefe, his predecessor in the administration of President George H.W. Bush, wrote in The New York Times that Trump has politicized the military to its detriment.
"His values are not those of our military," they wrote.
Last week, Trump tweeted that Gallagher must be allowed to keep his Trident pin, the medal that designates a SEAL member. The Navy had planned to let an administrative board review the question starting Monday, but eventually Esper decided to stop that process and let Gallagher retire as a SEAL, as Trump had ordered.
Earlier Wednesday, the Navy announced that it had canceled the peer-review boards for three SEAL officers who supervised Gallagher during the Iraq deployment that gave rise to the war crimes charges.
Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly said the case was becoming a distraction for the commando force, known for its quiet professionalism but recently roiled with controversy.
The decision was the latest twist in the Gallagher matter. Trump has made no mention of the three SEAL officers also ordered to be reviewed. All three had overseen Gallagher during his 2017 deployment to Iraq.
But Modly said there were better ways to address any "failures in conduct, performance, judgment, or professionalism exhibited by these officers."
He directed the chief of naval operations to end the review process for Lt. Cmdr. Robert Breisch, Lt. Jacob Portier and Lt. Thomas MacNeil.
"The United States Navy, and the Naval Special Warfare Community specifically, have dangerous and important work to do," Modly said in a statement. "In my judgment, neither deserves the continued distraction and negative attention that recent events have evoked."
Modly said his decision should not be interpreted as loosening the standards he expects of SEALs. He said ongoing efforts will continue to address problems within the SEAL community, which has had numerous allegations of misconduct in recent months.
"Navy uniformed leaders have my full confidence that they will continue to address challenging cultural issues within the Naval Special Warfare community, instill good order and discipline, and enforce the very highest professional standards we expect from every member of that community," he said.
Portier was Gallagher's platoon commander and was charged with failing to report the killing of the captive. He denied the charges and they were dropped after the jury acquitted Gallagher of murder.
Portier's attorney, Jeremiah Sullivan, said Portier was happy to learn he would be allowed to keep his trident, a pin designating SEAL status.
"Lt. Portier is extremely grateful for the unwavering support of President Trump," Sullivan said.
Attorneys for Breisch and MacNeil did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Texto completo: He worked to advance black causes within the Catholic Church. In 1981 he drew national coverage and consternation in the church when he adopted a child.
The Rev. George Clements, a Chicago priest who caused a stir in the Roman Catholic church when he adopted a child in the early 1980s, and whose civil rights and social justice activism inspired a television movie about his career, died on Monday at a hospital in Indiana. He was 87.
The Archdiocese of Chicago confirmed the death but did not specify the cause. The Rev. Michael Pfleger, another Chicago priest, said Father Clements had had a stroke and heart attack in recent weeks.
Father Clements was devoted to the civil rights movement as well as his faith, and he worked hard to advance black causes. He marched with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in Chicago, Alabama and Mississippi; he also found common cause with the Black Panther Party in Chicago in the 1960s. He helped create programs, like the National Black Catholic Clergy Caucus, to support African-Americans within the church.
Father Clements told Contemporary Newsmakers, a biographical guide, in 1985 that he thought such internal organizations were necessary. "I felt very lonely," he said, "and felt like I was really kind of lost in a sea of whiteness in the midst of all the furor that was taking place in the civil rights movement, and it was a beautiful thing to find kindred souls around the country that felt the same way as I."
Father Clements started programs to help drug addicts and incarcerated people and their families. In 1980 he created One Church One Child, a program to help Catholic churches find adoptive parents for orphaned black children. That year he announced that he intended to adopt a black child himself to dramatize the problem, drawing national media coverage and creating consternation in the church.
The Associated Press reported in 1980 that the Chicago Archdiocese issued a statement that praised Father Clements's character but said, in part, "It may be more appropriate for a priest to leave adoptions to those who are less encumbered by pastoral responsibilities, to those who can provide a true home."
The church agreed in 1981 that adoption would not violate Father Clements's vows, and he adopted a 13-year-old boy, Joey, from an orphanage. "I had given up hope of finding a family," Joey said, according to an article in The New York Times. "I am very proud to have him as my dad."
Father Clements said: "If the church had blocked me, I would not have defied them. But they didn't. Thank God they didn't."
In time Father Clements adopted three more sons. His life and work were chronicled in "The Father Clements Story," a 1987 television movie starring Louis Gossett Jr.
George Harold Clements was born to Samuel and Aldonia (Peters) Clements on Jan. 26, 1932, in Chicago, where his father worked as a city auditor.
In 1945, Father Clements became the first African-American to graduate from the Chicago Archdiocese's Archbishop Quigley Preparatory Seminary. He completed bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of St. Mary of the Lake seminary in Mundelein, Ill., north of Chicago, before he was ordained in 1957.
Father Clements was accused in August of sexually abusing a minor in 1974 while he was pastor of Holy Angels parish on the South Side of Chicago. He denied the allegation, but Cardinal Blase J. Cupich asked him to step aside from the ministry while the charges were investigated.
A spokesman for the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services said the allegation was classified as "unfounded" after the department's investigation, The Chicago Sun-Times reported. The archdiocese, however, said its own investigation was "still ongoing."
He is survived by his sons, Friday, Stewart, St. Anthony and Joseph; a sister, Ynez Gilmer; 15 grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren.
The Associated Press contributed reporting.

Murders, Carried Out With Manners

Texto completo: A man snuffs out his aristocratic relatives one by one in the 1949 British film "Kind Hearts and Coronets," now showing at Film Forum.
A mannerly cad murders his way to a dukedom, dispatching eight relatives all played by Alec Guinness. Obviously, "Kind Hearts and Coronets" is a comedy. In fact, a recent British Film Institute poll ranked it as Britain's greatest.
Directed by Robert Hamer for Ealing Studios, the movie is showing in a new 4K restoration of its original version on the occasion of its 70th birthday through Dec. 5 at Film Forum.
In his 1950 review, the New York Times critic Bosley Crowther hailed "Kind Hearts" as "a spoof on the highest level of cultivated humor." That's one way to describe this savage jest, saturated with class hatred and narrated in a tone of droll understatement by its unflappable serial-killer protagonist, Louis Mazzini (Dennis Price).
Mazzini is introduced in prison awaiting his date with the hangman and finishing his memoirs, a litany of crime. His mother, disowned by her aristocratic family for marrying an Italian opera singer, was denied burial in the ancestral crypt, thus inspiring her son to avenge her by eliminating all those in the way of his succession.
What follows is a series of creative murders, all entertainingly annotated by the killer. The most elaborate involves the poisoning of a doddering clergyman; the most outlandish has Mazzini using a well-aimed projectile to burst the hot-air balloon carrying the militant suffragist Lady Agatha: "I shot an arrow into the air. It fell to earth in Berkeley Square." That the victims, including Lady Agatha, are universally Guinness removes the sting -- however Mazzini does away with them, his look-alike relatives keep popping up.
The actor's multiple appearances turn the movie into a stunt. "The sly and adroit Mr. Guinness plays eight Edwardian fuddy-duds with such devastating wit and variety that he naturally dominates the film," Crowther wrote. Perhaps this performance diverted Crowther's attention from Mazzini's other sketchy escapades, outrageous for the time, which include courting one victim's widow (Valerie Hobson) while carrying on an affair with a friend's sultry wife (Joan Greenwood). In his way, this British villain is as coldblooded as Richard III or Macbeth.
Among Ealing's most accomplished directors, Hamer was not primarily a maker of comedies. He made his reputation with the creepy "haunted mirror" sequence in the classic 1945 horror anthology "Dead of Night." He also directed the atmospheric crime thriller "It Always Rains on Sunday," a 1947 movie that, in its treatment of London's working-class East End, predates the gritty "kitchen-sink" naturalism of films like "Room at the Top" (1959) and "Look Back in Anger" (1959) by a dozen years.
With "Kind Hearts," Hamer had first planned to make a comedy about the French serial killer Henri Landru, but Charlie Chaplin beat him to it, with "Monsieur Verdoux." He then adapted Roy Horniman's 1907 novel, "Israel Rank: The Autobiography of a Criminal," a snobbish, anti-Semitic satire in which a Jewish interloper gets away with murder and winds up a duke.
In the aftermath of World War II, it was surely prudent to change the killer's ethnicity. Such sensitivity did not extend, however, to a racial slur used twice in a children's nursery rhyme and overdubbed for release in the United States. The American version also added a final shot to ensure no one gets away with murder.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump was briefed on the whistleblower complaint about his dealings with Ukraine before the White House released nearly $400 million in military aid to Kyiv, officials say, shedding new light on events that triggered the impeachment inquiry.
Trump was told about the complaint in late August in a briefing by White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and John Eisenberg, an attorney with the White House National Security Council, according to two officials not authorized to publicly discuss the matter.
The lawyers told the president about the complaint, explaining that they were trying to determine whether they were legally required to give it to Congress, the officials said. The aid was released on Sept. 11 amid growing pressure from lawmakers.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The White House has claimed there was no link between the military aid suspension and the president’s request for Ukraine to investigate his political rival Joe Biden and his family.
But it was his request to Ukraine’s president in a July phone call that prompted the government whistleblower’s complaint about a link. The assertion of such a link has since been corroborated by a parade of witnessed testifying on Capitol Hill.
The August briefing with Trump was first reported by The New York Times.
The revelation comes just days before the House Judiciary Committee takes over the impeachment probe, scheduling a hearing for next week as it pushes closer to a possible vote on charges of "high crimes and misdemeanors."
The Judiciary panel scheduled the hearing as the Intelligence Committee on Tuesday released two last transcripts from its depositions, including from a White House budget official who detailed concerns among colleagues as Trump ordered them, through intermediaries, to put a hold on military aid to Ukraine.
Trump and his lawyers have been invited to attend the hearing and make a request to question witnesses, according to Democratic rules approved by the House last month. The committee released a letter from committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat, to the Republican president, saying he hopes Trump will participate, "consistent with the rules of decorum and with the solemn nature of the work before us."
The White House said Wednesday no decision had been made whether to send a representative.
"But what is obvious to every American is that this letter comes at the end of an illegitimate sham partisan process," press secretary Stephanie Grisham said.
Meanwhile, State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus reaffirmed in a statement the U.S. commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.

Texto completo: MANILA, Philippines - As public anger mounted last year over delayed plans to shake up the Philippines' outage-plagued telecommunications sector, angry comments and one-star ratings flooded a government-run Facebook page.
When employees suspected online trolls, President Rodrigo Duterte's digital mastermind offered a solution.
"I'll handle this," said Nic Gabunada, the architect of the social media strategy that powered Duterte's 2016 election victory, according to a government employee who managed the Facebook page.
Pro-Duterte comments soon poured onto the page, with users defending the president's handling of the situation or blaming the problems on the previous administration. Many of the new commenters had only basic profile information on their pages, which featured mostly generic posts with religious or pro-government messages.
"It was Nic," said the employee, who was interviewed on the condition her name not be used for fear of retribution. "The fact that he had a troll army was known by everyone, but not openly talked about."
In the Philippines, candidates and government officials routinely pay vast cyber-troll armies that create multiple fake social media accounts to smear opponents and prop themselves up.
It's all part of the online propaganda wars shaking politics in the country.
And it could soon be coming to the U.S., according to election officials and disinformation scholars who are watching closely. They warn that the Philippine epidemic probably will spread here, given Filipinos' proficiency in English, facility with social media and the lure of money from campaigns looking for a new way to get an edge over the competition.
Already, U.S. operatives in both parties have made early efforts at using trolls for political gain. Rogue progressives stealthily launched fake social media campaigns against Roy Moore, the GOP nominee for Senate in Alabama, during a 2017 special election. Their campaign aimed to confuse voters into thinking Moore supported banning alcohol and that Russian bots were working on his behalf.
The New York Times revealed the plot, along with an earlier, aborted plan developed by a firm run by former Israeli intelligence agents to engage dozens of paid trolls in swaying delegates to Donald Trump during the 2016 GOP convention. The plan was requested by a senior Trump campaign official but was not carried out.
"The presence of a large for-hire market looking at all the disinformation online that you can buy and people are selling is quite disturbing," Camille Francois, the chief innovation officer of Graphika, a firm that helps tech companies and government investigators find and confront online disinformation, said at a Federal Election Commission symposium in September.
"What these troll farms are reporting is a growth of global business. What do we do about that?"
Manila, alone, has hundreds of active troll farms. The shadowy networks act as weapons that, for the right price, can build artificial buzz around a product, a celebrity - or a political figure.
Those troll techniques "will be used more and more," said Malou N. Tiquia, chief executive of the Manila political strategy consultancy Publicus Asia. "When Facebook said it won't ban political ads, that was already a signal to everyone that anything goes."
U.S. regulators have barely begun to consider the mounting threat, and Silicon Valley has shown itself lacking the tools and will to effectively confront it. Tech firms are making little headway stamping out the scourge where it has emerged so far, even after Facebook in March removed from its platform 200 pages for "inauthentic" activity and took the rare step of identifying Gabunada's network as the culprit.
The Filipino digital propagandist has denied trafficking in misinformation and did not respond to texts seeking comment about his work for the Duterte administration.
Such moves by Facebook are doing little to slow the trolls.
Filipinos spend so much time online - they average a staggering 10 hours a day, according to industry data - and disinformation has spiraled so quickly that Katie Harbath, Facebook public policy director for global elections, branded it "patient zero in the global disinformation epidemic" during a 2018 talk in Berlin.
"The propaganda looks really organic and it often doesn't trip any of the flags" that alert tech companies, said Jonathan Ong, a professor of global digital media at University of Massachusetts Amherst whose research has taken him inside Filipino troll farms.
Political campaigns contract out their digital efforts to consultants, who in turn pay up to $1,000 per month to college students and recent graduates who are charged with launching multiple fake Facebook pages designed to look like they were created by actual voters or grassroots groups.
"It is so easy to be enlisted in these jobs," Ong said. His recent study on the industry includes an interview with one paid troll who fell into the work when the chief of staff of the political campaign she was working on ordered everyone to start creating fake accounts and posting on them.
Others have fleeting loyalties politically but are attracted to the cash. Consultants running troll farms have been known to switch sides in the middle of an election.
"The alliances are very shifty," Ong said. "Strategists will switch in the middle of a campaign to join who they think will be the winner. They will betray their client. It happened in the last election."
Most often, the operations are run through contractors separate from the actual campaigns so the candidate has no fingerprints on the weapon. And the trolls often don't trigger attention from tech platforms because they know how to avoid detection. The algorithms that tech companies use to detect phony accounts tend to focus on dozens of commenters posting the same message around the same time, or users with a stock photo on their profile page. The trolls don't do these things.
"You can look like legitimate Facebook users to trick the (company's) artificial intelligence," said Ross Tapsell, a researcher at Australian National University who documented the surge of paid troll activity in the Philippine province of Cebu.
In some cases operatives contract the work out to troll farms in far-off places, including Saudi Arabia.
"We have only scratched the surface of what a lot of this involved," he said.

Excusing bad behavior in any situation only encourages worse

Texto completo: Professional football involves systematic violence. On every play, men do things that would get them arrested in other contexts. What makes it a game -- rather than a brawl, a riot or deadly combat -- is that the violence is controlled.
There's a penalty for "unnecessary roughness" because roughness must be kept within certain limits. Some types of brutal contact are allowed, but others are forbidden.
Some forbidden ones were committed by Cleveland Browns defensive star Myles Garrett in a recent game against Pittsburgh. Having made a late hit on the Steelers' Mason Rudolph, which led to a scuffle with the quarterback, Garrett yanked Rudolph's helmet off and then struck him on the head with it.
Shocking incidents like this put a choice to the NFL: Deal leniently or sternly with the offender. The league could have decided that Garrett's ejection, coupled with a stiff fine and mandatory counseling, would suffice for his tantrum. Instead, it suspended him for the final six games of the season and gave no promise about when he will be reinstated. It thus sent Garrett a message that such outrageous conduct will not be tolerated.
But it also sent a strong message to all the players who get through each game without going berserk: that their stoic fortitude is recognized, respected and rewarded. To let Garrett off with a slap on the wrist would devalue their discipline. It would excuse bad behavior and generate more of it.
Donald Trump has a different attitude about punishing wrongdoers. He recently pardoned Clint Lorance, an Army lieutenant convicted of ordering the murder of three Afghans, and Matthew Golsteyn, a Green Beret major charged with murdering an Afghan prisoner.
Navy Secretary Richard Spencer was fired after Trump elected to reverse the demotion and preserve the SEAL Trident pin of Eddie Gallagher -- who was prosecuted in a military court on charges of murder and other crimes, though he was convicted only of posing for a photo with a corpse. Trump justified his decision by tweeting, "We train our boys to be killing machines, then prosecute them when they kill!"
But even in war, some killings are not allowed. Trump's intervention drew sharp criticism from military leaders, notably former Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey and former Marine Corps commandant Gen. Charles Krulak.
Retired Army Col. Mike Jason, who led combat units in Iraq and Afghanistan, tweeted, "The decision to pardon these three men, countering the sanctity of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the decisions of commanders, the verdict of their peers, our adherence to the Laws of Warfare -- WILL have long lasting battlefield consequences."
These veterans know more of war than Trump does. It was Gallagher's fellow SEALs who accused him of crimes. Nine members of Lorance's unit testified against him. "It tainted our entire service," one of them told The New York Times. "Every time a new story calling him a hero happens, I don't sleep."
The vast majority of our troops recognize that fighting a war is not a euphemism for mass slaughter or premeditated murder. They respect the rules of combat, even when it would be easier and safer not to. When the president sides with those who violate those rules, he effectively denigrates the integrity and self control of everyone else in uniform.
What leaders get is what they reward and tolerate. Trump cares nothing for laws of war. He wants our troops to be "killing machines." His indiscriminate bloodlust will make it harder for commanders to elicit restraint from their troops.
The same logic, of course, applies to Trump's own corrupt, reckless, self-serving and destructive behavior as president -- most notably in his attempt to extort the president of Ukraine and his subsequent efforts to prevent Congress from learning all the facts.
No president since Richard Nixon has shown such contempt for law and such eagerness to misuse the powers of his office for his own benefit. Nixon was forced out, and his fate was a lesson to his successors on the boundaries of acceptable behavior.
If Trump is not impeached and removed, the message will be that presidents can get always with virtually anything. If he isn't held fully accountable for his abuses, he will set a new low standard for acceptable conduct. And we can expect the same, if not worse, from future presidents.
As musician Jason Isbell sings, "The right thing's always the hardest thing to do." Honoring the virtuous by punishing the vicious is one way to make doing the right thing just a bit easier.

Texto completo: A psychological thriller series debuts on Apple TV Plus. And the first two "Godfather" movies air on IFC.
What's Streaming
SERVANT Stream on Apple TV Plus. A recent trailer for this series has all the ingredients of a shocking story: an unsettling doll, foreboding rain and a title card that reads "from M. Night Shyamalan." That filmmaker is an executive producer of the series, a psychological thriller about a couple (Lauren Ambrose and Toby Kebbell) who have lost a child. As part of a form of therapy meant to help them cope, the pair start taking care of a lifelike baby doll. They even enlist a nanny (Nell Tiger Free) to help -- which is when matters begin to take a turn for the exceedingly strange.
FROZEN (2013) Stream on Disney Plus; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The fact that "Frozen 2" has basically taken over movie theaters is a sign of the enduring passion audiences have for Elsa and Anna, the royal sisters at the center of the films. (It is also a sign of the increasing monopolization of theaters by franchise movies.) The sisters, voiced principally by Idina Menzel and Kristen Bell, were introduced to the world in this first entry in the animated series, which won two Oscars. "Allegorically, 'Frozen' lacks the purity and elemental power of a classic myth like 'Beauty and the Beast,"' Stephen Holden wrote in his review for The New York Times, "but at least its storytelling is fairly coherent, and its gleaming dream world of snow and ice is one of the most visually captivating environments to be found in a Disney animated film."
BRICK (2006) Stream on Netflix; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The filmmaker Rian Johnson just released an Agatha Christie-style murder mystery called "Knives Out," which hit theaters this week. He's no stranger to a murder tale: "Brick," Johnson's debut feature, also centers on a mysterious killing. The movie injects film noir into a 2000s Southern California setting, telling the story of a teenager (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who takes it upon himself to solve the murder of an ex-girlfriend (Emilie de Ravin).
What's on TV
THE GODFATHER PART II (1974) 9:30 p.m. on IFC. There are two big reasons Francis Ford Coppola's revered mob sequel is worth revisiting this month: Roger J. Stone Jr. and Martin Scorsese. Scorsese's new mob movie, "The Irishman," pairs Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, who each had one of the biggest roles of their career in "The Godfather Part II." The films would make a natural (if very long and gruesome) pairing. The second "Godfather" movie also came up this month in the trial of Stone, where a text message Stone once sent asking an associate to "do a Frank Pentangeli" came into play. The message was a reference to a character who gives obtuse answers during a Senate hearing in "The Godfather Part II" -- and is a good example of the deep cultural impact that the series has had. For memorable lines about "an offer he can't refuse" and a muscleman sleeping with the fishes, see the original movie, THE GODFATHER, which will air at 5:30 p.m. on IFC.

Texto completo: Readers, moved by their plight, ask what they can do and urge action to increase affordable housing.
To the Editor:
Re "114,000 Students in New York City Are Homeless. These Two Let Us Into Their Lives," by Eliza Shapiro, with photographs by Brittainy Newman (news article, Nov. 20):
First I have to say bravo! This was an incredibly well-written article that had the intended impact.
It was so poignant to consider that these were just two of the 114,000 stories, and the others are untold. It was crushing to hear about the lengths that these kids go to in order to overcome the obstacles to an education they face. And an education is what will lift these kids out of homelessness and poverty and offer a chance for a better life for them and their future children.
What can I as a New York City resident do to help, both big picture (what laws to vote for) and on a small scale (can we donate to these children, tutor them, offer our support)? I urge The Times to outline ways that we can help homeless children in need.
Hannah Ritchey
New York
Editors' Note: The author of the article offers some suggestions about how to help.
To the Editor:
The addition of more Education Department social workers is an important step in the right direction, but urgent attention must be paid to the conditions that continue to produce family homelessness and housing instability.
More and more children are bearing the enormous burden of our affordable housing crisis. This crisis is neither natural nor inevitable. Over the past 15 years, New York City's affordable housing market has been destabilized by predatory private equity companies and by landlords who illegally harass and intimidate low-income and rent-stabilized tenants to drive them out in favor of higher-paying tenants.
City and state leaders must listen to the voices of youth and parents demanding stable and good-quality affordable housing.
Elizabeth Clay Roy
New York
The writer is executive director of TakeRoot Justice.
To the Editor:
It is heartbreaking to read about homeless children like Sandy and Darnell. Both are being raised by poor, single mothers who have multiple children.
For 10 years, I mentored an extremely bright girl living in the poorest neighborhood in Bridgeport, Conn. Raised by an emotionally and physically abusive single mother, she graduated from one of Connecticut's worst-performing high schools, with a degree but not an education, with no path to supporting herself financially and no hope.
She had her I.U.D. removed and intentionally got pregnant. For her, a baby held the promise of love, companionship and a purpose in life, but her child is virtually guaranteed to grow up poor.
While access to effective birth control is critical, unless we address the emotional factors that drive women living in poverty to have children they cannot afford to raise, there will be too many stories like Sandy's and Darnell's.
Carolyn Field
Wilton, Conn.
To the Editor:
It is unconscionable in the richest country in the world that there are millions of homeless people, including more than 114,000 homeless school-age children in New York City alone. Perhaps those living in mansions could be persuaded to set an example and spend some of their billions to build housing for the homeless. What a heartwarming story that would be.

‘The Daily Show’ host Trevor Noah will bring his Loud &amp; Clear Tour to Staples Center

Texto completo: Southern California has always had a special place in the heart of Trevor Noah. The 35-year-old South African writer, producer, comedian, political commentator, actor and current host of Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show,” first cut his teeth in some of the area’s smaller comedy clubs and theaters.
After starting out in 100 to 300-capacity rooms, Noah graduated to 1,000 to 3,000-capacity theaters and eventually worked his way up to selling out the 8,000-capacity Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa in 2018. His latest stand-up outing, dubbed The Loud & Clear Tour, is now playing out in arenas across the country and Noah will return to Southern California to headline Staples Center in Downtown Los Angeles Friday, Dec. 6.
“I’ve been lucky that California has been one of the places where I’ve had a lot of support from the days of having like a really tiny following,” Noah said during a recent interview as he was also in the midst of taping “The Daily Show” back in New York. “It has been a really wonderful, sort of gradual celebration that just keeps growing. That’s the only way I can look at this show (at Staples Center) because otherwise it becomes overwhelming and you start worrying too much about the size of the show as opposed to the quality of the show.”
Despite hosting a television show where the primary topic is to analyze and report on politics, Noah said that’s not what his comedy show is. He’s said in previous interviews that he doesn’t talk about those things, including the President of the United States, so specifically but speaks rather generally when it comes to getting political.
“The live comedy audience has always been more diverse and also more broad in their taste,” he said. “‘The Daily Show’ is obviously a show based around politics and news and not everybody wants to live in that world, which I completely understand. But when it comes to stand-up, I’ve been really lucky. I have Republicans come to my shows and they’ll say ‘Hey, I love your stand-up … I don’t like your political views, but I love coming to your stand-up shows.’ That’s fine with me. I don’t think we have to agree with each other on everything, but I like that we can still all laugh together as people. I’ve always enjoyed that people of all ages, all religions, ethnicities and politics affiliations come to the shows. I want you to have fun whether you come with your mom and dad, boyfriend or girlfriend, your siblings, your friends … I just want you to have a good time. It’s not a show designed for one specific person, it’s designed for everybody.”
Doing the stand-up tour gives Noah a break from the 24/7 news cycle and all the commotion and breaking news that comes with ongoing impeachment hearings and the ramping up of yet another election year.
“It is a nice break and I think people should take that break in life, too,” he said. “People always ask me, ‘How do you cope with Trump all the time?’ It’s not healthy and I only deal with it during the day while making a show that’s 30 minutes long. If you engage in politics for 30 minutes a day, that’s more than enough to get all of the information you need since most of it is repetitive anyway. You don’t have to live in it and I try not to. I understand how important it is to our world and I give it the attention it deserves, but I also make sure to go live my life as a human being, too.”
On top of working on his stand-up material, Noah said he also listens to a lot of music. Nothing specific at the moment, but he said he’s a sucker for a good playlist on Spotify or Tidal. He picked up and is currently reading the new Prince biography, “The Beautiful Ones,” which was released in late October. He also said that if he had to choose between either being on “The Masked Singer” or “Dancing With the Stars,” he’d pick “The Masked Singer.”
“Because I’d be covered the entire time and my embarrassment is limited to when I have to take my mask off,” he said with a laugh. “I don’t think people would know it was me based on how badly or how well I could sing, which is nice.”
Noah has already accomplished a lot in his lifetime. He’s obviously got a successful stand-up career and daily TV show, but his book “Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood,” became a New York Times Bestseller and his “Son of Patricia” special and album is nominated in the best comedy category at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards, which will be held Jan. 26 at Staples Center.
“I live a very strange life in that I’ve never been too worried about the distant future,” Noah said. “I just try to focus on what I’m doing now and try to do it to the best of my ability and I found that serves me well. Right now, all I’m focused on is the Loud & Clear Tour and ‘The Daily Show,’ just making sure I put together a great show on TV every night and making sure that the stand-up is a world-class comedy experience. Once that’s all done, I’ll focus on the next thing. The last thing I want to do is start focusing too far into the future and tripping on the thing that’s right in front of me.”

White House budget officials resigned amid concerns about frozen Ukraine aid

Texto completo: Two White House budget officials resigned in the wake of President Trump’s decision to freeze U.S. military assistance to Ukraine, a top budget official testified.
Mark Sandy said in a closed-door deposition to House impeachment investigators that at least two Office of Management and Budget officials resigned in part over their concerns about the halt in aid. Sandy said one of the officials resigned in September after voicing concerns about the holdup.
“As I recall, he expressed some frustrations about not understanding the reason for the hold,” Sandy said, according to a transcript of his testimony, which was released on Tuesday.
He said the other official, a lawyer, stepped down over concerns that the halt was violating the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which puts limits on the executive branch’s authority to impound congressionally appropriated funds.
Sandy did not name either of the officials who resigned and noted that he did not know whether other factors played into their decisions to resign.
House Democrats have sought to determine whether Trump conditioned nearly $400 million in U.S. military aid to Ukraine on the country launching an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. Biden, who is running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, could face Trump in the general election.
The hold was released in September after a whistleblower filed a complaint about Trump’s conduct toward Ukraine. Trump had been briefed on the complaint when he unfroze the aid, according to the New York Times.

Giuliani Weighed Doing Business With Ukrainian Government; Trump's lawyer drew up retainer agreements with Yuriy Lutsenko and the Ukraine Justice Ministry worth $500,000 before deciding against the arrangement

Texto completo: Rudy Giuliani said Wednesday he was in talks earlier this year to earn hundreds of thousands of dollars from Ukrainian government officials but decided against it as he pushed the country to pursue investigations sought by his client, President Trump.
In January, Yuriy Lutsenko, then Ukraine's prosecutor general, asked Mr. Giuliani to represent the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice and him personally on two matters, Mr. Giuliani said in an interview. Mr. Giuliani said he subsequently drew up two retainer agreements, for a total of about $500,000, and gave them to Mr. Lutsenko.
The next day, Mr. Giuliani decided he couldn't represent Mr. Lutsenko personally because he believed doing so would pose a conflict with his representation of the president, he said, but continued to consider the Ministry of Justice contract. He said he ultimately declined that one, too, and was never "paid a penny" in connection with the proposed arrangements.
Mr. Lutsenko, who was removed from his post in August, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Giuliani's discussions about representing Mr. Lutsenko and the Ukrainian ministry came, he said, as he was meeting the Ukrainian prosecutor in New York to discuss an entirely different matter: investigations the president was seeking into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, as well as into alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.
Mr. Biden's son sat on the board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma Group while his father was overseeing U.S. policy toward Ukraine. The Bidens deny any wrongdoing.
U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded it was Russia, not Ukraine, that interfered in the 2016 election.
The talks between Mr. Giuliani and the Ukrainian officials were reported earlier by the New York Times and the Washington Post.
The push for those investigations by Mr. Giuliani and the president ultimately led to a phone call between Mr. Trump and the new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which set off the impeachment inquiry this fall. The overlap between Mr. Giuliani's business interests in Ukraine and his campaign on behalf of Mr. Trump is also at the center of a growing investigation by Manhattan federal prosecutors, which among other matters is examining whether the president's personal attorney might have violated rules on domestic and foreign lobbying.
A recent broad subpoena issued by the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office sought records of any payments to Mr. Giuliani and records related to his consulting firm, Giuliani Partners, The Wall Street Journal has reported .
Mr. Trump has called the impeachment inquiry a hoax that should end. Mr. Giuliani has denied wrongdoing.
More recently, Mr. Giuliani said, he was in talks to help represent Privat Bank, Ukraine's largest lender, in a lawsuit against the former co-owners of the bank, Igor Kolomoisky and Gennadiy Bogolyubov. Mr. Giuliani said he met with lawyers at the law firm Quinn Emanuel about the case, but ultimately decided against it.
Lawyers for Quinn Emanuel in Europe saw Mr. Giuliani's public mentions about Mr. Kolomoisky and believed he might have information that would be helpful to their case, according to a person familiar with the talks. After two meetings with Mr. Giuliani, the person said, it became clear that he didn't have any independent information about Mr. Kolomoisky and the law firm determined "there was no role for him."
Founded in 1992 in Ukraine's industrial east, PrivatBank grew into the country's biggest privately owned lender. After the 2014 revolution, the central bank set about cleaning up a banking sector beset by bad loans and inadequate capital. Backed by the International Monetary Fund, which has lent billions to Ukraine, regulators closed nearly 80 lenders. As its rivals shut down, PrivatBank increased its share of the country's deposits to around one-third by the time it was nationalized in 2016.
When Mr. Lutsenko asked Mr. Giuliani about representing him in January, he said he wanted Mr. Giuliani's help to arrange a meeting with the Justice Department, Mr. Giuliani said. "He wanted me to walk him into the Justice Department," Mr. Giuliani said.
He said he referred Mr. Lutsenko to Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova, a wife-and-husband legal team close to Mr. Giuliani. At one point, Mr. Giuliani said, Mr. Lutsenko tried to arrange for Mr. Giuliani to work for Ms. Toensing and Mr. diGenova as an investigator, an arrangement Mr. Giuliani declined.
Mr. Giuliani spent more time considering working for the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice, which he believed could help him get more information about money laundering, he said. He said he was only considering working on a portion of the ministry's case, which involved helping recover certain funds.
"I wasn't considering taking on the whole case, otherwise I would have charged $1 million," he said.
He ultimately referred that case to Ms. Toensing and Mr. diGenova, too, he said, adding that some of the retainers also named them.
Mark Corallo, a spokesman for the two lawyers, said in a statement: "We have always stated that we agreed to represent Ukrainian whistleblowers. Only because it was already public did we state that Yuriy Lutsenko was one of them. All the other names are attorney-client privileged, and it is unfortunate that some unethical person chose to violate that privilege."
Mr. Corallo said the retainer agreements involving Mr. Giuliani, his associates and Ukrainian officials, which were never signed, "contain the necessary notice of [Foreign Agents Registration Act] registration." Individuals are required to register with the Justice Department if they lobby in the U.S. on behalf of a foreign entity.
While Mr. Giuliani ultimately didn't represent either Mr. Lutsenko or the Ministry of Justice, he continued to be in close contact with the Ukrainian prosecutor. In their January meeting, Mr. Lutsenko told Mr. Giuliani he thought there were unanswered questions about the Bidens' role in Ukraine.
Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Lutsenko met again in Warsaw in February and continued to be in touch over the following months. In May, Mr. Giuliani planned a trip to Kyiv where he was planning to press the incoming president, Mr. Zelensky, to pursue investigations into the Bidens and alleged election interference. Ms. Toensing was planning to travel there with him, but Mr. Giuliani ultimately canceled the trip after news of it was reported.
Mr. Lutsenko served as prosecutor general of Ukraine from May 2016 through August 2019. In addition to discussing investigations into the Bidens and election interference with Mr. Giuliani, he worked alongside the president's lawyer to push for the removal of Marie Yovanovitch from her post as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. In March, Mr. Lutsenko told the news outlet the Hill that Ms. Yovanovitch had given him a list of people not to prosecute, an allegation that the State Department dubbed an "outright fabrication" and that Mr. Lutsenko later recanted.
Mr. Trump ultimately ordered Ms. Yovanovitch removed from her post in the spring, after hearing concerns from Mr. Giuliani and others. Mr. Lutsenko was dismissed from his post as prosecutor general in August.

Texto completo: Former presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke said that racism in America is "foundational" and that people of color were under "mortal threat" from the "white supremacist in the White House." Pete Buttigieg chimed in to explain that "systemic racism" will "be with us" no matter who is in the White House. Sen. Cory Booker called for "attacking systemic racism" in the "racially biased" criminal justice system.
Let’s follow up by examining Booker’s concern about a "racially biased" criminal justice system. To do that, we can turn to a recent article by Heather Mac Donald, who is a senior fellow at the New York-based Manhattan Institute. She is a contributing editor of City Journal, and a New York Times bestselling author. Her most recent article, "A Platform of Urban Decline," which appeared in Manhattan Institute’s publication Eye On The News, addresses race and crime. She reveals government statistics you’ve never read before.
According to leftist rhetoric, whites pose a severe, if not mortal, threat to blacks. Mac Donald says that may have once been true, but it is no longer so today. To make her case, she uses the latest Bureau of Justice Statistics 2018 survey of criminal victimization. Mac Donald writes: "According to the study, there were 593,598 interracial violent victimizations (excluding homicide) between blacks and whites last year, including white-on-black and black-on-white attacks. Blacks committed 537,204 of those interracial felonies, or 90 percent, and whites committed 56,394 of them, or less than 10 percent. That ratio is becoming more skewed, despite the Democratic claim of Trump-inspired white violence. In 2012-13, blacks committed 85 percent of all interracial victimizations between blacks and whites; whites committed 15 percent. From 2015 to 2018, the total number of white victims and the incidence of white victimization have grown as well."
There are other stark figures not talked about often. According to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting for 2018, of the homicide victims for whom race was known, 53.3% were black, 43.8% were white and 2.8% were of other races. In cases where the race of the offender was known, 54.9% were black, 42.4% were white, and 2.7% were of other races.
White and black liberals, who claim that blacks face a "mortal threat" from the "white supremacist in the White House" are perpetuating a cruel hoax. The primary victims of that hoax are black people. We face the difficult, and sometimes embarrassing, task of confronting reality.
Mac Donald says that Barack Obama’s 2008 Father’s Day speech in Chicago would be seen today as an "unforgivable outburst of white supremacy." Here’s what Obama told his predominantly black audience in a South Side church: "If we are honest with ourselves," too many fathers are "missing — missing from too many lives and too many homes. They have abandoned their responsibilities, acting like boys instead of men." Then-Sen. Obama went on to say, "Children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime; nine times more likely to drop out of schools and 20 times more likely to end up in prison."
White liberals deem that any speaker’s references to personal responsibility brands the speaker as bigoted. Black people cannot afford to buy into the white liberal agenda. White liberals don’t pay the same price. They don’t live in neighborhoods where their children can get shot simply sitting on their porches. White liberals don’t go to bed with the sounds of gunshots. White liberals don’t live in neighborhoods that have become economic wastelands. Their children don’t attend violent schools where they have to enter through metal detectors. White liberals help the Democratic Party maintain political control over cities, where many black residents live in despair, such as Baltimore, St. Louis, Detroit, Chicago.
Black people cannot afford to remain fodder for the liberal agenda. With that in mind, we should not be a one-party people in a two-party system.

Recalling the Troubles and a troubled father-son relationship in 'The Image You Missed'

Texto completo: Arthur MacCaig, the subject of his estranged son Dónal Foreman's evocative documentary “ The Image You Missed ," knew little about the Troubles in Northern Ireland before spending a summer there in the 1970s. After that the conflict became his life's obsession. He went to film school in Paris so he could become a documentarian and record what he observed and reveal what he believed to be the real story about the ongoing struggle, truths that had been ignored or denied by other media.
His debut feature “The Patriot Game" (1979) got a rave review from Janet Maslin in The New York Times and was condemned by the United Kingdom Foreign Office as “damaging and highly critical of Her Majesty's Government." MacCaig, who died in 2008, at 60, would make seven more films on the subject over the next three decades, documenting the evolving strategy and tactics of the Irish Republican Army, which permitted him extraordinary access to its activities.
Foreman was born in 1985. MacCaig, based in Paris, didn't have much time to spare from his filmmaking for him or his mother, who raised Foreman by herself, in Dublin. That neglect might be the missed image mentioned in the documentary's title. In the film, Foreman tries to restore it with impressionistic montages that reflect the vagaries of memory, the verities of history, and the need to reconcile the potential of the past with the realities of the present. He deftly and dreamily cuts from MacCaig's footage to his own images and counterpoints his father's comments in interviews or letters with his own sometimes-plaintive, never-to-be-answered questions about why his father abandoned him and what his life might have been like had he not.
“In 1997 I was making my first film as you were making your last," Foreman says, introducing a striking sequence. Foreman, then 11, is seen shooting an amateur movie with his friends in his kitchen about terrorists. In one scene a kid stumbles through a door with his shirt covered in fake blood. A match cut is made to a shot of a man also stumbling through a door covered in real blood. It's from the work-in-progress that MacCaig is seen in the process of editing, later to be released as “War and Peace and Ireland" (1998).
“Today I'm making a film about the end of the conflict," MacCaig says. “I hope." He is referring to the then-ongoing negotiations that resulted in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which brought a fragile but still-lasting peace to the island. However, as Foreman has pointed out, it would also be his father's last feature because, as MacCaig laments, “nobody wanted to fund the film about peace in Northern Ireland."
Foreman also poses a dialectic between the father's and son's disparate concepts about cinema. “Filmmaking is nothing more than people who find themselves in front of a camera confronted by a filmmaker and their own experiences," MacCaig states. “In effect they must have the courage to account for their lives." Foreman's approach is less dogmatic and more searching. He envies his father's certitude but questions its validity. “Your camera always looked out into other people's worlds," he says. “Never your own."
“The Image You Missed" screens at the Brattle Theatre as part of the DocYard series on Dec. 2 at 7 p.m. A question-and-answer session with the director will follow.

Low taxes fuel state's economic success. Let's keep it that way. Another viewpoint

Texto completo: Florida is fortunate to be home to 19 Fortune 500 companies - employers that are directly producing thousands of private-sector jobs, playing a strong role in Florida's vibrant economy, paying and collecting billions in taxes and contributing their time, talents and resources to many of Florida's philanthropic organizations who then put hundreds of millions of dollars to help those who can't help themselves.
Yet once again, these job creators are under attack. They are the "boogie man" for activist journalism which, far too often, seeks to advance socialism over free enterprise - apparently for more clicks, likes and retweets.
Only in America could the distorted tax policy theory of some become an Orlando Sentinel headline or fodder for a Sun Sentinel columnist. And situations like these are forcing job creators to become creative in their responses, just like FedEx Chairman and CEO Frederick W. Smith did recently when he tweeted his response to a New York Times front-page article on taxes.
As the late great Paul Harvey would say, "Now here's the rest of the story."
In uniting the business community for good, the Florida Chamber is shining a light on bogus, socialist-style reports that use half-truths and innuendoes in an attempt to somehow tarnish leading job creators (a system that has Florida creating one out of 13 new U.S. jobs).
Thanks to Florida job creators, Florida's unemployment level is lower than the national average. And families and businesses in high tax states like New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Illinois and California are fleeing their states for lower tax climates that allow families to save for a rainy day, businesses to hire more employees or reinvest in their facilities, and to create an overall better quality of life. These high-tax states apparently believe government creates jobs, when we all know that private sector employees create the jobs and the paychecks that are used to buy things that, in turn, create taxes that fund our government.
It's true that Florida has the fourth best tax climate in the country. That's because, unlike in high-tax states, Florida's corporate income tax reporting doesn't mandate "combined reporting." While that reporting style is favored by those who want to see Florida fail, it has not been roundly supported by economists. In fact, Florida's own economic forecasters have said combined reporting could decrease tax revenue, something Florida's education system, environment and transportation system can't afford.
That's not an economic forecast we're willing to stake Florida's future on.
Growing Florida's economy from 17th in the world to the 10th largest on the planet means ensuring global competitiveness, prosperity and high paying jobs, and vibrant and resilient communities. A competitive and equitable tax system that encourages job growth and strengthens our economy will be essential in achieving this goal.
That means the Florida Chamber will once again unite businesses in Florida's Capitol and fight for further reducing the corporate income tax, phasing out the business rent tax, leveling the online sales tax playing field, increasing the R&D tax credit to spur innovation, reducing the communications services tax and fixing Florida's lawsuit abuse tax.
With 4.5 million more people expected to call Florida home by 2030, we will continue to ensure Florida is a state where jobs provide Floridians an opportunity to prosper. And we will fight for free enterprise to lead the way.
For the last decade, lawmakers have been returning hard-earned tax dollars back to Floridians - through targeted tax savings like to back-to-school sales tax holidays and reductions in the corporate income tax. Yet, Florida's tax receipts continue to grow.
As Ronald Reagan used to say, if you want less of something, tax it. With all due respect to the Orlando Sentinel and South Florida Sun Sentinel, we're not willing to tax Florida's future away.
Mark Wilson is the President and CEO of the Florida Chamber of Commerce and can be reached at mwilson@flchamber.com.

Americans love conspiracy and Fox news delivers

Texto completo: You gotta love the art of sliming.
We Americans are good at it, thanks in no small part to a political climate in which disinformation serves as a devious means to an end — the end being what, exactly? More power, more money, more blind tribal affiliation, more of everything including a confused electorate?
Arguably the most successful practitioners of this art are the always entertaining talking heads at Fox News. Addictive stuff they're feeding us.
Now, thanks to former Fox talk show guest host Tobin Smith, we know how they do it. In a column published by the New York Times, Smith reveals how and why, by way of example, popular Fox host Laura Ingraham and guest John Yoo can concoct a fantasy about Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman. Vindman, the guy who testified in the House impeachment proceedings, might be a Ukrainian spy. Whoa Nelly, who knew?!
Yes, Vindman is a Purple Heart recipient who serves as the Director of European Affairs for the National Security Council. So what? Vindman is an immigrant and possibly a spy to boot. This means he cannot be trusted to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth — especially when it comes to President You Know Who.
Bizarrely, probably after being water boarded by fake news reporters from the Times, Yoo later claimed he was really thinking about Ukrainians, not Vindman, when he made that accusation. "I really regret the choice of words," he said on CNN.
Well, call me unpersuaded. Yoo's original accusation remains firmly entrenched in my TV viewing head. Vindman is a disloyal spy who hates President You Know Who.
Speaking of disloyal traitors, Smith's insights into Fox News tell us something about right-wing TV's methods and motivations. He describes how the network's hosts routinely use narrative story lines — "Vindman might be a Ukrainian spy" — as weapons of mass emotional manipulation. These story lines give viewers simple explanations of events that they can use to personal advantage when talking with like-minded friends and uninformed political enemies.
Smith describes the Fox News counter narrative model as "simple and cunning". Two questions get asked every day. What is today's most emotionally engaging story? How can a believable Fox counter narrative story be constructed around it?
The hunt for what Smith calls the "killer narrative" starts with a high level memo that identifies the highest-trending articles on Foxnews.com and Drudge. Next, Fox News contributors are primed to deliver the new counter narrative wrapped inside an existing or new narrative. Ratings confirm that the most engaging narratives are built around something we all really love: Good old fashioned conspiracy theories.
You can't give me enough titillating conspiracy theories. Love 'em all. They make me feel really good about myself and help me be smarter than my political enemies. I'm grateful that all my tribal friends — loyal elected officials being prime among them — can amplify and tweet conspiracy narratives to their (and my) heart's content.
We all end up knowing the real truth: Deep state operatives are out to get President You Know Who for no good reason. Hillary Clinton was never properly investigated for her scandalous emails. Attorney General Bill Barr didn't misrepresent the worst findings of the Mueller report. The indignation juices really get flowing when it feels like they're attacking me, too! I am victimized twice over, yet again!
Funny how I'm left craving more while Fox goes cha-ching. Fortunately, I feel more in control, better armed with special knowledge. If Fox talking heads suggest Vindman might be a Ukrainian spy, that's good enough for me. How about you?

Texto completo: The NYT Cooking video team spent two days capturing the feast preparations in Ms. Roman's small Brooklyn apartment -- jokes, hot takes and all.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
It was a cool afternoon in early September, and Thanksgiving was in the air in Alison Roman's Brooklyn apartment.
There were bowls full of shallots, onions and garlic on her kitchen table. Squashes lined her countertops. (No sweet potatoes, though; Ms. Roman isn't a fan.) Forty-two pints' worth of turkey stock sat in her fridge. Even her bathtub had been turned into a makeshift cooler for the turkey.
Among the bounty, the production team behind the NYT Cooking YouTube channel traversed the small apartment in their socks (it's a no-shoe household), checking sound and lighting and making other preparations to begin filming.
That week, Ms. Roman, a columnist for The New York Times's Food section, made not one but two complete Thanksgiving meals in her one-bedroom apartment. The first meal was prepared for a photo shoot for a guide to the day, complete with recipes, and print spread that will appear in Wednesday's paper. And the second was prepared as a demonstration for the NYT Cooking video, "Small Kitchen, Big Thanksgiving with Alison Roman."
When I arrived on set during the first day of filming, the small crew was just breaking for lunch. They seemed more like family than co-workers as they passed dishes down the table, splitting and sharing falafel plates, hummus and salads.
"We all know that we're a small team and we have a big job ahead of us," Scott Loitsch, the executive video producer, said. "We're all in on that and supporting each other."
The three-person NYT Cooking team may be small, but it is mighty. They work separately from other video staff at The Times and produce one video a week. Most videos are between eight and 15 minutes and focus on specific recipes by a variety of Times columnists and contributors. Ms. Roman is featured regularly on the channel. And the Thanksgiving video special, which by the end had produced more than 16 hours of footage, was the first longform video that presented an entire menu.

Mr. Loitsch, from upstate New York, leads the trio and works one camera. Vaughn Vreeland, a senior video journalist from North Carolina, commands a second camera, while Gina Fernandez, a production assistant and Bronx native, coordinates production and monitors sound, sometimes bringing filming to a halt to wait for planes or loud traffic to pass.
Over the past few months of working together, they have gotten to know each other and Alison exceptionally well. While filming the Thanksgiving video, they listed her "hot takes" -- controversial opinions -- without taking a breath.
"She doesn't like sandwiches," Ms. Fernandez said. "Or burgers," Mr. Vreeland added, quickly after.
"Alison and I both agree that marshmallows don't deserve to be on food," Ms. Fernandez said.
In fact, Ms. Roman doesn't like "soft foods" in general, which meant that pumpkin pie was definitely not on her Thanksgiving menu.
"For me, it's more about taking the general Thanksgiving menu framework and making it work for the flavor profiles and ingredients you like to cook with anyway," she said. "So you have a turkey potato stuffing, a green bean, an orange vegetable, a gravy, a cranberry."
For Ms. Roman, and Mr. Vreeland, that cranberry is best jellied and canned.
"I grew up eating it, so I was very happy that somebody who's very out there in the culinary world also agrees with my trash tastes," he said.
Which gave the team one of their favorite moments while filming the Thanksgiving project with Ms. Roman.
"She had just gone on this long diatribe about how the best, most effective way to open a can of cranberries is upside down," Mr. Vreeland said.
So when the time came, she opened the can at the bottom, gripped it and shook it, but all that came out was a cartoonish "bwip."
"We were all just dying," Mr. Loitsch said. "The footage is almost unusable because it's so shaky cause we were laughing so much."
The goal of the NYT Cooking videos is not only to teach people how to prepare specific recipes, but to entertain, inspire and demystify cooking for the audience. Occasionally, viewers will even see the team behind the scenes in videos, which is no accident.
"We want them to look real, and we want it to be like you're in the kitchen with us as we're filming," Mr. Vreeland said.
After Ms. Roman and the team had been together for close to 48 hours, filming was done. Production wrapped in her kitchen with wine, mezcal shots and cheers.

Texto completo: There’s a local angle to everything, even the impeachment hearings. David Holmes, a U.S. Embassy diplomat in Ukraine who testified Nov. 21, went to college in the Inland Valley, as reader Ray Escoto alerted me.
“I’m a graduate of Pomona College in Claremont, California,” Holmes told the House Intelligence Committee in his opening statement. No one interrupted to ask why Pomona College isn’t in Pomona.
Holmes is the witness who said he was eating lunch at a restaurant in Ukraine with Gordon Sondland, the ambassador, when Sondland placed a call to President Donald Trump on an unsecured line. Trump spoke so loudly, Holmes said, that Sondland pulled the phone away from his ear and both sides of the conversation were audible.
(We’ve all taken calls like that. Perhaps I’ll get one after this item runs.)
According to Holmes, when Trump asked if the Ukrainian president was on board with investigating the Bidens, Sondland assured the president, “He loves your ass.”
“There’s just so much about the call that was so remarkable that I remember it vividly,” Holmes testified.
In response, Trump tweeted that his hearing is “great” and that he’s never been able to overhear the other side of a phone conversation, statements that may cancel each other out.
“Who is David Holmes?,” the New York Times asked in a headline the next day. Answering its own question, the paper said Holmes joined the State Department under President George W. Bush and has been stationed in Russia, Afghanistan and India.
He won a State Department award in 2014 for “constructive dissent” for expressing concerns about President Barack Obama’s policy toward Afghanistan. The Washington Post described him as “a rising star in the Foreign Service.”
Closer to home, the 1997 alumnus won Pomona College’s Inspirational Young Alumni Award in 2004. Still, be careful what you say around him. He must have good ears.
Grandfatherly advice
A newspaper colleague in Upland told me last week: “My grandson had to attend a council meeting for his government class so I suggested he go to Ontario, rather than Upland meetings which go on forever. Great idea — tonight’s Ontario meeting lasted 12 minutes.”
I’ve rarely seen any high school students at Ontario meetings, but they’re worth the drive if you want to spare yourself a late night. And also if your grade isn’t dependent on excitement.
Stone wall (cont’d)
Remember the topic of the stone wall on Claremont’s Foothill Boulevard, newly revealed after vegetation was removed? Its origins are somewhat mysterious, although it’s believed to date to the 1920s or ’30s, when the land behind it was first subdivided for housing.
But now we know who built it: Clarence Stover.
Paula Pitzer, into whose family Stover married, told me: “His idea was he would make a form and drop in cement, rebar and these rocks. After he got in enough layers, he would shake the form. The idea is the rocks would slide over the surfaces and it would make it a good look.”
Stover’s company built houses, college buildings and commercial buildings in the Village. Stover “contributed to the look of Claremont more than any other builder,” John Neiuber wrote in the Courier in 2018.
Stover graduated from Pomona College in 1921, later served as a trustee and has the campus’ Stover Memorial Walk near Bridges Auditorium named for him. He died in 1955.
“He never did another wall,” Pitzer said. Apparently building it was more labor-intensive than he’d expected. But the one wall he did certainly contributed to the look of Claremont.
Thanksgiving!
Thanksgiving almost couldn’t fall any later, but here it comes Nov. 28 — not even a month shy of Christmas.
Whenever the date lands, it’s an opportunity to reflect on what we’re thankful for. Reasons I’m thankful include a stimulating job in an ever-changing valley, one that generates a steady flow of column ideas. Another reason is you attentive readers, who let me know you’re reading, correct me when I flub something and give me the occasional knock to keep me honest.
Thanks for reading, enjoy your holiday and I’ll see you here Friday — with a column I’ll be cobbling together on Wednesday, pre-turkey.
Valley Vignette
The TGI Friday’s restaurant in Ontario at 3351 N. Centre Lake Drive is closing Dec. 8. Reader Jeff Butler told me he and his wife have been regulars for 15 years and got the bad news from the manager recently. “There are a lot of memories from that place, as we had many birthday dinners and dinners with good friends there,” Butler said. The restaurant is planning a “Go out with a bang” farewell party Dec. 5 from 6 to 10 p.m. for regulars. “So come early,” an announcement board in the restaurant urges, “and let’s talk about how we all made this place like home.”

'In my own name': Anonymous author pledges to confront Trump before 2020 election

Texto completo: The anonymous "resistance" op-ed author claims he or she will come forward to speak out against President Trump before the 2020 election.
"Trump will hear from me, in my own name, before the 2020 election," the unnamed author of the new tell-all book, A Warning, declared on Tuesday.
Ever since the New York Times published an anonymous opinion piece by a senior member of the Trump administration in September 2018, which spoke of an internal "resistance" group of officials working to stymie the president's worst inclinations, rampant speculation has swirled about the identity of the author.
"As far as anonymity is concerned, I will not keep my identity shrouded in secrecy forever. I am not afraid to use my own name to express concern about the current occupant of the Oval Office," the unnamed writer said while taking part in a Reddit "Ask Me Anything" forum.
"Donald Trump has not heard the last of me. There is more to come," the author continued. "Other people who are currently serving, and who have left, are also considering adding their voices before votes are cast in 2020. We talk about this with some regularity. In the meantime, Trump must answer to the American people for his own conduct instead of redirecting their attention."
One possible hint came when a Reddit user asked if the U.S. Naval Academy will win in the annual Army-Navy college football game. "Yes," the writer replied.
"A clue!" another Reddit user exclaimed.
The forum took place following the Nov. 19 release of A Warning, which sought to tell voters "the truth" before the 2020 election.
There were several explosive claims in the book that reflect poorly on Trump, including one that focuses on a group of high-level White House aides putting together tally of Cabinet members they believed would support the use of the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. Another section of the book talks about how a group of senior Trump administration officials considered a "midnight self-massacre" in which they would resign together to draw attention to Trump's behavior.
Despite the bombshell allegations, the White House shrugged off the publication of the book.
"Others can fret about ridiculous, cowardly accusations; President Trump remains focused on delivering results to the American people," White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said. Asked if the White House now had a clearer idea of the identity of the author, Grisham added, “Yes — a coward."
But a little more than a year ago, following the publication of the Times op-ed, a litany of Trump administration officials denied being the author amid frenetic speculation, including Vice President Mike Pence, former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Trump, who called the author "gutless" and question whether a "so-called 'Senior Administration Official'" really existed, even pushed then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions investigate the source of the opinion piece.
This week Guy Snodgrass, an ex-speechwriter for former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, raised suspicions when he tiptoed around rumors that he was the author of A Warning. But he later rejected the rumors, saying, “No, I’m not the writer."
In the "AMA" on Tuesday, billed by Sean Desmond, publisher of Twelve, as "the first opportunity for Anonymous to respond to questions," the anonymous author addressed a wide range of topics. The official raised concerns about Trump's mental stability and appeared to confirm still being employed by the Trump administration.
"You'd be surprised (or maybe not) how remarkably widespread the sentiments conveyed in A Warning are shared — almost hourly — among folks in all corners of the White House and the Administration. The President knows this and fears this, which is why he's ordered us to ignore this book," the person said.
Impeachment was also discussed during the "AMA." The anonymous author said there was no doubt that Trump "demanded a quid pro quo from Ukraine in order to disrupt the 2020 election," but cautioned against Congress removing Trump from office.
"The only credible way to stop Trump is at the ballot box--and by a convincing margin," the official said. "He has to be defeated badly enough that Republicans will recognize they cannot support Trump's claim of voter suppression, or tampering, or fraud. He will never willingly acknowledge defeat and will fuel conspiracy theories for years to come. That will be dangerous for the country, so we've got to deprive him of those arguments with decisive electoral action."
Anonymity was heralded as an effective weapon when criticizing Trump, exemplified in recent months when a CIA analyst, who has yet to be identified, filed the whistleblower complaint that spurred impeachment proceedings.
"Trump thrives on distractions, and anonymity is a way to deprive him of his favorite weapon of mass distraction--personal attacks--and force the discussion to center on the substance, his character," the author said. "We've seen this on full display in the past few weeks, as the President has mercilessly attacked honorable public servants, from an anonymous whistleblower to aides on his own National Security Council. He can't win on ideas, just on mud slinging and personal attacks. So he's trying to use the long arm of government to unmask and undermine his critics."

TRUMP HONORS MILITARY DOG INJURED IN AL-BAGHDADI RAID PRESIDENT LAUDS PUP AT ROSE GARDEN EVENT

Texto completo: President Donald Trump made a surprise appearance Monday with the dog he called the "world's most famous" - Conan, the Belgian Malinois injured in the raid that took down Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
"Conan is a tough cookie, and nobody's going to mess with Conan," the president told reporters gathered in the Rose Garden. He added, "Yet you see how beautiful and how calm he is during a situation like this. And you're very lucky, because he's not in a bad mood today."
Mr. Trump identified the dog as male during the news conference. But confusion over the dog's sex abounded after it concluded. A pool reporter, citing a White House official who spoke on background, said the dog was female. That claim was later contradicted by another official, who said Conan was male.
Intrigue has surrounded the heroic canine ever since Mr. Trump disclosed that "a beautiful dog, a talented dog" had chased al-Baghdadi into a dead-end tunnel during the Oct. 26 operation in northern Syria. The pup's identity was briefly considered classified, with U.S. officials concerned that publicizing it might also reveal the identity of the elite Army unit she served.
Yet Mr. Trump, who has complained about not receiving enough credit for the raid that killed the terrorist leader, fed into the frenzy over the dog he said had played a key role. He first tweeted out a photo of the "wonderful" animal on Oct. 28.
"We have declassified a picture of the wonderful dog (name not declassified) that did such a GREAT JOB in capturing and killing the Leader of [IS], Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi!" Mr. Trump wrote.
More tweets followed, with the president eventually revealing the dog's name. In one image he tweeted, a Medal of Honor recipient was replaced with a photograph of Conan - tongue lolling - receiving the honor. He promised to commend the dog in person.
On Monday, Mr. Trump told reporters he had presented Conan with a medal and a plaque for heroism. He said the dog had been "very badly hurt" during the raid that killed al-Baghdadi - exposed to electric wires while chasing the terrorist leader - leading some to fear Conan "might not be able to recover." Yet Conan has bounced back and is nowhere near retiring.
The Belgian Malinois breed, Mr. Trump said, is the "ultimate fighter, ultimate everything," and besides being able to take a person down can also sniff out drugs.
As Mr. Trump described Conan as "so brilliant" and "so smart," the subject of his praise, mouth agape, looked to Vice President Mike Pence for head scratches. Mr. Trump, the first American president in a century without a dog of his own, stood with his hands at his side, as did first lady Melania Trump.
It was "a real joy to help walk him here to the White House," Mr. Pence said.
On their way back into the White House, the first couple laughed when a reporter shouted out, "Melania, do you want to adopt the dog for Barron?" She appeared to decline.
Conan joins a long, scruffy line of war dogs that have served alongside U.S. troops for more than a century. And in each major campaign, dogs have become remarkably agile on battlefields as some of the most fearsome and effective weapons.
"They have to adapt the same way humans adapt," said Rebecca Frankel, author of "War Dogs: Tales of Canine History, Heroism and Love." As long as combatants plant their feet on soil, Ms. Frankel told The Washington Post, "dogs are the best nonhuman partners on the ground."
War dogs are now most prominent in Special Operations raids. In 2011, a dog named Cairo accompanied Navy SEALs on the raid to kill Osama bin Laden.
Troops on raids don't rely on dogs just to sniff out bombs. They also use the jarring, ferociously fast attack of dogs like Conan to terrify would-be threats. In the case of a handler and the dog, "the enemy now has two threats," Ms. Frankel said.

Texto completo: The federal investigation into two associates of Rudy Giuliani is exploring a wide range of potential crimes — including wire fraud and failure to register as a foreign agent — as prosecutors dig into the pair's interactions with the president's personal lawyer and the main pro-Trump super PAC, according to people familiar with the investigation.
Giuliani's dealings with the two men, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, are being investigated by federal prosecutors at the US attorney's office in Manhattan. That office has already filed campaign finance charges against Parnas and Fruman, accusing them of conspiracy and making false statements to the Federal Election Commission.
According to people familiar with the ongoing case, investigators are scrutinizing Giuliani's consulting business and eyeing donations made to America First Action, the main pro-Trump super PAC set up by his advisers and allies after his election, as well as its affiliated nonprofit group.
As part of the probe, federal prosecutors are examining a raft of other potential crimes, including destruction or alteration of documents, aiding and abetting federal crimes, and foreign nationals contributing to US candidates, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation.
The list of possible crimes under investigation does not mean those charges will be filed. They do, however, indicate that prosecutors are casting a wide net for potential wrongdoing as they examine the business and legal dealings of the president's personal lawyer, and two Soviet emigres business executives who have been assisting Giuliani in the efforts to dig up damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on the president's behalf.
Parnas and Fruman have pleaded not guilty. An attorney for Parnas declined to comment. An attorney for Fruman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Giuliani, who has not been accused of any crimes, has denied any wrongdoing. He did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
A spokeswoman for American First Action said the group reached out last month to federal prosecutors in New York, offering to cooperate voluntarily. She said the group has received no subpoenas and follows the law, declining to comment further.
A representative for the US attorney's office declined to comment.

Trump ordered review of US sanctions on Turkish bank
President Trump told the Treasury Department and Justice Department to look into the impact of US sanctions on a Turkish state-owned bank after being lobbied by Turkey's president, a Treasury official acknowledged in a letter last week to a top Democratic senator.
The letter, sent in response to queries by Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, outlined seven meetings Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had with senior Turkish officials from April 2017 through this month, but didn't detail what was discussed or answer other questions posed by Wyden, who is the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee.
Bloomberg News reported in October that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan made repeated entreaties to Trump to avoid charges against Halkbank, one of Turkey's largest lenders. Trump assigned Mnuchin and Attorney General William Barr to look into the issue after an April phone call with Erdogan.
Wyden in a statement said the Treasury's response was unsatisfactory and "raises more questions than it answers."

Rick Perry says Trump is God's 'chosen one'
Secretary of Energy Rick Perry believes that President Trump was chosen by God to lead the country — and he handed the president a one-page description of morally flawed biblical kings as inspiration, he said.
"God's used imperfect people all through history. King David wasn't perfect. Saul wasn't perfect. Solomon wasn't perfect," Perry said in an interview on Fox News.
Trump himself caused a stir in August when he described himself in seemingly messianic terms: In one day, he looked to the sky while calling himself "the chosen one" to handle trade policy, and quoted the words of a conspiracy-theorist radio host who likened Trump to "the King of Israel" and "the second coming of God."
Perry says he told the president that this posturing, which some critics took as egotistical or even blasphemous, was correct.
"'Mr. President . . . you said you were the chosen one,"' Perry recalled saying in the Oval Office. "I said, 'You were . . . You are here in this time because God ordained you."'
He noted that he believes Barack Obama was also ordained by God for the presidency.
It's a common view among some evangelical Christians. Some of Trump's loudest evangelical defenders, like Franklin Graham, often compare him to sinful but important biblical kings, especially King David — who wrote the beautiful Psalms and slayed Goliath, but also impregnated Bathsheba and then calculated to have her husband killed.
It's a less common theme among political figures, prior to Perry's comments on Fox News.
Perry, whose trip to Ukraine for the inauguration of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is under scrutiny as the House impeachment inquiry probes the Trump administration's dealings with Ukraine, went on to say that he believes Trump will not be removed from office.
Perry, a former Texas governor who ran against Trump in the 2016 Republican primary for president, has served as energy secretary since the beginning of the Trump administration.

Conan the dog gets hero's welcome at White House
A US military dog that played a starring role in the raid that killed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi seemed oblivious to the praise that President Trump heaped on it Monday at the White House.
Conan, a Belgian Malinois, seemed much more interested in the head scratches it was getting from Mike Pence, repeatedly looking up at the vice president in search of more attention.
Trump used a slew of adjectives to describe Conan, which was injured when it was exposed to electric wires in the late October raid while chasing al-Baghdadi at the terrorist's compound in northwest Syria. “Incredible." “Brilliant." “Smart." “Ultimate fighter." “Very special." “Tough cookie."
“So this is Conan," Trump said. “Right now, probably the world's most famous dog."
Trump said he bestowed a medal on Conan and presented the dog with a plaque. First lady Melania Trump stood a few feet away.

Texto completo: First son Barron Trump has his own Cabinet, of sorts.
A new insider book dished that the 13-year-old son of the president and first lady Melania Trump is the boss of the president’s 10 grandchildren.
Barron, according to Inside Trump’s White House, being released tomorrow, “rules the grandkids.”
Donald Trump, Arabella Kushner, Joseph Kushner, Barron Trump
The big reveal in historian Doug Wead’s book, provided to Secrets, comes from half brother Donald Trump Jr., who described the first few days of the Trump presidency and the family’s experience of their first two nights inside the White House in 2017.
On the second night, Jan. 21, after a day of celebration, the White House staff filled a State Dining Room table with burgers and chicken fingers, Trump recalled. The adults couldn’t resist and joined their children in a mini-feast.
Wead wrote, “The children didn’t stay in the dining room long. They were soon scattered throughout the State Floor in a rousing game of White House hide-and-go-seek with Uncle Barron as the supervisor. ‘The kids all love Barron,’ Don Jr. explains. ‘He rules the grandkids.’’
Donald Trump, Melania Trump, Barron Trump
That same night, as the adults dined, Eric and Lara Trump announced that they were having another child, Luke.
When the family applauded, Barron was drawn back to the State Dining Room to see what the commotion was about.
“What happened? What happened?” he asked. Told of the news about a 10th Trump grandchild on the way, he said, “OK,” as the other grandchildren called from the East Room where they were playing. “Uncle Barron was needed elsewhere,” wrote Wead.
The New York Times best-selling author, who is the official Trump biographer, also suggested that in a family of tall men and women, Barron is fast on his way to being the tallest.
Donald Trump, Barron Trump, Melania Trump
At 13, he already appears taller than his mom and dad, who stands six-foot, two inches, and getting close to his tallest brother, Eric, at six-foot, five inches.
“By the time I finish this book, Barron may stand taller than any of them,” wrote Wead.
Throughout the administration, the first family has been protective of Barron, following a pattern set by other White House parents with younger children.
Still, he has been assailed on the internet.
Wead told Secrets, "He's not in the book very often, but he's a star."
He added, "Imagine, he came in a 10-year-old boy, and he will leave as a man, perhaps taller than all of the brothers. Imagine such a physical transformation, which you can see? Every time you buy shoes, they are the wrong size. And then imagine the emotional and intellectual transformation that you cannot see. The attacks on his father and mother."
"No wonder Melania is protective."

Texto completo: The billionaire said he bought the symbolic domain name this month "to make sure someone didn't do something crazy with it."
Well, you had your chance.
After going up for auction last month, Democracy.com has officially been sold. Its new owner is Mark Cuban, the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks.
Mr. Cuban, who is also famous for his role on the reality television show "Shark Tank," confirmed the sale in an email exchange with The New York Times. He explained that he had no plans for the highly symbolic address and had purchased the domain to protect it from abuse -- or, in his words, "to make sure someone didn't do something crazy with it."
He offered limited additional information about the deal.
"Someone sent me a cold email," he explained. "I gave them a price I would be willing to pay. They said yes." He declined to say how much he had paid.
The minimum bid had been set at $ 300,000, but the auction was called off after Mr. Cuban made his offer.
The sale, through Heritage Auctions, had been orchestrated by Talmage Cooley, an entrepreneur who used the domain for years as the home to a start-up social platform where politicians and civic groups could connect with supporters. The enterprise ran out of money in February, prompting the decision to sell the domain, which was owned by one of Mr. Cooley's investors, whom he declined to identify.
Days before the auction was set to close, Mr. Cooley emailed Mr. Cuban to invite him to buy the domain.
"I just made it super succinct and talked about the importance of this name being used for good," Mr. Cooley said.
Mr. Cuban replied within minutes and the sale was completed within a few days, according to Mr. Cooley. (While he declined to share further details about the deal, citing a confidentiality agreement, Mr. Cooley said that Mr. Cuban's offer exceeded the auction's minimum bid.)
Mr. Cuban has long been vocal about politics.
In 2016, he endorsed the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, and he has described himself as a social centrist and fiscal conservative. In September, he said that his family opposed the idea of his running for president in 2020, but that if he did, he would do so as an independent.
Despite its resonant and memorable name, Democracy.com has had a relatively unremarkable history. It was registered in the mid-1990s on behalf of the Democratic National Committee, which ultimately did nothing with it, according to a 1997 article in the magazine In These Times.
The domain was later sold to John Carrieri, an entrepreneur who told The Times last month that he had wanted to use it as the home to an educational website but sold it about a decade later after deciding that he couldn't garner the resources necessary to do it justice.
The domain was then listed in auctions hosted by a domain name reseller in 2010 and 2012, the year that Mr. Cooley said he began licensing the address.
While he is disappointed that the start-up didn't work out, Mr. Cooley said he was happy that the domain was in good hands.
"I'm glad that somebody in the U.S. bought it, as opposed to a Russian counter-democracy organization," he said.

Texto completo: My Mom died Tuesday. As much as I admire her 92 years of life, I remember as a kid thinking life had cheated her at times.
Lois Evaughn Schembs was born on a farm outside of Remington, Indiana, on Jan. 28, 1927, to farmer Jesse Schembs and his wife, Floretta Casey. Mom never said they were poor, but she did tell stories of running to the outhouse in the middle of winter nights and being happy to find a Sears catalog instead of just corn cobs. She’d heat an iron in the fire and use it to warm her bed sheets, but she’d still wake up some mornings to find the water frozen in her glass next to the bed.
She was so smart as a child, she skipped second grade. Then she got scarlet fever and missed so much school, she had to repeat third grade. Good in math and English, she was salutatorian of her Class of 1945 at Remington High School, where she also played the drums.
Of course, old classmates of hers just called her "the prettiest girl in school." They say she should have been queen of the Fountain Park Chautauqua in Remington, but the judges declared it a tie and Mom lost the coin flip.
Second in her class. Second to the queen. And second-class citizen when it came to education, I thought. College was never an option for her, so she took a job in bookkeeping with Sherman White and Co., a buyer of farm goods in Goodland. That’s where she met my dad, Willy Constable, on the day he came home from World War II and stopped by in uniform to see his sister, who introduced him to my mom. He was more than 10 years older, and Mom remembers being mortified when he wore his fedora on their first date to the movie theater, as if he were an old man.
Dad proposed on their third date. Three years later, Mom accepted. But first, she and her younger sister, Dorothy, crossed the Atlantic Ocean in the steerage compartment of a steamship for a grand adventure in Ireland. That took courage. Mom came home and married my dad on March 13, 1950, on what happened to be the first day in weeks that it was too wet for farmers to work. The last-second nuptials meant Willy’s father, Bert, skipped the wedding to attend his previously scheduled town board meeting. A rainy spring extended my parent’s honeymoon.
Mom gave birth to daughters Sally and Nancy, and then me and my brother, Bill. Mom insisted that all of us kids learn to play piano and sing alongside Dad and her in the choir at the Goodland Presbyterian Church. My sisters played organ and piano for church and countless weddings. My brother became a gifted musician and keyboard player who charmed crowds with his music. As the only person in my family who never got paid to perform music, I might be the only kid in history whose mother asked him to stop taking piano lessons. We both thought that was a good idea.
Mom and Dad were key members of the South Newton High School Production Company and got all of us kids interested in theater. They took us to Christmas concerts at Purdue University. They also had good seats for Boilermaker football games, where we’d wrap our feet in plastic bread wrappers to keep warm and Mom would open her stash of homemade chocolate-chip goodies only when our team needed her "third-down cookies." Her only attempt at athletics was standing on her head on her birthdays.
Mom quizzed us on current events and political news at supper and set up an Electoral College voting system for family decisions, with everybody getting votes depending on age. A parental bloc defeated any move by the minority children, but any split opened the door for new alliances. Mom filled our home with books, music, humor and love.
An avid reader, political junkie and crossword wiz, she used to quote from New York Times stories and talk about writing her own book. "I’d call it ‘Hamburger and Sex,’" she said. "Because I know hamburger, and I need sex to make it sell."
In addition to cooking our meals and running the household, Mom was the driving force in getting all four kids to go to college. But she didn’t just inspire her own kids. She had an uncanny ability to draw people to her and consider her their second mom. People confided in her about sexual issues, drugs, abuse, alcoholism and dreams.
She lived on a farm in a conservative, heavily Republican, all-white community, but became a go-to person for anyone from outside those boundaries. She and Dad visited Jimmy Carter’s church in Plains, Georgia. Mom and her friend Ruthann were once in a photo on the front of The Indianapolis Star talking with Jesse Jackson after they made the trip to hear the civil rights leader speak. Mom donated to Barack Obama, slapped an Obama bumper sticker on her car in 2008, and probably deserves credit for making Indiana a blue state that year. No one so much as teased her.
Once we kids were out of her hair, she focused more on herself. She and her friends had frequent Lunch Bunch outings.
In her 70s, she took art classes and became an accomplished watercolor artist, winning a couple of ribbons and landing one piece in a juried art show.
She got back to her drums, too, playing snare drum in the Newton Jasper Community Band from her early 70s through her late 80s.
Lovely and elegant are words often used in descriptions of her. Always polite, Mom never swore or spoke badly about anyone. She never let us kids say the S-word, whether that meant "stupid" or "shut up."
She cared for the old ladies in the church. She cared for her parents. She cared for my dad before he died in 2003. She cared for my brother before he died in 2010. She cared for others her whole life. My thoughts about what she could have been if she had been given the chance vanished. Life didn’t cheat her of opportunities. It let her forge her own.
She had grace, smarts, love and a wonderful life. And we were lucky to be part of it.

Mark Ruffalo talks about new whistleblower film 'Dark Waters'

Texto completo: Mark Ruffalo was shocked.
You see, apart from being an Oscar-nominated actor best known for playing the Hulk in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Ruffalo is also an environmental activist; he co-founded Water Defense in 2011 to raise awareness about the impact energy extraction has on water and public health.
And "The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare" had hit him hard. Nathaniel Rich's 2016 piece for the New York Times Magazine chronicled attorney Rob Bilott's fight to expose impact of the DuPont chemical company's release of PFOA, or perfluorooctanoic acid, which it had pumped as powder into the Ohio River near a West Virginia facility for decades, according to Rich's reporting. PFOA is a compound used in the manufacture of Teflon.
"If you are a sentient being reading this article in 2016, you already have PFOA in your blood," Rich wrote. "It is in your parents' blood, your children's blood, your lover's blood. How did it get there? Through the air, through your diet, through your use of nonstick cookware, through your umbilical cord. Or you might have drunk tainted water."
Scientists, according to Rich's reporting, found a "probable link" between PFOA and ailments including kidney, testicular and thyroid cancers, as well as high cholesterol, pre-eclampsia and ulcerative colitis.
"I was just floored," said Ruffalo. "It's like the biggest corporate criminality, spanning 50 years, no accountability, and no one knew about it."
Ruffalo is working to change that with "Dark Waters." The film — opening in select cinemas Friday, Nov. 22 before expanding on Nov. 29 and playing nationwide on Dec. 6 — was produced by Ruffalo.
He also stars as Bilott, a environmental corporate defense attorney who spent years on the issue of PFOA as the work took its toll on his health and career.
The question of Bilott's motivation compelled Ruffalo, the actor said.
"Was there really a rebellious quality in him? Did he have a chip on his shoulder about something?" Ruffalo wondered. Instead, the actor kept coming back to a much more straightforward answer.
"He believed in people, and he saw the world as a jury of his peers," Ruffalo said of Bilott. "And (he believed that) once he laid out enough evidence and it was compelling enough, that they would decide to do the right thing. That's how he handled everything, and it's that kind of dispassionate, unemotional, empirical sort of one foot in front of the other until we get to where we need to be that was his ethos.
"As an actor, you want the big, dramatic moments. You want the juicy scenes. You want the moment where our hero gets to confront the bad guy and take him down, but that's just not the nature of Rob and that's not the nature of the story."
Oscar-winning actor and activist Tim Robbins co-stars in "Dark Waters" as Tom Terp, Bilott's supervising partner at the Cincinnati law firm of Taft Stettinius and Hollister LLP who provides Bilott with crucial support in contrast to the firm's history of representing chemical companies.
"That's what spoke to me, it was the unexpected nature of it," said Robbins, "the man whose law firm represents chemical companies, to take on a case that is holding a chemical company responsible for polluting the environment. This is not their wheelhouse, right? This is not something they normally do. I find characters like that really inspiring."
DuPont and Chemours, a former DuPont unit that spun off into its own company in 2015, arrived at a $670.7 million settlement to settle 3,550 lawsuits related to the release of PFOA in 2017.
Terp and Bilott could, Robbins said, serve as guides for how more changes could come in the future.
"It's not like they're your liberal reformers or anything, it's people who go outside their own corporate culture to pursue something based on morality, based on right and wrong and not on profit margin," said Robbins. "And quite frankly, it's going to be up to people like Tom Terp to realize that morality in themselves and take risks and perhaps compromise their position of power or their livelihood to do the right thing."
Directed by Oscar nominee Todd Haynes from a screenplay by Mario Correa and Matthew Michael Carnahan, "Dark Waters" is a Focus Features release presented by Participant.
Haynes' film is firmly in the whistleblower cinema tradition that includes "All The President's Men" (1976) and "The Post" (2017), specifically the environmental and legal sub-genre alongside Oscar-winner "Erin Brockovich" (2000) and Oscar nominee "A Civil Action" (1997).
But it also has plenty in common with Ruffalo and Participant's 2015 modern classic "Spotlight," which earned a Best Picture Oscar and a Best Supporting Actor nomination for Ruffalo. Both films are non-sensationalist, methodical examination of all of the work — legal in the case of "Dark Waters," journalistic in "Spotlight" — that goes into uncovering the truth.
"Dark Waters," with its exposure of DuPont practices, also serves as an inadvertent companion piece to "Foxcatcher." That 2014 starred an Oscar-nominated Ruffalo as Olympic wrestler Dave Schultz, who was murdered in 1996 by chemical empire heir John du Pont, played by Steve Carrell.
Taken together, "Dark Waters" and "Foxcatcher" chillingly speak to the free reign our society has afforded powerful corporations and families.
"It is a corporate elite in America that basically because of economic reasons are given free hand to pollute, to dominate, to run amok," Ruffalo said. "Whether it's John du Pont in 'Foxcatcher' and his delusions of grandeur that came from a lifetime of privilege and money or it's DuPont as a corporate entity who was a driving economic factor in American business.
"If all we value is the GDP of a country as a value of its health or well-being, then you're going to have a lot more stories like the PFOA story and a lot more companies like DuPont who knowingly and willingly poisoned the world for pure profit and the almighty dollar."
"Dark Waters," 126 minutes, rated PG-13, open in select cinemas before expanding on Friday and playing nationwide on Dec. 6. More info: www.focusfeatures.com/dark-waters.

Texto completo: Re: "Let there be peace," Nov. 18 letter to the editor
To the author:
Do you not understand that members of our Air Force must train somewhere so they are prepared and ready to protect us? My husband was in the Air Force during the Korean Conflict. We have a son who has just retired as a lieutenant colonel with the USAF after 32 years. Both sacrificed being away from family for holidays and special occasions.
While you sit down to a beautiful table filled with the aroma of turkey and stuffing and some pumpkin pie, I hope a jet flies over this area to remind you we have military eating K-rations in the sands of foreign deserts protecting you.
Let your Thanksgiving prayer include your thanks for the slight noise inconvenience you experience from time to time so that our airmen will be prepared to protect you should the time ever come.
Tom and Bonnie McNunn, Cathedral City
Easing the load One in five teens living in the United States suffers from a mental illness severe enough to impact their daily abilities. Two states have already passed laws that allow students to take time off for mental health issues.
I think it is important for more states to follow the example of those progressive states that are rising to the challenge of helping youth in crisis.
High school students have to deal with more than they should at their age, from depression and anxiety, to the fear of school shootings, family problems and trying to negotiate their academics and their futures. Teenagers have an overflowing plate of responsibilities. When you then consider the pressure of extracurricular sports, clubs and activities, it becomes easy to understand how a teenager's life is not as easy as it may appear.
My teacher at school said, "Don't bring me grievances, bring me solutions." So, my solution to ease the burden of both teachers and teenagers is to move to a four-day work week to ease the stress, while allowing time to maintain better mental and emotional health.
Stephanie Mejia, Indio
President Trump and vaping Now that the extent of the vaping health crisis is becoming more evident, and has hit us locally as evidenced by the front-page story of Nov. 18, I think attention should be called to the New York Times story of Nov. 17 stating that President Trump has retreated from his September proposal to ban flavored "vapes" because of "political fallout among voters."
As a former smoker and survivor of lung cancer, I know the misery that lung disease can incur, and if my grandchildren and great-grandchildren can be saved from that misery, I am for anything that will deter them from starting an unhealthy habit.
This is another example of the president caving to contributors and political advisers for his own benefit, ignoring the general welfare (and perhaps that of his youngest son).
Paul Dyke, Desert Hot Springs
Bury power lines for safety Based on the article entitled, "EMF Pollution from Living Near Power Lines," (https://www.safespaceprotection.com/) people exposed to high voltage power lines and other collateral power transmission devices and networks exponentially increase their risk of cancer and other related health problems.
The article specifically mentions that the closer you are in proximity to power lines, the more you are bombarded with dangerous EMFs. These power lines handle electric power transmission and distribution across large distances.
Overall, the United States should take control in burying power lines safely underground because they are dangerous, and because there is empirical evidence that the lines harm humans.
Julian Diaz, Indio
The situation in Syria If the military of one nation goes into a second nation, without its government's permission, that is an invasion.
Any military actions by the first nation are acts of war.
Any armed group that does acts of violence against the government of the second nation are rebels, who must be put down.
This is Syria, today.

O, Come, All Ye Playful Fun Games For Holiday Gatherings FAVES &amp; RAVES

Texto completo: Whether your holiday season involves gatherings with family and friends for whom fun comes easily - or more fraught festivities where social grooves need some greasing - a good game can come in handy. Perennial favorites like Yahtzee, backgammon, Life, Boggle and Risk are sure-fire, and a newer discovery like What Do You Meme (an adults-only card game in which you create memes using the photos on the cards you are dealt) could spice things up.
We turned to some Hartford-area folks for their favorites. Let the games begin!
Amanda Aronson, principal, Aronson Consulting:
"Rummikub is our family game, and I'm proud to say I am the reigning champ." This family-friendly game is a version of rummy, but played with tiles instead of cards. Its makers say it's one of the world's most-played games; they also tout that it promotes STEM skills. Don't tell the kids!
Deb Greeson Cohen, Realtor and The Front Door Project blogger:
"We love Farkle or, believe it or not, pickup sticks! Someone got those a couple years ago and we played all day on Christmas!" Farkle's a dice game; you earn points by rolling the right combinations - but you have to decide whether to stop or keep rolling and risk losing your points in a "Farkle." As the listing on Amazon says, "Even if you do Farkle, it's fun just saying Farkle, right?" As for pickup sticks, it's a good reminder how much simple fun it can be to try to lift a stick from a pile without moving any others.
Elysha Dicks,co-founder, producer and host of Speak Up Storytelling:
"Sorry! is a great game to play with little kids. It is great practice for being disappointed and for winning and losing gracefully. Plus counting practice for the extra littles." In Sorry! players move colorful pawns around a board - and get to bump each other out of the way. She adds that her husband and son love Exploding Kittens, a card-game version of Russian roulette, only with... kittens. Its maker claims that "It was the most-funded game in the history of Kickstarter and has paved the way for peace and tranquility in the modern world. It also features cards illustrated by The Oatmeal."
Gretchen Fountain,development director at RE-Center Race & Equity in Education:
"Catch Phrase!" In this oldie-but-goodie, players try to get their teammates to guess the word or phrase on a card they've drawn before the buzzer goes off, using gestures and other clues. I can vouch for this one; we played it a lot when my kids were young.
Jenni Darius French,director of communication and strategic engagement at the Watkinson School:
"My family does the Saran Wrap Ball game every year on Christmas Eve... it is hysterical! My family plays with an added wrinkle; the person unwrapping the ball must wear oven mitts!" Before the game, the organizer wraps gifts of varying sizes and value amid layers of plastic wrap, creating a big ball of gifts. Players sit on the floor in a circle; one unwraps the ball, holding it in his or her lap, while the player to the left rolls a pair of dice. When that player gets a double, the ball and dice pass to other players. Players keep whatever gifts they unwrap.
Jacques Lamarre, playwright and senior project manager at BuzzEngine:
"Bananagrams!" Bananagrams is kind of like Scrabble on speed - but without a board. Players race to create a crossword grid using the letter tiles they've drawn; the first one to use all of his or her tiles hollers "Peel!" and everyone has to draw more tiles. The first to finish yells "Bananas!" The other players check his grid for errors; if they find one, it's a "spotted banana," but if it's all good, the player is that round's "top banana." The game comes in a banana-shaped pouch that's easy to tote to a party. And the yelling is half the fun.
Betsy Bucher Maguire,playwright for historical societies, museums and nonprofit organizations:
"We like Decrypto, Dixit, Pick Your Poison, Your Worst Nightmare, Code Names, Monikers, Secret Hitler, Sheriff of Nottingham, Snake Oil, Zero, The Metagame, Rate It, and good old reliable Balderdash!" Betsy's daughter Kerrie Maguire, a game and narrative designer, also voted for Monikers! "The game is three rounds consisting of games most people already know how to play (Taboo, Password, charades). Super fun!"
In Balderdash, players write down definitions of a word or description on the card that's been drawn, then read their definitions aloud. Fellow players have to judge whether the definition is real or the player reading it is bluffing. Unlike many card-based games, it's also a board game in which players move pieces as they score points by fooling the others or calling someone's bluff. Some of the content is for mature audiences, many Amazon reviewers note.
Monikers has players divide into teams and choose cards bearing famous (and some not-so-famous) names; in each of three rounds, players have to offer clues to get their teammates to guess the name. Anything goes in the first round; you can give any kind of clue you want, so long as you don't actually say the name. In the second round, though, you're only allowed to make a single sound or say a single word. The third round is charades. In its 2018 Holiday Gift Guide, The New York Times called Monikers "the perfect party game."

Mark Ruffalo talks about new whistleblower film 'Dark Waters'

Texto completo: Mark Ruffalo was shocked.
You see, apart from being an Oscar-nominated actor best known for playing the Hulk in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and a Hudson Valley resident, Ruffalo is also an environmental activist; he co-founded Water Defense in 2011 to raise awareness about the impact energy extraction has on water and public health.
And "The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare" had hit him hard. Nathaniel Rich's 2016 piece for the New York Times Magazine chronicled attorney Rob Bilott's fight to expose impact of the DuPont chemical company's release of PFOA, or perfluorooctanoic acid, which it had pumped as powder into the Ohio River near a West Virginia facility for decades, according to Rich's reporting. PFOA is a compound used in the manufacture of Teflon.
"If you are a sentient being reading this article in 2016, you already have PFOA in your blood," Rich wrote. "It is in your parents' blood, your children's blood, your lover's blood. How did it get there? Through the air, through your diet, through your use of nonstick cookware, through your umbilical cord. Or you might have drunk tainted water."
Scientists, according to Rich's reporting, found a "probable link" between PFOA and ailments including kidney, testicular and thyroid cancers, as well as high cholesterol, pre-eclampsia and ulcerative colitis.
"I was just floored," said Ruffalo. "It's like the biggest corporate criminality, spanning 50 years, no accountability, and no one knew about it."
Ruffalo is working to change that with "Dark Waters." The film — it opened in select cinemas Nov. 22, expanding on Nov. 29 and playing nationwide on Dec. 6 — was produced by Ruffalo.
He also stars as Bilott, a environmental corporate defense attorney who spent years on the issue of PFOA as the work took its toll on his health and career.
The question of Bilott's motivation compelled Ruffalo, the actor said.
"Was there really a rebellious quality in him? Did he have a chip on his shoulder about something?" Ruffalo wondered. Instead, the actor kept coming back to a much more straightforward answer.
"He believed in people, and he saw the world as a jury of his peers," Ruffalo said of Bilott. "And (he believed that) once he laid out enough evidence and it was compelling enough, that they would decide to do the right thing. That's how he handled everything, and it's that kind of dispassionate, unemotional, empirical sort of one foot in front of the other until we get to where we need to be that was his ethos.
"As an actor, you want the big, dramatic moments. You want the juicy scenes. You want the moment where our hero gets to confront the bad guy and take him down, but that's just not the nature of Rob and that's not the nature of the story."
Oscar-winning actor and activist Tim Robbins co-stars in "Dark Waters" as Tom Terp, Bilott's supervising partner at the Cincinnati law firm of Taft Stettinius and Hollister LLP who provides Bilott with crucial support in contrast to the firm's history of representing chemical companies.
"That's what spoke to me, it was the unexpected nature of it," said Robbins, "the man whose law firm represents chemical companies, to take on a case that is holding a chemical company responsible for polluting the environment. This is not their wheelhouse, right? This is not something they normally do. I find characters like that really inspiring."
DuPont and Chemours, a former DuPont unit that spun off into its own company in 2015, arrived at a $670.7 million settlement to settle 3,550 lawsuits related to the release of PFOA in 2017.
Terp and Bilott could, Robbins said, serve as guides for how more changes could come in the future.
"It's not like they're your liberal reformers or anything, it's people who go outside their own corporate culture to pursue something based on morality, based on right and wrong and not on profit margin," said Robbins.

Texto completo: When I've told you what my son said, it's not "his data" anymore.
Here is an anecdote I was not allowed to post on Twitter.
On a recent trip to Costco, the kids were fighting in the back of the car and I asked my husband, "Why do we have such bad children? Is it because we're bad parents?" He said, "Yes, but it's not our fault, we must've had bad parents." I said, "But that's not their fault -- " and my 6-year-old son interrupted, enraged, yelling from the back of the car, "IT'S ALL GOD'S FAULT!"
Your own reaction to this story can tell you why my son wouldn't let me tweet it: He doesn't want you to think he's cute. (He has consented to have it appear here. No children's rights were violated in the writing of this essay.) When he was saying those words, he was not trying to entertain. He was angry -- at me, at my husband, at God and, after I asked him whether I could tweet it, at you for the way he knew you would react.
My oldest son is 15, and he finds my Twitter behavior undignified. ("Why does the world need to know that we are at Costco?") He feels that a teacher, mentor and role model should cultivate a distance, even a mystique, so as to elicit the kind of respect she needs from her students, advisees and admirers. If people do not think they know you, then you do not need to worry, as my 6-year-old did, that you have left yourself in their interpretive hands. You can restrict their thoughts about you.
To allow others to think about us in whatever way they feel like -- perhaps to laugh at us, perhaps to dismiss us -- is a huge loss of control. So why do we allow it? What is the attraction of it? I think that it's the increase in control we get in return. Social media has enabled the Great Control Swap. And it is happening right now, beneath our notice.
The first baby step toward the Great Swap was the shift from phone calls to texts. A phone interaction requires participants to be "on the same time," which entails negotiations over entrance into and exit from the conversation. Consider all the time we spend first on, "Is this a bad time to call? Can you talk?" And then later on, "O.K., gotta go, talk to you soon, see you later, good talking to you ... " (It's only in the movies that you can just hang up on someone.) Everyone has been in a phone conversation that ended much later than they wanted it to; the form subjects us to the will of another.
A text or email interaction, by contrast, liberates the parties so that each may operate on their own time. But the cost comes in another form of control: data. Homer's "winged words" fly from the mouth of one directly to the ear of another, but text-based communication requires stationary words: One person puts them down, so the other can come along and read them at her leisure. And that means they leave a trail.
Imagine a man conducting a romantic affair exclusively by email. He needn't lie to his wife about fake "business trips," since he can pursue his shenanigans right under her nose. Likewise, he avoids undesirable entanglements with his mistress: He doesn't even need to buy her dinner! Email allows him the control to steer the two women out of the way of one another -- but the price he pays is a very robust data trail. His affair has a text archive. If his mistress decides to write a book about it, she can be scientific. She needn't rely on memory or vague impressions. She can systematically analyze their interactions and quote his exact words.
Our anger at social media companies resembles this man's anger over his mistress's theft of his "private data." We wanted one kind of control, and didn't reckon with the fact that we'd have to pay for it with another kind. We wanted to be able to interact with other people entirely in our own time, with people who make no demands on us. We wanted entry and exit to be painless. We understood from the start that this form of socializing -- like an affair without physical contact -- was shallower than the other, more demanding kind. We were prepared to accept that trade-off, but failed to grasp that we were trading away more than depth. We were also trading away a kind of control.
As my children appreciate, the control issue goes well beyond whether Facebook monetizes our data. It is also a matter of making oneself into a thing that others can own. When I've told you what my son said, it's not "his data" anymore. He can't control whether you laugh at it, or what tone you use when you do.
We don't like to acknowledge just how much we are willing to pay for distance from other people. For example, people warn prospective parents that having a baby is expensive, but that isn't exactly true. What's expensive is getting away from your baby. If you don't want to feed them with your body, you buy formula and bottles. If you don't want them looking at you all the time, you buy contraptions to entertain them. A stroller so you don't have to carry them, a crib so you don't have to sleep with them, a house with extra rooms so you don't even have to sleep near them, child care so that you can get farther away yet: These are the costs that add up. You don't pay much for babies, but you pay a lot to escape them.
All of us have a desire to connect, to be seen. But we live in a world that is starting to allow us to satisfy that desire without feeling the common-sense moral strictures that have traditionally governed human relationships. We can engage without obligation, without boredom and, most importantly, without subjecting our attention to the command of another. On Twitter, I'm never obligated to listen through to the end of someone's story.
The immense appeal of this free-form socializing lies in the way it makes one a master of one's own time -- but it cannot happen without a place. All that data has to sit somewhere so that people can freely access it whenever they wish. Data storage is the loss of control by which we secure social control: Facebook is our faithless mistress's leaky inbox.
When we alienate our identities as text data, and put that data "out there" to be read by anyone who wanders by, we are putting ourselves into the interpretive hands of those who have no bonds or obligations or agreements with us, people with whom we are, quite literally, prevented from seeing "eye to eye." People we cannot trust.
The Great Control Swap buys us control over the logistics of our interactions at the cost of interpretive control over the content of those interactions. Our words have lost their wings, and fallen to the ground as data.

Texto completo: Ciara hosts this year's American Music Awards, and Judy Garland stars in the beloved period musical "Meet Me in St. Louis."
What's on TV
2019 AMERICAN MUSIC AWARDS 8 p.m. on ABC. Ciara hosts this year's A.M.A.s ceremony, which honors the music industry's top performers. As always, the night will feature an eclectic slate of live performances -- this year, from Kesha and Big Freedia; Christina Aguilera featuring A Great Big World; and Post Malone, who will be joined by Ozzy Osbourne, Travis Scott and Watt. Selena Gomez will showcase new music, Green Day will celebrate the 25th anniversary of "Dookie" and Shania Twain will perform a medley of her greatest hits. Taylor Swift, who suggested earlier this month that her former label Big Machine was preventing her from singing her old songs on TV, is scheduled to be honored as artist of the decade.
BACK TO LIFE 10 p.m. on Showtime. Life for Miri Matteson (Daisy Haggard) post prison hasn't been easy. Members of her small coastal community have responded to her return by leaving offensive graffiti on her parents' house, lobbing a brick at her through a window at her new job and sending her a very unpleasant package in the mail. But Miri has soldiered on, trying to convince people that she's not the monster they think she is, working to repair her strained relationship with her mother, reconnecting with old friends and even testing the waters with a new love interest. In the final two episodes of the first season, Miri confronts the unforgiving residents of her town and learns about the events that led to the death of her friend.
CHRISTMAS 9 TO 5 8 p.m. on Lifetime. The latest installment of Lifetime's holiday programming touches on a topical phenomenon: the decline of the American department store. Jennifer (played by Tiya Sircar) is an investigative reporter who goes undercover as a store clerk at Desmond's, an outlet known for its holiday decorations and festivities. There, she starts up a workplace romance with Jack (Joe Dinicol), who informs her that the store will be closing after Christmas. Together they work to restore Desmond's to its former glory.
What's Streaming
MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS (1944) Stream on the Criterion Channel. This film is perhaps more remembered for its musical numbers, like "The Trolley Song" and "Meet Me in St. Louis," than it is as a holiday classic. But with its focus on family dynamics and Judy Garland's performance of "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas," it's also a seasonal favorite. The film follows the Smith family in St. Louis, Mo., over one lively year leading up to the 1904 World's Fair as the sisters Rose (Lucille Bremer), Esther (Garland), Agnes (Joan Carroll) and Tootie (Margaret O'Brien) navigate romance and anticipate a move to New York after the Christmas holiday. In his review for The New York Times, Bosley Crowther wrote, "The Smiths and their home, in Technicolor, are eyefuls of scenic delight, and the bursting vitality of their living inspires you like vitamin A."

Texto completo: Lhooq Books, the funky Carlsbad Village bookstore and arts hub that was set to close Saturday after losing its lease, has been granted a seven-month reprieve. But proprietor Sean Christopher said without community support to find and underwrite a new location, the business will close for good next spring.
Christopher, 45, has leased the property for the last 12 years at 755 1/2 Carlsbad Village Drive and lives with his 10-year-old son, Jack, in an 1940s-era home next door. Although Christopher said he had never missed a rent payment on the two properties, the landlord unexpectedly canceled his month-to-month lease in mid-September and gave him 60 days to vacate the property.
With so little time to find both a new home and retail space, and no savings to pay for the move, Christopher said he feared he and his son would end up homeless.

After starting a community appeal on Facebook and a Gofundme campaign, Christopher hired a lawyer and he and the landlord, San Juan Capistrano City Manager Ben Siegel, hammered out a compromise Oct. 31. The lease has been extended to May 31. Although details of the agreement are sealed, Christopher said he's grateful to have time to figure out his next steps.
Ideally, Christopher said he would like to find an arts-loving philanthropist or nonprofit organization that would underwrite Lhooq Books' move to a new location in coastal north San Diego County, which he could continue to operate as a paid employee. But if there's not enough community support to relocate, Christopher said he will sell off the store's vast collection of vintage books, art and memorabilia and move to the Pacific Northwest, where he would concentrate on writing novels and short stories, his first passion. As a fourth-generation Carlsbad resident, he's hoping for the former, rather than the latter.
"I think North County, especially coastal North County, needs an arts and culture space that specializes specifically in what many would call avant-garde or underground art, music and writing," he said. "We worked very hard at creating a space that was all that, but also was inviting to all."
Lhooq Books -- located in an alley between Garden Stage Bagels and the Taco Bell/KFC restaurant near Madison Street -- has the oddball, grass-roots vibe of something you'd find in San Francisco or Berkeley.
The front outdoor wall of the converted garage is lined with hundreds of books that community members are welcome to borrow or pay what they can to buy. Inside, thousands of rare, vintage and new books line floor-to-ceiling shelves decorated with found art, globes, statuary, antique typewriters, a fish tank and chess sets. There are shelves devoted to literature, beat poetry, philosophy, religion, poetry, war, fiction and biographies.
On the fenced patio between the shop and house where he and his son live, there are tables and chairs where visitors can order a cappuccino and watch movies or attend readings, concertsand writing workshops. Another wall of the is decorated with a large colorful mural by local skater-artist Kris Markovich.
The hidden-gem quality of Lhooq Books -- which Christopher named after "L.H.O.O.Q.," a tongue-in-cheek 1919 artwork by Marcel Duchamp -- has made it a darling with travel writers and bloggers. It's been written up in the New York Times, the Hidden San Diego website and in a local arts crawl guide.
The Gofundme campaign that Christopher launched in September has raised about $5,700, which he used to pay his attorney and help cover expenses at the shop while he explores options.
He's in talks with friends and supporters about possibly hosting fundraisers or an auction to underwrite the relocation.
If nothing else, Christopher said he has time to gradually sell his inventory to raise enough money to begin the next chapter of his life.
That future includes his new wife, an artist in Eastern Europe whom he married in December. He spent the last few weeks in her hometown doing interviews and paperwork for her immigration, which should happen in the next four to six months.
Because he wants to make his growing family a priority, Christopher said he can no longer afford to live a hand-to-mouth existence and needs a better work-life balance. So he's hoping to seek out grants, donations and underwriters willing to commit to saving Lhooq Books and supporting a paid staff.
"I think it is a very serious and important cause. We need a place that nurtures the kind of art and culture we supported," Christopher said. Places such as Lhooq Books are where the true artists discover themselves and eventually get discovered, he added.

Beware the federal “Grinch” during the season of giving

Texto completo: It’s officially the holiday shopping season. But be wary. Your Grinch neighbor, the IRS, is sitting high on the mountain, waiting to pounce. When money or items of value change hands, the IRS often wants a share, and believe it or not, it includes gift-giving.
The basic rules
A recipient of a gift does not pay income taxes on the gift. But the donor may pay gift or estate taxes. These taxes work together but are two different taxes, separate and apart from income taxes. A gift tax applies to gifts made during your lifetime, paid by the donor and not the recipient.
Estate tax applies to transfers at your death, paid by the decedent’s estate, not the recipient. There is one tax exemption for both these taxes. Currently, the exemption is $11.4 million, so you can give that amount away during your life or at your death, or some combination thereof, without gift or estate taxes.
Additionally, anyone can give another person a gift of up to $15,000 a year. That means spouses can together gift $30,000 per year. After that, the gift is subject to gift tax and you’ll need to use part of your exemption.
How it works
If you gift, for example, $25,000 to your adult child, $10,000 is a potentially taxable gift. You would need to file a gift tax return and claim a portion of your lifetime exemption, leaving you with $11,390,000 still to gift during your lifetime or at your death without taxes. An amount beyond that is taxed at 40%, and you or your estate pays that tax, not the recipient.
You may think that with an exemption that high you have nothing to worry about. — gift away! (Please add me to your list.) But beware that the exemption amount is scheduled to drop to about $5.4 million after 2025. Expect to see a lot of serious gifting by the wealthy in 2025 to use up the larger exemption that will disappear the following year.
What could go wrong?
There can be a lot of reasons to gift during your lifetime: your kid needs the money, you need to drop an asset from your estate, you’re downsizing and would like to see your child and grandchildren live in the family home. But beware that besides the potential for a gift tax, there’s an income tax issue, too.
Unlike property inherited due to death, gifted property keeps the same tax basis the donor had. Say you have stock you paid $25,000 for that is now worth $50,000. If the stock is given to your heirs, it would have an income tax basis of $50,000. If they sold the stock, they’d have no taxable gain. If you instead gift that stock during your lifetime, the recipient gets your same tax basis of $25,000. If they sell the stock, they will have a taxable gain of $25,000. This may work fine if the recipient is in a low tax bracket or is a tax-free charity. Just do the analysis with your advisors before making a gift of an appreciated asset. Timing is everything.
Other Gift Tax Exemptions
There are other gifts that can be made without incurring gift tax. Gifts to pay for someone else’s medical expenses or tuition, gifts to a spouse and gifts to charity do not incur gift tax no matter the amount and are not subject to the annual $15,000 limit. But again, be cautious. The Grinch is rubbing his green paws together.
A gift of tuition for all levels of education is not subject to gift tax, but the exemption, known as the Gift Tax Exclusion for Tuition, only applies if you make the payment directly to the institution and not the student and keep documentation. The exemption does not include gifts for housing, books, supplies, or meals. The gift may also affect the student’s eligibility for financial aid.
Payment of medical expenses is excluded from gift tax only if the bill is incurred for “the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease” and is not covered by insurance.
Gifts between spouses are not subject to tax. But a gift from a spouse becomes the separate property of the recipient. You would not get half of it back if you divorce. (This is a Grinch of a different color, but relevant here.) Additional rules apply if your spouse is not a U.S. citizen.
Charitable gifts aren’t subject to gift tax, and you can get an income tax deduction if you itemize. But your deduction for charitable gifts is limited to 60% of your adjusted gross income, 30% in some cases.
Conclusion
Gifting to your loved ones or charity is, of course, a wonderful thing. My gift to you is simply to remind you that sometimes gifts need to be carefully planned out with professional advisors so it makes it to the Whos in your Whoville without the Grinch grabbing a chunk. The IRS is a mean one.

Texto completo: It’s officially the holiday shopping season. But be wary. Your Grinch neighbor, the IRS, is sitting high on the mountain, waiting to pounce. When money or items of value change hands, the IRS often wants a share, and believe it or not, it includes gift-giving.
The basic rules
A recipient of a gift does not pay income taxes on the gift. But the donor may pay gift or estate taxes. These taxes work together but are two different taxes, separate and apart from income taxes. A gift tax applies to gifts made during your lifetime, paid by the donor and not the recipient.
Estate tax applies to transfers at your death, paid by the decedent’s estate, not the recipient. There is one tax exemption for both these taxes. Currently, the exemption is $11.4 million, so you can give that amount away during your life or at your death, or some combination thereof, without gift or estate taxes.
Additionally, anyone can give another person a gift of up to $15,000 a year. That means spouses can together gift $30,000 per year. After that, the gift is subject to gift tax and you’ll need to use part of your exemption.
How it works
If you gift, for example, $25,000 to your adult child, $10,000 is a potentially taxable gift. You would need to file a gift tax return and claim a portion of your lifetime exemption, leaving you with $11,390,000 still to gift during your lifetime or at your death without taxes. An amount beyond that is taxed at 40%, and you or your estate pays that tax, not the recipient.
You may think that with an exemption that high you have nothing to worry about. — gift away! (Please add me to your list.) But beware that the exemption amount is scheduled to drop to about $5.4 million after 2025. Expect to see a lot of serious gifting by the wealthy in 2025 to use up the larger exemption that will disappear the following year.
What could go wrong?
There can be a lot of reasons to gift during your lifetime: your kid needs the money, you need to drop an asset from your estate, you’re downsizing and would like to see your child and grandchildren live in the family home. But beware that besides the potential for a gift tax, there’s an income tax issue, too.
Unlike property inherited due to death, gifted property keeps the same tax basis the donor had. Say you have stock you paid $25,000 for that is now worth $50,000. If the stock is given to your heirs, it would have an income tax basis of $50,000. If they sold the stock, they’d have no taxable gain. If you instead gift that stock during your lifetime, the recipient gets your same tax basis of $25,000. If they sell the stock, they will have a taxable gain of $25,000. This may work fine if the recipient is in a low tax bracket or is a tax-free charity. Just do the analysis with your advisors before making a gift of an appreciated asset. Timing is everything.
Other Gift Tax Exemptions
There are other gifts that can be made without incurring gift tax. Gifts to pay for someone else’s medical expenses or tuition, gifts to a spouse and gifts to charity do not incur gift tax no matter the amount and are not subject to the annual $15,000 limit. But again, be cautious. The Grinch is rubbing his green paws together.
A gift of tuition for all levels of education is not subject to gift tax, but the exemption, known as the Gift Tax Exclusion for Tuition, only applies if you make the payment directly to the institution and not the student and keep documentation. The exemption does not include gifts for housing, books, supplies, or meals. The gift may also affect the student’s eligibility for financial aid.
Payment of medical expenses is excluded from gift tax only if the bill is incurred for “the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease” and is not covered by insurance.
Gifts between spouses are not subject to tax. But a gift from a spouse becomes the separate property of the recipient. You would not get half of it back if you divorce. (This is a Grinch of a different color, but relevant here.) Additional rules apply if your spouse is not a U.S. citizen.
Charitable gifts aren’t subject to gift tax, and you can get an income tax deduction if you itemize. But your deduction for charitable gifts is limited to 60% of your adjusted gross income, 30% in some cases.
Conclusion
Gifting to your loved ones or charity is, of course, a wonderful thing. My gift to you is simply to remind you that sometimes gifts need to be carefully planned out with professional advisors so it makes it to the Whos in your Whoville without the Grinch grabbing a chunk. The IRS is a mean one.

White House press secretary cites John Bolton’s ‘advanced age’ for ‘forgotten’ Twitter password

Texto completo: White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said former national security adviser John Bolton’s “advanced age” could be to blame for being locked out of his Twitter account after he left the Trump administration.
“Sometimes, I’ll use my father as an example, somebody who is of an advanced age may not understand that all you have to do is contact Twitter and reset your password if you’ve forgotten it so I’ll just leave it at that,” Grisham told Fox Business on Friday.
Bolton, 71, is two years younger than President Trump.
Bolton, who resigned in September, reemerged on Twitter on Friday after a more than two-month hiatus on the social media platform.
“Glad to be back on Twitter after more than two months. For the backstory, stay tuned,” Bolton wrote.
Tweet
“We have now liberated the Twitter account, previously suppressed unfairly in the aftermath of my resignation as National Security Advisor,” he said, adding that the White House had refused to give him access to his account.
Tweet
He thanked Twitter for “rightfully returning control of my account.”
Tweet
Trump denied to Fox & Friends that he had anything to do with the matter.
Bolton told the New York Times that the White House “attached software” to his account.
“They would not give it back. A representative of mine spoke with John Eisenberg, who said he would get it released, and it never happened. So finally we went to Twitter.”
Eisenberg is the top National Security Council lawyer. The software referenced by Bolton may have been connected to efforts to archive tweets in following presidential records laws.

Texto completo: Navy Secretary Richard Spencer is weighing whether to quit over President Trump’s interference in the case of Eddie Gallagher, a Navy SEAL accused of murdering an injured Islamic State fighter in Iraq in 2017.
During an Air Force One flight to Dover Air Force Base on Thursday, military leaders pleaded with Trump to stop intervening in the case in an effort to keep Spencer from resigning, according to NBC News.
Gallagher was acquitted by a military court, but he was found guilty of posing with the dead fighter’s body.
Trump, who restored Gallagher’s rank last week, condemned a board review into whether Gallagher should remain in the elite SEAL corps.
“The Navy will NOT be taking away Warfighter and Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher's Trident Pin. This case was handled very badly from the beginning. Get back to business!” the president tweeted Thursday.
Spencer told the White House that Trump’s tweet was not an official order and he would need to put it in writing. Four officials said Spencer was strongly considering resigning if Trump follows through with a written order to end the investigation.
Rear Adm. Collin Green, who leads the SEALs, also threatened to quit over Trump’s interference, according to the New York Times.
Gallagher, 40, was charged in 2018 for war crimes while he was deployed the previous year in Iraq. As a result of his conviction for posing with a dead ISIS fighter, his rank was reduced from chief petty officer to petty officer.
Trump has intervened in the case several times while Navy leaders sought disciplinary action against Gallagher.

Texto completo: STOCKDALE, Texas - The 300-pound llamas strolled quietly through the corridors of the nursing home, lowering their heads to be petted by residents in wheelchairs and pausing patiently as staffers took selfies.
“Did you get a bath today?” one resident, Jean Wyatt, asked Tic, a white male llama owned by Zoe Rutledge. (He had.)
Zoe, a high school sophomore, was there with her parents, Jeff and Carol Rutledge, who keep 13 llamas and alpacas at their home here in Stockdale, an exurb of San Antonio. Three of their herd have passed the qualifying exam necessary to become registered therapy llamas, a test that involves being touched by strangers and remaining impassive when people nearby start arguing.
“You look for the ones that are mellow and calm,” said Zoe, explaining how her family chose the animals they take to assisted living facilities, nursing and veterans’ homes, rehabilitation centers and walkathons for groups like the Down Syndrome Association of South Texas.
Llamas and alpacas - popular in TV commercials, as toys and on all manner of apparel - are simultaneously growing more common in therapeutic settings. While a handful are registered with Pet Partners, a national nonprofit clearinghouse for therapy animals, most are simply family farm pets whose owners take them to hospitals, college campuses and senior centers to ease people’s stress.
The novelty factor is a big part of the appeal, along with the creatures’ big-eyed, empathetic gaze. Among the animals that biologists refer to as charismatic megafauna - tigers, elephants, giant pandas and the like - llamas, which are not endangered, are among the few that people can safely hug.
“For some people, dogs are a little too much, or they’ve had a bad experience with them,” said Niki Kuklenski, a longtime llama breeder in Bellingham, Washington, who was one of the first to use the animals for therapeutic purposes. She said that her llamas, especially a female named Flight, “will read people. So when she goes into a setting where someone’s really animated and excited to see her, she’ll put her head down for a hug.”
But if someone seems apprehensive, “Flight will stand stock still,” Kuklenski said. “She is very cool.”
Don’t forget llama insurance
At Pet Partners, 94% of the registered therapy animals are dogs, but there are 20 llamas and alpacas in the mix, said Elisabeth Van Every, a spokeswoman for the group. (Most are llamas, which are much larger than alpacas and typically far friendlier to humans.) People who register their animals are covered under Pet Partners’ insurance for the duration of their therapy visits, and must abide by strict rules about health, grooming and working conditions. No animal may work more than two hours a day, and handlers must be aware of any signs of fatigue or annoyance.
Llama owners will tell you that their pets have a sixth sense about people who are needy, ill or frail. Carol Rutledge says that her therapy llama, whose name is Knock, will walk voluntarily to the bedside of a hospice patient and stand in silence while the patient reaches for him. “It wrenches at your heart,” she said. “It’s taken me several visits to be able to get through it without getting emotional.”
Mona Sams, an occupational therapist in Roanoke, Virginia, has eight llamas and five alpacas at her practice, which serves children with autism and other disorders, as well as adults with developmental disabilities. One patient is a girl with severe cerebral palsy and seizures who comes twice a week. “I have one llama” - named Woolly - “who literally sits there with her for a whole hour, face to face,” Sams said. “She calls Woolly her ‘counselor,’ and she will spend the first part of the hour telling Woolly what difficulties she’s had, and he just sits beside her for that entire time.”
Sams is the lead author of what seems to be the only published study involving the use of llamas as therapy animals. The article, published in 2006 in the American Journal of Occupational Therapy, describes a very small clinical trial in which children with autism were given either standard occupational therapy or therapy that involved handling llamas. The results “indicated that the children engaged in significantly greater use of language and significantly social interaction in the occupational therapy sessions incorporating animals than in the standard occupational therapy sessions,” the study authors wrote.
Hal Herzog, an anthrozoologist and professor emeritus of psychology at Western Carolina University, said that such results are not surprising, though they do not prove the efficacy of animal-assisted therapy. He says there’s a big mismatch between what the public believes - or wants to believe - about the effectiveness of therapy animals and what scientific studies show.
“The evidence for the short-term, probably transient, effects of interacting with animals in nursing homes or for autistic kids is quite good - petting a dog, or interacting with a llama, stress levels go down,” Herzog said. “But when we think of therapy, we think about long-term treatment, and I think the evidence for that is mixed.”
In Sams’ llama study, for example, he said, the children who got the standard therapy were doing “boring stuff” compared with the children who got to play with llamas. “I have no objection to that llama study, if it makes the kids feel better for a time, but I wouldn’t call it therapy,” said Herzog, author of the animal ethics book “Some We Love, Some We Hate, Some We Eat.”
He also pointed out that many people who research the human-animal bond are what he calls “true believers,” eager to validate the positive influence of pets and emotional support animals. “As an animal lover myself, I really wanted to believe it, too,” Herzog said, adding that his research led him to a different conclusion.
Not for everyone
Llama therapy is certainly not for everyone. While llamas are gentle creatures that seldom spit at humans, some people find their large stature intimidating or get spooked at seeing livestock indoors. On the flip side, some llamas aren’t cut out for the job: The two notorious runaway llamas that escaped onto a highway near Phoenix in 2015 had bolted from a visit to an assisted-living residence.
When two of the Rutledge family’s three therapy llamas - Tic and Knock - arrived at the Stockdale Residence and Rehabilitation Center for a regular visit, Bill Smallwood, a resident who is disabled from a motorcycle accident, accepted a small hair brush from Zoe and began grooming her llama. Smallwood is nonverbal, she said, but when the llamas are there, he will murmur and make wordlike noises.
This summer, for a science competition for 4-H Club, Zoe compared the blood pressure readings of three of the nursing home’s residents, including Smallwood and Wyatt, before and after the llamas visited. Her hypothesis proved correct: Most of the time, their blood pressure was lower after the llamas left, and, observationally, they seemed happier.
Bobbie West, the nursing home’s activities director, said she kept it secret when the llamas were scheduled to visit, lest staff and residents get too excited. “They love the llamas,” she said. “One lady, she can be in the foulest of moods, and when the llamas come, she just gets a whole new aura to her.”

Texto completo: MANILA, Philippines - As public anger mounted last year over delayed plans to shake up the Philippines' outage-plagued telecommunications sector, angry comments and one-star ratings flooded a government-run Facebook page.
When employees suspected online trolls, President Rodrigo Duterte's digital mastermind offered a solution.
"I'll handle this," said Nic Gabunada, the architect of the social media strategy that powered Duterte's 2016 election victory, according to a government employee who managed the Facebook page.
Pro-Duterte comments soon poured onto the page, with users defending the president's handling of the situation or blaming the problems on the previous administration. Many of the new commenters had only basic profile information on their pages, which featured mostly generic posts with religious or pro-government messages.
"It was Nic," said the employee, who was interviewed on the condition her name not be used for fear of retribution. "The fact that he had a troll army was known by everyone, but not openly talked about."
In the Philippines, candidates and government officials routinely pay vast cyber-troll armies that create multiple fake social media accounts to smear opponents and prop themselves up.
It's all part of the online propaganda wars shaking politics in the country.
And it could soon be coming to the U.S., according to election officials and disinformation scholars who are watching closely. They warn that the Philippine epidemic probably will spread here, given Filipinos' proficiency in English, facility with social media and the lure of money from campaigns looking for a new way to get an edge over the competition.
Already, U.S. operatives in both parties have made early efforts at using trolls for political gain. Rogue progressives stealthily launched fake social media campaigns against Roy Moore, the GOP nominee for Senate in Alabama, during a 2017 special election. Their campaign aimed to confuse voters into thinking Moore supported banning alcohol and that Russian bots were working on his behalf.
The New York Times revealed the plot, along with an earlier, aborted plan developed by a firm run by former Israeli intelligence agents to engage dozens of paid trolls in swaying delegates to Donald Trump during the 2016 GOP convention. The plan was requested by a senior Trump campaign official but was not carried out.
"The presence of a large for-hire market looking at all the disinformation online that you can buy and people are selling is quite disturbing," Camille Francois, the chief innovation officer of Graphika, a firm that helps tech companies and government investigators find and confront online disinformation, said at a Federal Election Commission symposium in September.
"What these troll farms are reporting is a growth of global business. What do we do about that?"
Manila, alone, has hundreds of active troll farms. The shadowy networks act as weapons that, for the right price, can build artificial buzz around a product, a celebrity - or a political figure.
Those troll techniques "will be used more and more," said Malou N. Tiquia, chief executive of the Manila political strategy consultancy Publicus Asia. "When Facebook said it won't ban political ads, that was already a signal to everyone that anything goes."
U.S. regulators have barely begun to consider the mounting threat, and Silicon Valley has shown itself lacking the tools and will to effectively confront it. Tech firms are making little headway stamping out the scourge where it has emerged so far, even after Facebook in March removed from its platform 200 pages for "inauthentic" activity and took the rare step of identifying Gabunada's network as the culprit.
The Filipino digital propagandist has denied trafficking in misinformation and did not respond to texts seeking comment about his work for the Duterte administration.
Such moves by Facebook are doing little to slow the trolls.
Filipinos spend so much time online - they average a staggering 10 hours a day, according to industry data - and disinformation has spiraled so quickly that Katie Harbath, Facebook public policy director for global elections, branded it "patient zero in the global disinformation epidemic" during a 2018 talk in Berlin.
"The propaganda looks really organic and it often doesn't trip any of the flags" that alert tech companies, said Jonathan Ong, a professor of global digital media at University of Massachusetts Amherst whose research has taken him inside Filipino troll farms.
Political campaigns contract out their digital efforts to consultants, who in turn pay up to $1,000 per month to college students and recent graduates who are charged with launching multiple fake Facebook pages designed to look like they were created by actual voters or grassroots groups.
"It is so easy to be enlisted in these jobs," Ong said. His recent study on the industry includes an interview with one paid troll who fell into the work when the chief of staff of the political campaign she was working on ordered everyone to start creating fake accounts and posting on them.
Others have fleeting loyalties politically but are attracted to the cash. Consultants running troll farms have been known to switch sides in the middle of an election.
"The alliances are very shifty," Ong said. "Strategists will switch in the middle of a campaign to join who they think will be the winner. They will betray their client. It happened in the last election."
Most often, the operations are run through contractors separate from the actual campaigns so the candidate has no fingerprints on the weapon. And the trolls often don't trigger attention from tech platforms because they know how to avoid detection. The algorithms that tech companies use to detect phony accounts tend to focus on dozens of commenters posting the same message around the same time, or users with a stock photo on their profile page. The trolls don't do these things.
"You can look like legitimate Facebook users to trick the (company's) artificial intelligence," said Ross Tapsell, a researcher at Australian National University who documented the surge of paid troll activity in the Philippine province of Cebu.
In some cases operatives contract the work out to troll farms in far-off places, including Saudi Arabia.
"We have only scratched the surface of what a lot of this involved," he said.

POINT PARK CANCELS FALL MUSICAL STUDENTS CONCERNED WITH ITS RACIST CONTENT

Texto completo: Student concerns over racist content in Point Park University's fall show have led to the cancellation of "Adding Machine: A Musical."
On Thursday, Steven Breese, artistic director of the university's Pittsburgh Playhouse and dean of the Conservatory of Performing Arts, convened a town hall in the Playhouse's Highmark Theater, where "Adding Machine" was to have opened Dec. 5. More than 200 students, faculty and staff aired concerns for nearly three hours.
"While it might be unusual and maybe even unprecedented, given the circumstances and the dialogue we had, it was absolutely the right thing to do," Mr. Breese said.
The provocative, expressionist musical was chosen for the current season by Mr. Breese's predecessor of 18 years, Ron Allan-Lindblom. Mr. Breese took the job in July.
Based on the 1923 play by Elmer Rice, "Adding Machine" debuted in 2008 to a rave New York Times review, which called it an "impossibly bleak, improbably brilliant little musical."
The show's protagonist is a racist who commits murder after being replaced by technology. In one particularly harrowing scene, as described in an essay by Chicago actor Bear Bellinger, "Inhabitants hurl epithets around the stage in a stylized musical sequence that is an apparent send-up of American White nationalism in an age of discrimination. But, when you add minority bodies to that mix, the message becomes muddled."
Mr. Breese was familiar with the play but not the musical when he arrived at Point Park. He understood the intent is to show "how easily discrimination and hatred become woven in the fabric of society."
Jordyn Hronec, covering the Thursday gathering as editor-elect of the Point Park Globe, quoted student actors who felt their concerns about the show's racist content were not being addressed. She wrote that the director of the COPA production, Tlaloc Rivas, who attended the meeting, had previously "described what he referred to as an "Action Plan for Traumatic Content' - something that students at the meeting claimed had not been effective enough."
Students did not hold back at the meeting. "It was not clear enough that the show was 'mocking' the characters expressing racist sentiments. Students were also concerned about the lack of trigger warnings given to students during the audition process, as well as on marketing materials," Ms. Hronec reported.
"I think there is difficult language in the show that is the trigger for emotional responses," Mr. Breese said Friday. "But also, and importantly, the play does hold a mirror up to society, and it's an ugly reflection. But there is this hate speech that we are supposed to react strongly to, yet there isn't a sense of getting their punishment or comeuppance for it. That's intentional in the playwright's mind but not easy for everyone to reconcile."
American musicals have dealt with racism, often by exposing it with disturbing images and language. "Show Boat," which debuted in 1927, includes a light-skinned black woman passing as white, who is discovered and ostracized. The song "Ol' Man River" from it was introduced with the N-word included - a lyric that has been modified through time, including by its original singer, Paul Robeson.
There have long been arguments for and against showing theatrical works in their original forms, as reflected by the times in which they were created and those in which we live today. "Thoroughly Modern Millie" is one example of a show that was rewritten to erase the racist stereotypes that featured white actors playing Asian characters.
In 2015, Clarion University canceled its production of "Jesus in India" after playwright Lloyd Suh voiced concerns over white actors being cast in roles written for actors of South Asian descent.
Canceling a university show, with actors already cast and rehearsal well underway, is not an easy decision, but "it was the right one," Mr. Breese said. The conservatory dean added that accommodations would be made for seniors or for any student who had worked on this production as a requirement.
Holding town hall meetings is something Mr. Breese has done in previous university positions and intends to do twice a semester. In this particular case, he praised the students' courage and passion in speaking up.
"It was an opportunity to have this dialogue and for students to express what was on their minds," he said. "Clearly when we got into the room, and there were 200 people, it indicated there was more conversation than any of us recognized. From that perspective, I'm delighted we did this."
Upcoming productions for the 2019-20 conservatory season are "The Wolves," a play about a girls soccer team that was a finalist for the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for drama; the Tony-winning musical "Parade," a historical account of the lynching of a wrongly accused Jewish man in the South, directed by Tony- and Emmy-winning director Rob Ashford, a Point Park alum; and the world premiere of the new rock musical "Pump Up the Volume."

Texto completo: U.S. lawmakers are asking Airbnb Inc. to provide information about hosts that list short-term rentals on the site who don't comply with local laws and violate the company's own policies.
In a letter to Airbnb Chief Executive Brian Chesky, six members of Congress said they are particularly interested in recent media reports that have highlighted the proliferation of limited liability corporations on the home-sharing platform. For example, the lawmakers cited an article in the New York Times that reported that listings by one operation, out of compliance with company policy, were able to generate revenue of almost $21 million in three years.
Deceptive and misleading listings have also led to customers being scammed by "hosts" who abuse Airbnb's cancellation policies, according to the letter, which was signed by Democratic Reps. Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey, Barbara Lee of California and Robin Kelly of Illinois, among others.

"While we appreciate that you have frequently stated that Airbnb has a 'zero tolerance' policy with respect to these types of host behaviors, it also seems clear that you have failed to authenticate host identities in a way that would prevent bad actors from continuing to rent through your platform under false identities after being banned," the letter stated.
The lawmakers said they hoped Chesky would meet with them within the next two weeks to answer a list of questions, including how Airbnb vets hosts and how it will check the veracity of photos on rental listings.
Airbnb announced significant safety measures this month after a deadly shooting at a house in California. The changes include a 24/7 neighbor hotline, 100% verification of all the listings on the site and a full-refund policy for guests. The San Francisco company is preparing for a public stock market listing next year and is trying to resolve regulatory issues with cities across the U.S.

Texto completo: For years, Chinese e-cigarette makers had free rein to operate without regard to consumer safety. But new rules are set to change that.
Models in tight dresses and high heels lounged in a yellow inflatable pool filled with plush toys and vaping equipment. Enthusiastic vapers lined up for free pens and pods, as clouds of mango, mint and rose mingled with the electronic dance music in the air.
Attendees of the Shanghai eCig Expo had a lot to celebrate. Vaping has surged in China, drawing money from domestic and Western investors alike. In a country with nearly as many smokers as the entire United States population, the growth potential seemed limitless.
"This," said Frank Wang, an aspiring entrepreneur who wanted to open his own vaping shop, "is where you can make money now."
Perhaps not anymore.
China has joined the United States and other governments in putting new pressure on vaping. Regulators have banned online sales of vaping products, and China's major propaganda outlets have heaped on scrutiny, citing the potential health effects. The government is considering banning vaping in public places.
Beijing's crackdown threatens an almost exclusively Chinese industry that had been counting on the country as a haven. Ninety percent of the world's e-cigarettes are made in China, and most of them are produced in Shenzhen, a southern city that borders Hong Kong. Some of the nation's top e-cigarette brands, including RELX, FLOW and Yooz, have taken hundreds of millions of dollars in venture capital funding from high-profile names like Sequoia China, IDG Capital and Matrix Partners China. The firms did not respond to requests for comment.
The new scrutiny adds to the troubles for Chinese e-cigarette exporters, already hammered by the vaping-related health crisis in the United States that has sickened at least 2,200 people and killed 47.
While exporters have long dominated China's e-cigarette industry, the domestic market took off only about three years ago. Of the 10 million e-cigarette users in China, most are young people who vape sleek, brightly colored devices with flavors like chilled strawberry and orange soda.
Euromonitor, the global market research consultancy, said China's e-cigarette market was worth $ 750.4 million in 2018, nearly triple the 2014 value. China has more than 300 million smokers, out of a population of nearly 1.4 billion. In the United States, 10.8 million adults vape.
Juul Labs, which is under fire in the United States for marketing its e-cigarettes to teenagers and children, wanted to cash in, too. But just days after it started business in China, its products were removed from Alibaba and JD.com, two of the biggest e-commerce platforms. Neither the government nor the company gave any explanation. Juul had paid to be at the e-cigarette fair in Shanghai starting in late October but withdrew at the last minute because of the crisis in the United States, according to Li Wangfeng, project director of the expo.
Concerns are mounting about the hazards of vaping among the young, prompting many Chinese to call for regulations. A 2018 tobacco survey commissioned by China's Center for Disease Control found that people 15 to 24 years old were the most avid vapers, with most buying their devices online.
In recent weeks, the state news media has kept up its drumbeat of negative coverage of the industry. On Nov. 4, the most-read article on the website of People's Daily, the Communist Party's official newspaper, noted that most e-cigarette companies continued selling their products online despite the ban. The next day, China's state broadcaster, China Central Television, showed Beijing officials summoning companies to comply with the ban. The day after that, e-cigarettes were no longer available on Alibaba's Taobao and JD.com, two of China's most popular e-commerce platforms.
For years, the Chinese government allowed the lucrative e-cigarette industry to thrive with no supervision. There was never any consensus on whether e-cigarettes should be classified as tobacco, health or electronics products and which agency should regulate them. Part of the problem, too, is that China's top tobacco authority is both a regulator and a producer of cigarettes.
In an industry with low barriers to entry, manufacturers took advantage of this void. According to Tianyancha, a corporate database in China, the country has more than 9,500 e-cigarette companies.
Many of these brands have haphazard quality controls that have resulted in knockoffs, unsafe ingredients and vape liquid leakage, but the authorities have rarely policed these companies. In March, CCTV said eight e-cigarette companies made vaping oils with nicotine levels that were higher than what the package stated.
Alarmed by these reports, the government is set to force producers to comply with standards on ingredients and manufacturing, according to a draft viewed by The New York Times.
Once the "national standard" is enacted, companies would be required to provide details on the number and dosage of ingredients, put warnings on packages and devise ways of testing e-cigarettes to ensure compliance.
The process would increase production costs, industry experts say, and is likely to put many small e-cigarette exporters out of business.
But Ou Junbiao, head of the Electronic Cigarette Industry Committee of China trade group, said he welcomed the rules because they would give him clear guidelines. He said that previously many companies like his never dared to sell in China for fear of running afoul of the government.
"Once the national standard comes out, I can follow its targets and make big investments," said Mr. Ou, a former factory worker and owner of Sigelei, one of China's top e-cigarette exporters to the United States, in his office in Shenzhen. "I won't have to worry that something will happen, but now I don't know which day the sword would fall."
E-cigarette executives in China were unanimous in attributing the vaping-related illnesses in the United States to the use of THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, and vitamin E acetate. The majority of the American victims had vaped THC, but some say only nicotine was involved.
In Shenzhen, several vaping manufacturers have laid off workers, according to two labor recruiters.
At the Shanghai expo, Chen Lin, a sales manager for a company that produces parts of e-cigarette atomizers, said his company's sales fell 80 percent in the past month.
"We basically have no orders coming in this month after what happened in the United States," said Mr. Chen, who attended the expo to look for business partners.
Within China, RELX has become the dominant seller of e-cigarettes and controls 44.4 percent of the market for closed vaping systems, e-cigarette pens that come filled, according to data from Euromonitor. It has nearly $ 286 million in financing, according to its founder, Kate Wang, from major venture capital firms like Sequoia China.
Ms. Wang started RELX in 2017, after testing 20 e-cigarettes in the Chinese market and discovering they did not meet her expectations. She said she was motivated to help her two-pack-a-day father quit smoking.
Jiang Xingtao, whose title is "director of flavors" at RELX, said that while vaping was safer than smoking tobacco, the jury was still out on whether it is definitively safe.
He is collecting data in RELX's lab in Shenzhen to determine the risks and wants to run clinical trials, singling out the flavoring ingredients.
"We can guarantee that they are safe to be consumed through the stomachs, but is it safe enough to be absorbed through the lungs?" Mr. Jiang said. "To be honest, in this respect, neither we nor the industry has evidence that is particularly solid."

Texto completo: John R. Bolton, President Trump's former national security adviser, said he was breaking his silence -- on Twitter. But what he meant was that he was taking back control of his Twitter account. He kept quiet on Ukraine and impeachment.
WASHINGTON -- For weeks, Washington has waited to hear what he had to say. So when John R. Bolton, the president's former national security adviser, popped back up on Twitter on Friday morning with a teasing message, it sent the town, well, all atwitter.
"Glad to be back on Twitter after more than two months," Mr. Bolton wrote. "For the backstory, stay tuned........"
Was he finally going to describe his internal opposition to President Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine for damaging information about his Democratic rivals? Would he confirm that he called the whole thing a metaphorical "drug deal" and considered Rudolph W. Giuliani a "hand grenade who's going to blow everybody up"?
Sorry, no go. Over the course of the day, Mr. Bolton posted a few more messages -- not about the Ukraine matter that has propelled his former boss to the edge of impeachment but about his own two-month battle to "liberate" his Twitter account, as he put it, from a White House that refused to give it back when he resigned in September in a flurry of acrimony.
Anyone who knows Mr. Bolton should never have thought he would actually spill on Twitter. A Yale-trained lawyer, he has made clear he is waiting for a court to tell him whether he has to testify, relying on a lawsuit filed by a deputy that will be argued on Dec. 10. While former colleagues have issued public statements, Mr. Bolton's legal team believes making any public comments could be interpreted as waiving any claim of immunity -- he could hardly claim confidentiality with Congress and then tell all on Twitter.
But Washington got excited all the same. And Mr. Bolton seemed to enjoy the tease. He issued a handful of additional tweets, spaced out with hours in between, building up interest. Along the way, he attracted tens of thousands of new followers, topping 800,000 by the end of the business day.
"We have now liberated the Twitter account, previously suppressed unfairly in the aftermath of my resignation as National Security Advisor," he wrote. "More to come....."
Three hours later, he added: "Re: speaking up -- since resigning as National Security Advisor, the @WhiteHouse refused to return access to my personal Twitter account. Out of fear of what I may say? To those who speculated I went into hiding, I'm sorry to disappoint!"
Two and a half hours after that, he continued: "In full disclosure, the @WhiteHouse never returned access to my Twitter account. Thank you to @twitter for standing by their community standards and rightfully returning control of my account."
Mr. Bolton, it turned out, had turned over control of his personal Twitter account to the White House when he joined the National Security Council last year. An avid Twitter user since 2010, Mr. Bolton brought a strong following to the new job and wanted it back when he left. In fact, he used the account moments after leaving the White House in September to accuse the president of not telling the truth about his departure.
After Mr. Trump said on Twitter on Sept. 10 that he had fired him, Mr. Bolton tweeted 12 minutes later that that was not true. "I offered to resign last night and President Trump said, 'Let's talk about it tomorrow,"' Mr. Bolton wrote, without elaborating.
That was his last tweet until Friday. Shortly afterward, he discovered that he no longer had control of the account. The White House had evidently changed his password and his verifying email address.
"The White House attached software to the account," Mr. Bolton said by telephone on Friday. "They would not give it back. A representative of mine spoke with John Eisenberg, who said he would get it released, and it never happened. So finally we went to Twitter."
Mr. Eisenberg is the top National Security Council lawyer and himself a player in the Ukraine drama. It was not clear what kind of software Mr. Bolton was referring to, but it appeared related to government efforts to archive messages in keeping with presidential records law.
Mr. Trump denied freezing Mr. Bolton's account. "No, of course not. Of course not," he said when asked on Friday on "Fox and Friends." "No, I actually had a good relationship with John. We disagreed on some things and some methods, but I actually had a good relationship."
No one from the White House or the National Security Council would say on the record whether anyone else in the building refused to surrender control of Mr. Bolton's account or why. But an administration official who insisted on anonymity denied that the White House blocked him from gaining access to his account and said it would not know how to do that.

Trump's Long List of Inaccurate Statements on 'Fox &amp; Friends'

Texto completo: The president was wrong or misleading or exaggerated about topics related to impeachment, Ukraine and the Democrats, among other inaccuracies.
In a freewheeling 53-minute interview on Friday morning on Fox News, President Trump rattled off exaggerations, falsehoods and debunked conspiracy theories, often related to the impeachment inquiry. Many of them have previously been fact-checked by The New York Times and found false, including his claim that Ukraine, rather than Russia, was behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee in 2016; his accusation that the Obama administration wiretapped him; and his characterization of the whistle-blower's report as baseless. Here's a check of some of his newer assertions.
"He made up a phone call, and then when I released it, everybody was embarrassed."
False. Mr. Trump was referring to statements Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, made about the president's July 25 phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. But Mr. Trump's timeline is scrambled.
A day after Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the impeachment inquiry on Sept. 24, the White House released the reconstructed transcript of Mr. Trump's call with Mr. Zelensky.
The following day, Mr. Schiff opened a congressional hearing with a characterization of the transcript. He did not claim to be reciting from the White House transcript, but said he was conferring "the essence" of the conversation, "shorn of its rambling character and in not so many words."
So Mr. Schiff's account of the call came after Mr. Trump released the reconstructed transcript, not before, and while Mr. Schiff took some liberties in the way he recounted the July 25 call, his characterization generally stuck to the actual substance of the conversation.
Mr. Trump has at other times acknowledged that Mr. Schiff's account of the call came after the release of the transcript. At a campaign rally in October, he said Mr. Schiff "had to make up a fake conversation" because the transcript of the actual call was "so good."
"I know Ukrainian people. They're great people. But it's known as being the third most corrupt country in the world."
This is exaggerated. Mr. Trump has often claimed that he withheld military aid to Ukraine because he was concerned about corruption. The statistic he offered to prove this point, however, is not quite accurate.
Transparency International ranked Ukraine at No. 120 out of 180 countries in its 2018 Corruption Perceptions Index, which is based on 13 global data sources on development. Ukraine also ranked at No. 120 in 2017, but its score improved by two points. (The three most corrupt countries in 2018 were Somalia, Syria and South Sudan. Seven countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia had lower rankings than Ukraine.)
Mr. Trump's insistence that he was focused on corruption also lacks support. For one, he did not raise those concerns during his July 25 call with Mr. Zelensky or in an April 21 call. The Pentagon had also certified in May that Ukraine had "taken substantive actions" to root out corruption. The military aid to Ukraine was withheld in July and released on Sept. 11, but neither Mr. Trump nor his aides have specified what corruption improvements had been made in Kyiv in those two months.
"How about the guy with the telephone? How about that one? I guarantee you that never took place."
This is disputed. David Holmes, the political counselor at the United States Embassy in Ukraine, testified on Thursday that he had overheard a cellphone call between Mr. Trump and Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, in July. During the call, Mr. Holmes said, Mr. Trump had asked Mr. Sondland about Ukrainian investigations into his political rivals. Mr. Holmes testified that he provided an account of the call to his boss immediately afterward and also informed other colleagues at the embassy in Kyiv.
Though Mr. Trump insisted Mr. Holmes's account was wrong, Mr. Sondland said Wednesday in congressional testimony that he had "no reason" to doubt it, though he could not recall precise details of their conversation.
"It's true that the president speaks loudly at times, and it's also true -- I think we primarily discussed ASAP Rocky," Mr. Sondland said, referring to the American rapper who was charged with assault in Sweden around that time.
"Actually, actually, I would have been more surprised if President Trump had not mentioned investigations, particularly given what we were hearing from Mr. Giuliani about the president's concerns," he said, referring to Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer. "However, I have no recollection of discussing Vice President Biden or his son on that call or after the call ended."
"This was an Obama person. Wouldn't -- didn't want to hang my picture in the embassy."
This lacks evidence. The president was referring to Marie L. Yovanovitch, a career diplomat who served as the United States ambassador to Ukraine until he recalled her this spring. She had come under intense criticism from allies of Mr. Trump, including Mr. Giuliani and Donald Trump Jr., who helped spread accusations that Ms. Yovanovitch was insufficiently loyal to the president. She has become a witness in the impeachment inquiry.
Mr. Trump's remark about his portrait may have been drawn from an exchange between Representative Lee M. Zeldin, Republican of New York, and Mr. Holmes during closed congressional testimony last week.
Mr. Zeldin asked Mr. Holmes if it was true that there was no official portrait of Mr. Trump hanging inside the United States Embassy in Kyiv by August 2017. Mr. Holmes replied that he could not recall.
But the White House did not release the portraits of Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for distribution in federal facilities until Oct. 31, 2017. Lawyers for Ms. Yovanovitch disputed Mr. Trump's claim, according to the NBC reporter Geoff Bennett, and said the embassy in Kyiv hung his portrait, along with Mr. Pence's and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's, "as soon as they arrived."
Mr. Trump was also wrong to characterize Ms. Yovanovitch as an "Obama person." She has served as an ambassador under presidents of both parties. She was first appointed as an ambassador to Kyrgyzstan and Armenia by President George W. Bush and was sent to Ukraine by President Barack Obama.
"Nancy Pelosi's totally incompetent. She's lost, absolutely lost. She doesn't know what she's doing. She hasn't done anything. She can't get anything approved."
False. Mr. Trump has a point that the current divided Congress hasn't exactly been productive compared with years past, but he is wrong to say Speaker Nancy Pelosi has done nothing at all.
Congress has enacted 69 pieces of legislation into law since January, and about a dozen since the impeachment inquiry began, including a stopgap spending bill on Thursday. The House, for its part, passed or agreed to 568 bills or resolutions, more than 100 of which were acted upon since the impeachment inquiry began.
Ms. Pelosi, in a news conference on Thursday, highlighted a bipartisan resolution supporting pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong that passed both chambers but has not yet been signed by Mr. Trump. She also faulted Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, for failing to take up legislation passed by the House on background checks for gun purchases, anti-domestic violence, immigration and a host of other issues.
The White House and Republicans, for their part, have blamed Ms. Pelosi for holding up Mr. Trump's revised North American trade deal. Top Democrats said they have been making progress in negotiations with the White House, but no deal has yet been reached.
Here are some of the other inaccurate claims made by the president that The Times has previously fact-checked.

- He repeated his unfounded accusation that Mr. Obama had carried out "the modern-day version of whatever wiretapping may be" on his campaign. (No evidence has emerged since Mr. Trump first suggested it in 2017.)
-
He repeated the conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, had hacked the Democratic National Committee's computer server in 2016. (The theory has been debunked by a number of Trump officials in the hearings.)
- He claimed the F.B.I. "has never gotten the server." (They received forensics.)
-
He exaggerated when he said that European nations are not contributing aid to Ukraine. (They do contribute.)
- He hyperbolically described the aid sent by the Obama administration to Ukraine as "pillows and sheets." (Mr. Obama did not send lethal assistance but did send other defense equipment.)
-
He claimed to "hardly know" Mr. Sondland. (He complimented Mr. Sondland last month, and Mr. Sondland said they had spoken around 20 times.)
- He falsely claimed to have signed the largest tax cut in American history. (The 2017 tax cuts rank below at least a half-dozen others.)
-
He omitted the context in which Mr. Zelensky "brought up" and then criticized Ms. Yovanovitch on their July 25 phone conversation. (This happened only after Mr. Trump mentioned the ambassador.)
- He falsely claimed that the whistle-blower complaint "bore no relationship to my call." (It was quite accurate.)
-
He wrongly took credit for the Veterans Choice Act. (It was signed into law in 2014.)
- He falsely claimed China is currently paying the United States "hundreds of billions in tariffs," whereas before "we never took 10 cents." (The amount is $ 37.6 billion as of Wednesday, and tariffs on Chinese products have been previously imposed.)
-
He falsely claimed that China had its "worst year in 57 years." (The Chinese economy experienced its slowest growth rate in 27 years.)
- He falsely claimed that he "opened" a factory that makes Apple computers on Wednesday. (It's been operating since 2013.)

Texto completo: Also this week, guarding Arctic researchers from polar bears
Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. And, to keep up on climate news the rest of the week, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter .
Sometimes, Thanksgiving dinner comes with a side dish of climate denial.
Whether it's grumbling about "the climate hoax" from your parents, a sibling or that cousin you rarely see, it's time to get ready in case climate myths come up at the dinner table. Here are 10 resources to refresh your understanding of our warming planet.
Websites and Fact Sheets
Skeptical Science -- This stalwart's "Arguments" page lists 197 common myths about climate change ("It's the sun") alongside what the science actually says ("In the last 35 years of global warming, sun and climate have been going in opposite directions"). It's all backed by abundant research.
Climate Change: How Do We Know? -- With a multitude of visuals, and using language that you don't need to be a rocket scientist to understand, NASA dissects the evidence, causes and effects of climate change. You might want to bookmark the FAQ page.
The 12 Questions Every Climate Activist Hears and What to Say -- This PDF from The Climate Reality Project will arm you with evidence-based answers to the "most common arguments against man-made climate change."
Podcasts
The Origin of Climate Denial -- It's important to remember that climate change wasn't always questioned. This engaging episode of WNYC's "The United States of Anxiety" explores how we went from broad climate consensus to having a persistent denial movement.
Today I Learned: Climate -- You can't really argue with MIT scientists. Well, you can, but you'll probably lose. These nine bite-size podcasts from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology interview professors on topics like clouds, carbon pricing and geoengineering.
The climate crisis is an oceans crisis -- On a recent episode of his podcast, Ezra Klein, a co-founder of Vox, had a smart discussion with Ayana Elizabeth Johnson, a marine biologist, about the water that covers more than 70 percent of the planet and the hundreds of millions of people who depend directly upon it.
Videos
Why Climate Change Is Anti-Justice -- Talia Buford, a ProPublica reporter, offers an introduction to the subject of environmental justice on the PBS show "Hot Mess." Also worth a click: this video from its sister show "It's Okay to Be Smart" explaining where that "97 percent of climate scientists agree" statistic originated, and this video divvying climate science into 24 parts.
13 Misconceptions About Global Warming: Got six minutes? Then watch Derek Muller, host of the YouTube channel Veritasium and holder of a doctorate in physics education research, offer humorous rebuttals to more than a dozen common climate myths.
Short Books
The Madhouse Effect: In just 208 pages, the climatologist Michael E. Mann and the cartoonist Tom Toles dismantle climate change denial with the help of witty writing and cartoons.
What Is Climate Change? This 112-pager from Gail Herman, which made Yale Climate Connections' list of recommended books for children, will allow you to learn the science of climate change alongside your kids.
There you have it. You've got about a week before Thanksgiving, so study up.
As Jamie Margolin, the 17-year-old co-founder of Zero Hour, a youth-led environmental justice group, said: "It's the one-on-one conversations that are slowly but surely going to change the political climate on, well, the climate."

Scientists visit the Arctic. Local residents are curious.
Esther Horvath is a documentary photographer aboard the icebreaker Polarstern, which is frozen into the ice in the Central Arctic on a yearlong science expedition to better understand the region's changing climate. In preparing for the expedition, Ms. Horvath trained as a guard to protect researchers from polar bears.
My first shift as an armed polar bear lookout was on Oct. 12, before the permanent winter darkness set in. I was assigned to "Met City," a science station about 2,000 feet from the ship with equipment for making atmospheric measurements. There were 12 of us at the station that day.
After about 90 minutes, I and the guards at the other science stations received an order from the bridge to bring everyone back to the ship immediately. A polar bear and her cub had been spotted. (They had been seen in previous days, but not when people were on the ice.)
Polar bears, by the way, are the largest land carnivores on the planet. And they're not just big, they're surprisingly fast. They can run about 20 miles per hour and maintain that pace for a mile.
The bridge gave us the position and distance of the bears -- about 2,500 feet from the stern and moving toward us. We had two snowmobiles and two sleds, and made a quick return. All the other groups returned safely, too. I had to stay on the ice with the other guards until all the researchers had scrambled back aboard.
This was the expedition's first ice floe evacuation because of a polar bear visit.
On my second shift there was another evacuation, and in some ways it was even more stressful.
By then, we were living in the 24-hour darkness of polar winter. I was close to the Polarstern at another research station, the one we call Ocean City, where oceanographic measurements are made through holes cut in the ice.
Guarding Ocean City made me uneasy because the researchers were all inside a tent and I was standing alone outside on a top of a small ridge. I would rather have been closer to the scientists.
That day, conditions were different. It was very windy and minus 15 degrees Fahrenheit, or about minus 26 Celsius. Blowing snow, combined with light coming from the ship, made it difficult to keep a lookout for bears.
But, at least we had the wire. Not long after my first shift on the ice, a perimeter trip wire had been installed some distance from the ship. The idea was that any wandering bear would hit the wire, giving us early warning of a visit.
The wire made me feel more secure but I still had a strange feeling, standing alone in the darkness with only the lights from the ship to help me see.
Then, an alarm went off not far away. The wire had been tripped.
I radioed the bridge and told the scientists in the tent that they had to stop working and get back to the ship. My heart was pumping fast from a rush of adrenaline, but we made it back without incident.
A short time later some other guards went out to check the wire. It turned out that a gust of wind had tripped the alarm; there were no signs of a bear.
After these two experiences, I've served my polar bear duties on the bridge, keeping watch from there. It's a lot less stressful.

From the mailbag
One reader had some criticism for the One Thing column this week: "These ideas, while nice, are almost completely pointless in the face of climate inaction at the regulatory level."
It's true: Those smaller actions, by themselves, aren't nearly enough to solve climate change. But recent research shows they're far from pointless. In fact, they appear to be directly linked to systemic change.
It made us think we should remind everybody about an item we published in June: Don't Do Just One Thing.
"It can't just be one thing," said Patrik Sorqvist, research director of environmental psychology at the University of Gavle in Sweden, in the item from the summer. "It needs to be one thing and a complete transformation."
Thanks for reading and see you next week.

Mark Ruffalo takes on 'corporate criminality' in 'Dark Waters,' his new whistleblower film

Texto completo: Mark Ruffalo was shocked.
Apart from being an Oscar-nominated actor best known for playing the Hulk in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Ruffalo is also an environmental activist; he co-founded Water Defense in 2011 to raise awareness about the impact energy extraction has on water and public health.
And "The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare" had hit him hard. Nathaniel Rich's 2016 report for New York Times Magazine chronicled attorney Rob Bilott's fight to expose impact of the DuPont chemical company's release of PFOA, or perfluorooctanoic acid, which it had pumped as powder into the Ohio River near a West Virginia facility for decades, according to Rich's reporting. PFOA is a compound used in the manufacture of Teflon.
"You already have PFOA in your blood," Rich wrote. "It is in your parents’ blood, your children’s blood, your lover’s blood. How did it get there? Through the air, through your diet, through your use of nonstick cookware, through your umbilical cord. Or you might have drunk tainted water. "
Scientists, according to Rich's reporting, found a ‘‘probable link’’ between PFOA and ailments including kidney, testicular and thyroid cancers, as well as high cholesterol, preeclampsia and ulcerative colitis.
“I was just floored," says Ruffalo. "It’s like the biggest corporate criminality, spanning 50 years, no accountability, and no one knew about it. "
Ruffalo is working to change that with "Dark Waters" (in select theaters Friday before expanding Nov. 29 and showing nationwide Dec. 6), which he produced.
He also stars as Bilott, a environmental corporate defense attorney who spent years on PFOA as the work took its toll on his health and career.
"He saw the world as a jury of his peers," Ruffalo says of Bilott. "And (he believed that) once he laid out enough evidence and it was compelling enough, that they would decide to do the right thing. That’s how he handled everything, and it’s that kind of dispassionate, unemotional, empirical sort of one foot in front of the other until we get to where we need to be that was his ethos.
"As an actor, you want the big, dramatic moments. You want the juicy scenes. You want the moment where our hero gets to confront the bad guy and take him down, but that’s just not the nature of Rob and that’s not the nature of the story. "
Tim Robbins co-stars as Tom Terp, Bilott's supervising partner at the Cincinnati law firm Taft Stettinius and Hollister LLP, who provides Bilott with crucial support in contrast to the firm's history of representing chemical companies.
“That’s what spoke to me," says Robbins. "The man whose law firm represents chemical companies (takes) on a case that is holding a chemical company responsible for polluting the environment. This is not their wheelhouse, right?"
DuPont and Chemours, a former DuPont unit that spun off into its own company in 2015, arrived at a $670. 7 million settlement to settle 3,550 lawsuits related to the release of PFOA in 2017.
Terp and Bilott could, Robbins says, serve as guides for future change.
"It’s not like they’re your liberal reformers or anything, it’s people who go outside their own corporate culture to pursue something based on morality, based on right and wrong and not on profit margin," he says. "And quite frankly, it’s going to be up to people like Tom Terp to realize that morality in themselves and take risks and perhaps compromise their position of power or their livelihood to do the right thing. ”
Director Todd Haynes' film is firmly in the whistleblower cinema tradition that includes "All The President's Men" (1976), "The Post" (2017) and "Erin Brockovich" (2000).
But it also has plenty in common with Ruffalo's "Spotlight" (2015), which won best picture and earned Ruffalo a best supporting actor nomination. Both films are non-sensationalist, methodical examination of all of the work – legal in the case of "Dark Waters," journalistic in "Spotlight" – that goes into uncovering the truth.
"Dark Waters," with its exposure of DuPont practices, also serves as an inadvertent companion piece to "Foxcatcher. " That 2014 film starred Ruffalo as Olympic wrestler Dave Schultz, who was murdered in 1996 by chemical empire heir John du Pont.
Taken together, "Dark Waters" and "Foxcatcher" chillingly speak to the free reign our society has afforded powerful corporations and families.
“It is a corporate elite in America that basically because of economic reasons are given free hand to pollute, to dominate, to run amok," Ruffalo says. "Whether it’s John du Pont and his delusions of grandeur that came from a lifetime of privilege and money or it’s DuPont as a corporate entity who was a driving economic factor in American business.
"If all we value is the GDP of a country as a value of its health or well-being, then you’re going to have a lot more stories like the PFOA story and a lot more companies like DuPont who knowingly and willingly poisoned the world for pure profit and the almighty dollar. ”

Bloomberg was Chafee's fellow independent, Raimondo's 'political idol'

Texto completo: PROVIDENCE — Back in September 2010, then-New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg stepped into Providence's Biltmore hotel and greeted two future Rhode Island governors.
“I've left two parties, you've only left one," Bloomberg said as he endorsed Lincoln D. Chafee, then a fellow independent who would go on to win that year's governor's race.
Now, Bloomberg, a Democrat-turned-Republican-turned-independent, has returned to the Democratic Party, and on Thursday he filed paperwork to formally create a presidential campaign committee — inching closer to running.
Chafee, meanwhile, has tried to keep up with Bloomberg's party-switching pace: The Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat joined the Libertarian Party earlier this year, and he, too, is toying with running for president.
But Chafee wasn't the only future governor at the Biltmore that day: Gina M. Raimondo, then the Democratic candidate for general treasurer, showed up to meet Bloomberg before a news conference.
“He's my political idol," she explained at the time. “He's not partisan, and he gets things done."
Raimondo, who succeeded Chafee as governor in 2015, is now chair of the Democratic Governors Association. And as former Vice President Joe Biden prepares to come to Providence for a fund-raiser on Sunday, Raimondo is facing questions about which of the many Democratic candidates she will back in the presidential primary.
When reminded of her 2010 comments about Bloomberg in a recent interview, Raimondo said, “I was young then. 'Idol' may be a stretch. But he does get things done."
Raimondo praised Bloomberg's accomplishments in business and government, saying, “He is a practical problem solver, and he could probably go toe-to-toe with Trump because Trump pretends that he is a successful businessman when, in fact, we know he is a fraud and a failure. I think Mike could really take it to him."
But Raimondo noted Bloomberg would be making a late entrance in the race. “It's a big gamble," she said. “But look, I like him, and I think he is enormously talented."
So would she support Bloomberg if he runs? “We will have to see," she said. “We will get there when we get there."
Raimondo, whose tenure as Democratic Governors Association chair concludes at the end of this year, said she does not know when she will endorse a candidate. But she said, “I might wade in before the convention."
The 2020 Democratic National Convention is set for July 13-16 in Milwaukee. “You can be sure I am going to do everything in my power," she said. “I will get behind our nominee."
Raimondo also praised a new entrant in the Democratic contest — former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick. “I have enormous respect for Deval," she said. “I think he had a good record as a governor."
But she noted that Patrick, too, is getting in late. “It's very, very, very difficult at this stage," she said. “But he is a friend, and he has a great record to run on."
Raimondo acknowledged another friend, US Senator Cory Booker, is running. Booker and Raimondo's husband, Andy Moffit, were roommates at Yale Law School, and Raimondo graduated from Yale Law the year after Booker.
“I've known Cory for 26 years, and I adore him," she said. “Look, we have to win."
But what is the path to victory for Democrats?
On Monday, The New York Times quoted Raimondo in a story titled “How Moderates Are Seizing the Moment in the Democratic Primary."
“Clearly, factually, people who voted for Trump voted for our Democratic gubernatorial candidates," Raimondo is quoted as saying. She said Democrats could win those voters in 2020 with a “message of unity" and pragmatic promises on issues like health care and student debt.
In October, Raimondo went on “The Axe Files" podcast with former President Obama's chief strategist David Axelrod, and repeated a concern that some of US Senator Elizabeth Warren's views may not play well in a general election nationally.
“I worry about free this, free that, Medicare for all," Raimondo told Axelrod.
So does she believe Democrats need a moderate candidate to prevail?
“I am not running into people out and about talking about impeachment or who is too liberal or who is too moderate," Raimondo told the Globe. “It's like: Who can deliver for people around what really matters -- good jobs, affordable health care, and college debt. Getting stuff done. We will have to see who can do that."
Chafee, meanwhile, said Bloomberg was a good New York City mayor. “That is one of the hardest jobs in politics," he said. “He has energy and resources, so let the people in the Democratic primary decide."
But one potential obstacle is that Bloomberg is 77 years old. “Despite his energy and the fact his mom lived so long, the age factor is a tough one to overcome," the 66-year-old Chafee said.
Chafee said he is fascinated watching a fresh crop of Democratic candidates emerge. “There is a lot of unease out there," he said. “A lot of it has to do with the fervor of Democratic base to defeat Donald Trump."
Chafee said he has been following elections since 1960 and has never a second ballot for presidential nominees in either major party.
“But 2020 could be the year the Democrats have a second ballot -- or even a third, fourth, or fifth ballot," he said. “It's wide open."

Texto completo: Playhouses and troupes beyond Broadway generate $ 584 million in economic benefit. But dependence on volunteer labor is high.
Broadway has the bright lights. But the world of New York theater stretches far beyond Times Square.
A new study, commissioned by the mayor's office and released on Wednesday, finds that the city is home to 748 Off Broadway and Off Off Broadway theater organizations responsible for 3,000 jobs.
But there is also quite a bit of churn: The study reveals that more than 280 theater organizations were established in the city since 2011, while more than 100 closed.
The study was overseen by the office of media and entertainment, and conducted by the consulting firms BuroHappold Engineering and 3x3 Design.
It argues that small venue theaters -- the term it uses for the range of New York City theaters beyond Broadway -- have an outsize cultural influence, often nurturing risky work, and reaching a wider audience with more affordable tickets.
And it suggests a link between the nonprofit theater world and the growing production of streaming content in the city, noting that some of the same artists work in both areas.
The study calculates that theaters aside from Broadway are responsible for $ 584 million in direct annual economic output, and estimates $ 1.3 billion in "direct, indirect and induced benefits."
"Traditionally people have viewed this as a niche sector, but we found it's a significant contributor to the creative sector in New York City, and also a significant economic driver," said Anne del Castillo, the commissioner of the city agency.
And the study cites the success of recent shows such as "Hadestown" (first presented at New York Theater Workshop) and "The Band's Visit" (at Atlantic Theater Company), each of which eventually reached Broadway and won the Tony Award for best new musical, as well as "Hamilton" (at the Public Theater) and "Fairview" (at Soho Rep), each of which won the Pulitzer Prize for drama. ("Hamilton" also won the Tony).
Del Castillo said she was hopeful that the study would help spur greater support for smaller theaters from donors as well as patrons and government officials.
Not surprisingly, the study identifies two related challenges facing Off and Off-Off Broadway companies: money and real estate. In a dry nod to persistent low salaries for rank-and-file theater workers, the report observes, "Employees are frequently faced with unstable compensation structures in comparison to other cultural sectors, such as television, film or other media."
Among the study's findings:

- Of the 748 small venue theater organizations identified by the city, 97 present work at a regular location, 51 are part of larger organizations, and 600 are production companies -- nomadic nonprofits.

Most of the nonprofit theater venues are in Manhattan (and below Central Park), with 30 percent in Midtown and 15 percent near the East Village and Lower East Side.

Of the 748 small venue theater organizations identified by the city, 97 present work at a regular location, 51 are part of larger organizations, and 600 are production companies -- nomadic nonprofits.

Texto completo: Jim Kay's favorite part of drawing is right before he makes a mark.
"The best moment is a blank sheet of paper," he said. "Every line is a slight degradation of that ideal."
Kay, the artist behind the illustrated editions of the Harry Potter series, works long days and often into the night in a free-standing studio in the garden of his home in Sussex, England.
His cluttered work space contains virtually every artist's tool imaginable, and some unlikely props: metal scrapers from a dentist's office, which he uses to add details to clay models; insect specimens; a model skeleton; and leaves, branches, seeds and feathers that he collects. He uses those motley materials to build three-dimensional models of winged dragons, elves, goblins and trolls, which he then sketches.
"The problem with fantasy books is these things don't normally exist, so you have to create them to give them a sense of reality," Kay said.
In October, Scholastic released Kay's latest illustrated volume, "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire." He gave us a tour of his studio and explained his elaborate process.
What appealed to you about this studio space and this spot?
We're surrounded on all sides by National Trust land. It's amazing for wildlife. We have badgers and owls at night and rabbits and foxes during the day, and a huge number of birds.
What objects do you keep in your studio for inspiration?
Hares are my good luck thing. In every book I've done, there's been a hare.
When I was a bit younger, my brother lived out in the countryside. It was a hot summer day and I was lying in a cornfield and a hare appeared. If you're ever face to face with a wild hare, it's quite a strange experience. They're quite freaky looking. Ever since that, I've been very fond of them.
I've always drawn crows. They're straight from Edgar Allan Poe and Gothic horror, and I love them. They're beautiful things.
I've got a lot of toys I've been collecting for many years since I was a kid. I've never grown up, that's the problem.
You also have quite a few insect specimens, which show up a lot in your illustrations.
When I was a little boy I used to keep insects under my bed in ice cream tubs. I used to catch butterflies and beetles. I had an entomologist uncle who used to send me insects in the post. It's never changed. I've always drawn from the natural world.
You seem to collect little bits of flotsam from nature, leaves and twigs and seeds. How do you use them in your work?
I collect loads of leaves. I'm working on an illustration at the moment that's predominantly green. On the floor I have all these different leaves and acorns from oak trees around the garden. Everything is starting to turn into really beautiful autumn colors. I'm trying to get more colorful. I think in black and white and I've got to go past that, so I surround myself with beautiful colors to make me push myself a bit harder. Otherwise everything I draw will look like a movie from the 1920s.
How do you make these abstract splatter images, and how do they factor into your work?
I make random marks or splatters with inks. Your own drawing becomes very predictable and formulaic, so it's nice to have something that has a bit of chance. It's nice to have visual images that I've not created myself. I'd lost confidence in drawing and so I thought if I randomly made marks and shapes, then it's not my hand that's doing it, it's just randomness. So I collect textures and mistakes and splatter spots. Sometimes if I'm working on a painting and there's a piece of paper next to it that I use to clean my brushes on, I'll often get rid of the painting but keep that piece of paper with the brush marks. I love the way you're not consciously thinking of making a mark, and you get these beautiful effects where the color bleeds or breaks up. It throws something random into the mix.
When you're drawing imaginary creatures that doesn't exist, how do you make them look real?
You're trying to get people to buy into an alternative world. The more you can seat it in apparent reality, the better it works.
On a more practical level, it's much easier to draw if you have something in front of you. If it doesn't exist, I make it. If there isn't something in the wild or it's not in a museum, I'll try to make it out of clay or plasticene. I'm not one of those illustrators who can pull stuff out of my head, I'm afraid. I'm not that good.
You seem to have a lot of 3-D art material in your studio, modeling clay and fabric and models. How do you use those materials in your illustrations?
I really struggle with drawing, still, so it's great to have something in front of you. Particularly for lighting, I struggle with how shadows are cast. It's a difficult thing to do, to understand how a solid object casts a shadow in a landscape. The main thing is to give it a more sculptural feel, because drawing can be very flat and two-dimensional. I have trouble with that, so I'm trying to get more depth and a more sculptural feel to the drawing.
The people who do the best drawings I think are sculptors. If you look at Henry Moore's drawings of elephant skulls and the London Underground, they've got such a sense of weight and gravity to them. They look solid, like they are occupying space, which is very difficult.
As the illustrator of the Harry Potter novels, you have a unique challenge, because the movies are so popular and most people already have an image of the characters in their heads. Was that an obstacle for you in developing your own version of the characters, and how did you overcome it?
It was very difficult because I'm very fond of the films. The only way to do it was to start from scratch. I built the landscape first, really physically built it with models, so I built a model landscape for Hogwarts. After that, I recast the film and I used people I know. For Ron, Ginny and Molly who are the Weasleys, I used a real mother, daughter and son as inspiration for the illustrations. By dint of the fact that I've got a real family, I buy into my version. I cast people I know who fit the character. My niece is a perfect Hermione. It took about two years, but now I think of my world and not the film one.
Which character is the hardest for you to draw?
Harry by miles, I find him so difficult. Children are difficult anyway, because if you put a line out of place on a child's face you age them by about five years. But Harry, also because he wears glasses and glasses are a nightmare to draw. I've literally smashed up and thrown stuff across the room in frustration trying to draw Harry. He's very hard. I think because I've got a very particular idea of him in my head that I've never been able to execute the way I want it. Even though I've got a boy who models Harry for me, I still can't get him right.
How would you say your style has evolved over the years?
I haven't found a style yet. I'm desperately trying to find a style. I'm a bit worried.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Re "How Not to Kill an Animal," by Margaret Renkl (Op-Ed, Nov. 19):
As we enter another season, among many, that includes among its rituals the sacrifice of an animal (or several), Ms. Renkl makes a brilliant point: Instead of debating whether we should kill animals, let's at least agree how not to do it.
While we prattle on about how much we have to be grateful for, some of us kill with cruelty for the sake of fashion, or simply out of habit.
I suggest that we put thankfulness aside this year and concentrate instead on respect. Respect for those creatures that have as much right to be here as we do, and respect for the fact that they can and do suffer, just as we do.

Texto completo: The troubled office space company is slashing its total work force as it sells businesses and outsources some jobs.
WeWork said on Thursday that it was laying off 2,400 employees around the world, weeks after huge losses at the co-working company brought it close to financial collapse.
The layoffs are equivalent to nearly 20 percent of the 12,500 employees WeWork said it had at the end of June. The company is also expected to shed another 1,000 employees as it closes or sells divisions that are not part of its core business of subletting office space. Additionally, roughly 1,000 building maintenance employees will be transferred to outside contractors.
In a statement, a WeWork representative said, "The company is making necessary layoffs to create a more efficient organization."
Under its former chief executive and co-founder, Adam Neumann, WeWork went on a frantic expansion that saddled the company with large losses. The company lost $ 1.25 billion in the three months that ended in September, more than twice as much as the company had lost in the same period a year earlier. Concern about WeWork's finances and its unusual corporate governance forced the company to withdraw its initial public offering in September.
The pullback at WeWork is being overseen by Marcelo Claure, a senior executive at SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate that is WeWork's largest shareholder. SoftBank is now attempting a financial rescue of the company. It has invested $ 1.5 billion of new money in WeWork, but it is unclear how the rest of the bailout plan, which includes selling over $ 3 billion of new WeWork bonds to investors, is progressing.
WeWork's main business is leasing office space, fixing it up and then subletting the space to individuals and companies. Under Mr. Neumann, who stepped down from the chief executive post in September, WeWork also piled into other activities, including a private school in Manhattan and a rental housing business, WeLive.
Many WeWork employees held equity in the company and were hoping that the I.P.O. would deliver a big financial reward for the long hours they spent trying to turn the company into a new type of real estate giant. Employees expressed anger in a letter to management after learning that Mr. Neumann had received an exit package worth roughly $ 1 billion.
Starting next month, cleaning and facilities jobs at WeWork will be outsourced to JLL, a real estate services company, or one of its partners. WeWork told employees that every member of its cleaning and facilities teams would keep his or her job and receive similar pay and benefits. But those who don't transfer will lose their jobs and won't receive severance, according to a document provided to employees that was reviewed by The New York Times.
In its statement, WeWork said the laid-off employees would receive severance and benefits. "These are incredibly talented professionals, and we are grateful for the important roles they have played in building WeWork over the last decade," the statement said.
David Yaffe-Bellany contributed reporting.

Hundreds Gather for the 'Main Event'

Texto completo: Headnote LOCAL
"I WANT TO START by suggesting to all of you that we shouldn't be here."
That's how New York Times op-ed stafF editor and writer Bari Weiss began her address to the crowd at the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia's Main Event on Nov. 14.
By "here," Weiss clarified, she didn't mean the cavernous Verizon Hall at the Kimmel Center where the annual gala was being held. Rather, she meant that Jews existing in the world in 2019 is almost unthinkable, and maybe even miraculous. And for American Jews to have felt so secure for so long? It's been nothing less than a "holiday from history," Weiss said.
The theme of her speech gelled well with the theme of the evening, "Anti-Semitism and Security," and was echoed by the other Main Event speakers: Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia Board Chair Susanna Lachs Adler, President and CEO Naomi Adler and Main Event Co-Chair Marc Brownstein. They all spoke of the increasing need for Jewish communal security in Philadelphia and around the world.
Total revenue for the Main Event, including ticket sales and sponsorships, was $950,000.
Prior to the evening's remarks, which clocked in at just under an hour, nearly 850 community members gathered in several different areas throughout the Kimmel Center. In the main lobby, attendees were treated to sushi, dumplings and more, while elsewhere members of other Federation groups - the Joshua Society and NextGen - mingled at their own functions.
Outside, members of IfNotNow Philly protested Weiss' appearance.
Lachs Adler, the first speaker, emerged, as all speakers did, from the back of the stage through straight rows of potted trees. Lachs Adler compared the work of the Jewish Federation to that of a tree, putting down roots as branches stretch higher, providing all manner of nourishment arid comfort.
Agrande esta imagen.

But the phrase "Tree of Life," she noted, had taken on a much darker connotation in the past year. Last year's Main Event took place just a few weeks after the massacre at the Tree of Life building in Pittsburgh; this year's Main Event took place in the world shaped by it.
"These acts of violence will not become our new normal," Lachs Adler said. "If we are going to be ready for the community's most urgent needs, we need to be ready the day before those needs arise."
Lachs Adler's address was followed by a short video extolling the virtues of the Secure Community Network, the national security initiative of the Jewish Federations of North America and Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations.
Next up were the Main Event's co-chairs, Amy and Marc Brownstein, alongside Jamie and Warren Klein. Marc Brownstein, speaking on behalf of the group, told the crowd how much they all appreciated the chance to work on the event.
"Organizing this Main Event has been a special opportunity to learn and appreciate how much the Jewish Federation does to keep us safe," he said. Brownstein cited the recent thwarting of an attack on a synagogue in Halle, Germany, as evidence of what Jewish Federations can do for the Jewish world: The Halle synagogue's security system and training were subsidized by an international fund to which Jewish Federation contributed.
Finally, Weiss, who recently published the book "How to Fight Anti-Semitism," was introduced. She spoke with candor and vigor about the state of the American Jewish community, focusing especially on maintaining a balance between a particularistic sense of Jewish identity and an openness to allied outsiders. And she charted a course forward for American Jews through 10 broad ideas. She offered up the merits of totally subsidized Jewish day school, increased focus on Hebrew immersion and an end to the "boardroom" world of panel discussions as a substitute for action.
"What if the symbol of American Jewish life in the coming decades is the rally?" she asked.
Her overarching point was that all of her ideas - from incentivizing Jewish teens to go to college in Israel to empowering Mizrahi Jews - were meant to affirmatively combat anti-Semitism, rather than "play defense," as she put it.
"The way ahead, the way to build a world that is strong and safe and fulfilling for Jews, is by drilling down deep into our roots," she said.
Weiss' address was followed by a short speech from Naomi Adler, who thanked the evening's attendees for coming. "In these turbulent times, how inspiring it is to be with all of you as we take this moment to vow to be proactive and thoughtful," she said. "Not only to help make us physically secure, but to make sure we walk away from this event with a reservoir of strength." *

Texto completo: Con las fronteras del país cerradas y las fuerzas militares en máxima alerta, Colombia vivió este jueves una masiva jornada de protestas convocadas por opositores del presidente Iván Duque y su gobierno.
Las centrales obreras y movimientos sindicales que llamaron a la protesta lo calificaron como “paro nacional” y se registraron protestas en Bogotá y otras grandes ciudades como Medellín, Cali y Barranquilla.
Las protestas comenzaron con marchas pacíficas, si bien se produjeron enfrentamientos entre las fuerzas del orden y los manifestantes en algunos puntos del país.
En la capital, donde la jornada terminó con un cacerolazo, durante el día se registraron fuertes disturbios tanto en el centro como en el noroeste, donde algunos manifestantes intentaron dirigirse al aeropuerto internacional El Dorado.
Otros disturbios se produjeron en Cali, donde el alcalde, Maurice Armitage, decretó el toque de queda en la ciudad a partir de las 7 de la noche de este jueves tras los actos vandálicos registrados en varios puntos de la ciudad.
Debido a los disturbios y hechos violentos ocurridos hoy en la ciudad, el alcalde @MauriceArmitage ha decretado toque de queda entre las 7:00 p.m. de hoy y las 6:00 a.m. de mañana. Las personas que estén por fuera en este lapso, serán detenidas por las autoridades. pic.twitter.com/v69iEvrltp
— Alcaldía de Cali (@AlcaldiaDeCali) November 21, 2019
El gobierno implementó de forma previa una serie de medidas para evitar los disturbios en el país, entre ellas el cierre desde primera hora de este miércoles y hasta las 5:00 de la mañana del viernes de los pasos fronterizos de Colombia con Venezuela, Brasil, Ecuador y Perú.
Además se ordenó el acuartelamiento en primer grado (máxima alerta) de las fuerzas militares.
No obstante, se sumaron otros colectivos así como más reivindicaciones que hacen que desde 1977 no se viviera en el país tanta tensión por un paro nacional.
Duque, por su parte, ya en horas de la noche, se refirió a los “actos de violencia atribuibles a vándalos que no representan el espíritu de quienes marcharon”.
“Los hechos sucedidos con posterioridad a la marcha son vandalismo puro y no obedecen a una expresión de la voluntad popular”, aseguró el presidente.
El mandatario también afirmó que habían sido detenidos “decenas de criminales” a los que van a “aplicarles todo el peso de la ley”.
* Paro nacional en Colombia: por qué la protesta del 21 de noviembre genera tanta tensión
Y sobre el fondo de la protesta, aseguró que el suyo es un gobierno “que escucha y construye”.
“El diálogo social ha sido la bandera principal de este gobierno. Debemos profundizarlo con todos los sectores de nuestra sociedad y acelerar nuestra agenda social y de lucha contra la corrupción”, afirmó.
Estas son algunas de las razones de la protesta.
Las organizaciones sociales también reclaman al gobierno un mayor compromiso con la implementación del acuerdo de paz con las FARC alcanzado en 2016.
En particular, y relacionado con el punto anterior, critican duramente lo que consideran un incumplimiento por parte del gobierno respecto al punto 4 del acuerdo que habla de la sustitución gradual y voluntaria de los cultivos de uso ilícito por otras alternativas de subsistencia para las comunidades más pobres.
Esto, según los expertos, está contribuyendo a la crisis de inseguridad que vive población indígena en el país.
En abril de este año, Duque presentó seis cuestionamientos a la ley de la justicia para la paz , lo que le provocó una ola de críticas e incluso protestas callejeras.
Aquella decisión, que fue sugerida por Álvaro Uribe apenas unos días antes, provocó que defensores del acuerdo con la exguerrilla FARC acusaran al mandatario de “permitir morir la paz” y de ser tildado por columnistas como “subpresidente”.
* 5 claves para entender la grave crisis política en Colombia y por qué acusan a Duque de “estar dispuesto a dejar morir la paz”
Por otro lado, recientemente se han llevado a cabo operaciones contra la disidencia de las FARC . En la última, en un caso que estremeció a la sociedad colombiana, al menos ocho menores de edad (algunos medios hablan de 18) murieron en un operativo de las fuerzas de seguridad a un campamento guerrillero.
La muerte de los menores , incluida una niña de 12 años, un adolescente de 15 años y otra menor de 16, había sido ocultada por el gobierno -que solo había hablado de una impecable y exitosa operación- pero fue revelada en el congreso, costándole el puesto al ministro de Defensa Guillermo Botero.
* Guillermo Botero dimite en medio de la polémica por la operación militar en que murieron varios menores
Las críticas contra Botero se habían agravado en mayo pasado cuando un reportaje de The New York Times revelaba que el alto mando ordenó a los militares que doblaran “el número de criminales y guerrilleros que matan, capturan o fuerzan a rendirse en combate (y posiblemente admitiendo un mayor número de víctimas civiles)”.
Esto hizo recordar directivas similares que, durante el gobierno de Álvaro Uribe Vélez, condujerom a la ejecución por parte del ejército de miles de jóvenes que luego fueron presentados como guerrilleros, en lo que se conoció como los “falsos positivos”.
.
La combinación de estos factores han generado un clima de descontento con el gobierno de Duque, cuya popularidad pasa por sus horas más bajas desde su llegada al gobierno en agosto de 2018.
* Un año de Iván Duque en el poder: “Subpresidente”, la pesada carga del presidente de Colombia por ser el elegido de Álvaro Uribe
Una encuesta de la empresa Gallup correspondiente a octubre de 2019 ubicó el nivel de desaprobación de Duque en 69%, mientras que su aprobación era de 26%.
Por lo que este paro nacional representa, para Duque, una de las pruebas más difíciles hasta ahora en su mandato.

Texto completo: Mark Ruffalo plays a suddenly impassioned environmental attorney in "Dark Waters," a story that was his passion project; he took it to the director Todd Haynes, then served as one of the film's producers as well as its star.

* 'A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood'
* 'Frozen 2'
* 'Citizen K'
The subject is corporate malfeasance that results in environmental pollution on a massive scale over a long period of time. If that makes you think of Erin Brockovich chasing down the source of hexavalent chromium, think again. Instead of Julia Roberts's crowd-pleasing flamboyance there's Mr. Ruffalo's earnest, admirably serious portrayal of Rob Bilott, a real-life defense attorney for chemical companies who became an environmental crusader, in and out of court, after switching sides to go after DuPont Co., an industry supergiant, on behalf of a grievously wronged farmer in West Virginia.
Mr. Haynes, a notable stylist whose work is sometimes tinged with surrealism, was an improbable choice to direct this material, though a fine one, as it turns out. Like Rob, the film isn't flashy, but it is honorable, admirable and improbably stirring—for its hero's idealism and tenacity, for its devotion to detail and its straight-in-the-eye look at plain people living hard lives in a company town. (The cinematographer was Edward Lachman, Mr. Haynes's longtime collaborator. His work is first-rate, as always, though I wish he hadn't emphasized the region's grimness with a blue-skewed palette.)
The farmer, Wilbur Tennant, is played by one of the pre-eminent character actors of our day, Bill Camp. He's a study in coiled fury, as well he might be. When he and Rob first meet in 1998, Wilbur has lost 190 cows to an unknown something that causes deformities, aberrant behavior and rampant cancer, and he's been stonewalled in every effort to seek information. As Rob discovers through exhaustive, and sometimes exhausting, research, the villain—the physical villain—is perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, huge quantities of which DuPont has dumped in a landfill near Wilbur's property, even though the company has known for years that the substance is highly toxic.
One of the hallmarks of good corporate-malfeasance stories is that they ramify. Rob's case is a prodigy of ramification, from one rural landfill to a nearby stream to global pollution of water and air. Once the case advances to the discovery phase, DuPont swamps Rob in documents, delivering so many boxes of them to his office in Cincinnati that it looks like the archive at the end of "Raiders of the Lost Ark."
The script, based on a New York Times Magazine story by Nathaniel Rich, was written by Matthew Michael Carnahan (his credit reads "earlier screenplay") and Mario Correa. It's lucid, dutiful and inevitably sprawling—there's no easy way to structure a story that spans almost two decades before reaching a dramatic, and in this case dramatically financial, payoff. Anne Hathaway does as well as she can in the severely underwritten role of Rob's wife. But "Dark Waters" is Mr. Ruffalo's film, both in its gestation and execution, and his passion has been well served.

How could MLB's proposed cuts affect independent leagues?

Texto completo: With the recent news of the proposed changes from Major League Baseball, a handful of players throughout the minor leagues could be without jobs within a year.
The independent leagues, of which there are eight across the country, could be an option for those players affected by the possible changes.
The MLB has entertained the thought of making some sweeping changes to professional baseball at the end of the 2020 season. Reports of MLB cutting ties with 42 of its minor league teams arose during October. Over the weekend, a New York Times report released the list of teams that could lose their affiliation.
For those 42 teams that would be removed under the proposal, MLB suggests creating a "Dream League." This MLB-MiLB joint venture would resemble independent leagues in a sense.
Clubs in the Dream League could fill their teams with undrafted players. The players who go undrafted would have the option of going to the Dream League or to the independent leagues.
The York Revolution, an independent team in the Atlantic League, has carried players who have professional experience from season to season. Mark Mason, York Revolution Field Manager and Director of Player Personnel, doesn't see the Atlantic League being affected in a big way if the MLB makes the changes.
"If all of this does end up happening, I think most players who do not have much experience playing professionally will go to other independent leagues," Mason said. "The Atlantic League tends to carry players who have had experience in the majors or extensive trips in the minors."
Eric Menzer, President of the York Revolution, believes independent leagues could be the right move for players, if the proposal does go through.
"If one or more currently affiliated teams lose its affiliation, that provides an interesting opportunity to come join a team in the Atlantic League or any other independent league," Menzer said.
Unlike other independent leagues, the Atlantic League does not have classifications for its roster limitations.
"We can sign any player, regardless of their age or level of experience," Mason said.
In talking with other managers from different independent leagues, Mason heard a lot of concerns on where managers would get players from.
"From a recruiting standpoint, I don't think we will face any turmoil, but other leagues could certainly face some," he said. "With other leagues dealing with younger players and having classification levels, some managers could have some difficulties finding players.
Independent Leagues like the Frontier League have specific player eligibility limitations and different classifications that each team has to abide by.
"I think that players will take advantage of the Independent Leagues if this proposal goes through and it will be interesting to see how everything plays out," Mason said.
In his current role as president of an independent team, Menzer understands that there are some challenges being independent.
"There are advantages and disadvantages of not being affiliated," he said. Independent leagues pay their own players and the MLB doesn't. "I would say that is a disadvantage because that is something MLB does not have to deal with," Menzer said.
Being independent does give you full control of how you can run your team and decisions can be made at any time.
"We play to win so we have the ability to hire and fire our own players at any point during the season," Menzer said. "My job is to maximize the advantages and minimize the disadvantages."
On the thought of a possible expansion of current independent leagues if the proposal were to pass, Menzer believes there could be a possibility.
"I don' think you can look at the situation and say that there is anything but a possibility that there could be more independent teams in the leagues," he said. "I think that this whole situation is not going to turn out the way it's sitting right now; there is a lot of negotiation to be done."

Police Investigate Possible Hate Crime After Man Is Stabbed Near Synagogue

Texto completo: The police said the attack was under investigation and declined to say whether they believed it was a hate crime.
An Orthodox Jewish man was stabbed and slashed in a suburb near New York City on Wednesday morning, steps away from a local synagogue, and left bleeding on the ground, the police said.
The local police department said the attack was under investigation and declined to say whether they believed it was a hate crime.
Michael B. Specht, town supervisor of the suburb, Ramapo, which is in Rockland County, just north of Manhattan, said: "It's certainly a possibility the attack was a hate crime."
The stabbing was "an anomaly" in the town, Mr. Specht said, adding, "In the larger picture, it's hard not to think about other attacks on people in the Jewish community."
Police Chief Brad R. Weidel did not rule out that possibility at a news conference on Wednesday afternoon but was not, at that moment, "willing to say that this is a hate crime."
"Could it be a hate crime? Of course," he said, but noted that the police had "a legal obligation" to meet before making that determination.
Rockland County has more than 320,000 residents, according to census figures from 2018. More than 31 percent of those residents are Jewish, according to the state, which also says that Rockland has the largest Jewish population, per capita, of any county in the country.
Police officials gave few details about the attack, saying that information was still being gathered. The victim, who was walking to the synagogue, was approached from behind early on Wednesday and attacked by at least one person, the police said.
At about 5:49 a.m., officers responded to a call at Howard Drive in Monsey, which is within the town of Ramapo, and found the victim with multiple wounds.
It was "a vicious, violent attack," Chief Weidel said.
The victim, who has not been publicly identified, was taken to Westchester Medical Center, the police said. Mr. Specht said he was in critical condition.
Chief Weidel said the police were reviewing video from the nearby area but declined to release a description of any suspects. He said he needed time to confirm the details before releasing it publicly.
Aron Hershkowitz, a manager at the Toshnad Heichel Torah Utfila, said the attack was captured on two of the synagogue's 40 surveillance cameras.
Mr. Hershkowitz said footage from the cameras showed a vehicle stopping near a man walking toward the synagogue. Then, he says, someone hopped out from the driver side of the vehicle and attacked the person, who was beaten "for a few minutes" and left on the ground.
Minutes after the attack, Mr. Hershkowitz said a person came into the synagogue to alert them about the man on the ground, which prompted him to call 911.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said in a statement that he was sending members of the State Police Hate Crimes Task Force to assist in the investigation and "examine all potential motives, including whether the attack may have been motivated by anti-Semitism."
Mr. Specht said additional police patrols would be added throughout the area in response to the incident.
In 2016, the last year figures were available online, eight hate crimes were committed in Rockland County, three of which were reported by the police in Ramapo.
State Senator David Carlucci, whose district includes Ramapo, said in a statement, "This act of violence is horrific and not reflective of our peaceful community."
A $ 10,000 reward is being offered by the Anti-Defamation League in exchange for information that leads to an arrest and conviction in the attack. In a statement, Evan R. Bernstein, the New York and New Jersey regional director of the organization, called the attack "truly horrifying."
Mr. Bernstein said that people needed to condemn the attack and "also work as a community to stem the tide of hatred and violence." Michael Gold contributed reporting.

Texto completo: ATLANTA, Georgia — The top-tier Democratic presidential contenders and those fighting to stay in the 2020 White House race are set to clash during Wednesday night's November primary debate.
Front-runners such as former Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg will take jabs at each other from their respective podiums at Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta. Meanwhile, Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kamala Harris of California, and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, along with Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, businessman Tom Steyer, and entrepreneur Andrew Yang, will try to land punches from their spots on the wings.
Here are five moments or trends to watch out for during the fifth debate, co-hosted by MSNBC and the Washington Post, and moderated, for the first time, by an all-female panel:
Buttigieg has a target on his back
Buttigieg, 37, is surging in Iowa ahead of the opening nominating caucuses on Feb. 3, with 25% of likely Democratic caucus-goers telling pollsters for the Des Moines Register and CNN that the openly gay, married Navy veteran was their first choice to become the party's standard-bearer. The historically crowded field has swiped at Buttigieg in the past — first for, among other issues, his gun control rhetoric, for openly predicting the race will winnow to himself and Warren, and for using a stock photo of a Kenyan woman to promote his policies for black America. But his rivals are increasingly hitting him for his lack of experience as a "college town mayor," attacks in part motivated by the threat posed by his $23 million campaign war chest.
Warren is under assault for 'Medicare for all'
Warren, 70, was the prime target of her opponents the last time candidates convened on October's debate stage in Ohio, for failing to acknowledge the prospect of middle-class tax hikes under "Medicare for all." In the ensuing weeks, the former Harvard Law School professor released a plan outlining her proposal to pay for a single-payer system and how she wants to transition to it, including passing comprehensive immigration reform. Biden and Buttigieg, in particular, have sustained their criticism of Warren's plan on the trail. Sanders will likely continue to defend his signature platform if pushed to on Wednesday night.
Fireworks over "Medicare for all" represent a larger argument among the competitors, with many of Warren's more centrist counterparts taking umbrage with her call for the party to reject a "safe" nominee. She told Democrats in Iowa this month anyone who "tells you to dream small and give up early is not going to lead our party to victory." She and Biden, who turns 77 Wednesday, have exchanged barbs after the initial Consumer Financial Protection Bureau point person accused the 36-year Delaware senator of sticking up for health insurance companies, claiming he was running in the wrong party's primary. Biden was a non-entity during the last debate, so he may go on the offensive.
Impeachment proceedings
When the White House hopefuls walk out on stage, they will do so amid the House Democratic-led impeachment investigation into President Trump and hours after a key witness, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, testifies before lawmakers. While the majority of the field has come out in support of impeachment, the politics of the proceedings are still playing out, with different consequences for the primary and general electorates, especially for Biden as a central figure in the investigation.
Will Klobuchar continue her Minnesota mean streak?
Klobuchar's bid experienced a second-wind after the October debate when the 59-year-old dropped her "Minnesota nice" act and went after Warren. Though still trailing in national polls, the Midwest former prosecutor is looking to capitalize on a bump in public opinion in Iowa and New Hampshire. Simultaneously, Harris, 55, another ex-prosecutor who has also qualified for December's debate but has diverted staff from New Hampshire and Nevada to Iowa, needs a moment, as well, to salvage her presidential efforts. Unlike Klobuchar's blows aimed at Warren, Harris' confrontation of Biden in June over federally mandated busing received mixed reviews for coming across as premediated.
Gabbard's last stand
Gabbard, 38, has gained a reputation for her debate take-downs, first of Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan in June over Middle East foreign policy and Harris in July over her prosecutorial record. Wednesday is likely to be the Hawaii National Guard major's last appearance on a stage as the qualifying polling and fundraising criteria become more stringent heading into December. Booker, Steyer, and Yang additionally have nothing to lose given they are yet to cross the thresholds to participate in the next round, set to be hosted by PBS NewsHour and Politico at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles on Dec. 19.

Washington Post admits Ukraine interfered in 2016 election but attempts to minimize its effect

Texto completo: It’s virtually impossible to get anyone in the national media to concede that yes, Ukraine did interfere in the 2016 election for the explicit purpose of hurting President Trump’s campaign. And when one reporter finally does admit it, the result is comical, such as in this piece in the style section of the Washington Post last weekend.
The story, by Paul Farhi, looked at past articles written by reporter Kenneth Vogel, one in the New York Times and one in Politico, which have to do with conflict of interest questions swirling around Joe Biden and Ukraine’s 2016 meddling.
Farhi’s piece acknowledged that Vogel’s reporting on Ukraine “extensively detailed Ukrainian efforts to undermine Trump in 2016, such as publicly questioning his fitness for office, disseminating documents implicating Paul Manafort, his campaign chairman at the time, in corruption and helping a Clinton ally research damaging information about him.”
So doesn’t that settle it? Nope!
Farhi then went on to belittle Ukraine’s role in 2016, disparaging Vogel’s reporting for having “implied an equivalence with Russian efforts to undermine Clinton.” He was also sure to point out that Ukraine’s own particular interference wasn’t even close to “the type of hacking and disinformation campaign waged by the Russians in 2016.”
How’s that for a distinction without a difference? On the one hand, you have Ukraine’s government aggressively working to screw Trump’s campaign — so much so that one of its managers, Manafort, is now in prison because of those efforts — and on the other, you have Russia with “hacking and disinformation.”
Interference is interference. I know that the media prefer the kind that unsuccessfully attempted to keep one candidate — Trump — away from the White House, but that doesn’t make the interference on behalf of the other candidate any better, cleaner, or fairer.
If that were the case, reporters would have to admit that some foreign interference is fair. Any takers?

Jesse Wegman: Col. Vindman’s America is something Trump knows little about

Texto completo: As the House of Representatives’ impeachment inquiry enters its second week of public hearings, a recurring theme has emerged: Veteran government officials, conditioned by years of training to believe that America’s leaders act solely in the best interests of the nation, come to understand only reluctantly what now seems beyond question — that President Donald Trump and his henchmen spent months carrying out a secretive nearly $400 million extortion plot against the new Ukraine government to help him win re-election in 2020.
On Tuesday the part was played by Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the White House’s top Ukraine expert, and Jennifer Williams, a foreign policy adviser to Vice President Mike Pence. Vindman and Williams represent an increasingly endangered species in Trump’s Washington, a world populated by grifters, self-dealers, liars and cheats who look at political power and see personal gain.
In contrast, dedicated public servants like Colonel Vindman and Williams speak in sincere and personal terms of their allegiance to the country and the Constitution they had sworn to defend. Both listened in on the July 25 call between Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s new president. Both were alarmed by what Trump said.
“I couldn’t believe what I was hearing,” Vindman said of his reaction to hearing Trump tell Zelenskiy “to do us a favor, though,” by investigating Joe Biden and his son Hunter for alleged corruption.
“Without hesitation, I knew that I had to report this to the White House counsel,” the colonel said. “It is improper for the president of the United States to demand a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen and a political opponent.”
Williams, who said she had listened to about a dozen calls between presidents and other world leaders, called the conversation “unusual,” explaining, “I thought that the references to specific individuals and investigations, such as former Vice President Biden and his son, struck me as political in nature, given that the former vice president is a political opponent of the president.”
Republicans tried to dismiss Trump’s call for investigations of the Bidens as a harmless request. Vindman shot that down quickly. “The culture I come from, the military culture, when a senior asks you to do something, even if it’s polite and pleasant, it’s not to be taken as a request, it’s to be taken as an order.”
Especially given the power disparity between the United States and Ukraine, Vindman said, it was clear that Zelenskiy wasn’t being given a choice. Slowly it dawned on the colonel that Trump’s true interest was not defending Ukraine against Russian aggression or helping it shake off its long history of official corruption — both long-standing and bipartisan U.S. foreign policy goals.
“It was probably an element of shock that maybe in certain regards, my worst fear of how our Ukraine policy could play out was playing out, and how this was likely to have significant implications for U.S. national security,” he said.
It didn’t help Trump’s case that Kurt Volker, the former top envoy to Ukraine and one of the Republicans’ own witnesses, on Tuesday afternoon dismissed the claims of corruption by the Bidens as conspiracy theories.
Without any substantive defense of the president’s behavior, Republicans did all they could to deflect. They called the hearings a circus. They demanded to know the identity of the whistleblower — even though they previously complained that he had not listened to the July 25 call, and two people who had heard the call were sitting right in front of them. They criticized the media.
They continued to push the idea that Trump is genuinely interested in rooting out corruption. That was never plausible to begin with. But it became even harder to sustain in light of the fact that anti-corruption measures were on a list of talking points prepared for Trump both times he spoke with Zelenskiy, and both times he failed to raise the issue at all. (And as Rep. Eric Swalwell noted, the Pentagon had certified that Ukraine had met its anti-corruption requirements for receiving the military aid before Trump withheld it.)
And Stephen Castor, the staff lawyer for the Republicans, darkly insinuated that Vindman harbored dual loyalties to the United States and Ukraine, because a Ukrainian official had repeatedly offered him the job of secretary of defense. Vindman acknowledged the offers and laughed them off; the Ukrainian official later said he had been joking.
It was a particularly repulsive line of attack in light of Vindman’s opening remarks, in which he addressed his father, who escaped the Soviet Union with his family when the colonel was a young child, in the hope of a better and safer life in America. “Do not worry, I will be fine for telling the truth,” Vindman reassured his father. When Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney later asked him why he had said that, he replied: “This is America. This is the country I’ve served and defended. That all of my brothers have served. And here, right matters.”
The gallery burst into applause while Republicans sat and stewed. Perhaps they were reflecting on another part of Vindman’s opening statement, in which he said that the testimony he was about to give “would not be tolerated in many places around the world,” specifically Russia. If the exasperated Republicans had their way, it wouldn’t be tolerated here, either.

Parker: Haley's comet just fizzled

Texto completo: and blew it.
Nikki Haley, former South Carolina governor - and more recently the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations - sandblasted her carefully crafted facade and, in a transparent act of virtue signaling, stabbed two of her former colleagues and fellow Cabinet members between the shoulder blades. Her return to the public stage can best be described as a goddess ex machina, whereby she descended from the upper realms to dispense wisdom and hurl thunderbolts into the hearts of any who would deny her.
No one did. Indeed, for the past several days, Haley and her just-released memoir, "With All Due Respect: Defending America With Grit and Grace," have been the talk of the town. News shows have homed in on a single allegation that seems to have been designed to produce TV teasers about "shocking revelations" - that Rex Tillerson, former secretary of state, and John Kelly, former White House chief of staff and a retired Marine Corps general, had tried to undermine President Trump and asked Haley to help.
More to the political point, Haley essentially launched her next act - possibly as Donald Trump's vice-presidential running mate (with all due respect to Mike Pence), or as a 2024 presidential candidate. Like clockwork, the president tweeted kudos and encouraged followers to buy the book.
Whatever her ultimate motive, Haley clearly decided that stepping on Tillerson and Kelly was in her political interest. There can have been no other reason to drag these two honorable, accomplished men through the mud for, by her own account, trying to mitigate some of Trump's more-destructive impulses.
Rather than sign on, Haley claims to have been offended by this conspiracy of good intentions. In her book and in several recent television appearances, her halo blindingly bright, Haley has said that Kelly and Tillerson thought they were aiming to "save the country" by attempting end runs around Trump.
They wouldn't have been the only ones, according to last year's anonymous op-ed in the New York Times in which the author similarly claimed that White House staffers and officials have been trying to save the country by working within, sometimes against the president's expressed wishes, which can change in a flash.
The resurfacing of these claims - and the anonymous author's new book - could help explain why good men and women continue to enter this decidedly dysfunctional White House. Being inside the White House may be a better position from which to manage the beast within.
It's a pickle. Do you ignore an immature president and take turns plugging the hole in the dike? (Hey, Haley, we could use some help over here!) Or, do you do everything in your power to avoid actions that might cause the dike to crumble? One thing you don't do, obviously, is confide in an unscrupulous, self-serving, future presidential candidate.
Haley's loyalty to Trump at the expense of Tillerson and Kelly is both a hat-tip to Trump's base and a curtsy to the president. She plainly made a political calculation that people would find "her truth" courageous and that flattery aimed at Trump would not be wasted. "To undermine a president is really a very dangerous thing, and it goes against the Constitution and it goes against what the American people want," Haley intoned during a CBS News interview.
This would be true if said president weren't almost daily threatening to destroy order in the civilized world and didn't behave as though he were checking off the characteristics of narcissistic personality disorder. But there's an inherent irony in banking one's future on preaching loyalty through disloyalty. To what end does such a revelation, if true, warrant such tongue-wagging?
Alas, it seems that Haley, whom I've admired since before she became governor, bought her own myth and sold it cheap. Through her preening virtue, she has revealed herself to be more Lucy from "Peanuts" than Erin Brockovich - a cartoonish fussbudget stumping for blue ribbons and bows rather than a whistleblower acting in the service of the greater good.
Sad.

Texto completo: The extent to which the defense of press freedom has been a bipartisan concern is suggested by the fact that as a member of Congress, Mike Pence served as the co-chair of the Freedom of the Press Caucus — along with Adam Schiff.
"If you believe in limited government, you understand that the only check on government power in real time is a free and independent press,” Pence said on the floor of the House in 2005, when he was pushing for legislation to protect journalists and their sources.
Today, of course, Schiff is leading the congressional impeachment hearings against President Donald Trump, and Pence is the vice president in an administration that has waged a relentless war on the press.
Trump’s attacks on the news media, while divisive and polarizing in the United States, are doing far worse damage in places around the world where authoritarian governments are jailing journalists in record number or, as was the case with Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, murdering them with impunity.
Pence and press freedom winners
On Monday, I went to see Vice President Pence with a group of courageous journalists from Pakistan, Nicaragua, Tanzania, India and Brazil. These journalists were in the United States to receive press freedom prizes from the Committee to Protect Journalists, the organization I lead. We are honoring them for putting their lives on the line to bring us the news.
The journalists shared a variety of experiences. Neha Dixit described the onslaught of hate she has endured in India about publishing stories on sex trafficking and other sensitive issues. Patrícia Campos Mello, who has reported on alleged corruption in Brazil, said President Jair Bolsonaro has emulated Trump’s rhetoric, unleashing a torrent of online death threats and harassment. Bolsonaro even went so far as to cancel the government’s subscription to her publication, Folha de S. Paulo, after Trump banned The New York Times and The Washington Post from the White House.
Northwestern journalism dean: 'Give the young people a break' in the Sessions story
Several of the journalists raised concern about the proliferation of laws criminalizing “fake news” and the ways these laws are used to target critical media.
Zaffar Abbas, the editor of the Dawn, one of Pakistan’s top newspapers, called on Pence to stand up for journalists working in developing democracies around the world.
Meanwhile, Miguel Mora and Lucia Pineda, who were jailed in Nicaragua in reprisal for their critical reporting, thanked Pence for the support they had received from the U. S. government, which they said helped get them out of prison.
Impeachment keeps leaders apart
The vice president was deeply engaged by these stories and reaffirmed his commitment to press freedom. That’s important, but the reality is that the impeachment inquiry is polarizing, and it’s hard to imagine our political leaders coming together again to defend this critical principle.
That’s why the American people should.
Regardless of how you feel about the impeachment proceedings, many Americans are glued to the news, and we want to know and understand what’s transpiring in Washington. That’s the role of a free press, which is facing new challenges in this country, from the decline in local news to legal action targeting journalists’ sources.
This month, along with our partners at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and more than 40 media organizations around the country, we launched a new campaign called Protect Press Freedom. The campaign seeks to educate Americans about the threats to press freedom, celebrate the diverse journalism that keeps the public informed and mobilize citizens to stand up for freedom of the press — no matter what news is important to them.
There’s another reason that we are calling on all Americans to stand firm for press freedom, and that’s to bolster journalists around the world who work without the protection of the First Amendment. Their reporting not only informs their own societies but also reaches a global audience. The journalists who met with Vice President Pence told him they would like the United States to be an ally and an inspiration. He seemed to get this. Let’s hope he can persuade his boss.

Jackson mayor
Minor league baseball could be in for a drastic change after MLB made a proposal to cut affiliation with 42 minor league teams, including the Jackson Generals.
It was first reported on Oct. 18 by Baseball America reporter J.J. Cooper that the MLB has proposed eliminating 25% of its minor league teams to increase pay, improve transportation between games and improve the working conditions for players.
On Saturday, the New York Times released a list of the 42 teams that could be on the chopping block, which included four AA baseball teams: Binghamton Rumble Ponies, Chattanooga Lookouts, Erie Seawolves and Jackson Generals. No AAA teams were on the list.
On Monday, the Jackson Sun confirmed with the MiLB — the organization that operates minor league baseball — that the Generals were on this list.
"MLB's list was apparently made after looking at a combination of factors, some of which are the location of the team and how far away other Southern League teams are located, the quality of the ballpark and proximity to each team's major league affiliate," Jeff Lantz, MiLB senior communications director, said.
MLB agreements with its minor league affiliates are up in 2020, the same year that the Jackson Generals lease agreement with the city of Jackson ends.
"Minor League Baseball has assured us that they have no intention of allowing this contraction to take effect," Jackson Generals GM Marcus Sabata said in a press release. "Both MLB and MiLB have both acknowledged that negotiations are in the early stages, are primarily focused on facilities and player care issues, and that any adjustments will take place in 2021."
Sabata and Jackson Generals owner David Freeman declined the Jackson Sun request for an interview.
Freeman also owns a second minor league baseball team in Florida, which is also on the list of 42 teams. His Florida team recently accepted a buyout to move from its current location in Osceola County.
Jackson Generals uncertain future An article published by the Jackson Sun in July showed that Jackson is spending over $1 million per year for the last eight years to keep Generals in Jackson. It was also reported in October that West Tennessee Healthcare was pulling its $65,000 sponsorship from the team because of its uncertain future.
"We are aware of the situation and are monitoring it closely," Jackson Mayor Scott Conger said. "It has no effect on us fulfilling our current contract obligations."
Conger did not respond to the Jackson Sun's question on whether he has begun negotiating a new lease agreement with the team.
"I am confident that the Jackson Generals, the City of Jackson, Congressional leaders and MiLB will do all that is necessary to make sure we continue to provide quality family entertainment in West Tennessee for years to come," Sabata said in the release. "In the interim, we will work closely and quickly with the city to ensure that the Ballpark at Jackson maintains its status as a premier Southern League facility."
The Generals are the minor league affiliate for the Arizona Diamondbacks. The team has won the Southern League Championship for three of the last four years, including this year.
The Southern League has three teams each from Tennessee and Alabama , and two each from Mississippi and Florida.

The debate is 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. Eastern time. It is being held in Atlanta and co-hosted by MSNBC and The Washington Post.
There will be no opening statements. Candidates will have 75 seconds to answer questions from the moderators: Rachel Maddow of MSNBC, Andrea Mitchell and Kristen Welker of NBC and Ashley Parker of The Washington Post. Each candidate will have 45 seconds for rebuttals or follow-ups, as well as a 75-second closing statement.
The New York Times will have extensive debate coverage, including a live analysis throughout the event.
Ten Democratic presidential candidates will take the debate stage in Atlanta on Wednesday night, but the spotlight is likely to follow two contenders who have risen to the top of polls over the last several months: Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.
Here is what to watch for as the candidates debate:
How will Warren handle jabs from her rivals?
Last month in Ohio, Ms. Warren took incoming fire from four different rivals. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mr. Buttigieg led the attack against her health care proposals, Senator Kamala Harris of California made a disjointed plea for Ms. Warren to sign onto her call for Twitter to ban President Trump and Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii demanded to know how Ms. Warren was qualified to serve as commander-in-chief.
Since then, Ms. Warren has seen her polling position diminish as she has sought to explain how she would finance "Medicare for all" beyond the "I'm with Bernie" line that she offered earlier in the campaign. But the attacks against her haven't stopped. She remains a useful foil for Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg -- along with Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota -- as they jostle to be the standard-bearer for the party's moderate wing.
Ms. Warren has shown no indication she's willing to give ground. During a speech to Iowa Democrats this month she used the word "fight" 21 times in 12 minutes. Her argument that the party will lose to Mr. Trump if it nominates a candidate who fears her bold proposals has become central to her campaign stump speech.
Expect both dynamics to be on full display in Atlanta, though this time Ms. Warren will be prepared to defend Medicare for all in a more detailed fashion than she has demonstrated to date.
The Pete pile-on is coming
For weeks, aggravation about Mr. Buttigieg among his rivals has been simmering. It's about to boil over Wednesday night.
With the 37-year-old holding a commanding first-place position in the latest Des Moines Register poll, his opponents are ready to attack him.
Ms. Harris said Mr. Buttigieg would "have to answer" for using a stock photograph from Kenya to illustrate his plan for African-Americans on his campaign website. Ms. Klobuchar has taken her quiet asides about his lack of experience to the Sunday talk shows. And Ms. Warren dismissed Mr. Buttigieg for running a "consultant-driven campaign with some vague ideas that are designed not to offend anyone."
At the same time, the volume of opposition research being pitched by rival campaigns about Mr. Buttigieg has increased, focusing on 9-year-old friendly remarks about the Tea Party and his stewardship of the municipal government in South Bend.
In previous debates, Mr. Buttigieg has easily parried attacks from his rivals -- that task will become tougher as scrutiny on him increases.
Will Bernie Sanders finally pressure Warren?
While Ms. Warren laid out a plan last week to pass a full Medicare for all system by her third year in the White House, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said he'd get it done right away.
"I will engage that struggle on day one of my administration," Mr. Sanders said Friday in California. "Not put it off for several years."
Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, long ideological partners, have mostly avoided direct conflict on the campaign trail. But the Medicare for all issue affords each of them an opportunity to create political distance. Mr. Sanders can once again brand himself as the purest advocate for his political revolution. Ms. Warren, meanwhile, will have to navigate between appealing to the party's most progressive voters and not frightening away moderate Democrats by tying herself too closely to Mr. Sanders.
Medicare for all who want to debate about it
The Democratic differences on how to fix America's health care system have consumed much of the airtime in debate after debate, and the coming clash in Atlanta is expected to be more of the same.
In the last debate, Ms. Warren was hammered for lacking her own Medicare for all plan. She has since rolled out a comprehensive package that more moderate Democrats, like Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg, have said is unrealistic and unworkable. Mr. Biden has used health care to raise other questions about Ms. Warren, calling her an elitist with a "my way or the highway" approach to governance.
Mr. Buttigieg has been advertising in Iowa to promote his "Medicare for all who want it" approach, which Ms. Warren has said will not fundamentally fix the system. The recent Des Moines Register/CNN poll showed how divided the party is on the topic, with 36 percent favoring a Medicare for all plan that eliminates private insurance, 34 percent wanting a "public option" and 20 percent saying they preferred restoring provisions in the Affordable Care Act.
A split-screen on impeachment
Midway through the second week of impeachment gobbling the entire Washington news cycle, the presidential candidates would still rather talk about almost anything else.
Yet it seems implausible -- if not impossible -- for Wednesday night's debate moderators to avoid asking the White House hopefuls about the House inquiry unfolding daily on live television.
But what can the candidates say at this point? They're all for impeaching Mr. Trump. But while they know that wanting the president removed from office is the cost of entry for the Democratic primary, voters would much rather see a discussion about the sort of issues that are central to their daily lives: health care, climate change and the economy.
Even Tom Steyer, the California billionaire who spent years on a campaign calling for Mr. Trump's impeachment, is talking about other issues on the trail.
So expect to see the moderators quiz the candidates about the latest developments from Washington, as they then pivot to something else.
Can Kamala Harris recover?
Things are not going well for the California senator. Since the last debate, she has shuttered her New Hampshire offices. She has laid off staff and shifted resources from her Baltimore headquarters to Iowa. And she has continued a slide in the polls, which now show her closer to the bottom tier than to the top.
The challenge is that Ms. Harris has already delivered one of the most memorable debate moments of the primary -- her takedown of Mr. Biden on busing -- but the bump she received quickly faded.
She has since turned her focus on Mr. Trump in one debate, and challenged Ms. Warren to call for kicking the president off Twitter in another. She does not have a signature policy focus -- she has called to cut middle-class taxes as a top priority -- that seems ripe to pop. It is not clear what tack she will take on Wednesday evening (she could be among the many ready to pile onto Mr. Buttigieg), but the pressure to perform is strong.
The debate will take place at Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta on Wednesday. (PHOTOGRAPH BY Ruth Fremson/The New York Times FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)

Texto completo: The former Knick and 10-time All-Star joins a team off to a disappointing start after a run to the Western Conference finals last season.

Carmelo Anthony, who has not played in the N.B.A. since November 2018, officially joined the Portland Trail Blazers on Tuesday.
Anthony signed a one-year, veteran minimum contract, according to a person with knowledge of the deal who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. If Anthony is on Portland's roster beyond Jan. 7, his $ 2,159,029 salary -- pro-rated from the full veteran minimum of $ 2,564,753 for the portion of the season Anthony has already missed -- becomes guaranteed.
He made his Blazers debut on Tuesday night in New Orleans, scoring 10 points on 4-of-14 field-goal shooting (2 of 3 from 3-point range) and grabbing four rebounds while playing 24 minutes in a 115-104 loss. He was in the starting lineup and, as expected, wore the jersey No. 00. Anthony wore No. 15 with the Denver Nuggets and No. 7 for the Knicks, Thunder and Rockets.
"Carmelo is an established star in this league that will provide a respected presence in our locker room and a skill set at a position of need on the floor," Neil Olshey, Portland's president of basketball operations, said in a statement.
The Blazers, coming off a trip to the Western Conference finals last season, are a disappointing 5-10 after their loss to the Pelicans on Tuesday, and they have turned to Anthony, 10 times an N.B.A. All-Star, to try to add scoring punch to a depleted frontcourt. Zach Collins (shoulder) and Jusuf Nurkic (leg) are out with long-term injuries.
Anthony, 35, has been looking for a job to resurrect his N.B.A. career for more than a year. The Rockets used him in only 10 games last season before essentially banishing him from the team until they could trade him to Chicago in January, having decided that his game was a poor fit. The Bulls released Anthony after the Jan. 22 trade without even bringing him to Chicago.
"The last year and a half has just been like an emotional roller-coaster," Anthony said in a YouTube video.
Portland's star guards, Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum, lobbied Anthony to push for a trade from the Knicks to the Blazers in the summer of 2017, but Anthony later told The New York Times that he considered a move to the Pacific Northwest to be too far away from his family. Anthony opted instead to waive his Knicks no-trade clause to facilitate a trade to Oklahoma City, then spent one season with the Thunder before they dealt him to the Rockets.
"I always kept my eye on Portland," Anthony said in the video. "It just didn't work out at other times. Now it seems like a perfect opportunity."
Anthony won the N.B.A. scoring title in 2012-13 by averaging 28.7 points per game. That was the last season that the Knicks made the playoffs.
In recent years, though, Anthony's defensive deficiencies and offensive limitations raised fears that he would not get another chance in the league after his doomed stint as a Rocket. He is considered much more effective as a scorer when used in isolation plays rather than as a catch-and-shoot option on the perimeter as most teams prefer in the modern game, but the Blazers do use plenty of isolation schemes.
"It will only work if all parties see it the same way," Anthony said.
LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers expressed support for his friend's comeback last week, telling local news reporters: "He belongs in this league. I'm happy the Blazers gave him an opportunity. He'll make the most of it. We'll see what happens. I'm just happy he's back in the league."
Of the 19 players in league history with at least 25,000 career points and more than 6,500 rebounds, only four have not won an N.B.A. championship: Karl Malone, Dominique Wilkins, Alex English and Anthony.

No more hitting snooze, America

Texto completo: Since I became The Washington Post's media columnist in 2016, I've developed a habit of asking people, wherever I travel, how they get their news.
In keeping with that, I had a brief chat last weekend in Sarasota, Fla., with a middle-aged man (a local used-car salesman, he said).
'Pretty much just from here,' was how he answered my question, indicating his smartphone. When I dug for specifics, he mentioned Fox News.
The impeachment hearings, which that day had offered riveting testimony from diplomat Marie Yovanovitch? He merely shrugged: Didn't know, didn't care.
That plenty of Americans share this apathy about what's happening in their government is appalling, but hardly shocking.
Many clearly do care, as the movement of public opinion favoring impeachment suggests, but there's a whole category that pollsters and pundits call 'low-information voters.'
The New York Times published a story Monday with this headline: ' 'No one believes anything': Voters Worn Out by a Fog of Political News.' The reporters quoted a Wisconsin woman who said she didn't know what to think of the various conflicting claims she'd heard about President Trump's apparent abuse of power.
'You have to go in and really research it,' she said, and she doubted that many people cared enough to do that.
David Roberts, writing in Vox this week, explored 'tribal epistemology' " the idea that 'what's good for our tribe' has become more important than facts, evidence and documentation. He identifies a crisis that 'involves Americans' growing inability, not just to cooperate, but even to learn and know the same things, to have a shared understanding of reality.'
Roberts, the Times article and Florida Man all point to the same thing: A lot of Americans don't know much and won't exert themselves beyond their echo chambers to find out.
This is the way a democracy self-destructs.
And what's more, it's not that difficult for American citizens to do much, much better.
Granted, the flow of news is unending " exhausting, even. And, granted, there's a lot of disinformation out there.
But apathy " or giving in to confusion " is dangerous.
'I'm terrified that the idea that it is all too much and it is okay to tune out is getting socialized as an acceptable response,' said Dru Menaker, chief operating officer of PEN America, the free-expression advocacy organization.
'Our country is being challenged to its very core, and we have an obligation to pay attention precisely because things are so overwhelming,' she told me by email.
I couldn't agree more. And it's not really all that hard to develop some constructive news habits.
It doesn't take a research project into every claim and counterclaim.
If every American did any two of the following things, the 'who knows?' club could be swiftly disbanded.
Subscribe to a national newspaper and go beyond the headlines into the substance of the main articles; subscribe to your local newspaper and read it thoroughly " in print, if possible; watch the top of 'PBS NewsHour' every night; watch the first 15 minutes of the half-hour broadcast nightly news; tune in to a public-radio news broadcast; do a simple fact-check search when you hear conflicting claims.
For those who can't afford to subscribe to newspapers, almost all public libraries can provide access.
'Whatever the president wants us to believe, there are tested and reliable news sources,' Menaker noted. 'There are even more firsthand sources than ever where you can judge yourself " links to documents, video clips, hours of televised testimony.'
I would also offer this small list of things to stop doing: Stop getting your news and opinions from social media. Stop watching Fox News, especially the prime-time shows, which are increasingly untethered to reality.
If every American gave 30-minutes a day to an earnest and open-minded effort to stay on top of the news, we might actually find our way out of this crisis.
As Walter Shaub, former director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, noted Tuesday on Twitter, it was on Nov. 19, 1863, that President Lincoln challenged his fellow citizens to rise to a 'great task.'
Americans must dedicate themselves to ensuring, Lincoln urged in the Gettysburg Address, 'that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.'
So, too, in this historic moment.
After all, authoritarianism loves nothing more than a know-nothing vacuum: people who throw up their hands and say they can't tell facts from lies.
And democracy needs news consumers " let's call them patriotic citizens " who stay informed and act accordingly.
Flag-waving is fine. But truth-seeking is what really matters.

Teacher pay

Teachers salaries arent keeping up

I recently discovered a copy of the salary schedule from Pinellas County schools from 2005-06. Being in my 24th year of teaching, I paid attention to the salary of a 24-year experienced teacher from back then. In the 05-06 school year a teacher with a bachelors degree and 24 years experience would have made $54,400. The salary for a bachelors degree teacher with 24 years experience in 2019-20 is $55,008, a difference of only $608. That equals a 1.1 percent overall pay increase in 14 years. During that same time period the CPI in the Tampa Bay area rose an average of 2.2 percent a year  an overall increase of 33 percent. If the pay scale had just managed to keep up with the cost of living, the pay for the said 24-year teacher would be $72,403, a difference of $17,395. Year after year, experienced teachers are being squeezed out of the system with wage compression that Tallahassee forces on the districts. While paying beginning teachers higher and higher salaries is a good and decent thing, the insulting and injurious pay scale for the experienced teachers helps explain the exodus of good, experienced teachers from the profession.

Bicyclist injured after hit-and-run inside bike crossing | Nov. 17

Flashing lights should be red

It has always been a head scratcher for me that crossings for pedestrians and cyclists come with flashing yellow lights rather than red. Drivers are taught that red means stop and yellow means slow down and proceed with caution. If the true purpose for crosswalks is to protect walkers and bikers, then red flashing lights need to be the only color option. Otherwise, people attempting to share a roadway with motor vehicles will always lose out.

Rich co-opt tax break | Nov. 17

Pick the person, not the party

While I have been a registered Democrat ever since I first began to vote, I have on occasion voted for a Republican when I thought the person would be a better representative of all the people as opposed to a Democratic opponent who only seemed to want to represent himself. Thus, I am amazed by the indoctrination of Republicans who vote for their party no matter what. Reading this article about then-Gov. Rick Scotts giveaways to the rich along with a similar article a few days earlier about his shenanigans concerning his denial of Medicaid expansion  and how Republican legislators here in Florida want to continue such draconian policies  is enough to make me worry about the future of our republic.

Trump Jr.s book is a No. 1 bestseller | Nov. 15

Fiction or non-fiction?

President Donald Trump bragged on Twitter that his sons book was No. 1 on the New York Times bestseller list. Now Im confused. I thought the president believed the New York Times was fake news.

Barriers zigzag across America like a scar

Texto completo: A few words about walls.Unsurprisingly, the one Donald Trump is trying to build on the southern border -- the one he swore Mexico would pay for -- has proven, like most things he touches, an embarrassing failure. First came news early this month that smugglers have been able to cut through the barrier with a simple reciprocating saw, available at Home Depot for prices starting at less than $100. Then, TBS' "Full Frontal with Samantha Bee" aired a segment demonstrating that the wall, which Trump has said "can't be climbed," can actually be climbed in as little as 15 seconds and by climbers as young as eight.
Maybe Mexico should demand a refund.
In the meantime, and with much less fanfare, construction continues on a wall of much further-reaching consequences. You see, while the wall on the border is supposed to repel immigrants and smugglers, this one repels something many of us find even more threatening: contradictory opinions. Consider three recent news stories:
• In Washington, the White House announces it will cancel government subscriptions to The Washington Post and New York Times. The administration calls it a cost-saving measure, but the truth is obvious. Trump famously hates both newspapers.
• In Citrus County, Florida, county commissioners reject the local library's request for a digital subscription to The Times. Says Commissioner Scott Carnahan, "Fake news, OK, I agree with President Trump. I don't want the New York Times in this county."
• In Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, the library reports that an unknown patron has been hiding books critical of Trump and conservatism, deliberately mis-shelving them in other sections of the library. As that person explained in a note, "I am going to continue hiding these books in the most obscure places I can find to keep this propaganda out of the hands of young minds."
The sheer snowflakery of all this cannot, of course, be overstated. And yes, it reeks of anti-intellectualism, that proud, bullyboy ignorance that has too often fed books -- and bodies -- into bonfires.
But this also speaks to barriers of intellectual -- and emotional -- separation that now zigzag across America like a scar, splitting towns, colleges, churches, workplaces, friendships and families. Nor is the barrier only being built from one side. As liberal college students demand "safe spaces" and "trigger warnings" so they won't have to confront contradiction of their beliefs, it becomes painfully clear this wall is a bipartisan project. And that should concern us all.
This is no argument for false equivalence, nor even for civility. But it is an argument for intellectual freedom -- for honoring people's sacred right to speak and to hear.
The genius of America has always been that it believed in the marketplace of ideas, believed we should have access to the broadest possible range, and that if we did, we would, more often than not, choose the good over the bad, the right over the wrong, the intelligent over the stupid.
Yes, that trust has been sorely tested lately, but is the answer to abandon it completely? To do so would be to abandon everything that makes this country worth the trouble. To do so would be craven and un-American. As in commissioners of a podunk Florida county defending its citizens from The New York Times.
One doesn't know whether to laugh or cry. That wall Trump is trying to build against immigrants will go down as an expensive boondoggle. But you know what will cost us more in the long run?
Any wall we build against ourselves.

ANALYSIS: Warren 'Medicare for all' push slowing her 2020 primary momentum

Texto completo: For months, Elizabeth Warren held off publishing details on how to pay for her "Medicare for all" proposal, which would effectively eliminate private health insurance in favor of a government program.
It turns out there was a good reason why.
Since the Massachusetts senator released details of her healthcare plan on Nov. 1 to counter charges by 2020 Democratic presidential rivals that it would raise taxes on middle-class earners, her poll numbers have dropped in key early voting states.
Ahead of the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses, every poll of Democrats in the state this month has shown her support decrease. The latest Des Moines Register/CNN poll found her at 16% support. An Oct. 25-30 New York Times/Siena College poll had her at 22% support.
Nationally, Warren has seen her numbers in the mid-to-high teens, down from her consistent polling in the 20% range during October. Warren, 70, is now 6.7 percentage points behind former Vice President Joe Biden, 76, in the RealClearPolitics national average.
Warren doesn't have the "Medicare for all" proposal to herself. Socialist Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders made the idea famous, going back to his 2016 Democratic presidential bid. But Sanders has openly campaigned on higher middle-class taxes to fund his healthcare plan, arguing American taxpayers would end up saving money due to decreasing healthcare costs.
Democratic strategists and insiders who have spoken with the Washington Examiner since the beginning of the month have expressed dismay that Warren committed to a "Medicare for all" program and have said it could prove to be a major liability in a general election.
[Read more: Warren says she'll phase in 'Medicare for All' gradually via an opt-in government healthcare plan]
That reflects skepticism by Democratic primary voters, as seen in a poll of likely Iowa caucus-goers conducted by the Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom. The survey found that 36% support a "Medicare for all" plan that would eliminate private health insurance and enroll all Americans into a government-run system. Over 54% said that instead they would like to see a public option, backed by government, or improvements to the Affordable Care Act, which relies largely on private insurance.
Only 36% of respondents said they want a nominee who will "back big ideas, even if there's a lower chance they would become law." Fifty-two percent said they want a candidate who will "advocate for proposals that have a good chance of becoming law, even if the changes aren't as big."
"The work we’ve done shows there’s nothing to suggest Democratic voters are in favor of 'Medicare for all.' I think people are trying to get things that fix the current laws and get a policy that works," said Democratic pollster Peter Hart, who has worked with Democrats such as President Bill Clinton and the late Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts.
"You have 10, 12 people running, and one of the things candidates tend to do is say, 'How can I get a share of the electorate?' and not ask what it means if I’m the nominee," Hart told the Washington Examiner. "They play for the short end of the field. It plays well for certain constituencies, but it becomes a liability. Senator Warren is trying to figure out how to walk this back slightly, without flip-flopping."

MLB is proposing to trim minors

Texto completo: The Batavia Muckdogs, Auburn Doubledays and more than three dozen other minor league baseball teams in the nation could have their ties to a parent club eliminated through a Major League Baseball proposal, according to The New York Times.
The newspaper reports that Major League Baseball says the reorganization is needed to make the minor leagues more efficient and to improve conditions and facilities. Major and Minor League Baseball's current Professional Baseball Agreement is set to expire after the 2020 season.
Among the proposed changes are to sever ties with 42 minor league teams, which is approximately a quarter of the minor league teams under the current contract; and to shift the baseball draft from June to August and limit the number of rounds.
Under the plan, a new "Dream League" would be operated by MLB at minimal cost and provide undrafted players an opportunity to break into professional baseball.
The New York Times reported that such a league could be a "death sentence" as a loss of major-league affiliation would significantly diminish a team's value in the community and could alter interest among prospective employees.
Sen. Charles Schumer on Monday implored MLB to reconsider.
"America's favorite pastime should not become part of Upstate New York's past," he said in a statement to the USA TODAY Network New York.
"It's no secret that New York's minor league teams are institutions within their communities, which is why I implore MLB to reconsider any such plans and will be reaching out to them directly to advocate for our New York teams."
Speaking in Rochester on Monday morning, Schumer said he plans to call baseball commissioner Rob Manfred and "make a strong push" on behalf of the minor league teams that would by affected by this proposal.
Baseball's long history in upstate New York Both the Auburn and Batavia teams are part of MLB's New York-Penn League, which has been operating since 1939. The team in Batavia – then known as the Clippers – was one of the league's six inaugural teams and was the only one still operating in 2019.
For most of its history, the league was largely comprised of teams in small upstate communities, which at various times also included Binghamton, Corning, Elmira, Geneva, Hornell, Jamestown, Lockport, Newark, Olean, Oneonta, Utica, and Watertown.
Last season, just six of the league's 14 teams were based in New York state, and two of them are slated for elimination.
The Batavia Muckdogs, in Genesee County, are a feeder team for the Miami Marlins.
The Auburn Doubledays, in Cayuga County, are a feeder team for the Washington Nationals, which won the 2019 World Series.
Other New York teams on the elimination list include the Binghamton Rumble Ponies and the Staten Island Yankees.
Some New York teams appeared safe, including the Hudson Valley Renegades in Wappingers Falls and the Tri-City ValleyCats in the Albany area. They both also play in the New York–Penn League.
"These teams are not only regional economic and tourism engines, they are also part of the DNA of these communities – and we are more than willing to work with them and Major League baseball to stop this from happening," said Jason Conwall, a spokesman for Gov. Andrew Cuomo.
Binghamton Mayor Richard David said he has spoken with state and local leaders about the news reports and vowed "to fight tooth and nail" to keep the Rumble Ponies.
He said the city-owned stadium is well positioned to fight any efforts by MLB, saying state and local governments have recently invested more than $8 million to upgrade the facility and meet team requirements.
"We were very proactive several years ago where there were deficiencies to put us in a strong position" going forward, he said, adding, "It's something we are concerned about. We are organizing and mobilizing very quickly."
But David warned that these stances often come up when there are contract negotiations coming.
"I would just reiterate that this is a proposal by Major League Baseball, and historically we have seen this every decade or so when contract negotiations come up between minor league baseball and Major League Baseball," David said in Albany as he attended a meeting of the New York Conference of Mayors.
"I don't think that proposal will be adopted in that form."
Auburn City Clerk Chuck Mason offered similar concern, saying losing the Doubledays would be a major blow to the community that has supported a baseball team for more than a century.
"It's a big economic driver," he said. "We're doing everything we can to communicate with our state and federal officials to try to get support for maintaining the New York-Penn League."
Why is MLB proposing to eliminate minor league teams? The proposed changes were first reported by Baseball America's J.J. Cooper in August, which came as part of the negotiation to renew an operating agreement between the minor and major leagues that expires at the end of the 2020 season.
On Saturday, Dan Barry of the New York Times revealed the names of the 42 teams who would be impacted by the plan.
For more than 100 years, minor league teams have negotiated affiliation agreements with big-league teams. The parent club provides funding and players to the minor league teams, which help train and develop young players who aspire to a major league career.
Cooper reported that MLB owners and team officials have long expressed concerns about the quality of playing facilities where many of the affiliates operate. They'd also like minor league teams to contribute more to player salaries.
But perhaps the biggest reason behind the proposed reductions is a shift in the way teams are thinking about player development, driven by the emergence of technology and data analytics.
As teams have adopted these tools, they've concluded that their current system is woefully inefficient. Travis Sawchik, a sports reporter for FiveThirtyEight, wrote in September about why the Houston Astros were among the teams who have reduced the number of minor league affiliates in recent years.
Team officials concluded that they need less time and fewer games to understand the potential of their young prospects, and it is better served by consolidating resources around their most promising players.
Teams have also shifted their development efforts off the field, using video analysis and other high-tech tools to help players improve their skills at their training facilities rather than by playing in regulation games. Many players have embraced these efforts on their own, turning to independent coaches and unaffiliated training facilities.
Sawchik and co-author Ben Lindbergh explored these changes in their best-selling book, "The MVP Machine: How Baseball's New Nonconformists Are Using Data to Build Better Players."
They describe a system where teams have traditionally poured in hundreds of players and millions of dollars each year in the hopes that a handful of those prospects will eventually emerge on the other end to help the big league team. The process seems mysterious from the outside, and in truth, the effort has often been more art than science.
"As far as many fans are concerned, players disappear after draft day," Sawchick and Lindbergh wrote, "encased in cocoons from which some emerge as beautiful baseball butterfiles, while most wither away, forever forgotten or, if they're particularly talented, lamenting for failing to molt."
Sawchik and Lindbergh said that the adoption of these new technologies has helped teams to realize they can get a competitive advantage by upending the way they develop players and shifting away from the minor league model they've relied on for the last century.
Jeff Lantz, Senior Director of Communications for Minor League Baseball said the sides will meet in upcoming weeks to negotiate a plan that would "save as many teams" as possible.
"From what we gathered from the MLB, they did a poll of which ballparks were better, which needed a lot of work and came up with a mass list," he said.
Lantz said an estimated 1,200 players would also lose their jobs should the proposal be approved.
"A lot would be released and have their dreams of being big-league players crushed," Lantz said. "We'll see how things shake out. Both sides want to get a deal done that benefits baseball."
However, the 2020 season is not in jeopardy and is scheduled to be played uninterrupted, he said.
"This is where people gather in the summertime, and it'd be very unfortunate to lose baseball in any of these communities," Lantz said. "Our communications team is looking to keep baseball in all 160 markets."
Fans cry 'foul' While these changes might represent an improvement for major league operations, the proposed restructuring could have a devastating effect on long-standing minor league teams and the communities they serve.
Brett Mandel, who wrote a book about his experiences playing minor league baseball, says baseball risks further alienating its fans.
"Minor league baseball may not be the most cost-effective way to cultivate MLB talent," Mandel said, "but I would argue that it is an incredibly efficient way to connect millions of fans to baseball and its players in an intimate and personal way that is impossible in Major-League markets.
Some fans of teams that are on the cutting block have taken to social media to express their displeasure with the plan.
"I think it is profoundly stupid to deny people in smaller communities the opportunity to see live professional baseball at an affordable price," said Ed Wright of Hamburg. "As though baseball isn't losing its popularity fast enough already. This will exacerbate that trend."
Mike Armstrong, now a Connecticut resident, once worked for the team in Auburn.
"I spent the best summer of my life working for the Doubledays," he tweeted. "Would be devastating to see the loss of small-town minor league baseball under this proposal."
Hilton resident Jason Rhodes said he loves going to games in Batavia because it makes him feel closer to the sport he grew up loving.
"These teams play such an important role in the life of these small towns, and they make the game approachable for fans," he said. "If you got to a big-league game you'll spend 50 bucks and your seat will be far removed from the playing field. Sitting in the bleachers at Dwyer (Stadium in Batavia) makes me feel reconnected to the game in a way that isn't possible anywhere else."

Texto completo: Gig workers on Mechanical Turk, a platform run by Amazon, do computer-like tasks for pennies. Here's what I learned when I joined their ranks.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
"What's your story about?" friends and colleagues would ask.
"It's about this ... thing," I'd say, "called Mechanical Turk."
If the other person did not speak tech, where Mechanical Turk, a platform run by Amazon, is synonymous with low-paid digital piecework, they would look at me blankly. So I would explain:
There are these people who do these little tiny online jobs that other people post. The other people pay them little tiny amounts of money, like 5 cents or 75 cents or two dollars, or sometimes one lousy cent.
The idea is to do lots of these little jobs as fast as you can and move on to higher paying ones and make something like an O.K. wage. If you navigate the learning curve, you sort of can. Most people, including me, do not, as I wrote about my brief experience working as a "turker" in an article published on Friday.
This description, though, leaves out a key aspect of Mechanical Turking, which is how strangely disconnected it feels to do it.
Here is a job I performed on Sept. 17: Type the letters A and B as fast as you can, in alternation, for 10 minutes: ABABABABABAB. For every 100 times you type A and B, you get 6 cents.
It turns out I can type A and B pretty fast -- all those years of piano lessons and high school typing class. In 10 minutes I typed them 2,371 times. For this, I was paid $ 1.42, plus a $ 1 bonus -- the most I made on any Mechanical Turk task. But why?
That same morning, I accepted a task with the inviting subject line "Make 1 art, upload the image. With bonus." The catch was that the task was "only for people who have or personally know someone harmed by gun violence." Like millions of Americans, I qualified. My job was to make an artwork about the incident.
Feeling creeped out and kind of violated but strangely compelled to finish the assignment, I drew a man pointing a gun at another man, with a broken heart next to it. I answered a series of questions: "How has gun violence harmed someone you know?" ("A friend of mine was shot dead while driving a cab.") "Describe how your artwork is about the topic." ("My artwork shows James helpless to stop his killer from shooting him.") I hit "submit." I earned 7 cents.
These two tasks were so puzzling that I contacted the requesters, as people who post tasks on Mechanical Turk are known, to learn more.
The task where I typed A and B turned out to be part of an economics study about racial discrimination. The researcher, Sher Afghan Asad, a graduate student at Iowa State University, explained that some participants were paid more or less than me, while others were paid nothing but told that their typing would cause another person who was identifiably black or white to be paid.
The experiment used typing speed as a measure of caring. "We're looking at whether people care about others based on race," Mr. Asad said. His paper is due out soon.
The gun violence task was part of an art project. The requester, Jason Zhao, a student at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, commissioned hundreds of turker artworks on hot-button topics and is selling them in a vending machine for $ 3 apiece.
His project, "Everyone Will Be an Artist," is a critique and satire of Mechanical Turk itself, and of the art market, and capitalism, and alienated labor. The anti-exploitative twist is that if an artwork sells, Mr. Zhao gives the $ 3 to the turker, minus 53 cents overhead and 12 cents profit.
(The New York Times Company itself, I learned, has made interesting use of Mechanical Turk. Last year, The Times paid turkers 4 cents apiece to read articles and tag the emotions they evoked. Their responses were used to train a program called Project Feels that places ads with articles whose emotional valence can increase clicks on the ads.)
Really, though, most jobs on Mechanical Turk were more like this: I voted on whether someone should call their website "proMerchantShop.com" or "goWebMerchant.com " or "merchantEZ.com." I looked at 82 pairs of photos of edible things and answered whether, for instance, fried chicken is a subcategory of food, or equivalent to food, or neither.
Turkers get used to this indifferent march of tasks.
"Honestly, monotony can be good," one turker, Katie Boehm of Pittsburgh, told me. "'Is article A the same as article B?' over and over -- you just kind of get in this flow, and you realize, 'I just made 20 bucks."'
Ms. Boehm was the only turker I talked to who actually found the work occasionally meaningful. Surveys are big on Mechanical Turk, and Ms. Boehm, who is bisexual, likes doing ones involving L.G.B.T.Q. issues and discrimination. "I'm given a platform to tell someone, a student who's studying rights, what's really happening out here," she said.
For me, turking usually felt bubbled off from the real world. But there was a moment when I was transcribing a long register receipt from a Target store near Denver and the date on it caught my eye: The receipt was from that very day. I looked at the time stamp: less than an hour and a half ago.
It dawned on me that halfway across the country, an actual person had just bought a sleeve of 18-ounce red plastic cups, a pair of Cat and Jack girl's leggings, an 18-ounce bag of Smarties, a four-pack of Totino's triple cheese frozen party pizzas and a 49-cent pencil sharpener. And some aspect of recording that transaction had been entrusted to me.
I felt a rush of pride at my role keeping the wheels of commerce turning. For 14 minutes of my life, 3 cents felt like a bonus.

Texto completo: Ashley James, most recently of the Brooklyn Museum, started there this week.
At a time when museums all over the country are trying to increase the number of people of color on its staff, boards and walls, the Guggenheim Museum has hired its first full-time black curator: Ashley James.
Ms. James, who this week started on the job as the museum's associate curator of contemporary art, was most recently an assistant curator of contemporary art at the Brooklyn Museum, where she was a moving force behind the acclaimed exhibition "Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black Power."
"Her work complements the Guggenheim's mission to present the art of today," Nancy Spector, the Guggenheim's artistic director and chief curator, said in a statement, "which we understand as a deep and expansive view of art history."
Before coming to the Brooklyn Museum, Ms. James was a Mellon Curatorial Fellow in the Museum of Modern Art's drawings and prints department, where she focused on retrospectives of the artists Adrian Piper and Charles White. Ms. James has also held positions at the Studio Museum in Harlem and the Yale University Art Gallery. In the spring, she will receive a Ph.D. from Yale in English Literature, African-American Studies, and women's, gender and sexuality studies.
"I am eager to begin work with my colleagues to develop new research, explore new ideas for exhibitions, programs and publications," Ms. James said in a statement, "and continue to expand and shape such a vital collection."
The appointment coincides with recent frictions in the Guggenheim's relationship with a guest curator, the art historian Chaédria LaBouvier, who organized the exhibition "Basquiat's 'Defacement': The Untold Story." Speaking up recently at a museum panel discussion, Ms. LaBouvier, who is black, accused the Guggenheim of snubbing her and undermining her curatorial role by, among other things, not inviting her to participate in the Guggenheim's panel discussion about Basquiat with other scholars who had contributed to her own catalog. Last summer she told The New York Times that she was cut out of other decisions on how the exhibition was to be presented and that her research had been shortchanged.
Ms. LaBouvier was the first black female curator to organize a solo exhibition at the museum in its 80-year history. The independent Nigerian curator Okwui Enwezor was one of several organizers of a show on African photography in 1996 and the artists Carrie Mae Weems and Julie Mehretu are among six artist-curators in the current exhibition "Artistic License: Six Takes on the Guggenheim Collection," running through January.
In a statement, the Guggenheim said, it "is proud to have presented the exhibition Basquiat's "'Defacement': The Untold Story," curated by Chaédria LaBouvier based upon her original and groundbreaking research." (PHOTOGRAPH BY ELLE PÉREZ)

Texto completo: Two days after a mysterious, unannounced hospital visit, President Trump's physician issued a late-night statement attributing it to "regular, primary preventative care."
WASHINGTON -- The White House sought on Monday night to quell a torrent of speculation about President Trump's health two days after a mysterious, unannounced visit to the hospital, denying that he was treated for an emergency and insisting that it was just "regular, primary preventive care."
"Despite some of the speculation, the president has not had any chest pain, nor was he evaluated or treated for any urgent or acute issues," Cmdr. Sean P. Conley, the president's Navy physician, wrote in a memo released by the White House in an unusual late-night statement. "Specifically, he did not undergo any specialized cardiac or neurologic evaluations."
Mr. Trump was taken on Saturday to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in his motorcade in a trip that had not been listed on his public schedule. He stayed for about two hours for what White House officials said were routine tests, but since the visit had not been revealed in advance and came only nine months after his last annual physical, it touched off much discussion about whether the president had an undisclosed health issue.
Mr. Trump, 73, is the oldest man ever sworn in for a first term as president, and he is not known for a healthy diet or exercise other than weekend golf. At his February checkup, he weighed in at 243 pounds, which is considered obese for a man of his reported height of 6-foot-3. He has been reported in the past to be taking rosuvastatin, a lipid-lowering drug, to control his cholesterol.
Dr. Conley reported that his latest test showed Mr. Trump's cholesterol at 165, down from 196 in February. His LDL has fallen to 84, from 122, while his HDL was 70, up from 58. The doctor did not release results of any other tests, if conducted, including an updated weight.
In his memo, Dr. Conley called Saturday's visit "a routine, planned interim checkup as part of the regular, primary preventative care he receives throughout the year." He said it was not announced in advance "due to scheduling uncertainties," without explaining further.
Dr. Conley also made no mention of whether Mr. Trump underwent a routine colonoscopy, which his physician at the time said in January 2018 would be conducted at his next regular exam. The president's doctors did not say in February whether he had one then.
After the February exam, Dr. Conley described Mr. Trump as being in "very good health." He made no characterization one way or the other in Monday night's statement, but brushed off concerns generated by the Saturday visit.
"Primary preventative medical care is something that occurs continuously throughout the year, it is not just a single annual event," Dr. Conley said. "As such, I will continue to monitor the president's health, planning on a more comprehensive examination after the new year."

Nevada Democrats open to latecomer Deval Patrick if they hear more from him

Texto completo: PARADISE, Nevada — Deval Patrick, a late entrant into the Democratic presidential field, hopes that voters will like him once they get to know him. In Nevada, many voters are open to backing the former Massachusetts governor — if they heard more from him.
“It’s not a fool’s errand,” Patrick told reporters Sunday in Nevada, home to the third 2020 Democratic nominating contest, the Feb. 22 caucuses. “I respect that you are skeptical. And I hope you respect when I prove you wrong.”
In a volatile period for the Democratic primary, with no one candidate a clear front-runner, Patrick, 63, joins lower-tier candidates who insist that current leaders in primary polls will not necessarily be the nominee. About only a third of voters in a recent New York Times/Sienna College poll said they have settled on which candidate to support.
Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Sunday discouraged reporters from writing off candidates, including Patrick, even though there are fewer than 100 days until the Nevada caucuses.
“It's way too early to start crossing people off the list,” Reid said to a Democratic audience in his home state, adding that Patrick is “a very fine man and a great worker in Massachusetts.”
In addition to limited time to build a campaign infrastructure and make upcoming primary debate stages, one of Patrick’s biggest challenges is introducing himself to voters already bombarded by about 1 1/2 dozen candidates still in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.
It was 10:45 p.m., nearly four hours after the event’s start time, by the time Patrick took the stage at the Nevada Democratic Party’s “First in the West” event Sunday. Speaking order for the 14 presidential candidates participating was determined by polling, and Patrick was the last to speak.''

Hundreds of supporters for other candidates who filled blocks of seats purchased by the campaigns and had turned the event into a spirit rally with organized cheers, “thunder stick” noisemakers, and light-up signs had long cleared the room by the time Patrick spoke.
“It’s a little strange to be in a hall where every candidate but mine has a cheering section already organized,” Patrick joked to the roughly 50 people left in the otherwise empty Bellagio hotel ballroom, promising that he would make his comments brief. “Events like this are fabulous, as good as they are, but I still believe they should end the day they began.”
Patrick argued that he could appeal to a wide range of voters. “If we want to make change that lasts, we have to talk to everybody,” he said. “I am not running to be president of the Democrats; I'm running to be president of the United States.”
Attendees who filtered out before Patrick spoke told the Washington Examiner they had little to no knowledge of Patrick as a candidate. But for those who powered through the entire event, Patrick left a positive impression.
“He stood out, actually. I'd say he stood out of all of them,” said retired Henderson, Nevada, resident Sara Frankel, 64, who is undecided on whom to support in the Nevada caucuses. She also liked South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg but was skeptical that he could win in all areas of the country.
“I didn't have an expectation, and I was really glad I sat there because he would have been missed, and I wouldn't have even known he would have been missed,“ said Jan Kalajian of Henderson, 69, who runs a cleaning company. “You never know who's going to end up on top.”
Some undecided voters who had not heard from Patrick did not discount his candidacy. “I need to know more about him. But I'm going to be actively watching and listening to what he has to say. So it's a possibility," retired Las Vegas resident Kate Baca said at a Joe Biden event on Saturday.
But 72% of likely Nevada caucus-goers in a CBS/YouGov poll released Sunday said they are satisfied with their choices in the field, and some voters assessed that Patrick’s campaign might be unable to reach many voters.
“It seems to me that we have lots of good people who've been running for a while and trying to explain their views to the American people. And to be a latecomer, they're going to have to run awfully fast to catch up,” said retired philosophy professor John Knight, who attended an event for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Sunday.
It’s possible that Patrick could get a leg up on other candidates if large donors back an advertising campaign. He declined to discourage outside super PACs from supporting his candidacy, unlike most of the other candidates in the field.
“We need to do some catch-up, so I think we've got to follow and find all sorts of above-board strategies,” Patrick said on Meet the Press Sunday.

I broke the story of Andrew Toles’ promotion to the big leagues in the summer of 2016. One thing I didn’t include in any of my reporting at the time was this text message from a Dodgers staffer: “that could end poorly.”
The story of Toles’ career with the Dodgers hasn’t technically ended. He’s still under contract to the team, but he spent all of 2019 on the restricted list and did not play. The reason for his absence was never revealed; we only knew that Toles had the support of the organization while he was away. For a player who joined the team in a cloud of mystery, it was an appropriate fadeout to the decade.
The Dodgers were well aware of his question marks when they signed Toles as a minor league free agent. They knew Toles had been disciplined by two different college programs — kicked off the University of Tennessee baseball team in 2011 and suspended by Chipola College in 2012. They knew the Tampa Bay Rays expelled Toles from his Single-A team following a blow-up with his manager in May 2014. They knew all this because the GM who drafted and developed Toles with the Rays was none other than the Dodgers’ Andrew Friedman.
Toles’ second chance in professional baseball went much better than his first. Fast-tracked from Single-A to the majors in 2016, Toles slashed .314/.365/.505 in 48 regular season games. By October, he had ramrodded his way into the starting outfield. Toles started four of six NLCS games against the Cubs that year, going 6 for 13 (.462) with a pair of doubles. At 24 years old, Toles had made the leap from prospect, to failed prospect, to starting outfielder on a playoff team. The transformation landed him in the pages of the New York Times.
The following winter, the Dodgers jettisoned their de facto left fielder, Howie Kendrick, paving the way for Toles to seize regular playing time in 2017. However, a knee injury in May promptly ended his season. His absence on the field would have been more conspicuous without the emergence of Chris Taylor. Still, by 2018, Toles was healthy and competing for a job in spring training. There was a pathway for him to regain his standing on the depth chart.
By the final week of camp, Toles and Joc Pederson were in the running for the final outfield job. Pederson went 8 for 54 during the Cactus League season. Toles went 15 for 53. Pederson won the job anyway, and Toles began the season in Triple-A. There, a hamstring injury cost him two months. He batted .306 at Oklahoma City but never cracked a Dodger outfield rotation that now featured a rejuvenated Pederson and Matt Kemp, in addition to Chris Taylor, Kiké Hernandez and Yasiel Puig. On Sept. 29 in San Francisco, Toles singled and stole second base against the Giants. He hasn’t batted in a major league game since.
Judging only what he did on the field, Toles deserves some extolling. His postseason at-bats, limited though they were, look impressive in the context of the decade. His .792 regular-season OPS compares surprisingly well with the Dodgers’ other outfielders of the last 10 years. His effort in the outfield and on the bases was at least as impressive as hit bat. Ironically, Toles’ hard-nosed efforts landed him in the operating room and derailed his early promise perhaps as much as anything. Toles is still only 27 years old. But without knowing the substance of his off-the-field issue(s), it’s hard to say anything definitive about his future in baseball.
All we have for now are memories of one of the game’s best personalities, a talented athlete who offered tantalizing glimpses on the field. Who else points at a mean-mugging Chase Utley and says, unironically, “I wake up in the morning and I’m like, ‘how can I be like Chase Utley today?’ ” Who else admits he checked FanGraphs to see when he’d get called up from Triple-A? Who else, while being unable to walk, says (also unironically), “I’m pretty much healthy right now … besides my knee”? No one, that’s who. You can tell the story off the 2010s Dodger teams without Andrew Toles, but it wouldn’t be nearly as fun.

David Leonhardt: Comey, Mueller and the true courage of Marie Yovanovitch

Texto completo: To understand the courage that witnesses like Marie Yovanovitch have shown during the Ukraine investigation, it’s worth looking back on a couple of the other signature moments of the Trump era.
One was in the summer of 2016, when James Comey, then the FBI director, faced an uncomfortable choice. He and his colleagues had concluded that Hillary Clinton should not be prosecuted for using a private email account to conduct government business. Her conduct was sloppy and inappropriate, but it was also fairly common and not close to being criminal.
Still, Comey knew that Republicans would vilify him for his decision not to prosecute. They would portray it as partisan, rather than what it was: a straightforward application of the law. And Comey prized his reputation for appearing to be above partisan politics.
So he looked for a way to dilute the criticism. Instead of simply closing the Clinton investigation, he gave a news conference blasting her. Doing so violated Justice Department policy, but also ensured that the subsequent criticism of Comey would come from both Democrats and Republicans. Comey, in short, put a higher priority on avoiding the appearance of partisanship than on doing the right thing.
Three years later, Robert Mueller faced his own uncomfortable choice. As special counsel, he helped uncover evidence that President Donald Trump had repeatedly broken the law, including paying hush money to two women and interfering in the Russia investigation. But Mueller understood that clearly laying out his conclusions would subject him to vicious criticism as a partisan. Like Comey, he prized his reputation for floating above partisan politics.
Conveniently, he found a solution that protected his reputation. Mueller’s final report included a detailed recitation of facts, but its conclusions were deliberately obtuse, which meant they changed almost nobody’s mind. “If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so,” Mueller cryptically said. Making matters worse, he then allowed the Trump administration to control — and spin — the report’s release.
Mueller, to be fair, has a stronger defense than Comey. Throughout, Mueller interpreted Justice Department guidelines in narrow ways: Those guidelines didn’t compel him to present clear conclusions — as Kenneth Starr had two decades earlier — and so Mueller didn’t do so. It’s possible that Mueller’s mistakes had more to do with naïveté than pride.
Yet the outcome was the same. Both Mueller and Comey preserved their nonpartisan images (only temporarily in Comey’s case, because he later engaged in a full-on fight with Trump), while the country suffered.
Comey’s unprecedented insertion of the FBI into the final stages of a presidential campaign may have decided the outcome. And Mueller’s convoluted report was a gift to Trump. Mueller’s long investigation uncovered extensive evidence of a president who had broken the law and abused his power, but Mueller did almost nothing to hold the president accountable.
Now let’s return to the Ukraine case — and contrast the approach of Comey and Mueller with the very different decisions by Yovanovitch, Alexander Vindman, Bill Taylor, George Kent and, above all, the whistleblower.
After learning that Trump was pressuring a foreign country to investigate U.S. citizens, the whistleblower took the extraordinary step of filing a formal complaint against the president. He had to have understood the risks of doing so. He could lose his job and his career. He could become a Fox News boogeyman. Any part of his background could be subjected to public scrutiny. His life might never be the same.
And yet he put a higher priority on doing the right thing than on avoiding accusations of partisanship.
Since then, Yovanovitch, Vindman, Taylor and Kent have made similar decisions. Despite the personal risks, they have testified forthrightly about Trump’s actions. Sure enough, Trump apologists have smeared them. Conservative pundits suggested Vindman was a traitor, and a House Republican lamely tried to link Yovanovitch to a Democratic operative. Trump has publicly insulted the witnesses. They have been portrayed as partisan hacks rather than what they are: Americans willing to pay a price for their country.
The radicalization of the Republican Party means that other people are going to face versions of this dilemma. Not just Trump, but many members of Congress, have chosen to depict anything other than partisan hackery for their own side as partisan hackery for the other side. Just look at Adam Schiff, the House Democrat who — though like every human being makes occasional missteps — has run a fair, rigorous impeachment inquiry and whom Republicans have painted as a vindictive villain.
The situation is even more difficult for people who pride themselves on their nonpartisanship. This group includes Mueller, Comey, diplomats, law enforcement agents, journalists, national security officials, Federal Reserve officials and more. Many of them may be faced with a miserable choice, in which they can’t both do the right thing and preserve their reputation for doing the right thing.
Mueller and Comey are decent men who have served their country honorably for decades. Yet when confronted with this test, even they failed it. Which should make us all the more grateful for Yovanovitch, Vindman, Taylor, Kent and the whistleblower.

Texto completo: Thankful for SCAD's impact on downtown life
While the Habersham School is moving to a brand-new campus on Chatham Parkway next year, we will look fondly on our years in downtown Savannah, where the city was our classroom and students could be found reading their Dante and Dostoevsky in the shade of our many squares.
In a recent conversation with one of our art teachers, Jared Seff, I realized what we will miss most about downtown - what Savannah has that no other American city can offer: the flagship campus of the Savannah College of Art and Design.
"When we're downtown, the presence of SCAD - students, bikes, buildings, construction, and art displayed seemingly everywhere - constantly reinforces that we are participating in a culture of art and creativity that is larger than ourselves and not confined inside any walls," he said.
The SCAD Museum of Art, Ex Libris Bookstore, the numerous SCAD galleries and exhibitions, festivals and live theater productions, and other learning events and environments have made Savannah an educator's paradise.
Habersham students have competed in the SCAD Sand Arts and Sidewalk Arts Festivals, attended demonstrations led by SCAD students and faculty, hosted SCAD professors on our own campus for talks and lectures, visited many exhibitions and installations at the SCAD Museum of Art and other SCAD galleries, and toured SCADstory. By the way, if you haven't seen SCADstory, you must go. So unexpected and brilliant.
As I reflect on the Habersham School's success and growth since its founding only seven short years ago, I want to express gratitude to SCAD for making Savannah a city known not just for history and beauty but also for invention and discovery. As we're fond of saying at Habersham, where goodness and truth exist, there you will find beauty.

Administration ignores climate damages
Authoritative sources have revealed a compelling reason for taking quick action to curb climate disruption. They report that climate threats to human survival on Earth are more imminent than previously predicted.
A New York Times article, citing recent coverage in Scientific American, describes extensive on-the-ground evidence that damages caused by our overheating climate are already far beyond the predictions previously made by most climate scientists.
For instance, in all human existence there has never been so little glacial ice on Earth - for hundreds of thousands of years. Across the globe, temperatures have registered so many record-breaking highs that dangers expected no sooner than mid-century are already occurring.
Compounding this alarming record of accelerated damages caused by the climate crisis are reckless, defiant political responses where leadership in Washington is now dismantling both well-established environmental protections of air and water as well as emerging efforts taken to reduce the causes of climate change - the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs).
Over the past five years alone, events linked to climate disruption suffered by Americans caused more than a trillion dollars in damage, unparalleled and unprecedented - primarily due to wildfire and major storms. Each year, hundreds of billions of dollars in harms have been incurred, and full recovery is often impossible.
Yet, U.S. officials continue budgeting billions annually in subsidizing the fossil-fuel industry, the primary cause of dangerous overheating trends, now confirmed to be accelerating. Similarly, billions in federal funds continue being foolishly spent on development and redevelopment in high-risk areas vulnerable to growing climate-driven disasters.
Meanwhile, financial institutions have issued well-founded precautions about avoiding such risks. A member of the Federal Reserve recently warned that climate impacts pose a significant threat to the financial stability and welfare of millions of Americans living in harm's way

Rep. Carter questionnaire draws response
I believe Rep. Buddy Carter to be a good congressman in most ways and I think he cares about his constituents.
Yet it is disingenuous for Carter to ask for my opinion when he has clearly made up his mind. He doesn't care what I think about the impeachment process. Otherwise, he would not describe his view of it as "shocking" before ever asking my opinion and he would not have worded a recent questionnaire such that anyone who answered "no" would seem to be saying they cared nothing about the American people. How can Carter hope to find truth if he frames the world the way he framed that question?
I do care about America, Republicans, Democrats and everything in between and I know Carter does, too. I implore him to care with a more open mind. Perhaps this process is proceeding as it should. Our president clearly broke the law. At a minimum, this needs to be acknowledged and atoned for. I can read, I don't need a talking head to tell me what to think and what I think is that the transcript released by the White House was an unintentional admission of guilt.
What I found shocking was that they actually released such self-incriminating evidence. I don't think they knew that they had broken the law and that makes me more afraid of who isn't minding the store than who is.
I understand why Carter thinks the policies of our president are beneficial. But there are limits to the breaches of law and of morality that we can suffer in support of any person or policy. The end does not justify the means. No one is above the law.

Senators show double standard on impeachment
For Sens. Lindsey Graham, Mitch McConnell and many of the other Republicans who voted for articles of impeachment inquiry or conviction during the trial of President Bill Clinton, lying about extramarital sex to the American people was an impeachable offense. These same senators now find nothing wrong with President Donald Trump's lying, obstructionist tactics, and walking all over the Constitution. Sen. Graham in 1999 said, "Impeachment is not about punishment but is about cleansing and restoring integrity to the office." Graham now: "The Democrats have lost their minds to want to impeach President Trump". Sen. McConnell had similar views in 1999 and the same today as Graham. Republicans talked about the rule of law in 1999 and that even the president was not above the law. I assume that they feel that it's OK with Trump lying, walking on the Constitution, and doing whatever he wants to do or say because they feel he's just being Trump.
When President Trump said that he was above the law, that he could shoot someone in the middle of the street and nothing would happen, his party should've straightened him out at that time. If nothing else they could have told him that if he does something unethical or illegal, that he would be held accountable. The Republican congressmen seem to be afraid of President Trump.
I never thought I would see the day when we would hold our professional athletes to a higher standard than we hold our president. Our Congressman Buddy Carter should be about upholding the Constitution and letting the truth come out good or bad.
The one thing for sure is that the truth will come out now or later. Later might be worse for a former President Trump. That, he should be assured.

Leonard Pitts Jr. column: Barriers zigzag across America like a scar

Texto completo: Unsurprisingly, the one Donald Trump is trying to build on the southern border - the one he swore Mexico would pay for - has proven, like most things he touches, an embarrassing failure. First came news early this month that smugglers have been able to cut through the barrier with a simple reciprocating saw, available at Home Depot for prices starting at less than $100. Then, TBS' "Full Frontal with Samantha Bee" aired a segment demonstrating that the wall, which Trump has said "can't be climbed," can actually be climbed in as little as 15 seconds and by climbers as young as eight.
Maybe Mexico should demand a refund.
In the meantime, and with much less fanfare, construction continues on a wall of much further-reaching consequences. You see, while the wall on the border is supposed to repel immigrants and smugglers, this one repels something many of us find even more threatening: contradictory opinions. Consider three recent news stories:
- In Washington, the White House announces it will cancel government subscriptions to The Washington Post and New York Times. The administration calls it a cost-saving measure, but the truth is obvious. Trump famously hates both newspapers.
- In Citrus County, Florida, county commissioners reject the local library's request for a digital subscription to The Times. Says Commissioner Scott Carnahan, "Fake news, OK, I agree with President Trump. I don't want the New York Times in this county."
- In Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, the library reports that an unknown patron has been hiding books critical of Trump and conservatism, deliberately mis-shelving them in other sections of the library. As that person explained in a note, "I am going to continue hiding these books in the most obscure places I can find to keep this propaganda out of the hands of young minds."
The sheer snowflakery of all this cannot, of course, be overstated. And yes, it reeks of anti-intellectualism, that proud, bullyboy ignorance that has too often fed books - and bodies - into bonfires.
But this also speaks to barriers of intellectual - and emotional - separation that now zigzag across America like a scar, splitting towns, colleges, churches, workplaces, friendships and families. Nor is the barrier only being built from one side. As liberal college students demand "safe spaces" and "trigger warnings" so they won't have to confront contradiction of their beliefs, it becomes painfully clear this wall is a bipartisan project. And that should concern us all.
This is no argument for false equivalence, nor even for civility. But it is an argument for intellectual freedom - for honoring people's sacred right to speak and to hear.
The genius of America has always been that it believed in the marketplace of ideas, believed we should have access to the broadest possible range, and that if we did, we would, more often than not, choose the good over the bad, the right over the wrong, the intelligent over the stupid.
Yes, that trust has been sorely tested lately, but is the answer to abandon it completely? To do so would be to abandon everything that makes this country worth the trouble. To do so would be craven and un-American. As in commissioners of a podunk Florida county defending its citizens from The New York Times.
One doesn't know whether to laugh or cry. That wall Trump is trying to build against immigrants will go down as an expensive boondoggle. But you know what will cost us more in the long run?
Any wall we build against ourselves.

Texto completo: Headnote Editorial
We were happy to see former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick enter the presidential race this week - if only to give Americans another strong Black leader to consider.
We were also pleased with the amount of national media attention his announcement got.
But we wonder if it will continue as his campaign continues.
Will he get as much attention as, say, a white mayor from a big town in Indiana?
Presidential contender Amy Klobuchar raised a related question last week on CNN's "State of the Union."
When asked if she thought Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana (population: approximately 102,000) and a fellow presidential contender, was qualified, Klobuchar said yes.
But she also noted that Buttigieg is relatively inexperienced. He has not won state races. He has not worked in the Capitol.
"Of the women on the stage, and I'm focusing here on my fellow women senators, Sen. Warren, Sen. Harris and myself... Do I think we would be standing on that stage if we had the experience he had? No, I don't," Klobuchar said. "Maybe we're held to a different standard."
While we recognize that Buttigieg is unique in that he's one of the youngest presidential candidates in U.S. history and the first openly gay candidate, we share Klobuchar's questions about his credentials and double standards.
There are more women in the field than ever before and - with the exception of Marianne Williamson, who has at least written 13 books - they are all significantly more qualified than Buttigieg. And some of them are unique in their own right.
* Tulsi Gabbard is the first Samoan American and first practicing Hindu elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, where she has represented Hawaii since 2012. As a major in the Hawaii Army National Guard, she is also the first female combat veteran to seek the presidency.
* Kamala Harris is the only Black woman in the U.S. Senate and the only Black woman in the presidential race. She has represented California since 2017.
* Amy Klobuchar is the first woman in Minnesota to be elected to the U.S. Senate, where she has served since 2006.
* Elizabeth Warren, a former law professor, has represented Massachusetts in the U.S. Senate since 2013.
Only Warren consistently gets the kind of attention Buttigieg gets.
And there are weeks when Harris is mentioned as often in national media as Buttigieg - sometimes more.
There are also more Black and Hispanic candidates in the field than ever before and they, too, are as qualified as Buttigieg - or more so.
* Cory Booker is the first African-American in New Jersey to be elected to the U.S. Senate, where he has served since 2013. Before that, he was the beloved mayor of Newark, New Jersey (population: approximately 285,000).
* Julian Castro became the youngest member of President Barack Obama's Cabinet when he was named secretary of housing and urban development in 2014. Before that, he was the mayor of San Antonio, Texas (population: approximately 1.5 million).
* Wayne Messam was the first Black man to be elected mayor of Miramar, Florida (population: approximately 140,300) in 2015. Before that, he served on the Miramar City Commission for several years. He has the same number of years of experience leading a large town as Buttigieg does. None of them gets the kind of attention Buttigieg gets.
Booker and Castro have publicly struggled to stay in the campaign. On Sept. 21, Booker said he would have to end his campaign if he didn't raise $1.7 million by the end of that month. He succeeded and appeared in the October debate. A few weeks later, on Oct. 21, Castro announced that he needed to raise $800,000 by the end of that month to stay in the campaign. As of Friday, he hadn't met the Democratic National Committee's requirements to appear in the next debate.
And Messam has never appeared on the debate stage.
In a Democratic field with more women and people of color than ever before, many of whom are also unique, why is Buttigieg getting so much attention? And the money and celebrity endorsements that go with it?
We believe a big part of it comes down to the national media.
Members of the national media talk about the candidates who interest them the most or who they think are most likely to win, which brings more awareness to those candidates' campaigns, which helps those candidates raise more money, which gives members of the national media more reason to talk about them.
And members of the national media are mostly non-Hispanic white men.
Approximately 77% of all reporters, editors and photographers are non-Hispanic whites, according to a 2018 report from the Pew Research Center. And approximately 61% of all reporters, editors and photographers are men.
These demographics make newsrooms less diverse than the entire American workforce, which is 65% non-Hispanic white and 53% male.
A significant portion of the newsroom employees at The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal are graduates of America's elite universities, according to a 2018 study published in the Journal of Expertise. Approximately 44% of the Times' newsroom employees and 50% of the Journal's newsroom employees graduated from Ivy League schools. The study did not look at the newsrooms of The Washington Post or The Associated Press.
The demographics of these large newsrooms matter because many newspapers across the country rely on them to provide coverage of these national campaigns.
And who are these predominantly non-Hispanic, white male reporters going to be most interested in?
Another white man.
Would the national media give the same attention to a Black man with the same political experience in a town a little bigger than South Bend (a town most people only knew because of the local university's football team)? We've already seen the answer to that with Messam.
Would the national media give the same attention to a white, Black or Samoan American woman who had never won a state race? We don't know because there are none in the field. But we do know that it's not giving the same attention to some white, Black and Samoan American women who already serve in Congress.
Will the national media give the same attention to a Blackformer governor? Only time will tell.

Texto completo: Provo • For the last 41 years, Leah Scharp thought her older sister Marla had been killed by notorious serial killer Henry Lee Lucas.
That belief, like her sister’s untimely death, was a hard truth to swallow, but knowing the person responsible for the slaying had been caught gave her some sense of justice.
That all changed last month, when Karra Porter with the Utah Cold Case Coalition presented the Scharps with a thick stack of investigative files and a PowerPoint presentation that convinced them Marla’s death couldn’t have been committed by Lucas.
The Provo Police Department was apparently similarly persuaded. They have reopened the case, Porter announced Saturday outside police headquarters — and she called for departments in 27 other states where Lucas confessed to murders to reopen their cases, too.
“Because every case that Henry Lee Lucas falsely confessed to is a cold case,” Porter said. “It really has not been solved.”
Lucas had confessed to hundreds of murders, but later recanted, The New York Times reported at the time of his death in 2001. Many of those cases were never reopened.
The Times reported that Lucas “attributed the confessions to a steady diet of tranquilizers, steaks, hamburgers and milkshakes fed to him by investigators, along with crime scene clues that he said he had parroted back to detectives.”
One of the cases he confessed to was the June 29, 1978, rape and murder of Marla Scharp, 26.
Marla Scharp, a former BYU student, lived in a Provo house with roommates, but on that June day, she found herself alone for about half an hour. That’s when the assailant struck.
Police closed the case in 1984 when Lucas confessed. But in looking through the investigative file, Porter came across evidence that she thinks proves that Lucas couldn’t have killed Scharp.
For one, all the information Lucas knew about the case were details that had been given to him by police. Lucas himself admits this in a letter he wrote to the “people of Provo," saying, “I never killed the [Scharp] girl.” He said he was in Maryland that year and that police played a “guessing game” with him about the facts of the case until he got them “straight.”
Porter provided a copy of the letter to The Salt Lake Tribune and other media.
Second, Porter said, police found forensic evidence at the scene that she says Lucas couldn’t have produced.
Now, more than four decades after Marla Scharp was killed, her family members are again trying to find the person who did it. Leah Scharp said she just wants to know the truth.
“I don’t believe in closure, because for something like this, there is no closure. You don’t get any closure for something like this," Leah Scharp said, "But somebody killed my sister and they need to be brought to justice.”
The revelation that Lucas may not have killed Marla Scharp didn’t come as a surprise to some in the family, Leah Scharp said.
Marla’s brother Craig Scharp said he never thought Lucas was responsible. Leah Scharp’s two daughters also had doubts.
The family says they’re confident the police will get to the bottom of the case, and are thankful investigators were willing to reopen it.
“What Henry Lucas did by claiming that he had murdered these people is he stopped these investigations, and that’s a horrible thing,” Craig Scharp said. “So by the Provo police being willing to reopen this — that’s huge.”
At the Saturday news conference, Porter presented a piece of evidence that was found at the murder scene, hoping it could jog some people’s memories: a unique Budweiser beer tap.
She said the 6-inch tall tap was found at the homicide scene, and that it was very unlikely it belonged to Marla Scharp or her roommates.
Anyone with information can call Provo police at 801-852-6210.

'Warning' a toothless self-preservation

Texto completo: On Nov. 19, Twelve will publish "A Warning" by an anonymous Trump administration official, and I would like to urge everyone to not purchase this book.
For the Americans who would support Donald Trump even if he shot someone in the middle of 5th Avenue, the book is the work of a subversive deep-state operative plotting an internal coup.
For the rest of us who are worried about what additional damage President Trump may do to the office he holds and the country he is supposed to serve, allow me to make a more thorough, reality-based case.
First, this anonymous author's horrifying story of the Trump administration is already leaking ahead of its publication date.
Second, I don't believe in rewarding people who are in positions of significant power and influence who are too cowardly to stand up publicly for the principles they claim to hold.
Let's understand a couple of things: Anonymous is in fact not a deep-state operative. As his or her 2018 New York Times op-ed makes clear, Anonymous is a Republican who supports the president's agenda. Anonymous also is not a "whistleblower." Whistleblowers, as we have seen with the brave individual who flagged the president's attempts to meddle in the integrity of the 2020 election, act out of a sense of duty by going through official, legal channels.
Instead, Anonymous is one of a very common species: a Republican who has worked in the Trump Administration and who believes he is every bit as dangerous to the country as any Democrat, and yet still does not do anything truly substantive to act on those beliefs.
Anonymous is for sure not alone. As Republican consultant Mike Murphy told MSNBC in September, one senator told him that 30 of his colleagues would vote to remove Trump from office if it could be done anonymously.
Gen. James Mattis, former defense secretary, studiously avoids sharing his true thoughts about the president in his new book, "Call Sign Chaos: Learning to Lead." We know this thanks to Mattis' former aide and speech writer, Guy Snodgrass, who wrote in his own book, "Holding the Line: Inside Trump's Pentagon with Secretary Mattis," about Mattis' concerns regarding the president's behavior.
Mattis says he owes a certain deference to the office of the president to not speak out. It is not clear to me why he should defer to an office when the man holding it shows it no such respect. I understand it even less, considering our national security is in the balance.
I get Anonymous' hesitancy to reveal himself. President Trump is obviously more than willing to use the awesome powers of the presidency to enact revenge on those he perceives as enemies. The Ukraine whistleblower has much to fear. Trump is already using the U.S. Justice Department to try to unmask the identity of Anonymous under the guise of making sure no non-disclosure agreements have been violated.
Unfortunately, by staying undercover, Anonymous significantly blunts any chance of whatever warnings he wishes to issue having an effect, no matter how disturbing. I don't wish any harm to this person. I don't even support any investigatory efforts to have him unmasked without his consent.
That said, is it too much to ask for people who took an oath to the Constitution to live up to their pledge?

Book recommendations from the Biblioracle
John Warner tells readers what book to pick up next, based on the last five titles they've read.

1. "The Education of an Idealist" by Samantha Power
2. "Good and Mad: The Revolutionary Power of Women's Anger" by Rebecca Traister
3. "Red Clocks" by Leni Zumas
4. "Circe" by Madeline Miller
5. "Fleishman Is in Trouble" by Taffy Brodesser-Akner
-- Sally T., Chicago
Jami Attenberg has a special talent for bring a "messy" family to life, and really, what family isn't messy. Sally should try "All This Could be Yours."

1. "She's Come Undone" by Wally Lamb
2. "The Corrections" by Jonathan Franzen
3. "House of Sand and Fog" by Andre Dubus III
4. "An American Marriage" by Tayari Jones
5. "Midwives" by Chris Bohjalian
-- Mary P., Rockford
Going back a bit to find the kind of drama Mary seems to gravitate towards: "The Shipping News" by Annie Proulx.

1. "The Anthologist" by Nicholson Baker
2. "The Best American Short Stories of the Century," edited by John Updike
3. "Nutshell" by Ian McEwan
4. "Motherless Brooklyn" by Jonathan Lethem
5. "Station Eleven" by Emily St. John Mandel
-- Michael T., Chicago
Some good substantive stuff in this list when it comes to contemplating the deepest recesses of the human condition. This makes me think "The Association of Small Bombs" by Karan Mahajan is a good fit for Michael.

Texto completo: November is National Adoption Awareness Month. Journalist, author and adoptee, Seth Berkman, got a taste of his birth country when the New York Times sent him to report on the United Korean women's hockey team. Consisting of players from North and South Korea, select players trained and competed together as teammates at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Berkman's coverage spurred him to write "A Team of Their Own: How an International Sisterhood Made Olympic History" (Hanover Square Press, $19.99).
An edited version of our conversation follows.
Q: How have your trips for work shaped how you travel?
A: Traveling for work has been one of the privileges of my job. In particular, traveling to smaller cities in America is always intriguing. I often find that it's helpful to capture the ethos of a location, to learn about the subject I'm reporting on. Environment can critically shape who we are. I also enjoy going running in new places. I find that's a great way to explore the intricate nooks of somewhere new.
Q: Where have you been to that you'd like to return to explore further?
A: Seoul. I was born in Seoul, then adopted at a very young age. I didn't go back until February 2018 for the Winter Olympics. I was so busy with work duties on that trip and follow-up reporting trips, I feel like I really haven't had a chance to get to know the city where I was born.
Q: What is your favorite vacation destination?
A: Vienna, Austria. I was lucky enough to live in Vienna for a few months on a fellowship and have immensely enjoyed going back. The city is a wonderful combination of old Europe and new style, which can be seen in their abundance of museums.
Q: What untapped destination should people know about?
A: Fukushima city, Japan. In the fall of 2017, I traveled to Fukushima to report on their preparation for hosting events at the 2020 Olympics (in Tokyo). While many parts of Fukushima are still uninhabitable after the 2011 (nuclear) disaster, the city of Fukushima is a great destination. Not only are there numerous onsens (hot springs) and great local restaurants, there is resonance in the sincerity of the residents and their hopes for more tourism and to change the perception that all of Fukushima is a permanently damaged area.
Q: What's the most important thing you've learned from your travels?
A: I really like to travel alone, because it gives you the freedom to explore at your own pace. I have cultivated some memorable friendships with people I've randomly met on the road, who I probably wouldn't have talked to or bothered to spend the time to get to know if I encountered them in New York. The city hardens you in a way that is not conducive to the best of human nature, so it's important to remember to let down my guard when I'm traveling.
Q: Where are your favorite weekend getaways?
A. I'm not a real weekend getaway person, but I do enjoy jogging in Central Park or running alongside the Hudson River. Go early, though, because these paths become too crowded later in the day.
Q: What is your best vacation memory?
A: On one of my first days in Seoul in February 2018, I randomly met up with a friend of a friend, who showed me around the city and had me run a lot of errands with her. It was a great way to explore. We ended the night in Itaewon until about five in the morning. She's an Olympic athlete and this was like a week before the Games began, so I'll keep her name confidential.

Texto completo: His biographer notes that "every Supreme Court Justice who served at least five years since 1966 mentioned Friendly by name in an opinion, a remarkable nineteen. Justices of all persuasions respected him." The current Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, John Roberts clerked for Judge Friendly in 1979.
Henry J. Friendly was 16 when he entered Harvard. He had skipped three grades in school and was the valedictorian for the Class of 1919 at Elmira Free Academy.
Not only was he first in his class, editor in chief of the school newspaper, a member of the student council and a member of the Class Song and Motto Committee, but when he graduated, he had the highest score of any student in the 55-year history of the New York State Regents examinations.
According to author David Dorsen, Friendly excelled at Harvard as well, graduating summa cum laude, with a B in a physical training course the only deviation from straight A's.
From Dorsen's book "Henry Friendly, Greatest Judge of His Era":
"At Harvard, Friendly realized the high quality of his Elmira education. 'I looked at the elementary course in English, and it didn't seem to me I'd learn very much from it that I hadn't already learned.' He found he could take an 'anticipatory examination,' which if he passed, would obviate the need to take the course and if he failed would not count against him. 'I was told there was absolutely no chance that that was only for boys who had gone to Exeter and Andover, and places like that, and very few of them get excused. Well I took it and I got excused. So apparently the English instruction in Elmira had been pretty good.'"
Henry Jacob Friendly, born in Elmira on July 3, 1903, was the son of Myer H. and Leah Friendly, and the grandson of Henry and Lena Friendly.
His home was 411 W. Church St. His father was a businessman who owned Friendly Boot and Shoe Co., which was started by Myer's uncle on Baldwin Street. Myer Friendly became president of the company after his uncle retired but later moved to the mortgage business as the shoe business faded.
The Friendlys were members of the High Street Temple, a reformed congregation within the Elmira Jewish community. While Myer and Leah were not particularly observant, Henry's namesake, his grandfather, was a leader in the Jewish community.
According to his obituary published Feb. 23, 1910 in the Star Gazette, "Each of the Elmira synagogues has felt his helping hand when a mortgage was personally lifted by him — mere divergence of a few ideas of worship making no difference in his generous nature."
According to his biographer, when young Friendly was admitted to Harvard, he was ready to leave Elmira. He told an interviewer, "We didn't have a very close family."
During World War I, as a young teenager, he gave speeches and sold war bonds in the towns around Elmira. He preferred reading and long walks to developing friendships.
An illustration of his earnestness as a youth was told by Judge Morris Lasker, whose stepfather grew up in Elmira. It seems Dr. Ben Levy, from Elmira, visited Lasker in Manhattan. Lasker asked him if he would like to meet Friendly, who was also from Elmira. Levy replied, "Hell no. When I was growing up, all I would hear from my mother was, that is not the way Henry Friendly would do it." (Dorsen)
It is noteworthy that at the end of Friendly's junior year at Harvard, President A. Lawrence Lowell proposed limiting the number of Jews to be admitted. His rationale: "There had been a gradual increase in the number of Jewish students ... that was as high as it should get ... it wasn't going to be good for Christian students and it wasn't going to be good for Jewish students."
He believed that Harvard could only survive if it had a majority of old American stock. Antisemitism was very much alive.
According to Friendly, "All hell broke loose." Friendly vowed to leave the school if the policy was not rejected, which it was.
Future Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, then a professor at Harvard Law School, became a mentor for Friendly.
When Friendly graduated from Harvard Law, with what in effect was an A++ average, the first ever summa cum laude graduate, Frankfurter described him as "by long odds one of the ablest lawyers who came out of the Harvard Law School in my time."
Upon leaving law school, Friendly served as a clerk for Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis. After the clerkship, he entered private practice in 1928, becoming a Wall Street lawyer. He was a founding partner of the Cleary Gottlieb Law Firm and became the full-time general counsel for Pan Am Airways. He worked on bankruptcies, argued before the Supreme Court and even negotiated for Pan Am with Howard Hughes to purchase planes.
On Sept. 4, 1930, he married Sophie Stern, of Philadelphia. They settled in New York City and raised three children.
Friendly was in private practice for 31 years until he was appointed to the Second Circuit Court of New York by President Eisenhower in 1959.
His career on the federal court would be one of distinction.
After the 1968 election, he was mentioned in newspapers along with Warren Burger as a potential nominee for Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. His name was raised again for Justice in May of 1969 (with the resignation of Abe Fortas) and in 1971.
Space does not allow for reviewing the significant cases in his career, but his biographer notes that "every Supreme Court Justice who served at least five years since 1966 mentioned Friendly by name in an opinion, a remarkable nineteen. Justices of all persuasions respected him."
The current Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, John Roberts clerked for Judge Friendly in 1979.
In 1977, Judge Friendly received the Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian award, from President Ford.
Friendly observed in the Star-Gazette on Jan. 4, 1977: "I don't know much about the award, but I was at the White House once before and they had excellent food."
Sadly, Friendly became very depressed after the passing of his wife, Sophie. On March 10, 1986, exactly one year after her memorial service, he died by suicide. He was 82.
In his obituary in the New York Times, Chief Judge Feinberg of the Second Circuit called Friendly "one of the greatest Federal judges in the history of the bench."
His biographer notes that "every Supreme Court Justice who served at least five years since 1966 mentioned Friendly by name in an opinion, a remarkable nineteen. Justices of all persuasions respected him." The current Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, John Roberts clerked for Judge Friendly in 1979.

Texto completo: Oh, That Mona Lisa Scowl
The Louvre attracted 10 million visitors in 2018, the overwhelming majority of whom were there to see -- and be seen with -- Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. Jason Farago, an art critic for The New York Times, made the case in a recent article that the painting he calls "the Kim Kardashian of 16th-century Italian portraiture" should be removed for the greater good of the museumgoing experience. Here are some of the passionate reader responses that followed, edited.
I, personally, am sick of hearing people complain about the crowds in front of the Mona Lisa. Yes, they are bad. But no, they are not THAT bad. You can still see the painting just fine if you take your time. The crowds are nothing compared to what the average New Yorker goes through during their daily commute. The painting is a masterpiece. Not only for its artistic merits but also for the mystique surrounding it. It was unconventional for its time. Portraits of women always showed them sitting upright, covered in jewels, dripping in formality. Da Vinci was one of the first to capture a woman relaxed, in simple clothes, giving a genuine expression. DANIEL METZ, BROOKLYN
Comparing the Mona Lisa to Kim Kardashian is a sacrilege. She was a lady, not a California celebrity. MARTHA WATKINS, GENEVA
Over the past 40 years, I have visited the Louvre four times. The first three visits were very satisfying and of course included a viewing of the Mona Lisa. I was able to stay as long as I wished and could even get close enough to inspect the painting as much as my untutored eye could absorb. My last visit to the Mona Lisa, in the spring of 2011, was a terrible experience The photograph of the horde of selfie-takers massed 20 feet deep in front of the painting replicates my experience. Flashes from cellphones and the noise of the milling crowd destroyed the serenity of the portrait, and museum guards did not intervene, possibly because it would have been pointless. The crowd paused, shot a picture and then swarmed on; it is behavior one associates with tourists who simply need to show they were there but who do not desire any deeper connection to the event. There are postcards, posters and books in the Louvre's gift shop that provide much superior mementos. Let them go there and leave the actual picture to those who want a few quiet moments to imagine. JUDITH KLEIST, HAVERTOWN, PA.
Hordes of tourists are literally canceling the world's treasures. Perhaps it's time for all of us to stay put, and instead enjoy our immediate surroundings, say, for a decade. The planet and the locals would be grateful. ALFONSO PAREDES, BROOKLYN
I'd rather explore all the other museums in Paris than fight though the lineup which is there primarily to check off the Mona Lisa box on their Paris stamp card. In fact, I'd pay double for a "no Mona Lisa" entry to the Louvre to avoid the lineup and crowds, but since one doesn't exist, I spent my month in Paris this summer visiting a long list of other fantastic museums and galleries. PAUL DONE, VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA
The problem is not about selfies or photography. It's about selling celebrity and the significant increase in tourism. Anyone who has traveled over the past few decades has experienced insane hordes of tourists packing a few prominent venues where, motivated by tour guides carrying little umbrellas, they worship at a couple of shrines, like Mona, or Venus, or David. TOBI GORDON, TORONTO
As a museum professional, I'm surprised by the many comments wanting to ban cameras. This has largely been seen within the field as a democratization of art. Many people are not able to get to museums, or pay the expensive admission fees, but by spreading images online, the art is available to all. NICOLE BLOOMFIELD, HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON, N.Y

Texto completo: Pitch seems designed to assuage worries about a more radical approach
WAVERLY, Iowa " Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) pitched her new, more flexible approach to government-run health care during a town hall here Saturday afternoon as her campaign tries to move beyond an issue that's mired her for weeks.
Under her proposal, outlined Friday, all Americans would be eligible to participate in Medicare, but it would not be mandatory. Warren said she'd push a full-fledged Medicare-for-all bill through Congress later in her first term.
'I want to do it early, early, early,' Warren told a crowd of nearly 600 at Wartburg College in northeastern Iowa. 'There are millions of people right now who are struggling to pay their medical bills. Let's get them in the door.'
Her new pitch also seems designed to assuage voters worried that her earlier approach would force 150 million people off their private insurance. Her ability to sell this new plan " and refocus her campaign on her larger message of reform " will be a key test for her candidacy.
The toll on her campaign is particularly apparent here in Iowa, where a new poll by the Des Moines Register and CNN released Saturday night showed Warren in a three-way tie for second place with former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), while South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg surged ahead of the pack. The poll shows Buttigieg with 25 percent support and Warren, Biden and Sanders all with about 15 percent support.
Before this most recent poll, an average of five statewide polls since October showed Warren at 20 percent support among likely Democratic caucus-goers, Biden at 18 percent, Buttigieg at 17-percent and Sanders at 16 percent, with other candidates averaging 4 percent or less.
Warren has struggled to outline a plan for health care, saying earlier this month that she supports Sanders's Medicare-for-all plan but would pay for it differently.
On Friday, she announced she will push Congress to pass legislation that allows all Americans to opt into the existing Medicare program in her first 100 days in office and take executive actions even sooner to lower the price of prescription drugs.
She wouldn't push for full-blown Medicare-for-all until the third year of her term.
That has prompted Sanders to adjust, adding a line to his stump speech that contrasts Warren's approach to his.
'Today I tell you that on our first week in office, we are going to introduce Medicare-for-all single-payer legislation,' he said Saturday in East Los Angeles.
Polls consistently show that Iowa Democrats say health care is their top issue and also that many Democrats have conflicted views about Medicare-for-all.
A recent New York Times-Siena College poll found that over 7 in 10 likely caucusgoers support 'a single-payer health care system, which would abolish private insurance and provide every American with a government health insurance.'
But the same poll also found that more Democrats prefer a candidate who 'promises to improve the existing health insurance system' rather than 'replace the current health care system with Medicare-for-all.'
Several who attended Warren's town hall Saturday were relieved by her new approach.
'I like the shift,' said Elizabeth Texley, 43, of Cedar Rapids. Texley works with seniors and hasn't yet decided who she will support in the upcoming caucuses.
'The goal of Medicare-for-all is great,' she said. 'But I don't think you're going to be able to get everybody on board right now.'
Warren's new proposal, Texley added, 'does make it easier to support her.'
Kristina Burroughes, 28, said she wants Medicare-for-all to happen quickly but believes Warren's adjustment is smart strategy. 'It's walking into it instead of diving,' Burroughes said as she waited in line for a photo with the candidate.
In Iowa, Warren also tried to explain how her new plan differs from the proposal laid out by Buttigieg. Her plan, she argued, would get more people on government insurance for less money.
'Mine is about actually giving people Medicare-for-all that is going to be full health-care coverage,' she said when asked about the differences. 'I'm going to bring in as many people as we can right at the beginning.'
Sean Savett, a spokesman for Buttigieg, said that the Buttigieg plan preserves private insurance for those who want it. ' Pete's plan would also achieve universal health care coverage,' he said. 'But unlike Senator Warren, he wouldn't kick tens of millions of American families off their private health care plans because he trusts the American people to choose what's right for them.'
But some voters didn't detect a large difference between the two " aside from timing.
'She's a week late for me,' said Conni Miller, 59 of Waverly, who came to Warren's town hall even though she just committed to support Buttigieg largely because of his heath-care plan.
A key part of Warren's gambit is to remain close enough to Sanders's plan so that his voters would, at some point, support her. But among Sanders's supporters gathered Saturday afternoon, there was deep skepticism.
'I think it's terrible,' said Eduardo Barrio, 23, of San Bernardino, Calif. 'She's not going to be fighting for it.'
'There's a gap [between] them,' he added. 'She's clearly the second-best option, but why have the copy when you can have the OG?'

Texto completo: For the Valley News
I am 66 years old, a “young” senior. I would not even consider running for president of these United States. The logistics wouldn’t work. State dinners would have to end before dark. I don’t much like to drive, even in motorcades, after the sun sets.
Also, I couldn’t forswear watching Jeopardy!, which starts nightly at 7. On the dot.
If I felt like napping and the world was falling apart at the seams, I would take my nap. Russia can wait.
I am not infirmed, but taking on the labors of the so-called Leader of the Free World would be a stretch. At 66, even stretches are a stretch. When I flop on the floor and try to touch my toes without bending my knees, my toes mock me from afar. But so what? You can live a rich life without touching your toes like a yogi. Just say to hell with it and bend your knees.
I have been limbering up in this column until we reach the main point: I am surprised — no, make that amazed — at the advanced age of many of our presidential candidates. I do not question their capacities, though I peek for signs of decline, just as you would inspect an old home for dry rot, bad wiring or bat infestations. We did that insufficiently in 2016.
Our current president (I won’t mention his name since it may be a trigger for some Upper Valley residents) will be 74 on election day 2020. By my math, if the Electoral College once again works its magic and overrules the popular vote, he would be about 78 at the end of a second term. Even if you like his policies, you have to admit that there’s a fair chance that our chief executive in his latter days could be spending his evenings ranting at Fox News in his underwear (notable only if that’s not already the case).
The Democratic candidates offer diversity in age. Babyface Buttigieg, aka Mayor Pete, is 37, born the same year I started working at the Valley News. When I retired at 65, I told a similarly aged colleague that I could still put in a good eight hours, but any more and I would droop. After 5 p.m, it took me two hours to do one hour’s work. Double shift? Only if I was in bed.
Bernie Sanders, whom I admire for his zeal and authentic outrage, is 78 and just had a heart attack. Joe Biden is 76 and looks it. (That’s not to say that “electability” doesn’t make him look 10 years younger to me.) Billionaire Michael Bloomberg might jump into the fray. He’s 77. Elizabeth Warren is a comparatively youthful — seriously, she looks pretty vigorous for her age — 70. If this was a half-mile footrace, I’d put my money on her.
I am not saying they are absolutely too old, but 70 is kind of late to be starting a new job, especially one that calls for forward thinking. Even in my early elderhood the past is calling to me more and more. The kids can fret about artificial intelligence. I’m going to watch another World War II documentary. Kanye West? I’m listening to Crosby, Stills and Nash sing Suite: Judy Blue Eyes for the seven millionth time. I see a classic car from the ’60s roll down Main Street and I am transported. No seatbelts, no problem. You don’t need them on the highway of dreams.
Of course older people can accomplish great things. A story in ARTNews ran under the headline, “Artists who are going strong at 80 and up find that old age offers freedom, self-assurance, and room to explore.” Michelangelo apparently hardly missed a beat before he died in his late 80s. Monet and Mattisse were hot tickets in their 80s as well. My painting has also improved as I’ve aged, but mostly because I’ve finally learned to use blue tape for edging.
All kidding aside, at 66 I sense changes in my outlook on life and work. They are not fatalistic, but realistic. Last year we put a new 25-year roof on our house and I thought, next time it’s someone else’s problem. Comedian George Burns, who was funny well into his ’90s, used to say, “At my age, I don’t even buy green bananas.”
Speaking of them, I am now working in a part-time job where I am happily a second banana. It seems to me that after a certain age the emphasis should not be on climbing the ladder but holding it steady for someone else. Share your wisdom — after all, you have tested out many bad ideas through the years. No need to see them repeated.
The New York Times reported this week that Bernie Sanders is taking better care of himself. He’s walking more and ordering nutritious dishes and salads. I recently found out I’ve got some sludge in a cardiac fuel line (not an actual medical diagnosis) and need to do the same. Hello diets and statins. So long Ben & Jerry’s.
As for me, I would not run for president. I would not walk for president. I would not amble, stroll or saunter. Let the burdens of the future be carried by a younger generation – they are the ones who will have to live in it.
Now should come the softer, slower, healthy season of hummus and spinach for people my age — and, I might add, our elders.

Texto completo: There's a cost to caring too much.
Two prominent mental health counselors – a resilience expert at an Ivy League college and a megachurch pastor – died by suicide in September. At the 2017 U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation's Health Means Business summit, Arianna Huffington, sleep evangelist and author of "The Sleep Revolution: Transforming Your Life, One Night at a Time," said people who toil in the charitable space often have the most trouble detaching from work and, well, going to bed.
Meanwhile, Justin Phillips, a mother who lost her son to a drug overdose, is trying to start the #chooseempathy movement. She founded Overdose Lifeline to raise awareness that addiction is not a choice and requires empathetic responses.
Dr. Judith Orloff, a psychiatrist and self-described empath, agrees society needs more empathy given the rising rates of addiction, suicide and mental illness, among other challenges. But she cautions those who choose to be empathic – or find it comes naturally – about the need to care for themselves first.
The New York Times best-selling author's new book, "Thriving as an Empath: 365 Days of Self-Care for Sensitive People" (Sounds True publishing), is now in stores.
Here, she talks with USA TODAY health policy reporter Jayne O'Donnell, who calls herself an "overempathizer."
Question: How do you know if you are an empath? What are the character traits?
Dr. Judith Orloff: Ordinary empathy is the ability to feel someone else's pain as well as their joy, the ability for us to be open-hearted. It's such a beautiful trait. Being an empath, however, goes further. Empaths have extremely sensitive neurological systems and don't have the usual filters that other people have, so they feel things intensely and often are emotional sponges who take on other people's stress if they don't learn how to set boundaries and practice other self-care techniques ... Most empaths are introverts like myself, but some are extroverts who love socializing but still need to decompress afterwards to take care of themselves.
As part of my research on empaths, I developed a 20-question self-assessment test in my earlier book, "The Empath's Survival Guide," to determine if you are an empath. Some of the questions include: Have I been labeled as overly sensitive? (in a derogatory way). Do crowds drain me, and do I need a lot of alone time to replenish myself? Do I take on other people's stress or emotions? Do I replenish myself in nature? Am I super-sensitive to noise, smells and excessive talking?
Empaths have many special challenges and also many gifts.
Q: There's a clear need for more empathy in our country, isn't there?
Orloff: I believe empathy is the most precious trait in human nature. We need more of it in our country and in the world. Empathy is the ability to put yourself in someone else's shoes so you can see their point of view. Empathy is so powerful because it opens our hearts. It allows us to try to understand another person's position, even if we don't particularly like them or if we disagree on an issue. This gives us the best chance of successfully communicating with them and resolving differences.
Q: But there are risks in caring too much, aren't there?
Orloff: Yes, I've seen many of my patients, including empaths and all sensitive people, care too much and become burned out by empathy overload – or get involved with addictions, including substances, food and sex to numb themselves out. In my psychotherapy practice, there has been an epidemic of empathic patients consulting me who are exhausted, anxious, depressed and overwhelmed by added stress in their personal lives, which is aggravated by our world's non-stop stress.
Arianna Huffington reports that over two-thirds of doctors in the U.S. say they are burned out, depressed or both! Plus the general suicide rate in our country just keeps going up. Those in the helping professions have trouble turning stress off so they also tend to experience impaired sleep and increased anxiety.
Q: What are the most effective ways for empaths to establish boundaries?
Orloff: Taking adequate alone time is essential to decompress. When my empath patients go nonstop in their jobs or as parents – without periodically slowing down – they risk chronic exhaustion, anxiety and overwhelm. Scheduling mini-breaks in your life to take a few deep breaths, spending some quiet time without phone calls, demands or over-stimulation, taking a walk or meditating for even a few minutes will break the momentum of stress and prevent sensory overload.
Also I teach all my patients that "no is a complete sentence."
Q: Shouldn't we all try to be better listeners and responders to those going through hard times?
Orloff: Being a caring listener is one of the great empathic gifts we can give others. But we don't have to listen for hours on end to be effective. Giving someone your caring attention for five to 10 minutes can be very potent, as opposed to getting hooked into repetitive two-hour phone conversations that wear you out. "I love you and I will be thinking of you" is a wonderful thing to say after responding to the person for a limited time. Also, I recommend having short check-ins with the person. A technique I suggest in "Thriving as an Empath" is the "3 Minute Phone Call." This is when you tell the person you're available for this period of time and you want to support them.
As an empathic person, you adore giving, but what I hope my book will provide you with are strategies to give in healthy ways – but also practice self-care so you can be a balanced, happy person.

Texto completo: The coveted Cortaca Jug will boldly go where it has never gone before.
Neither Jim Butterfield Stadium nor SUNY Cortland Stadium will host the annual game between Ithaca College and SUNY Cortland this season.
The Division III football rivals with campuses about 20 miles apart in central New York are hitting the road this year to play at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.
Kickoff is 1 p.m. Saturday.
Here are 10 things to know about the Cortaca Jug:
It'll be a record The largest crowd to see a Division III football game is 37,355. That happened Sept. 23, 2017, when Minnesota rivals St. Thomas and St. John's played at Target Field, home of the Minnesota Twins.
As of about two weeks ago, more than 42,500 tickets had been sold for the Cortaca Jug, Ithaca College Athletic Director Susan Bassett said.
"We've probably expanded a lot of peoples' imagination at this point," Bassett said. "For Division III to have this kind of showcase and this type of interest, everyone thinks it's all about professional sports and Division I sports, but this really sets the bar for interest in Division III athletics."
Doing the math Ithaca and Cortland have been playing for the Jug since 1959, with the Bombers holding a 37-24 lead in Jug games.
But their first football game came in 1930, a 12-0 Cortland victory.
They played 16 times before the first Cortaca Jug. Ithaca leads the overall series, 41-33-3.
The teams played twice in 1988, the Red Dragons winning the Cortaca Jug game, 21-20. Three weeks later they met in an NCAA quarterfinal and the Bombers won, 24-17.
It's more than football Ithaca will be sending 16 buses to New Jersey, many carrying student spectators as well as others who participate in the event.
The Bombers' choir will sing the national anthem, cheer teams will accompany both teams, Ithaca's West African Drumming and Dance Ensemble will perform and students from IC's school of sports management will organize pre-game events
"It's beyond this being a football game," Bassett said. "There are multiple ways people are involved. It's multi-faceted and comprehensive."
Media interest Cortland AD Mike Urtz said he's done interviews with the New York Times and Forbes Magazine in the lead up to the game.
"Our campus is getting unbelievable exposure," he said. "This is probably my fourth interview. When you look at the free marketing and free branding for both institutions, it's been incredible."
Local talent While Cortland and Ithaca are located in Section III and Section IV, respectively, both teams have their share of Section V talent.
For Cortland, senior quarterback and Webster Schroeder graduate Brett Segala headlines the Rochester-area talent.
Segala has started each of the Red Dragons games the past two seasons and has a total of 2,362 yards and 21 touchdowns to 6 interceptions on 164-for-275 passing this season.
Joining Brett Segala are younger brother and fellow Webster Schroeder grad, sophomore Brees Segala, freshman quarterback Jack Johnston from Canandaigua and sophomore running back Dom Gombetto out of Fairport.
Freshman linebackers Jair Ford (Fairport) and Alex Testa (Greece Arcadia), as well as junior defensive lineman Roman Simmons (Brighton) are the Section V alums who help make up the Cortland defense.
The Red Dragons coaching staff also has area ties in assistant coach (Special Teams Coordinator/Tight Ends) Jake Spalik.
Spalik played wide receiver for, graduated from and coached at The College at Brockport, finishing as the Golden Eagles all-time leader in receiving yards for a career and receptions for a career, season and single game.
For Ithaca, the local talent is spread across all three facets of the game and is highlighted by running back, kickoff return specialist and Canandaigua alum, sophomore AJ Clifford.
Clifford leads the Bombers with 23 kickoff returns and 553 yards for a 24.04 average and long of 44 yards.
Other Ithaca players hailing from Section V are sophomore wide receiver Jacob Cooney (Webster Thomas), sophomore linebacker Patrick Bowes (Penfield), freshman offensive lineman Jacob Cole (Pittsford) and freshman tight end Jon Crowley (Victor).
Downstate interest Bassett and Urtz said a major reason ticket sales have been so brisk is the large number of downstate graduates from both schools.
"The alumni gatherings to watch the game down in the city, they were getting larger and larger," Urtz said. "Within the last two years, there were two bar/restaurants in New York City somewhere, one of them hosted Cortland and the other hosted Ithaca and they were across the street and they each had more than 1,000 people just to watch the game. I knew we were going to have a pretty good draw."
Tickets They're still available, plenty of them. If you're looking to go and you're a fan of perusing online ticket sites such as stubhub or ticketmaster, you can find tickets for as low as $20 or as expensive as $500.
Might happen again Bassett said given the interest this year's game has drawn, she wouldn't be surprised if the Cortaca Jug returned to the NYC area in the future.
"We look at this as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity," Bassett said. "At some point is it possible our campus leadership would say, 'Let's do this every four years and we'll alternate who the host team is.' I just have no idea. We haven't gotten that far yet. We're so focused on this experience.
"If you had a couple years to plan, I think this would be so much easier for everybody, but this is all coming together nicely."
What can you bring If you're heading to the game, here's what you can bring:
Clear bags that are 12-by-6-by-12 inches or less in size (one bag per person); small purses/handbags (clutch-type bags) that are 41/2-by-61/2 or less in size (one per person); food of any kind that is contained in a clear plastic bag; plastic bottles of water or soft drinks that are 20 ounces or less; cameras with a lens that is 6 inches or less in length; jackets, blankets or other items, which will be patted down or searched; official national flags that can reasonably be hand held by a single person.
What can't you bring Don't bring these items:
Seat cushions of any size except those for medical needs; glass bottles, cans, coolers of any kind, thermoses or ice chests; alcohol of any kind; banners of any size; flags that are not the official flag of a country; umbrellas, strollers, laser pointers and balls of any kind; video cameras or still photography cameras with a lens longer than six inches; selfie sticks; weapons or any item that may be used as a projectile or one that is deemed dangerous by stadium management; any animal aside from service animals; any item deemed inappropriate by stadium management.

Texto completo: Dartmouth should kill the biomass plan once and for all
The biomass project at Dartmouth College lurks. Despite known deficiencies, college officials waffle about biomass as part of the college’s energy future. Emboldened supporters (mostly woodlot owners and foresters) relentlessly flog this project while scoffing at those who oppose it. Some facts the supporters don’t want to mention:
In a recent New Yorker article, Bill McKibben, a world-renowned environmentalist and the Schumann Distinguished Scholar at Middlebury College, warned of the dangers of biomass.
In a 2017 commentary on VTDigger, Hans Ohanian of Burlington, a physicist and adjunct professor at the University of Vermont, wrote of the Middlebury College biomass plant: “my own number-crunching tells me that this heating plant is horse (manure) rolled in sugar and sold as doughnuts.”
In an Aug. 9 Valley News opinion column, (“Dartmouth’s planned biomass plant would only make things worse”), George Woodwell, a 1950 Dartmouth graduate and founder of the Woods Hole Research Center; William Schlesinger, Dartmouth ’72 and dean emeritus of Duke University’s Nicholas School of the Environment; and John Sterman, Dartmouth ’77 and professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and director of its Sustainability Initiative, wrote: “We urge the college to avoid making a heavy investment in a mistaken assumption that a wood-fired heating plant will benefit the college or the world.”
On its own website, Dartmouth states: “To reach our long term, ambitious goals, we will likely have to transition away from generating heat with combustion, period.”
Temporizing about climate change is neither vision nor leadership. Vacillating about climate change is not an option for my grandchildren. Absolute clarity about this biomass project is essential. So let me propose the following: The college should plunge the “Green Initiative” flag into the heart of this biomass project and kill it once and for all.

All the news that’s fit ...
The board of commissioners in Citrus County, Fla., recently voted to deny the county library system’s request for funding for a digital subscription to The New York Times, with commissioners saying they support President Donald Trump and accusing the Times of printing “fake news.”
The Valley News has often presented articles and commentary that have been critical of the president. Is the Valley News producing “fake news”? Should the towns in the Upper Valley vote to remove the Valley News from their libraries?
JEFFREY BELL

Put the focus on sports
First off, congratulations to Hanover High School’s soccer and field hockey teams for winning their state championships. I commend the hard work, good sportsmanship, and fair and aggressive play all three teams demonstrated throughout the season.
This sports fan, however, is disappointed in the Valley News’ preference for depicting female athletes celebrating their wins rather than giving them the proper sports coverage they deserve.
While I wholeheartedly believe in the importance of being a supportive teammate, I would have rather seen a Valley News photo of field hockey goaltender Ella Edmonds saving a sick shot than of her receiving a kiss from a teammate. Reading about Pepper Joseph sprinting toward goal on a breakaway would have been more interesting to me than reading about her kissing and twirling around with the team’s trophy.
Please, Valley News, more action and less kissing in your sports section.

Texto completo: A new exhibition that opens Sunday at the Walker is a look at collecting, the expressive potential of the human body, and how different artists have portrayed the body, from Max Beckmann to Andy Warhol.
Curated by Joan Rothfuss, “The Expressionist Figure: The Miriam and Erwin Kelen Collection of Drawings” features some 100 works on paper by 73 artists. Most were recently donated to the Walker by the Kelens, who are longtime patrons. Rothfuss also included related drawings and sculpture from the Walker’s collection.
The show invites us to see the body in ways both familiar and new. Spanning more than a century of experimentation by artists working in the United States and Europe – the earliest drawing dates from 1900, the latest from 2018 – works include portraits, figure studies, social satire, narrative, fantasy and erotica. Media range from crayon, ink, and graphite to watercolor, pastel and collage. Along with Beckman and Warhol, artists include Jim Denomie, Henri Matisse, Christo, Pablo Picasso, Claes Oldenburg, David Hockney, Joan Miró, Egon Schiele, Zak Smith, and Edgar Degas.
“The Expressionist Figure” will be on view in the Walker’s Burnet Gallery through April 19, 2020. If you want to bring it home, there’s an exhibition catalog in the gift shop(s) with full-page color reproductions of each drawing, an essay by Erwin Kelen, an introduction by Rothfuss, along with her short essays on 14 of the works, and a foreword by the Walker’s new ED, Mary Ceruti.
On Jan. 30 at 6 p.m., you can tour the exhibition with Walker curatorial fellow William Hernandez-Luege for free. No tickets required, just show up.
The picks
Opens tonight (Friday, Nov. 15) at Theatre in the Round: “Agatha Christie’s Towards Zero.” As Park Square Theatre has a way with Sherlock Holmes, Theatre in the Round has a history with Christie. “Towards Zero” is its latest holiday toast to the Queen of Crime. Originally a novel (1944), it was adapted into a play (1956) by Christie and Gerald Verner. But only recently (2015) was it discovered that Christie had written her own adaptation for the stage. The theater at Seven Corners will present this version, directed by Wendy Resch Novak, who returns to TRP for her fourth Christie play. The setting is a clifftop manor on the English seaside, where a house party is interrupted by a brutal murder. 7:30 p.m. FMI and tickets ($22). Runs Fridays-Sundays through Dec. 15.
Saturday at MacPhail: MacPhail Spotlight Series: “Locally Sourced.” For an evening of Minnesota music and stories, artistic director Mischa Santora has promised a Prince cover. For the rest, composer Libby Larsen has set music to words by Minnesota and North Dakota poets; her “Jazz at the Intergalactic Nightclub” will be performed by tenor Dennis Peterson and pianist Timothy De Prey. Pina Basgöze and Susana Pinto will play a pair of piano duos by Greg Theisen, and Fred and J.D. Steele (of the famous Steeles) will share songs. 7:30 p.m. Preconcert talk at 6:30. FMI; for tickets ($25/15), call 612-767-5250.
Saturday at the O’Shaughnessy: “Band Together: An Event to Benefit Climate Generation.” We know, this comes right after Give to the Max, but dig into your pockets if you can. Hosted by Climate Generation: A Will Steger Legacy, this will be a night of music, storytelling and climate action. Featured performer and emcee Xiuhtezcatl, a 19-year-old indigenous rapper climate activist, will be joined by a strong lineup of Minnesota artists: Astralblak, Chastity Brown, Strong Buffalo, Chris Koza, Lazerbeak, Eric Mayson, Jeremy Messersmith, Lucy Michelle, Ben Weaver and Aby Wolf. Artist pre-party at 5:30, concert at 7. FMI and tickets ($55; with pre-party, $125).
Saturday and Sunday at the Ted Mann: University Opera Theatre Presents Peter Brook’s “Carmen’s Tragedy.” Every semester, students at the U of M present a fully-staged operatic production – no small feat. Brook’s “Carmen,” last seen here in a Feb. 2017 production by Skylark Opera, is shorter than Bizet’s, packing all the fire, intensity and emotion of the original (and the best music) into 90 minutes. David Walsh directs; Ho-Yin Kwok will conduct the chamber ensemble in this contemporary take on a classic tale. 7:30 p.m. Saturday, 1:30 p.m. Sunday. FMI and tickets ($26/15/7).
Sunday at the Dakota: The Jeremy Walker/Clara Osowski Quartet: Ellington + Originals: Jazz Art Song. Just over a year ago, award-winning mezzo-soprano Clara Osowski and jazz pianist and composer Jeremy Walker released their first album together, “Haunted Blue.” It was a new direction for both of them, and magical. They’re working on another project, using poems from Edna St. Vincent Millay, and exploring new arrangements of Duke Ellington favorites. And they’ve added drummer JT Bates to the mix, turning their trio with bassist Anthony Cox into a quartet. 7 p.m. FMI and tickets ($20).
Monday at Minneapolis Central Library: Talk of the Stacks: Carmen Maria Machado. Machado was a 2018 National Book Award finalist for her breakthrough story collection “Her Body and Other Parties,” published by Graywolf Press. That was a mix of horror, comedy, science fiction and fantasy the New York Times described as “a wild thing … covered in sequins and scales.” Just out from Graywolf, “In the Dream House” is her unconventional memoir, the story of an abusive relationship with a former girlfriend. Machado is a fast-rising literary star, so you might want to arrive early. 6:15 doors, 7 p.m. program. Overflow seating with live feed will be available. A book signing will follow. FMI.

Texto completo: Utah Sen. Mike Lee, who was sharply critical of Donald Trump in 2016 and withheld his vote from Trump in the last election, admits that he “took the scenic route” to becoming a fan of the nation’s 45th leader.
But he’s certainly arrived there now, with a Friday announcement that he will co-chair Trump’s reelection effort in Utah along with former Sen. Orrin Hatch and several others. Speaking at an event in the Utah Capitol — where second lady Karen Pence also made an appearance — Lee commended those who were quicker than he to embrace the president.
“Look, some of you in this room, some of you in our state were wise enough to see where this was heading a few years ago. You were quick and astute enough to see the gift that President Trump and Vice President Pence would be to the United States of America,” the Utah Republican said. “Some of us took a little bit more time.”
Lee cast what he previously called a “protest vote” for independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin in the 2016 general election. During that year’s campaign, he called for Trump to step down after release of the “Access Hollywood” tape and was critical of him for proposing a “religious test” in deciding to ban Muslims from entering the United States.
He also sided with “never Trump” delegates at the Republican National Convention, in a rowdy attempt to free pledged delegates to vote their consciences rather than being bound by results from their local primaries or caucuses. Speaking to reporters Friday, Lee said he never identified as a “never Trumper” and asserted that the convention rule-change effort was incorrectly portrayed by the media as an anti-Trump maneuver.
During his speech Friday, Lee said he was “not going to make any excuses” for his initial discomfort with Trump, but explained that he warmed to the president over time. He was unable to pinpoint the exact moment he changed his mind about Trump, instead referencing a period shortly after the 2016 elections when he and the president began to converse and develop an understanding. While the two don’t see eye to eye on every issue, the senator said they’ve found they agree more often than not.
Trump won Utah in 2016 without a majority, landing about 45% of the vote — the worst showing for a Republican presidential candidate in the state since 1992, when George H.W. Bush mustered just 41% after independent Ross Perot drained 26%.
Lee predicted in an interview that the incumbent president will perform better in Utah next year — and that the ongoing impeachment inquiry will only strengthen him.
“The Democrats have overreached on this. I think he’s been treated unfairly in the House,” Lee told reporters. “I think people throughout our state and many other places across the country will see that and people will be more sympathetic to him as a result.”
Pence also spoke at the event, which took place after she had filed paperwork to add Trump’s name to the Republican primary ballot next year.
Pence highlighted Trump’s appointment of conservative judges to the federal courts, his focus on religious rights and the nation’s low unemployment rates.
“Make no mistake about it: We are getting things done. America has the strongest economy in the history of the world,” Pence said.
Later, urging the roomful of supporters to contribute to Trump’s reelection effort, she said: “This election is about jobs, it’s about security and it’s about our liberties. We are winning under President Trump’s leadership, and to keep winning, we need four more years.”
Thomas Wright, national committeeman for the Utah GOP and a potential contender in state’s next gubernatorial contest, also spoke in glowing terms of the Trump administration during the kickoff of the president’s formal reelection bid in Utah. He credited the president for the “decimation of ISIS and just wiping them off the face of the Earth." (Analysts have said the recent death of the Islamic State’s leader in a U.S. raid will hurt the organization but will not eradicate it, The New York Times has reported.)
He also praised Trump’s judicial appointments.
“Is there any better accomplishment than Justice Gorsuch and Kavanaugh?” he said to loud applause.
In addition to Lee and Hatch, Trump’s Utah ground game will be led by U.S. Rep. Rob Bishop, Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, Utah Sen. President Stuart Adams, community leader Don Peay, policy leader Ron Fox and U.S. Rep. Chris Stewart — who serves on the House Intelligence Committee that is currently conducting an impeachment inquiry into Trump.

Bloomberg will not save the Democrats

Texto completo: WARNING: Parts of this column may bear strong resemblance to my earlier columns when Michael Bloomberg toyed with running for president, because with Bloomberg, history has a way of repeating itself.
Every four years, Michael Bloomberg hears something virtually no other American hears: a groundswell of support for a Michael Bloomberg presidential candidacy. Now, as the 2020 Democratic primaries rapidly approach, he’s hearing it again.
Bloomberg, a fairly successful mayor of New York and a fabulously successful businessman, has an estimated net worth of $52 billion. Without that fortune, nobody would be talking about a Bloomberg candidacy at this late date. But with his money, Bloomberg could self-finance a run from start to finish without ever having to ask a single donor for a penny. That gives him freedom to float a would-be candidacy long after the field has been set.
This time, Bloomberg, who in his political life has been a Democrat, a Republican, an independent and now a Democrat again, is setting a personal record by flirting twice in a single cycle.
Last spring, there was a ripple of speculation about a 2020 Bloomberg candidacy. On March 5, Bloomberg put an end to it when he announced flatly, "I’m not running for president." Instead, he said, he would pour his energy and resources into a new climate change project called Beyond Carbon.
Now, however, he has apparently moved beyond Beyond Carbon. Last week, The New York Times reported that Bloomberg is "actively preparing to enter the Democratic presidential primary."
"Mike is increasingly concerned that the current field of candidates is not well positioned to [defeat Trump]," Bloomberg adviser Howard Wolfson told the paper. "If Mike runs he would offer a new choice to Democrats built on a unique record running America’s biggest city, building a business from scratch and taking on some of America’s toughest challenges as a high-impact philanthropist."
Bloomberg is said to be concerned — and it is a legitimate concern — that the current Democratic field has moved too far left, embracing policies like Medicare for All, virtually open borders, free college and wealth taxes. That’s what Wolfson meant when he said the field is "not well positioned" to beat Trump.
But there is no indication that voters believe Bloomberg is the solution to the problem. This latest tease is too recent for any reliable polling — although one survey found Bloomberg with the highest negatives in the field — but in the past, he has never been a voter favorite outside the confines of New York City.
Bloomberg is being pressed into action by states with early primary filing deadlines. He has already placed his name on the ballot for the Alabama primary, and a short time later flew to Arkansas to file there.
Alabama and Arkansas are fine, but what about Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina — the first states to cast votes and award delegates? Bloomberg has apparently decided to blow them off.
"In a dramatic acknowledgment of his own late start in the race," the Times reported, "Mr. Bloomberg and his advisers have decided that he would pursue a risky strategy of skipping all four traditional early state contests ... and focus instead on big states that hold primaries soon afterward."
Instead of "risky strategy," one might substitute "crazy strategy." Candidates in the past have sometimes tried to skip an early primary or caucus, but skipping all four at the beginning is a sure way to lose. Bloomberg predecessor Rudy Giuliani essentially tried it in the Republican contest in 2008, and by the time the first four primaries were over, voters barely remembered Giuliani was in the race.
The same will likely happen to Bloomberg, if he goes through with it. Recall the excitement and 24/7 media attention that precedes the Iowa caucuses, and then the shift to New Hampshire, and so on. Bloomberg won’t be a part of that. He can buy all the ads he wants telling people to just wait until he gets in, but there will be Democratic winners chosen by the voters of the first four state contests who cannot be ignored.
Also, if Bloomberg jumps in, voters will eventually recognize that he, like Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, is too old to be president. Bloomberg will be nearly 79 on Inauguration Day 2021. Like Biden, who will be 78, and Sanders, who will be 79, Bloomberg will have to convince voters that a president in his 80s — never before seen in American history — is nothing to worry about.
Bloomberg’s move is a symptom of Democratic anxiety. We’ve seen it before, in both parties. At the beginning of a primary season, with a big field of candidates starting the race, the party faithful say, "Isn’t this great? We have so many good candidates — almost an embarrassment of riches!" Then, after several months of campaigning, they say, "Can’t somebody enter this race and save us?"
The answer is no. The Democratic field is what it is. One of the candidates in the race right now will win the nomination, go on to face President Donald Trump, and have a chance to become the next president. There’s no savior waiting to rescue Democrats — and that includes Michael Bloomberg.

Welcome to the 'Neighborhood,' Tom Hanks How director persuaded actor to play Fred Rogers

Texto completo: By the time she was 4 years old, Marielle Heller had already rejected "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood." As the eldest of three, she saw her younger siblings watching the PBS show and felt she had grown "too jaded and cynical" for Fred Rogers' brand of cheery positivity.
It wasn't until decades later, when she became a parent herself, that the filmmaker gave Rogers another shot. When her son turned 2, the first television program she and her husband allowed him to watch was "Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood." The animated kids series, which launched in 2012, is produced by Fred Rogers Productions and espouses many of the same values as the original Rogers show - teaching children how to deal with difficult emotions like anger, disappointment and loss.
"It's like the parenting hack of all parenting hacks," Heller said. "It makes you a better parent, I swear to God, because it gives you, like, tips on how to deal with your children. And there's an episode for everything. When you're potty training, there's an episode that we all have sung and quoted a bajillion times that's, like, 'When you need to go potty, stop and go right away! Flush and wash and be on your way.' "
Heller was steeped in the world of Daniel Tiger when the screenplay for "A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood" came across her desk a couple of years ago. She'd worked with the writers of the script, Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster, on Amazon's "Transparent," and they'd mentioned they were trying to get a film made about Mister Rogers. At the time, however, the movie already had a director attached, but Heller nonetheless asked: "Why am I not directing that?
"I said something very bold like that because it felt so up my alley, being a mom with a little kid," Heller recalled with a laugh.
By the time she was offered the directing gig on "A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood" - which Sony Pictures will release on Nov. 22 - Heller had been anointed one of Hollywood's top directors to watch. She made her directorial debut in 2015 with the critical darling "The Diary of a Teenage Girl," about a 15-year-old's sexual awakening. Heller's follow-up, last year's "Can You Ever Forgive Me?" was even better received. The film, which earned star Melissa McCarthy an Academy Award nomination, told the story of an author who forged letters by famous artists to make ends meet.
And - to the surprise of the producers on the Rogers film - she had also formed a relationship with the actor most coveted for the lead role: Tom Hanks. Coming off a period in which he'd played a handful of iconic real-life figures, including Capt. Chesley "Sully" Sullenberger and Walt Disney, Hanks had already passed on the "Neighborhood" script three times.
Heller had become friendly with the actor after meeting him at a backyard birthday party held by his son, Colin Hanks. During the gathering, Tom Hanks mentioned he'd just read an article in The New York Times about female directors. Heller pointed out she'd been quoted in the piece. Upon learning more about her, Hanks promised to watch "The Diary of a Teenage Girl." He made good on his word and set up a meeting with the filmmaker, telling her, "We gotta find a way to work together."
For years, Heller said, she and the actor would stay in touch, sending potential projects to each other. So when the team behind the Rogers film expressed how badly they wanted Hanks for their movie, Heller said she'd give it her best shot.
"So I called him and I described how I saw the movie - that I didn't want it to be a biopic," she remembered. "It was never going to be a prosthetics thing - it wasn't going to be about trying to make him look just like (Rogers). It was really a character piece about manhood and what it is to be a good person. And he was like, 'Oh, OK, lemme go read the script with all of that in mind,' and signed on like a week later."
"A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood" is far from a Rogers biopic. In fact, Hanks plays the supporting character in the film, which stars Matthew Rhys as an Esquire journalist tasked with profiling the TV legend. Based on Tom Junod's 1998 magazine article about Rogers, the movie explores the effect the star had had on the writer, revealing less about himself in interviews than expressing a genuine interest in the journalist himself.
Shortly after the movie was greenlit, Morgan Neville's hit documentary about Rogers, "Won't You Be My Neighbor?" was released in theaters. The movie collected $22.8 million in theaters, making it a huge box office success for a nonfiction film. At first, Heller admitted, "We had a moment where we kind of were, like, 'Oh, is this a good thing or a bad thing?' And then we thought, 'Oh, more Fred Rogers in the world? This is a good thing."
Before filming began, Heller visited Pittsburgh, where Rogers lived and worked for nearly his entire life. She visited the Fred Rogers Co., meeting with executives who'd worked there for nearly four decades and had been integral to the PBS show. She went to Latrobe, Pennsylvania, Rogers' hometown, where his archives are housed, sifting through the boxes of letters, photographs and emails he'd meticulously stored until his death in 2003.
She also met with Rogers' widow, 91-year-old Joanne Rogers, who lent her late husband's ties to the production and frequently visited the set during shooting.
What Hanks said he admired about Heller's approach to conveying Rogers' beliefs was that she made it a "slow-cooking recipe" without "fakery or trickery," allowing the character to express his identity through his actions instead of words.
Rogers "was not introduced as: here's the most important man there is," the actor explained. "She captured who he was without trying to explain it. She showed it through his behavior and the behavior of others when they were around him."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump is asking the Supreme Court to block a subpoena for his tax returns, in a test of the president's ability to defy investigations.
The filing Thursday sets the stage for a high court showdown over the tax returns Trump has refused to release, unlike every other modern president. The justices also could weigh in more broadly on Trump's claim that sitting presidents can't be prosecuted or investigated for crimes.
The subpoena from the Manhattan district attorney is seeking Trump's tax returns back to 2011 from his accounting firm as part of a criminal investigation. Trump's lawyers say a criminal probe of the president at the state or local level is unconstitutional and unprecedented in American history.
Lower courts have rejected Trump's claims of immunity.
The Supreme Court justices may not decide whether to hear the case for at least another month.
A second, similar case is headed to the court over a House committee subpoena demanding Trump's financial records from the same accounting firm. The president has lost both cases at each step of the judicial system so far. The Mazars USA firm has said it will comply with the subpoenas, if courts agree.
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. is seeking the records in a broader probe that includes payments made to buy the silence of two women, adult film actress Stormy Daniels and model Karen McDougal, who claim they had affairs with Trump before the 2016 election. Trump has denied the claims.
Brexit Party fails to clinch voting pact with Conservatives
LONDON - Britain's Brexit Party has failed to reach a tactical voting pact with the ruling Conservatives, saying Thursday that it will field 300 candidates in next month's election to force Prime Minister Boris Johnson to deliver on his promise of a clean break with the European Union.
Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said the party had to contest the seats in Britain's Dec. 12 election to keep the pressure on Johnson, rebuffing Conservative arguments that doing so risks splitting the pro-Brexit vote and boosts parties that want to remain in the EU.
Britain is holding a national election on Dec. 12 because Johnson wants to secure a majority so he can take the U.K. out of the bloc.
Johnson reached a Brexit deal with the EU but has not persuaded enough British lawmakers to pass it.
Pastor: Jimmy Carter 'up and walking' post brain surgery
ATLANTA - Former President Jimmy Carter was already "up and walking" just a day after undergoing surgery to relieve pressure on his brain from bleeding linked to recent falls, his pastor said.
The Rev. Tony Lowden visited Carter, 95, in an Atlanta hospital on Wednesday.
"His spirits are good and he is up and walking," Lowden told reporters.
Carter Center spokeswoman Deanna Congileo has said there were no complications during Carter's Tuesday surgery at Emory University Hospital for a subdural hematoma, blood trapped on the brain's surface.
The center said the bleeding was connected to Carter's recent falls. A Spring fall required Carter to get hip replacement surgery. He fell twice in October, hitting his head at least once.
Trump Jr.'s book is a No. 1 bestseller, but with an edge
NEW YORK - Donald Trump Jr.'s "Triggered" is a No. 1 New York Times bestseller, although not without an edge.
"Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us" came out last week and tops the hardcover nonfiction list that will appear in the Times on Nov. 24.
A dagger symbol appears next to the listing, indicating that some of the sales were "bulk purchases," often meaning that the author or someone associated with the author bought a substantial number of copies. A spokesman for the Republican National Committee, Steve Guest, said the RNC has been offering "Triggered" as a fundraising incentive, a common practice for political books.
Guest said copies were bought "to keep up with demand," not in a "large bulk purchase."
North Korea: US offers to restart nuclear talks
SEOUL, South Korea - North Korea on Thursday said the United States has proposed a resumption of stalled nuclear negotiations in December as they approach an end-of-year deadline set by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for the Trump administration to offer an acceptable deal to salvage the talks.
In a statement released by state media, North Korean negotiator Kim Myong Gil didn't clearly say whether the North would accept the supposed U.S. offer.
He said North Korea has no interest in talks aimed at buying time without discussing solutions. He said the North isn't willing to make a deal over "matters of secondary importance," such as possible U.S. offers to formally declare an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, which was halted by a cease-fire, not a peace treaty, or establish a liaison office between the nations.
US implores EU nations to retake fighters from IS group
WASHINGTON - European and other members of the international coalition fighting the Islamic State group must take back and prosecute their nationals detained in Iraq and Syria to help keep IS from regaining territory, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Thursday.
Pompeo told foreign ministers and senior officials from about 30 coalition members that it's imperative that they hold thousands of detained foreign fighters accountable for atrocities committed while IS held swathes of territory in the two countries.
Many of the detained foreign fighters are from Europe, but countries have been reluctant to take them back and officials acknowledged there are still differences of opinion among coalition partners about how best to deal with them.
In South Carolina: A school shooter who was 14 when he killed a first grader on a school playground in South Carolina after killing his father in their home was sentenced Thursday to life in prison without parole.
Jesse Osborne, now 17, crashed his father's pickup truck into the fence on Sept. 28, 2016 and fired on first graders at Townville Elementary School celebrating a classmate's birthday.
But Osborne's lawyers noted he never tried to get inside the school, even though police took 12 minutes to arrive.
Osborne, who was tried as an adult, had left a video chat open on his cellphone and witnesses said he was pacing outside, crying and saying he was sorry. Jacob Hill, 6, was killed.

Texto completo: Our guide to plays and musicals coming to New York stages and a few last-chance picks of shows that are about to close. Our reviews of open shows are at nytimes.com/reviews/theater .
Previews & Openings
'A CHRISTMAS CAROL' at the Lyceum Theater (in previews; opens on Nov. 20). Ghosts of Broadway past, present and future unite in a new adaptation of the Charles Dickens Yuletide-cheer monger. The playwright Jack Thorne and the director Matthew Warchus weave Christmas songs into the tale of a miser redeemed. Campbell Scott stars, with Andrea Martin and LaChanze as spirits.

'FEFU AND HER FRIENDS' at the Polonsky Shakespeare Center (previews start on Nov. 16; opens on Nov. 24). After a four-decade absence, María Irene Fornés's lapidary comedy-drama, an early example of a promenade play, returns Off Broadway. At a country house, in 1935, eight women gather to discuss love, violence, gender and philosophy. Lileana Blain-Cruz directs a cast that includes Amelia Workman and Jennifer Lim.

'THE HALF-LIFE OF MARIE CURIE' at the Minetta Lane Theater (in previews; opens on Nov. 19). Most of Audible's theatrical enterprises are solo efforts, but to tell the story of an episode from the life of the physicist and chemist Marie Curie, it takes two. In Lauren Gunderson's drama, Francesca Faridany stars as Curie, with Kate Mulgrew as the engineer Hertha Ayrton, who spent a summer with Curie in 1912. Gaye Taylor Upchurch directs.

'THE INHERITANCE' at the Barrymore Theater (in previews; opens on Nov. 17). Three generations of gay men live, grieve, love and mourn through the six and a half hours of Matthew Lopez's modern epic, which Matt Wolf called "capaciously moving" when it was staged in London last year. The play arrives on Broadway directed by Stephen Daldry and starring the original cast members John Benjamin Hickey, Paul Hilton and Andrew Burnap, as well as Lois Smith.
212-239-6200, theinheritanceplay.com
'MEASURE FOR MEASURE' at the Public Theater (previews start on Nov. 18; opens on Nov. 22). The Public's Mobile Unit has been solving Shakespeare's political problem play at correctional facilities, homeless shelters and community centers throughout the five boroughs. The production, directed by LA Williams, now returns to the theater with a reminder of how lawmakers place their own interests above the commonweal.
212-967-7555, publictheater.org
'THE UNDERLYING CHRIS' at the Tony Kiser Theater at Second Stage Theater (in previews; opens on Nov. 21). Will Eno, a playwright who packs big emotions and big ideas into small, nondescript packages, returns with a new play. Inspired in part by his young daughter, it is a meditation on identity and the things that make and mar us. Kenny Leon directs a cast that includes Hannah Cabell and Michael Countryman.
212-246-4422, 2st.com
Last Chance
'THE HEIGHT OF THE STORM' at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater (closes on Nov. 24). Florian Zeller's drama about a couple, long married and possibly dead, divorces itself from Broadway. Jesse Green wrote that Zeller's "idée fixe about unfixed consciousness gets its fullest and least rewarding workout." Still, he praised the play's stars, Jonathan Pryce and Eileen Atkins, "who face the adversity of the text in contrastingly and compulsively watchable ways."
212-239-6200, manhattantheatreclub.com
'HEROES OF THE FOURTH TURNING' at Playwrights Horizons (closes on Nov. 17). Will Arbery's anguished moonlit chat with young Christian conservatives ends its Off Broadway run. Jesse Green wrote that this astonishing play, set in Wyoming and directed by Danya Taymor, "explores the lives and ideas of conservatives with affection, understanding and deep knowledge -- if not, ultimately, approval."
212-279-4200, playwrightshorizons.org
'IS THIS A ROOM' at the Vineyard Theater (closes on Nov. 24). Tina Satter's lauded play, based on a transcript of an F.B.I. interview with the whistle-blower Reality Winner, ends its interrogation. Ben Brantley praised the "almost forensic detail" of Emily Davis's central performance and the nerve-shredding over all. "Unlike more classic high-anxiety plays -- say, 'Oedipus Rex' or 'Macbeth' -- this production isn't about to offer you the cleansing release of catharsis," he wrote.
212-353-0303, vineyardtheatre.org
'SOFT POWER' at the Public Theater (closes on Nov. 17). David Henry Hwang and Jeanine Tesori's new play, a multinational, metatheatrical meditation on creativity and control, lowers its curtain. Directed by Leigh Silverman, this show about an Asian-American playwright contracted to write a musical for a Chinese impresario is, as Jesse Green wrote, "something of a miracle but also something of a muddle."

Texto completo: The Turkish leader clashed with a Republican senator and returned President Trump's pointed letter warning against a military incursion into Syria.
WASHINGTON -- To outward appearances, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey enjoyed a genial visit to the White House on Wednesday, where he and President Trump exchanged compliments and resolved to work out multiple policy disputes between Washington and Ankara.
But behind the scenes, the visit featured some tense and awkward moments that have come into clearer view only after Mr. Erdogan's departure. Among them was an unusual Oval Office meeting Mr. Trump convened with Mr. Erdogan and five Republican senators, some of whom challenged the Turkish leader in sharp terms, according to attendees.
On his return to Turkey, Mr. Erdogan was rewarded with accolades from pro-government news outlets for standing up to Mr. Trump by returning a blustery letter Mr. Trump sent him in October. In the message, Mr. Trump warned the Turkish leader, "Don't be a fool," by launching a military operation against Kurdish fighters in northeastern Syria. Mr. Erdogan ignored the warning and sent troops across the border on Oct. 9.
"We gave back the letter that we have received," Mr. Erdogan said Wednesday during a joint news conference with Mr. Trump. On his plane home, Mr. Erdogan said the White House "had no reaction" to his gesture, according to the Turkish news channel NTV.
While Mr. Erdogan himself did not gloat, pro-government news outlets in Turkey did. The Daily Sabah ran an article under the headline "Decisive Stance From Erdogan," noting that the letter "was returned to its owner by hand." Hurriyet and Milliyet, two newspapers owned by a pro-government conglomerate, also announced the return of the letter on their front pages.
The White House declined to comment, and Mr. Trump did not mention the letter on Wednesday.
Mr. Erdogan also went on the offensive in his meeting with the senators. Sitting beside Mr. Trump in the Oval Office, he surprised the lawmakers by producing an iPad to play a video depicting atrocities said to have been committed by two Kurdish groups, the People's Protection Units, known as the Y.P.G., and the Kurdistan Workers' Party, known as the P.K.K.
The Y.P.G. played an instrumental role in the fight against the Islamic State, working closely with United States military forces. Turkey calls it an offshoot of the P.K.K., a separatist organization that the State Department has designated as a terrorist group. Mr. Erdogan insists he is unfairly branded as anti-Kurd, and objects only to Kurdish groups he calls a threat to Turkey's security.
Mr. Erdogan told reporters on his plane that Mr. Trump was "very impressed" by the video, according to NTV.
But the Turkish leader was also on the receiving end of stinging words.
Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who was among the Republican attendees in the Oval Office meeting, recounted on Thursday that Mr. Erdogan -- a strongman rarely challenged directly at home -- "went nuts" after Mr. Graham used the word "invasion" to describe Turkey's widely condemned military offensive against the Kurdish fighters.
"I said, 'Well, the reason it's an invasion is that's exactly what you did,"' Mr. Graham said. "I warned you not to do it. And everything that I was worried about came true in spades."
In response to Mr. Erdogan's video, Mr. Graham recalled, "I said, 'Want me to get the Kurds to make one about what you're doing?"'
Analysts said that Mr. Trump probably hoped such exchanges would demonstrate for his Turkish counterpart, with whom he has sought warm relations, the pressure he faces from members of Congress who are furious over the Turkish military action in Syria, as well as Turkey's purchase of a Russian antiaircraft missile system. Leaders of both parties in Congress have called for sanctions to punish the moves by Turkey, a North Atlantic Treaty Organization ally that under Mr. Erdogan's leadership has moved toward authoritarianism, including closer ties with Russia.
Mr. Trump said he wanted to salvage that relationship, and on Wednesday he cited a 70-year alliance between Washington and Ankara forged during the Cold War, when Turkey feared Soviet domination.
The Republican senators in attendance -- Mr. Graham, Joni Ernst of Iowa, Jim Risch of Idaho, Ted Cruz of Texas and Rick Scott of Florida -- share that view, but have been far more willing than Mr. Trump to criticize the Turkish leader.
"Primarily, this was Trump's favor to Erdogan, allowing him to plead his case directly with the Republican senators in an attempt to prevent a veto-proof sanctions vote against Turkey," said Aykan Erdemir, a former member of Turkey's Parliament and now a senior fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington.
"Trump would have also seen this as an opportunity to demonstrate that he alone does not call all the shots on U.S. foreign and security policy, so as to lower Erdogan's expectations from him personally," Mr. Erdemir added.
Mr. Risch, who serves as the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said he and the other senators who attended had explained to the Turkish president that the mood of Congress was "very clearly not in his favor." He added that Mr. Erdogan's tone had been "defensive."
Mr. Risch said he told Mr. Erdogan that he would effectively block Turkey from receiving any American F-35 fighter jets, which it helped develop in partnership with the Atlantic alliance, as long as the country retains the Russian surface-to-air missile systems, known as the S-400. Defense Department officials say that operating the advanced F-35 in proximity to a Russian system could compromise the plane's technology. Mr. Risch and other leading members of Congress also say that Turkey's acquisition of the missile system should set off sanctions under a 2017 law meant to punish the purchase of Russian military hardware by other nations.
"The president I can tell you was sitting right there when we delivered this very hard message," Mr. Risch added. "Erdogan did not look to him for help and the president did not offer help."
Mr. Risch said he hopes to move a bipartisan package of sanctions against Turkey that he sponsored with Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the panel, although not until "negotiations have fallen off the rails."
Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general, met Thursday with Mr. Trump and discussed, among other matters, the S-400 sale. European diplomats said a compromise was possible, and both sides were signaling they wanted one. But one diplomat said the technical hurdles to reaching some sort of deal that is acceptable to both sides remained a challenge.
"There is a strong motivation, drive to solve the disagreement," Mr. Stoltenberg said. "And if we are not able to solve the disagreement, to find a way to avoid it undermining the alliance."
Mr. Trump also held a second meeting with Republican senators on Thursday, including Mr. Cruz, Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming, Steve Daines of Montana, Michael D. Crapo of Idaho and Kevin Cramer of North Dakota.
"Having some relationship, even with your adversaries, makes sense, particularly one that still is a NATO ally, and we still have obviously some very strong interest in," Mr. Cramer said.
After the White House publicly released Mr. Trump's Oct. 9 letter to Mr. Erdogan, some Turkish news reports suggested the Turkish leader had thrown it in the trash, and he publicly criticized it, telling reporters in Istanbul, "We will not forget this lack of respect."
Michael Crowley and Catie Edmondson reported from Washington, and Megan Specia from London. Julian E. Barnes and Emily Cochrane contributed reporting from Washington.

Using an Anti-Immigration Group's Data, Miller Drove Breitbart Coverage

Texto completo: A new batch of leaked emails illustrates the degree to which Mr. Miller used a think tank's work to shape coverage at Breitbart News and policy at the White House.
WASHINGTON -- Stephen Miller, President Trump's hard-line immigration adviser, has long relied on data produced by the Center for Immigration Studies, a right-leaning think tank, to shape policy at the White House. Shortly after Mr. Trump was elected, Mr. Miller became well-known in the West Wing for putting printouts of studies published by the group on the president's desk.
A new set of emails first published by a civil rights advocacy group, the Southern Poverty Law Center, and shared with The New York Times illustrates the degree to which Mr. Miller used the work of the think tank, which advocates restricting immigration, to shape coverage at Breitbart News, a conservative news site, while he served as a communications aide to Jeff Sessions, the former Republican senator from Alabama.
"He was almost a de facto assignment editor for the political writing team at Breitbart," said Kurt Bardella, the site's former spokesman and now a frequent critic of the Trump administration.
In one instance in January 2016 -- around the time he joined Mr. Trump's presidential campaign as a senior policy adviser -- Mr. Miller sent Breitbart employees a study from the think tank that tracked Muslim population growth in the United States: "Huge Surge in U.S. newborns named 'Mohammed,"' Mr. Miller wrote in the subject line. A related story appeared on Breitbart the next day.
In another email sent in July 2015, Mr. Miller praised the work of Jason Richwine, an anti-immigration author whose work appears often on the think tank's website. Mr. Richwine, who has drawn public furor for arguing that Hispanic immigrants are less intelligent than white Americans, said in an email on Thursday that he was a "mainstream" analyst whose work has appeared in The Wall Street Journal and Politico.
"Those publications are not embarrassed to promote my work," wrote Mr. Richwine, who said that he did not personally know Mr. Miller. "So I don't know why Stephen Miller should be either."
In several cases, the think tank has shared with readers links to websites tied to white nationalists, including the site VDARE, which regularly publishes white nationalists and traffics in anti-immigrant messages. Katie McHugh, a former Breitbart editor who leaked the cache of emails, said Mr. Miller emailed her a link to an article on VDARE. Ms. McHugh has said she now denounces far-right groups.
The White House defended Mr. Miller on Thursday by equating the law center's reporting to libel.
The law center "libels, slanders and defames conservatives for a living and in fact is a discredited, debunked far-left smear organization that has even recently been forced to pay someone $ 4 million for defamation," Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman, said in an email. Mr. Gidley was apparently referring to $ 3.4 million the group paid to settle a lawsuit filed by Maajid Nawaz, an activist whose advocacy organization the law center initially said was an "extremist" group.
Mr. Gidley also claimed that criticism of Mr. Miller was connected to his Jewish faith. "I work with Stephen," Mr. Gidley said. "I know Stephen. He loves this country and hates bigotry in all forms -- and it concerns me as to why so many on the left consistently attack Jewish members of this administration."
Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the think tank, said in an interview that he knew Mr. Miller from his time with Mr. Sessions, and that he had discussed immigration policy with him during two White House meetings.
Mr. Krikorian disputed the law center's designation of the think tank as a hate group, but said he was aware that some content on VDARE was "outrageous."
Mr. Miller, who delivered a 2015 keynote speech at one of the think tank's events, is now one of the main speechwriters for the president, as well as Mr. Trump's chief adviser on immigration policy. He often shares news coverage that he thinks will catch Mr. Trump's attention, or perhaps draw his ire, according to several current and former officials.
In 2017, while searching for ways to illustrate the cost of resettling refugees, Mr. Miller urged State Department officials to embrace data from the think tank that showed it was 12 times more costly to bring a refugee to the United States than to help that same person in their own region. State Department officials declined on the grounds that the think tank report, which did not take into account refugee contributions through taxes, was flawed.
Mr. Miller also publicly used the think tank's data to bolster his argument for the Trump administration's initial travel ban that restricted travel from seven largely Muslim countries, a narrower version of which the Supreme Court upheld last year. He said he referred to the think tank's analysis that 72 people from the those countries had been implicated in terrorist activity since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
"We know there's at least several dozen, perhaps many more than that, cases of terrorism from these countries that have happened in the United States in terms of terroristic plots, terroristic activity, material support for terrorism, supporting terrorism overseas, all different kinds of terroristic activity that's been interdicted in the United States tracing back to these seven countries," Mr. Miller said in an appearance on ABC's "This Week" in February 2017.
A host of fact checks found that the think tank's claims were overstated -- most of those people were not charged with crimes related to terrorism.
"The only thing I can say from the outside is that he really does seem to have mastered the art of bureaucratic infighting," Mr. Krikorian said of Mr. Miller. "It's clear to anyone that he's done a good job of maintaining his position within the White House, and that's not nothing."

Texto completo: NEW YORK — Kellyanne Conway told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that he embarrassed himself following a tense exchange Thursday where he asked the White House counselor to respond to her husband's criticism of President Trump on television.
Lawyer George Conway has frequently attacked his wife's boss on social media. MSNBC brought him into the studio Wednesday to serve as an analyst during its coverage of the House impeachment hearings.
Blitzer, toward the end of an in-studio interview with Kellyanne Conway on Thursday morning, said he had a sensitive but substantive question for her.
“I don't want to talk about your marriage," he said. “I know there are issues there."
Conway seemed taken aback.
“What did you say?" she asked. “You don't want to talk about my marriage but there are issues there? Why would you say that?"
Conway noted that there was no shortage of Trump critics who appear on CNN and MSNBC and wondered why Blitzer brought up her husband.
“Because he's a legal scholar, he's a lawyer, and he was really going after the president of the United States," Blitzer said. “He was all over television yesterday."
Responded Conway: “And the relevance is, come on, wait for it, drumroll, he's married to me."
CNN rolled a tape of George Conway criticizing Trump for using foreign policy to advance his own interests. It aired on a split screen, as another camera followed his wife's reaction.
Kellyanne Conway said it was “his opinion."
“What you just quoted is said every single day by other voices," Conway said. “But you wanted to put it in my husband's voice because you think somehow that will help your ratings or that you're really sticking it to Kellyanne Conway. And let me make it very clear, you didn't stick it to Kellyanne Conway. I think you embarrassed yourself and I'm embarrassed for you."
MSNBC didn't bring up Kellyanne when her husband was on the air Wednesday, although anchor Brian Williams gave a knowing reference to “yes, that George Conway," when introducing him.

Trump Jr.'s book makes bestseller list
NEW YORK — Donald Trump Jr.'s “Triggered" is a No. 1 New York Times bestseller, although not without an edge.
“Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us" came out last week and tops the hardcover nonfiction list that will appear in the Nov. 24 edition of the Times.
Among those celebrating was President Trump, who tweeted, “Wow! Was just told that my son's book, 'Triggered,' is Number One on The New York Times Bestseller List. Congratulations Don!"
A dagger symbol appears next to the listing, indicating that some of the sales were “bulk purchases," often meaning that the author or someone associated with the author bought a substantial number of copies. A spokesman for the Republican National Committee, Steve Guest, said Thursday that the RNC has been offering “Triggered" as a fund-raising incentive, a common practice for political books.
Guest said copies were bought "to keep up with demand," not in a "large bulk purchase."
“Triggered" also placed high on the weekly report compiled by NPD BookScan, which tracks around 85 percent of the print market. According to BookScan, “Triggered" sold 71,000 copies last week, second only to Jeff Kinney's latest “Diary of a Wimpy Kid." NPD could not immediately determine how many of those sales were bulk sales.

Mirren, McKellen relish roles in
‘The Good Liar’
NEW YORK | Roles for older actors can fall into some predictable tropes, but Helen Mirren and Ian McKellen say their new film, “The Good Liar,” let them brush aside cliches and even their characters’ mortality for a good cat-and-mouse thriller.
“Elderly characters are sort of there to be the lovely old grandfather or granddad that the kids go and visit,” Mirren said. “As you get older and you realize, ‘You know what? I still have agency in my life. Things are still happening in my life. It doesn’t all stop when you’re 50.”
The film, which opens in theaters Friday, brings Mirren, 74, and McKellen, 80, together on the big screen for the first time.
McKellen plays Roy, a man who has spent his life swindling others and sets his sights on Mirren’s character, a lonely widow named Betty. Roy is hoping to cash in on Betty’s life savings.
Actor Dave Bautista is now guardian to 2 abandoned pit bulls
TAMPA, Fla. | A Florida animal shelter sent out a desperate plea after someone had abandoned two pit bull dogs. But volunteers never expected the post would catch the attention of “Guardians of the Galaxy” actor Dave Bautista.
The 6-year-old pit bulls, Maggie and Ollie, were handed over to the county after their owner had a baby. Volunteers from Rescue Me Tampa wrote a post seeking someone who would take both dogs, writing they’d been together their whole life.
That was last month. A week later, the group posted a picture of the star hugging the two pups and announcing he had adopted them.

Texto completo: The sensations surged up from somewhere inside, like poison through a syringe: a mix of sadness, anxiety and shame that would overwhelm anyone, especially a teenager.
“I had this Popsicle stick and carved it into a sharp point and scratched myself,” Joan, a high school student in New York City, said recently; she asked that her last name be omitted for privacy. “I’m not even sure where the idea came from. I just knew it was something people did. I remember crying a lot and thinking, ‘Why did I just do that?’ I was kind of scared of myself.”
She felt relief as the swarm of distress dissolved, and she began to cut herself regularly, at first with a knife, then razor blades, cutting her wrists, forearms and eventually much of her body. “I would do it for five to 15 minutes,” she said, “and afterward I didn’t have that terrible feeling. I could go on with my day.”
Self-injury, particularly among adolescent girls, has become so prevalent so quickly that scientists and therapists are struggling to catch up. About 1 in 5 adolescents reports having harmed himself or herself to soothe emotional pain at least once, according to a review of three dozen surveys in nearly a dozen countries, including the United States, Canada and Britain. Habitual self-harm, over time, is a predictor for higher suicide risk, studies suggest.
But there are very few dedicated research centers for self-harm and even fewer clinics specializing in treatment. When youngsters who injure themselves seek help, they are often met with alarm, misunderstanding and overreaction. The apparent epidemic levels of the behavior have exposed a structural weakness of psychiatric care: Because self-injury is considered a “symptom” and not a stand-alone diagnosis like depression, the testing of treatments has been haphazard, and therapists have little evidence to draw on.
In the past few years, psychiatric researchers have begun to knit together the motives, underlying biology and social triggers of self-harm. The story so far gives parents - tens of millions worldwide - some insight into what is at work when they see a child with scars or burns. And it allows for the evaluation of tailored treatments: In one newly published trial, researchers in New York found that self-injury can be reduced with a specialized form of talk therapy that was invented to treat what’s known as borderline personality disorder.
“It used to be that this kind of behavior was confined to the very severely impaired, people with histories of sexual abuse, with major body alienation,” said Barent Walsh, a psychologist who was one of the first therapists to focus on self-injury, at the Bridge program in Marlborough, Massachusetts, now a part of Open Sky Community Services. “Then, suddenly, it morphed into the general population, to the point where it was affecting successful kids with money. That’s when the research funding started to flow.”
Joan was 13 when the cutting began. Now 16, she had greatly curtailed this routine in the past few months, she said: “But I still do it, like, every week or so.”
The most common misperception about self-injury is that it is a suicide attempt: A parent walks in on an adolescent cutting herself or himself, and the sight of blood is blinding. “A lot of people think that, but in reality, you cut for different reasons,” said Blue, 16, another high school student in the New York area, who asked that her last name be omitted. “Like, it’s the only way you know to deal with intense insecurities or anger at yourself. Or you’re so numb as a result of depression, you can’t feel anything - and this is one thing you can feel.”
Whether this method of self-soothing is an epidemic of the social media age is still a matter of scientific debate. No surveys asking about self-harm were conducted before the mid-1980s.
In the 1990s, the idea of self-injury and its underlying psychic misery began to enter popular culture. Princess Diana talked about it, in an interview; so did actors Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie. A popular 2010 music video by Pink contained vivid scenes of cutting. By then, dozens of online forums were providing community, support and understanding to those who self-injured - and also, some experts say, often reinforcing the behavior, as a badge of membership in a special club.
“Nowadays a lot of younger girls especially are influenced by various media, where this whole self-harm thing is glamorized,” said Blue, who quit harming herself this year. “I was hospitalized, and it was strange: A lot of other girls were impressed by my scars, like: ‘How did you get those? I’m jealous.’ It’s disturbing, this gratification - like, people who I guess feel good or happy when they do it.”
Among current American college students, a privileged group by definition, about 1 in 5 reports having inflicted self-harm on purpose to ease emotional pain at least once, according to surveys done at 10 universities by Janis Whitlock, director of the Cornell Research Program for Self-Injury and Recovery.
The first episode occurs around age 15, on average, she said, but a large number of people who self-harm started later, at age 17 or 18.
Few people who self-harm once stop there, said Whitlock, an author of “Healing Self-Injury: A Guide for Parents.”
“About three in four continue, and the frequency tends to go up and down, as people go in and out of various stages,” she said. “It’s absolutely crazy-making for parents because it’s hard to know what’s happening.”
This pattern becomes, for about 20% of people who engage in it, a full-blown addiction, as powerful as an opiate habit. “Something about it was so grounding, and it was always there for me,” said Nancy Dupill, 32, who cut herself regularly for more than a decade before winding down the habit, in therapy; she now works as a peer specialist for adolescents in central Massachusetts. “I got to the point where I cut myself a lot, and when I came out of it, I couldn’t remember things that happened, like what set it off in the first place.”
People who become dependent on self-harm often come to treasure it as their one reliable comfort, therapists say. Images of blood, burns, cuts and scarring may become, paradoxically, consoling. In isolation, amid emotional turbulence, self-injury is a secret friend, one that can be summoned anytime. “Unlike emotional or social pain, it’s possible to control physical pain” and its soothing effect, said Joseph Franklin, a psychologist at Florida State University.
Franklin argues that the brain circuits registering physical and mental pain, while distinct, probably have some overlap. The burn of humiliation feels very different from the burn of fire, of course, but there is some evidence that the relief from yanking a hand away from the flame can activate neural circuits that register psychological relief, although this system is far from worked out.
“As a weird quirk of this effect, people who think the relief of psychological pain is worth the physical pain may reason that self-injury is a good idea,” Franklin said.
The one treatment that appears to be most effective for breaking the habit of self-harm is a specialized talk therapy, originally invented for people with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, who are highly suicidal.
Through one-on-one and group therapy sessions, at least once a week for two months or more, people who injure themselves learn coping skills to weather troughs of misery. The therapy is called dialectical behavior therapy, or DBT.
In a study of 800 adolescent inpatients at Zucker Hillside Hospital, in Glen Oaks, New York, a team of doctors found that those who received DBT had far fewer incidents of self-injury, spent less time on suicide watch and had shorter hospital stays, compared to adolescents who had been treated before DBT was standard.
“There is real hope,” Dupill said, “if you let the person going through this have some control, if you listen to them, if you’re curious about their behavior and not afraid of it.”

Trump unfit to lead, author warns in book

Texto completo: Senior Trump administration officials considered resigning en masse last year in a "midnight self-massacre" to sound a public alarm about President Donald Trump's conduct, but rejected the idea because they believed it would further destabilize an already teetering government, according to a new book by an unnamed author.
In "A Warning" by Anonymous, obtained by The Washington Post ahead of its release, a writer described only as "a senior official in the Trump administration" paints a chilling portrait of the president as cruel, inept and a danger to the nation.
The author, who first captured attention in 2018 as the unidentified author of a New York Times opinion column, describes Trump careening from one self-inflicted crisis to the next, "like a twelve-year-old in an air traffic control tower, pushing the buttons of government indiscriminately, indifferent to the planes skidding across the runway and the flights frantically diverting away from the airport."
The 259-page book, which was published by Twelve, an imprint of Grand Central Publishing/Hachette Book Group, and goes on sale Nov. 19, does not recreate many specific episodes in vivid detail, which the author writes was intentional to protect his or her identity.
At a moment when a stream of political appointees and career public servants have testified before Congress about Trump's conduct as part of the House impeachment inquiry, the book's author defends his or her decision to remain anonymous.
"I have decided to publish this anonymously because this debate is not about me," the author writes. "It is about us. It is about how we want the presidency to reflect our country, and that is where the discussion should center. Some will call this 'cowardice.' My feelings are not hurt by the accusation. Nor am I unprepared to attach my name to criticism of President Trump. I may do so, in due course."
White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham derided the book and its anonymous author.
"The coward who wrote this book didn't put their name on it because it is nothing but lies," Grisham wrote in an email. "Real authors reach out to their subjects to get things fact checked -- but this person is in hiding. ... Reporters who choose to write about this farce should have the journalistic integrity to cover the book as what it is -- a work of fiction."
The author describes senior officials waking up in the morning "in a full-blown panic" over the wild pronouncements the president had made on Twitter.
"It's like showing up at the nursing home at daybreak to find your elderly uncle running pantsless across the courtyard and cursing loudly about the cafeteria food, as worried attendants tried to catch him," the author writes.
The author argues that Trump is incapable of leading the United States through a monumental international crisis, describing how he tunes out intelligence and national security briefings and theorizes that foreign adversaries see him as "a simplistic pushover" who is susceptible to flattery and easily manipulated.
After the 2018 killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents, the author writes, Trump vented to advisers and said he would be foolish to stand up to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
"Do you know how stupid it would be to pick this fight?" Trump said, according to the book. "Oil would go up to one hundred fifty dollars a barrel."
One theme laced throughout the book is Trump's indifference to the boundaries of the law. The author writes that Trump considered presidential pardons as "unlimited 'Get Out of Jail Free' cards on a Monopoly board," referring to news reports that he had offered pardons to aides.
As he ranted about federal courts ruling against some of his policies, including the 2017 travel ban, the author writes, Trump once asked White House lawyers to draft a bill to send to Congress reducing the number of federal judges.
"Can we just get rid of the judges?" the president said, according to the book. "There shouldn't be any at all, really."
The author also ruminates about Trump's fitness for office.
"I am not qualified to diagnose the president's mental acuity," the author writes. "All I can tell you is that normal people who spend any time with Donald Trump are uncomfortable by what they witness. He stumbles, slurs, gets confused, is easily irritated, and has trouble synthesizing information, not occasionally but with regularity. Those who would claim otherwise are lying to themselves or to the country."

Texto completo: Jane Fonda's protest look makes a statement of its own.
Forget the power shoulder. These days, it's all about the power coat. At least when it comes to Jane Fonda -- and, perhaps, to those who would follow her example.
We are speaking, of course, of the five-alarm, bright red coat the actress and activist wore last Friday (or last #firedrillfriday, as she has designated them) as she protested at the National Capitol to raise awareness about the climate crisis. The one she has worn every Friday for the last five Fridays, and will wear tomorrow, and continue to wear every Friday through the end of the year.
The one she is wearing in the video she posted on her website explaining her actions. The one that she says is the last piece of clothing she will ever buy.
The one that has, like the burnt orange MaxMara coat Nancy Pelosi wore back in December when she confronted President Trump after her return as speaker of the House, provoked a viral obsession thanks to its ability to represent visually the issue Ms. Fonda is raising verbally (and physically), while also looking deeply chic.
According to a recent article in The New York Times, the idea of wearing red came from discussions over Labor Day weekend between Ms. Fonda and some of her friends, as well as the author Naomi Klein, Annie Leonard of Greenpeace USA and the environmental activist and author Bill McKibben.
How, exactly, participants wanted to interpret the red in garment form would be up to them.
In some of the arrest photos of Ms. Fonda, you can see other celebrities adopting the tactic. Sam Waterston seems to be partial to a burgundy-tone cable-knit sweater; Ben Cohen of Ben & Jerry's wore a Crayola red polo over a long-sleeved gray T-shirt; the activist Jodie Evans wore a lush velvet cherry red coat. (Ted Danson, who was arrested in a gray crew neck, did not seem to have gotten the message.)
But none of the garments have the clarity and impact of Ms. Fonda's coat.
Ms. Fonda went to Neiman Marcus to buy her version, on sale. We don't know the label (when asked, Ms. Fonda told The Hollywood Reporter she could not remember, though she did say it cost $ 500). It has a large shawl collar and belt, which she sometimes leaves undone. Speculation has centered on a Mackage style. If, indeed, it is her last fashion purchase, it was a good one.
The coat does everything it needs to do. It is unmistakable in a crowd and sends a message: Warning! Our house is on fire! Urgent action is needed! It also provides warmth and some comfort during Ms. Fonda's time in jail. It has become so immediately recognizable that it was its own Halloween costume.
One Twitter observer noted: "BTW, I hope that red coat ends up in the Smithsonian." It probably should. It has made that rare but historically significant leap from garment to symbol: of a time, place and movement. A red-coated Jane Fonda, shown being arrested on Nov. 1, has made a habit of getting cuffed while protesting a lack of action against climate change.

Texto completo: President Trump seemed unbothered by Turkey's recent invasion of Syria, which prompted outrage in Congress and among some in his administration.
WASHINGTON -- One month ago, President Trump warned President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey not to "be a fool" or "a tough guy" by invading northeastern Syria. The Turkish leader sent his troops across the border anyway, outraging much of official Washington.
On Wednesday, Mr. Trump seemed unbothered by the episode and gave Mr. Erdogan a warm welcome, offering little sign of frustration with Turkey's authoritarian leader over an incursion that scrambled American policy in the region.
"I'm a big fan of the president," Mr. Trump said during a joint news conference at the White House with Mr. Erdogan. "My dear friend," Mr. Erdogan said of Mr. Trump.
Mr. Erdogan's invasion of Syria, in part to attack Kurdish fighters who helped the United States crush the Islamic State, infuriated many military and diplomatic officials and prompted members of Congress to draw up punitive sanctions. Many of the same people also are angry over Turkey's recent purchase of an advanced Russian antiaircraft missile system, which legislators from both parties call grounds for separate sanctions.
Last week, a mostly Democratic group of House members called on Mr. Trump to rescind his invitation to Mr. Erdogan. On Wednesday, the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, issued a statement saying that he hoped the meeting would help to restore relations with Turkey. But, he noted, "I share my colleagues' uneasiness at seeing President Erdogan honored at the White House."
Although Mr. Trump briefly threatened Turkey with crippling economic sanctions after its Oct. 9 invasion of Syria, he had also cleared the way for the incursion by withdrawing American forces after a phone call with Mr. Erdogan. On Wednesday, he returned to a warmer tone, stressing the value of the decades-long strategic relationship between the two countries -- both NATO members, but ones that have drifted apart over the past decade.
During remarks to reporters over the course of a day of diplomacy largely overshadowed by an impeachment hearing on Capitol Hill, Mr. Trump said he hoped that the United States and Turkey could work out their differences. The president said he wanted to increase trade between the countries by a multiple of four, to about $ 100 billion, "which would be great for Turkey and great for us."
Mr. Trump also expressed confidence that Washington and Ankara could resolve their standoff over Turkey's purchase of the Russian missile system, which leading Republicans in Congress call a clear violation of a 2017 law requiring sanctions on countries that buy military hardware from Moscow. Some members of Congress have suggested the sanctions might be avoided if Turkey does not power up the missile system.
Mr. Trump called five Republican senators to the White House on Wednesday, including some sharp critics of Mr. Erdogan, for an unusual meeting with the visiting Turkish leader.
"I project that we will work something out," Mr. Trump said. Also in the meeting were Senators Joni Ernst of Iowa, Jim Risch of Idaho, Ted Cruz of Texas, Rick Scott of Florida and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.
Mr. Graham, for one, betrayed a note of amazement over dropping in on a foreign leader's White House visit.
"I've never had an opportunity like this before," Mr. Graham told reporters who were briefly ushered into the room. "I appreciate it. The purpose of this meeting is to have an American civics lesson for our friends in Turkey. And there's a pony in there somewhere if we can find it."
To which Trump quickly replied: "And I think we will."
Mr. Trump repeatedly sounded sympathetic to the Turkish leader, seconding Mr. Erdogan's complaints that European nations have not contributed enough to the cost of caring for more than three million Syrian refugees who have streamed across Turkey's border since their country plunged into civil war more than eight years ago.
Mr. Trump also sided with Mr. Erdogan after the Turkish leader sharply criticized President Emmanuel Macron of France, who last week called Mr. Erdogan's invasion of Syria a dangerous mistake that will empower Iran and Russia.
"I think that bothered the president very much," Mr. Trump told reporters. "I think a lot of other people feel that way, too."
Mr. Macron also said the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was experiencing "brain death" because of Mr. Trump's policies.
At the end of the day, it was not clear what Mr. Erdogan's visit had actually yielded. A White House statement mentioned no tangible agreements.

Brooklyn Bishop Named by Pope to Investigate Abuse Is Accused Himself

Texto completo: Bishop Nicholas DiMarzio, who was recently chosen to lead an inquiry into clergy abuse in Buffalo, faces an accusation of molesting an altar boy in Jersey City in the 1970s.
Bishop Nicholas DiMarzio, the longtime leader of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, sexually abused an 11-year-old altar boy during his tenure as a young priest in Jersey City in the 1970s, according to a lawyer who helped unleash Boston's priest abuse scandal.
The lawyer, Mitchell Garabedian, told Catholic officials in New Jersey this week that he was preparing a lawsuit on behalf of a client who says he was molested by Bishop DiMarzio more than 40 years ago, according to a letter obtained by The Associated Press, which reported the accusation.
In the letter, according to The A.P., Mr. Garabedian says that his client, Mark Matzek, 56, claims that as an altar boy at St. Nicholas Church and a student at St. Nicholas School he was repeatedly abused by Bishop DiMarzio and a second priest, Albert Mark. Father Mark is dead, the letter says.
Bishop DiMarzio, who has led the Brooklyn diocese since 2003, denied the accusation unequivocally in a statement to The A.P.
"In my nearly 50-year ministry as a priest, I have never engaged in unlawful or inappropriate behavior and I categorically deny this allegation," he said in the statement. "I am confident I will be fully vindicated."
In a new, longer statement issued by the diocese, which encompasses Brooklyn and Queens, Bishop DiMarzio added, "There will be a legal process now and I will vigorously defend myself against this false allegation."
Maria Margiotta, a spokeswoman for the Archdiocese of Newark, which includes the Jersey City parish where Bishop DiMarzio was assigned when the abuse is alleged to have happened, confirmed that officials there had received Mr. Garabedian's letter.
"The archdiocese has reported the matter to, and is cooperating with, law enforcement," Ms. Margiotta said.
Last month, Pope Francis chose Bishop DiMarzio to investigate the Buffalo, N.Y., diocese, where Bishop Richard J. Malone has come under criticism for his handling of a mushrooming clergy abuse scandal.
Many other Catholic bishops in the United States have found themselves in similar circumstances, but Bishop Malone's approach may have embroiled him in scandal more so than most of them.
He kept a secret binder that listed priests accused of sexual abuse. He was recorded expressing more concern about his own reputation than about removing a priest whom he called a "sick puppy." And some of his own clergy have circulated a letter of no-confidence in him as calls mount for his resignation as leader of one of the Northeast's largest dioceses.
The Brooklyn diocese said on Oct. 31 that Bishop DiMarzio had concluded his investigation into the Buffalo diocese. The inquiry, described as an "apostolic visitation," involved three trips to Buffalo over seven days and interviews with 80 people, including clergy members and parishioners.
Having completed his interviews, the Brooklyn diocese said, Bishop DiMarzio would prepare a report to be delivered at an unspecified date.
Bishop DiMarzio has a long history of dealing with priest abuse scandals as a church leader.
He arrived in Brooklyn after serving as bishop of the Camden, N.J., diocese. One of his first tasks there was to help settle a scandal over the sexual abuse of children by priests that became public a few years into his tenure. He arranged payments totaling $ 880,000 to 23 plaintiffs at one point, and fought lawsuits by plaintiffs who would not settle.
In February, the Brooklyn diocese, one of the country's biggest claiming about 1.5 million adherents, named more than 100 priests that it said had been credibly accused of sexually abusing a child. It was one of the largest disclosures yet in a torrent of lists published by the church as its handling of clergy abuse has drawn the scrutiny of law enforcement officials.
"We know this list will generate many emotions for victims who have suffered terribly," Bishop DiMarzio said at the time.
"For their suffering, I am truly sorry," he added. "I have met with many victims who have told me that more than anything, they want an acknowledgment of what was done to them. This list gives that recognition and I hope it will add another layer of healing for them on their journey toward wholeness."
The release of the list came two years after the diocese publicly identified eight priests who had been defrocked for child sexual abuse offenses, in an effort to protect children who might come into contact with them.
Mr. Garabedian, who gained a measure of fame as a character in the Oscar-winning film "Spotlight," has also represented abuse victims in the Buffalo diocese. He told The A.P. that "the investigation of the diocese of Buffalo by Bishop DiMarzio is tainted because of these allegations."
Mr. Garabedian declined to share a copy of his letter to the Newark diocese with The New York Times. In an email, he elaborated on his comments about Bishop DiMarzio's role in the Buffalo inquiry.
"It is time for the police to investigate the investigator," Mr. Garabedian said. "The investigation should include questioning Pope Francis about his appointment of the bishop as investigator."
Mr. Garabedian also said that Bishop DiMarzio, who, like Bishop Malone, was in Rome this week on a previously scheduled trip, should "be immediately placed on administrative leave pending an investigation."
In his letter to the Newark archdiocese, Mr. Garabedian demanded $ 20 million in damages for Mr. Matzek.
He told The A.P. that he planned to file the lawsuit on Mr. Matzek's behalf next month, when New Jersey opens a so-called look-back window of two years. During that time, victims can sue those they accuse of sexual abuse even if their cases expired under previous statutes of limitations.
The two-year period in New Jersey is set to open on Dec 1. New York State's version of the look-back window opened on Aug. 14 and lasts one year.

¿18 contra Trump? Quizás, si un exgobernador se suma a la carrera por la Casa Blanca

Texto completo: Pues esa será la cifra de precandidatos presidenciales demócratas si el exgobernador de Massachusetts Deval Patrick se suma a la carrera por la Casa Blanca antes del fin de semana, como informó el miércoles la prensa estadounidense.
Patrick, de 63 años, uno de los primeros gobernadores afroamericanos de Estados Unidos y cercano al expresidente Barack Obama , no confirmó haber comunicado estos planes a varios políticos demócratas, como indicaron varios medios.
Pero según el New York Times y la televisión CNN, este sexagenario relativamente moderado podría confirmar su decisión por video desde este jueves, e inscribirse como candidato a las primarias demócratas en New Hampshire el viernes, día de cierre de las inscripciones en ese estado.
Si se confirma, la candidatura tardía de Patrick demostrará las angustias en el campo demócrata: muchos se inquietan de ver que los senadores Bernie Sanders y Elizabeth Warren, muy de izquierda, suben en los sondeos y superan al centrista Joe Biden , lo cual según ellos arruina las posibilidades de que los demócratas expulsen a Trump de la Casa Blanca en las presidenciales de noviembre de 2020.
Testigo de estas preocupaciones, el multimillonario y exalcalde de Nueva York Michael Bloomberg también contempla disputar las primarias demócratas.
Casado con una abogada y padre de dos hijas, Deval Patrick descartó no obstante en diciembre de 2018 la idea de presentarse a las presidenciales, citando “la crueldad del proceso electoral que terminaría por perjudicar a personas que Diane (su esposa) y yo amamos”.
Pero a menos de tres meses de las primarias, Patrick estima ahora que aún hay lugar para un candidato capaz de unir a demócratas moderados y radicales, según sus allegados.
Nacido en una familia pobre de Chicago, luego becario de una escuela de élite de Boston antes de graduarse en derecho en Harvard, Patrick fue abogado durante mucho tiempo, sobre todo para la asociación de defensa de los derechos de los afroamericanos NAACP, antes de convertirse en gobernador de Massachusetts de 2007 a 2014.
Desde que dejó la gobernación trabaja para el fondo de inversiones privado Bain Capital, que se especializa en empresas que impulsan un modelo de desarrollo sustentable, y como comentarista político del canal CBS News.
Fue así que comentó el último debate demócrata, donde subrayó que “ser candidato, como ser un funcionario electo, es una mezcla de sustancia y de desempeño artístico”.
La disputa por la investidura demócrata ya cuenta con otros dos candidatos afroamericanos, la senadora de California Kamala Harris y el senador de Nueva Jersey Cory Booker. Pero ninguno lidera por ahora la carrera.

Texto completo: LONDON - We humans make a lonely crowd, and it's killing us.
Social isolation is more lethal than smoking 15 cigarettes a day, or than obesity, according to research published by Julianne Holt-Lunstad of Brigham Young University. Since obesity is associated in the United States with 300,000 to 600,000 deaths a year, the implication is that loneliness is a huge, if silent, killer.
Loneliness increases inflammation, heart disease, dementia and death rates, researchers say - but it also simply makes us heartsick and leaves us inhabiting an Edvard Munch canvas. Public health experts in many countries are debating how to address a "loneliness epidemic" that corrodes modern life, but Britain has taken the lead: Last year it appointed a minister for loneliness.
"It touches almost every one of us at some point," Baroness Barran, the current minister for loneliness, told me. "It can lead to very serious health consequences for the individual and leads to erosion of our society, where people become isolated and disconnected."
I've become interested in loneliness while reporting on the opioid epidemic and soaring suicide rates in the United States. These have complicated roots, partly economic, but they also result from social isolation. Extended families have dissolved, and social institutions like churches, bowling leagues and neighborhood clubs have frayed. We are no longer so deeply embedded in our communities.
"I trained in internal medicine, and I expected most of my time would be spent on diabetes or heart disease or cancer," Dr. Vivek Murthy, who was surgeon general of the United States under President Barack Obama, told me. "What I didn't expect was that so many people I saw would be struggling with loneliness."
More than one-fifth of adults in both the United States and Britain said in a 2018 survey that they often or always feel lonely. More than half of American adults are unmarried, and researchers have found that even among those who are married, 30% of relationships are severely strained. A quarter of Americans now live alone, and as the song says, one is the loneliest number.
One gauge of social isolation, or perhaps selfishness: Murthy says he saw families sometimes drop elderly family members off at a hospital for Thanksgiving or another long weekend in what sounds to me rather like the practice of a family leaving a dog at a kennel when they're going away. At the hospital, doctors are sometimes the only ones to witness a patient's death, with no loved ones around.
Loneliness affects physical health in two ways. First, it produces stress hormones that can lead to inflammation and other health problems. Second, people who are alone are less likely to go to doctor appointments, to take medicine or to exercise and eat a healthy diet. We may resent nagging from loved ones, but it can keep us alive.
When I met Barran I suspected that the minister of loneliness portfolio was a bit of a gimmick. In fact, I'm now persuaded that it's a model for other countries.
The ministry started a "Let's Talk Loneliness" campaign that sparked difficult conversations across Britain, and it is handing out small grants to local gardening clubs, bird-watching groups and others so that they can spread the word and invite more people to join. One grant of $640, for example, went to a Birmingham group to buy board games and start a game club.
It is supporting "friendly benches," which are public benches where people are encouraged to go and chat with one another. It's pushing to keep community spaces open and to stop public transportation from being cut in ways that leave people isolated. The government is also putting social workers in doctor's offices for "social prescribing" - connecting lonely patients with local organizations.
One early lesson, Barran said: Because of stigma, don't post a sign inviting lonely people to show up. Rather, have an upbeat sign inviting people to take part in a dog-walking club, a community garden or some other activity.
"We should focus on people's gifts rather than people's problems, because most of us would prefer to talk about our gifts," Barran said.
I suggest that we also make it easier for people to have dogs. There is some evidence that dog owners (but not cat owners) are less lonely, although in fairness the research is mixed.
Some think that the internet has aggravated the problem, because a cursory look through Facebook or Instagram suggests that everyone else in the world is having a fabulous time and enjoys perfect relationships.
Meanwhile, the reasons to address the topic are compelling. "If we could tackle loneliness," Barran said, "people would feel stronger, more resilient, more optimistic about the future." Holt-Lunstad has found that greater social connection is associated with a 50% reduced risk of early death.
Australia, Canada, Germany and New Zealand have shown interest in adopting British approaches. Maybe the United States, too, should experiment: How about a new post in the Department of Health and Human Services - an assistant secretary for loneliness?

Explorers discover sunken WWII sub Five Naval Academy grads were aboard USS Grayback

Texto completo: Five Naval Academy graduates were aboard the USS Grayback in February 1944 during its final combat mission of World War II, including commanding officer John Anderson Moore.
Cmdr. Moore was among 80 sailors aboard when the boat disappeared on Feb. 26, and was presumed to have died with the rest of his crew. The exact whereabouts of the sub remained a mystery for 75 years.
Sunday, a team of ocean explorers confirmed they had located the wreckage of the Grayback, one of the most successful U.S. submarines during the war. It was located about 50 nautical miles south of Okinawa in June. The group, led by undersea explorer Tim Taylor, spent the past few months searching for relatives of the crew, he told ABC News.
The Grayback sailed out from Pearl Harbor toward the East China Sea on Jan. 28, 1944 and sank at least two Japanese cargo ships in its path, according to the U.S. Naval History and Heritage Command.
It was due to return on March 7 of that year, but it never did. The submarine was attacked about two weeks earlier and "exploded and sank immediately," according to Japanese reports cited by the Navy. A Japan aircraft struck the submarine with a 500-pound bomb.
The Grayback is the fifth submarine discovered by Taylor's Lost 52 Project, which aims to find the 52 U.S. submarines that were lost in World War II. The location of the vessel remained unsolved for so long because of one wrong number in coordinates recorded by the Japanese navy. A 1949 document with approximate locations for each missing submarine was translated from Japanese into English with one digit wrong in the longitude and latitude of the site the Grayback was believed to have sunk, The New York Times reported.
The error was reportedly detected last year by an amateur researcher. The submarine was destroyed in its 10th and most successful patrol, in which it had sunk more than 21,000 tons of shipping belonging to enemy forces, according to the Navy.
Moore graduated from Annapolis in 1932, according to USNA Virtual Memorial Hall, an online list of graduates who have died in service to their company. It is maintained by Run To Honor, an organization of Naval Academy alumni founded in 2007.
Known as "Johnnie," Moore came to Annapolis from Arizona. He was on his second patrol aboard the Grayback at the time of his death.
According to the website On Eternal Patrol, a private listing of members of the U.S. submarine service who have died in combat, the four other academy graduates serving aboard the sub when it was sunk were:
Cmdr. Raymond Leon Mayo, Class of 1930. Mayo was on his third combat patrol aboard the sub.
Lt. Cmdr. Carthel Hill Smith, Class of 1940.
Lt. William C. Roy Jr., class of 1942.
Lt. j.g. Melvin Clyde Phillips, Class of 1944.
Naval Academy offices were closed Monday, and a spokesperson was unavailable for comment on the discovery.
Two sailors from Maryland also were aboard the sub when it disappeared, Quartermaster 3rd Class Ralph Bloodsworth of Baltimore and Electricians Mate Richard Hitch of Wicomico County, according to On Eternal Patrol.

This year, college basketball expected to be more balanced

Texto completo: The opening week of college basketball featured some incredible individual performances, several tremendous team wins, and also a number of off-the-court issues.
Unlike last November, when a select group looked like it was destined to separate from the rest of the sport, this season could be more balanced from now until Selection Sunday, when teams are picked for the NCAA tournament.
What we learned last week
Cole Anthony is already appointment television. Through two games, Anthony, a 6-foot-3 guard, has already broken several records at North Carolina. Anthony scored 34 points in his first game at North Carolina, more than any other freshman in his debut for the program. Anthony is also the only Tar Heels freshman to post 20 points and 10 rebounds in consecutive games. He is an early favorite for the national player of the year awards.
Shaka Smart is getting back to his roots. Smart, the Texas coach, made his name at Virginia Commonwealth by playing smaller lineups that featured four perimeter players. It looks like he's now finally set on doing the same thing at Texas. After years of having two traditional front-court players on the floor at the same time, Smart appears to be committed to using versatile 6-8 sophomore Gerald Liddell at power forward in an effort to maximize both skill and spacing. "When your second-biggest guy on the floor thinks like a guard and passes like a guard, it changes things," Smart said. "We haven't had the personnel to play that way the past few years." That alignment was critical in a 70-66 win at Purdue on Saturday, especially down the stretch when Texas trailed by 5 with 3:14 to play. Liddell finished with 14 points, eight rebounds and four assists.
Arizona is good at basketball again. The program has had a trying two years embroiled in the sport's corruption scandal, but the team in Tucson is back on track on the court, at least. Arizona's 90-69 rout of Illinois on Sunday night highlighted the Wildcats' upside, led by the talents of freshmen Nico Mannion, Josh Green, and Zeke Nnaji. Mannion, a 6-3 point guard, has a legitimate chance to be the best freshman floor general for Arizona since Mike Bibby helped lead the Wildcats to the 1997 national title.
What we're looking forward to this week
Villanova takes its first trip to Ohio State. Villanova coach Jay Wright and Ohio State coach Chris Holtmann coached against each other in the Big East when Holtmann was at Butler. With an NCAA tournament feel, the game presents the first national stage for Villanova freshman Jeremiah Robinson-Earl, who had 24 points and 13 rebounds in his college debut against Army.
Villanova freshman Bryan Antoine returned to practice last week after undergoing shoulder surgery. That's exciting, but this is going to be a process. While the 6-5 Antoine was the top recruit in Villanova's strong class, he hasn't played basketball since March.

Texto completo: To all of you who are writing letters castigating House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats for not doing their jobs and only concentrating on the impeachment of out president, please note that over 40 bills on every topic from healthcare to guns to infrastructure have been sent to the Senate where Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sits on them.
It is not the Democrats who are ignoring what has to be done.

Protect, not destroy
The New Mexican editorial ("Boom times on the Hill need to be shared," Our View, Nov. 10), was overdue but good to see. It analyzes the impact of the battleships full of money being made available to Los Alamos National Laboratory for projects and upgrades. You know, the problem is not the supercomputer research or the plutonium power supplies for space exploration or the research into environmental issues such as climate change or the jobs they make available for local residents.
The problem is "expanding plutonium pit production for nuclear weapons," i.e., the new nuclear arms race. Who will enlighten them regarding this dead end? I know -- rocket scientists. Obviously, LANL needs more rocket scientists. That's who they should hire and for whom they should set up apprenticeships. They can use the new highway to commute to work for a better planet -- one that they will protect, not destroy.

Tapped memories
Reading about my godmother, Fabiola Cabeza de Baca Gilbert in Pasatiempo ("As authentic as it gets," Amuse-Bouche, Nov. 1), brought back wonderful memories visiting her at her home on San Antonio Street. I have a 50-year old article about Mrs. Gilbert with reference to her book, We Fed Them Cactus, that tells her story growing up in New Mexico.

Deserving of praise
Too bad the photo on page A-4, intended to illustrate the challenges facing the Special Weeds Action Team (" 'Medians represent the pride we take in our city,' " Nov. 8), included the sign designating "Living Water" as the organization that adopted the median. The inference is that Living Water is to blame for the problem.
In my opinion, the medians adopted by Living Water are among the best maintained in the city -- they do a good job of balancing the lovely native grasses with a need for some tidiness. More to the point, Living Water should be applauded for having stepped up to partner with the Santa Fe Parks and Recreation Department to adopt medians. Most of the medians in the city have not been adopted. The Special Weeds Action Team should work to encourage more organizations to adopt medians -- it's a great way for companies to contribute to the community and get recognition.

No exemption
How can we possibly thank Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham? She says that if Trump loses reelection, she'll ask the Democratic president to give New Mexico an exemption from an oil and gas drilling ban ("Drilling Ban Proposals Divide Democrats in U.S. Oil States," New York Times, Nov. 1). Too bad that if we get a president to lead us out of the climate emergency the governor will instead continue business as usual, continuing destruction of New Mexico itself.
Thanks? No, thanks. Leadership gets thanks. Cowardice gets nada.

Love native plants
From the picture in the paper (" 'Medians represent the pride we take in our city,' " Nov. 8), those "weeds" now designated as unacceptable to many are chamisa and native grasses: the very plants natural to New Mexico that are beautiful and need absolutely no care whatsoever, so let's get rid of them and put in non-native growth requiring water, time and endless effort. Our newly designated Santa Fe, "mud town," continues to be not up-to-snuff. Thank goodness at least the city got rid of those awful bricks once in front of the railroad station along with the dull dirt color once so traditional and popular here. If you don't like the weeds, then cut them and let them grow back. Don't pull them out and replace them with Kentucky bluegrass.

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook Inc.’s Instagram plans to remove the number of “likes” visible on posts for some users in the U.S. to decrease competitive pressure among people on the photo-sharing service.
Instagram has been hiding like counts in some markets since April, beginning in Canada, and later expanding to Japan and Brazil. The U.S. is one of Instagram’s largest markets with more than 106 million users, according to data analyst EMarketer. Instagram boss Adam Mosseri told NBC in October that the effort was meant to “make Instagram feel less pressurized, to make it less of a competition.”
Users will still be able to see the likes they receive on their posts if they want, but those metrics won’t be visible to others on Instagram, the company said.
Mosseri said the test will begin next week. He announced the plan Friday at a conference in San Francisco sponsored by Wired magazine.
Instagram’s follower counts and likes have made it one of the top places online to compare one’s popularity with others, especially among teens and young adults. The company has tried for years to combat the competitive trend by promoting good role models via posts on its @instagram account, hoping to reflect the parts of the app that are about creativity and art as opposed to self-promotion. Still, striving for the metrics was irresistible for its users, contributing to mental health issues and other ills, like users paying for fake likes and followers from bots.
Even some of the app’s most prolific celebrities have said a service without likes may be healthier for its users.
“It would be really beneficial,” said Kim Kardashian, speaking at the New York Times DealBook conference Wednesday. Kardashian, who has 151 million Instagram followers and regularly receives more than 1 million likes on her posts, said the Instagram team has been discussing the changes with select users to get feedback, “and that makes me happy.”
Instagram, Facebook and Twitter have been at the center of debate around issues like smartphone addiction and online health in recent years. As a result, product “health” has become a priority at the social media companies, which are trying to balance the need to drive user growth and engagement with the outside perception that they are contributing to problems such as online bullying.
Instagram, for example, has also announced a feature where users can limit the amount of time they spend on the app in a given day. Apple Inc. built a similar “time spent” feature into its iPhone software, and Google offers tools like this for Android phones. Twitter has a beta version of its main product that hides engagement metrics, including likes and retweets, from user replies and interactions.

Texto completo: Aftermath

TAMPA  It was so much more than an interception.

A game-changer? Absolutely  but still so much more.

When Jamel Dean picked off a Kyler Murray pass late in the Buccaneers win over the Cardinals on Sunday, it was a reminder, a reminder that in sports anything can happen at any time. Even when theyre not supposed to. Even in Tampa Bay.

In the closing moments of the fourth quarter, the odds were stacked against Dean and the Bucs. A week ago, the rookie cornerback had allowed three touchdowns. Murray, meanwhile, hadnt thrown an interception since Sept. 29  a span of 211 consecutive passes.

When he dropped back to pass on that fateful second-and-10 play, Tampa Bay, trailing 27-23, was hanging by a thread. Various probability models placed Arizonas chances of winning at greater than 90 percent.

Four minutes later, the Bucs were celebrating their first home win of the season.

Could it be? A turnaround? Could this team make a run at the  the  p-p-p-playoffs?

Crazy talk, you say? Youre probably right. After all, Tampa Bay, at 3-6, is 17 times more likely to land a top-five pick in Aprils draft than it is to reach the postseason.

Even so, coach Bruce Arians has been clear on a couple of points:

1.) For better or worse, he has no intention of looking toward 2020.

2.) He doesnt care or understand probability. The man isnt afraid to waste timeouts, but going for it on fourth down? Nope, too risky.

Much would have to fall the Bucs way for them to make the playoffs, but we were able to chart, with the help of the New York Times playoff calculator, a somewhat realistic path to them being in the picture heading into the final weekend of the season. All aboard the crazy train!

 The Bucs can help their cause by, you know, winning more often. Even if they win their next six games, however, their chances are still worse than a coin flip.

Besides, Tampa Bay is not going to win six straight games. This is an average team that, more often than not, has found ways to lose. We have to build in at least some margin for error.

Say the Bucs lose as expected Sunday to the Saints (FiveThirtyEightgives New Orleans a 69 percent chance of winning). That would be a crushing blow, but it wouldnt necessarily be a season-killer. Their five opponents after that: Falcons (away), Jaguars (away), Colts (home), Lions (away) and Texans (home). Those are all winnable games. Its conceivable that they could be 8-7 heading into Week 17.

 Lets concede the NFC South to the 7-2 Saints. The goal is to clinch one of the conference wild-card slots. As of today, there are eight teams in front of the Bucs (nine if we count the NFC East-leading Cowboys, who easily could fall back into the wild-card picture): the Seahawks, Vikings, Rams, Eagles, Panthers, Bears, Lions and Cardinals.

 The Bucs would need either the Seahawks OR the Vikings to lose almost all of their remaining games. Its unlikely, of course, that either team will do that, but its more likely for the Seahawks, who are the weaker team and have the NFLs most difficult remaining schedule. Weve seen such a collapse before: The 1994 Eagles started 7-2 and lost their final seven games.

 So say the Seahawks lose their next six and are 7-8 heading into Week 17. What else would need to happen for the Bucs to climb back into contention? Assuming again that they lose to the Saints and beat everyone else, every team presently in front of them could win all of their home games but would need to lose all of their road games. Thats a little too clean, but its not all that far-fetched, is it?

 If everything fell into place, these would be the NFC wild-card standings heading into Week 17:

Vikings: 10-5

Eagles: 9-6

Bucs: 8-7

Panthers: 8-7

Cardinals: 7-7-1

Bears: 7-8

Cowboys: 7-8

Rams: 7-8

Seahawks: 7-8

Lions: 5-9-1

In this scenario, the Vikings have clinched one of the conferences two wild-card slots, and the Eagles have clinched the NFC East, leaving seven teams in the running for the second wild-card slot: the Bucs, Panthers, Cardinals, Bears, Cowboys, Rams and Seahawks.

 That gets us to Week 17 with the Bucs still alive. Their chances of making the playoffs: 38 percent. To get to 100 percent, two things would have to happen, both of which are realistic. They have to beat the Falcons, and the Saints would have to beat the Panthers.

Chances are Tampa Bay wins maybe three more games, finishes 6-10 and misses the playoffs for the 12th straight season. Well assess what went wrong and debate where to go from here.

But today? Lets linger a little while longer on the statement Dean made when he intercepted that pass Sunday: This thing isnt over yet.

Report: Walgreens in talks with KKR

Texto completo: Walgreens Boots Alliance is in talks with private equity firm KKR to take the drugstore chain private in what could be one of the largest leveraged buyouts, Bloomberg reported Monday.
New York-based KKR has approached Walgreens about a proposal to potentially buy out shareholders of Walgreens, unnamed sources told Bloomberg, but it is unclear whether the proposal is feasible because of the large amount of financing required. The two companies could decide not to pursue a deal, said people who asked Bloomberg not to be identified.
If a deal were to come to pass, it would reunite Walgreens Chairman Stefano Pessina with KKR. In 2007, they joined forces to take European pharmacy company Alliance Boots private.
Walgreens and KKR declined to comment.
News broke last week that Deerfield-based Walgreens has been exploring a potential deal to take the company private as the pharmacy chain grapples with shifting consumer habits and pressures on its pharmacy business.
The step would remove the company from the public eye and could make it easier to focus more on in-store health services, which could draw in customers and better position Walgreens to compete with CVS Health, analysts said. It would mean the retailer and pharmacy would not have to answer to shareholders for the first time since 1927 as well as not abide by the regulatory reporting requirements of publicly traded firms.
KKR was founded in 1976 by best friends and first cousins Henry Kravis and George Roberts. They were joined by their mentor, Jerome Kohlberg, who left the firm in 1987 over differences in buyout strategy. Kravis and Roberts became known for their aggressive, often hostile, takeovers of large conglomerates. Kohlberg, who died in 2015, preferred smaller deals and a more friendly approach, according to his obituary in the New York Times.
The firm is perhaps best known for its $25 billion hostile takeover of food and tobacco giant RJR Nabisco in 1986, a deal scrutinized by Congress for allegedly avoiding taxes and contributed to KKR becoming the poster child for Wall Street's buyout-crazy, debt-driven '80s. That same year, the company was behind big deals such as the purchase of Beatrice -- at the time the largest leveraged buyout in history -- and grocery giant Safeway. Other big KKR deals during the 1980s included battery maker Duracell and grocery store Stop & Shop.
In 2007, KKR and other investors, including Pessina, took European pharmacy Alliance Boots private. Five years later, in an effort to to expand its global footprint, Walgreens announced plans to acquire Alliance Boots, which would become Walgreens Boots Alliance. KKR reportedly pocketed $7.3 billion when the two-part deal was completed in 2015.
In September 2010, KKR went public.
Walgreens has a market cap of about $53 billion and $16.8 billion of debt. That means taking it private would top the largest leveraged buyout in history: the 2007 sale of utility TXU Corp. to KKR and TPG, which was worth about $45 billion including debt, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The news comes weeks after the company laid off employees and said it won't pay annual bonuses this year as it works to increase its cost-cutting goal to $1.8 billion annually. Walgreens also previously announced plans to close 200 of its stores and said it would eliminate health insurance for a number of eligible retirees after this year. Walgreens has more than 18,750 stores worldwide.

High-tech drones solve mystery of missing WWII sub

Texto completo: Tim Taylor was about to end the mission. His team had scoured the seabed off Japan with autonomous underwater vehicles, which are essentially high-tech drones, without a hit. His ship now needed repairs, and a $7 million drone had just reported an error on its latest dive.
All that remained was to download the data from that drone before heading hundreds of miles back to shore.
That's when they spotted it: an unusual reading on the ocean floor, more than 1,400 feet deep. The next day, another submersible with high-definition cameras went to investigate. The images it beamed back left no doubt about what Taylor's team had found: A hulking ship lay rusting in the pitch-black water. As the camera rounded the bow and panned to the bridge, an eerily preserved plaque came into view: USS Grayback.
"It was amazing. Everyone was excited," Taylor told The Washington Post. "Then you realize there are 80 men buried there, and it's a sobering experience."
Taylor's discovery on June 5 solved an enduring 75-year-old mystery about the fate of the USS Grayback, one of World War II's most effective submarines. The U.S. Navy confirmed Sunday that Taylor's team, part of a group dedicated to finding the 52 American submarines lost in action during World War II, found Grayback's final resting place in the ocean off Okinawa, Japan.
The news brought closure to relatives of the sailors lost that day.
"There's a book I read, and it said these ships are known only to God," Gloria Hurney, whose uncle, Raymond Parks, died on the Grayback, told ABC News. "But now we know where the Grayback is."
The Grayback's final mission started on Jan. 28, 1944, according to the Navy's official history, when it left Pearl Harbor on its 10th combat tour. Commissioned in 1941, the Tambor-class sub had spent the war patrolling the South Pacific and South China Sea, torpedoing numerous enemy vessels and rescuing downed American aviators. The Grayback sank more than a dozen Japanese ships in all, The New York Times reported.
On Feb. 24, 1944, the sub reported sinking two Japanese cargo ships days earlier and was ordered back to replenish its torpedo supply. But it never arrived in Midway.
After the war, the Navy used Japanese military records to try to piece together a history of its lost subs and pinpointed the submarine's final resting place as about 100 miles east-southeast of Okinawa, the Times reported.
But its remains were never found -- until Taylor took on the case.
In 2010, Taylor, an undersea explorer and CEO of a New York-based firm that provides autonomous underwater vehicles, discovered the USS R-12, which sank in an accident off Key West, Florida, in 1943. He set up a privately funded group called the Lost 52 Project, dedicated to using new technology to find long-lost World War II subs. Along with his wife, fellow explorer Christine Dennison, his team found three more vessels before tackling the Grayback.
In this case, he relied on a key discovery by Yutaka Iwasaki, a systems engineer in Kobe, Japan, who works with Taylor's team as a researcher. While poring over original Japanese military documents, he found reports showing that on Feb. 27, 1944, a Japanese aircraft had dropped a 500-pound bomb on the Grayback. The coordinates given in that report suggested the Navy had made a crucial error when translating the coordinates where the sub was attacked.
"It was off by one digit," Taylor said. "That changed the location by more than 100 miles."
Armed with the correct information, his team journeyed in June into the open seas off Japan with a fleet of the latest submersible drones.
"The most compelling moment was when the camera went from the bow up to the bridge and we all saw the plaque," Taylor said. "There was no doubt about it."

Biden lambastes 'chump' Giuliani

Texto completo: Joe Biden ripped Rudy Giuliani for his role in trying to dig up political dirt on him and his son's dealings in Ukraine while defending Hunter Biden from House Republican calls for him to testify before Congress as part of President Trump's impeachment proceeding.
"There's not been a scintilla of evidence pointing out anything wrong. But there are people around him, like that chump Rudy Giuliani and the thugs that he has working with him," the former vice president said on Monday in Iowa of his family's conduct.
Joe Biden dismissed the suggestion the younger Biden, a 49-year-old lobbyist who earned $50,000 a month from a Ukrainian oligarch-linked energy company while his father spearheaded the Obama administration's foreign policy in the region, should appear on Capitol Hill before impeachment investigators.
“There is zero rationale for that to happen,” Biden said during a town hall televised on CNN. “This is all a diversion. This is classic Trump, classic Trump. Focus on the problem. We have a president who is one of the most corrupt people to serve in that office.”
The television event coincides with the impeachment proceeding's first public hearings, scheduled to start on Wednesday. Investigators are looking into whether Trump improperly leveraged U.S. military aid with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to pressure him to examine the Bidens.
Giuliani pushed for a Ukrainian investigation into the Bidens since at least May, centering on Hunter Biden’s position on the board of Burisma Holdings, the natural gas company. The former New York mayor-turned-Trump's personal lawyer also wanted an investigation into the elder Biden’s threat to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loans from Ukraine while urging then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to fire the country's top prosecutor Viktor Shokin.
An associate of Giuliani told his lawyer he warned a representative of Zelensky’s government that the Trump administration would stop the flow of security assistance and Vice President Mike Pence would not attend Zelensky's inauguration if the country did not publicly announce an investigation into the Bidens, according to the New York Times this week. Giuliani has denied the allegations. "Categorically, I did not tell him to say that," he told the news outlet.

Joshua Bernstein wants you to drink better beer

Texto completo: Author Joshua M. Bernstein has written five books on craft beer, including “Drink Better Beer," released last month. In addition, Bernstein contributes beer and travel coverage to the New York Times, Men's Journal, and Imbibe.
I recently caught up with Bernstein to discuss his latest book, industry trends, and more.
You write that the release of your last book, in 2013, seems like “sixty-five million years ago." What have been some of the biggest shifts in beer since then? Six years ago, American craft beer was sitting in a hot air balloon that seemed to be soaring ever higher, no end in sight. Bitter IPAs were all the rage, and we bought beer at grocery and liquor stores in bottles, not cans. Now, hazy IPAs that flaunt juicy, tropical aromas and flavors and scant bitterness rule the land, the beers sold in 16-ounce cans directly from taprooms where — why not! — folks might stick around for another round served on site. The biggest shifts are where we buy beer, and where we drink beer.
What are your favorite beer trends right now? I'm psyched to see, slowly and steadily, that brewers are gravitating back toward traditional styles. Look, it's great to make something that tastes like your favorite childhood cereal, a beer to drink once and maybe never again — because it's never brewed again — but I like the trend toward refining pilsners and lagers and other classic styles, served in proper glassware with the right amount of foam on top.
What are your least-favorite trends? There's a beer for everyone, that's for sure. But I'm not the biggest fan of dessert-style stouts that are packed with excess alcohol, sugar, and enough candy bars to stock a corner store. I also have zero sweet tooth, so perhaps this isn't a trend for me, but I don't get excited about beers that I can only sip by the ounce, maybe two. I want to have a full pint and talk to folks, the beer a companion to conversation.
You've got a section on hard seltzer in there. What are your thoughts on that trend? Seltzer, in its booze-free form, is all about bubbly refreshment. It's a guilt-free pleasure. Hard seltzer has borrowed the healthy veneer, offering an of-the-moment mix of low calories, invigorating carbonation, and restrained alcohol content. You can also drink a couple of them, maybe five or six, while sitting at the beach on a sweltering summer day. Will the trend have lasting traction? I don't think we'll be making White Claw memes five years from now. We're always looking for a new flavor of the month. But if you reframe hard seltzer as a premixed, portable vodka soda, then you can see its appeal. If breweries want to make hard seltzer, go for it! It's fermentation. Brewers are good at fermenting things. Brewing is also a business. And as the industry grows more competitive and the taproom model evolves, it's imperative to offer drinks that might tickle everyone's fancy.
I wonder how your own personal beer preferences have changed over the years. When I first dove into beer more than 15 years ago, I used to chase intensities with the best of them, always seeking out flavors that were cranked high. Now, though, I've learned to appreciate beers that speak in whispers and conversational tones, not shouts. I want to get to know a Munich helles lager over several rounds, as well as knock back a couple Czech-style pilsners. Also, I seek out beers with a more moderate ABV. My liver isn't quite as fresh as it once was, and my first-grade daughter wakes up at the same time — 6 a.m. or so — every single day.
You mention London and Brussels as go-to beer destinations. Are there any others that you'd highly recommend? Don't sleep on domestic beer tourism. The great thing about America's brewery boom is that you'll find thriving and compelling scenes anywhere and everywhere. Go to Austin, Texas, and drink your way through the city's pilsners, or travel to Chicago and explore the town's deft integration of beer and food. I was just in Jacksonville, Fla., and I found a bundle of great breweries, many perched in the city's strip malls — the local version of the old abandoned warehouse. From regional flavor preferences to repurposed infrastructure, there's a wealth of amazing beer being made anywhere and everywhere. To experience it, you need to get in a car, plane, or train and drink up the local culture, one pint at a time.
What's the best beer experience you can remember? The day after my daughter was born, I bought a case of Sierra Nevada Celebration, the brewery's annual fresh-hop IPA. I sipped a cold bottle in the hospital while cradling Violet, a touch of bitterness bringing immeasurable joy to that memorable November day.

Texto completo: A prominent software developer said on Twitter that the credit card was "sexist" against women applying for credit.
Something curious happened when a husband and wife recently compared their Apple Card spending limits.
David Heinemeier Hansson vented on Twitter that even though his spouse, Jamie Hansson, had a better credit score and other factors in her favor, her application for a credit line increase had been denied.
Mr. Hansson, a prominent software developer, wondered how his credit line could be 20 times higher, referring to Apple Card as a "sexist program" (with an expletive added for emphasis).
The card, a partnership between Apple and Goldman Sachs, made its debut in the United States in August.
"My wife and I filed joint tax returns, live in a community-property state, and have been married for a long time," Mr. Hansson wrote Thursday on Twitter. "Yet Apple's black box algorithm thinks I deserve 20x the credit limit she does."
Mr. Hansson's tweets caught the attention of more than just his 350,000 followers.
They struck a nerve with New York State regulators, who announced on Saturday that they would investigate the algorithm used by Apple Card to determine the creditworthiness of applicants.
Algorithms are codes or a set of instructions used by computers, search engines and smartphone applications to perform tasks, from ordering food delivery to hailing a ride -- and yes, applying for credit.
The criteria used by the Apple Card are now being scrutinized by the New York State Department of Financial Services.
"Any algorithm that intentionally or not results in discriminatory treatment of women or any other protected class violates New York law," an agency spokeswoman said in a statement on Saturday night.
"DFS is troubled to learn of potential discriminatory treatment in regards to credit limit decisions reportedly made by an algorithm of Apple Card, issued by Goldman Sachs, and the Department will be conducting an investigation to determine whether New York law was violated and ensure all consumers are treated equally regardless of sex," the statement said.
An Apple spokeswoman directed questions to a Goldman Sachs spokesman, Andrew Williams, who said that the company could not comment publicly on individual customers.
"Our credit decisions are based on a customer's creditworthiness and not on factors like gender, race, age, sexual orientation or any other basis prohibited by law," Mr. Williams said.
Mr. Hansson did not respond to an interview request on Saturday night.
His wife's experience with the Apple Card, the first credit card offering by Goldman Sachs, does not appear to be an isolated case, however.
Steve Wozniak, who invented the Apple-1 computer with Steven P. Jobs and was a founder of the tech giant, responded to Mr. Hansson's tweet with a similar account.
"The same thing happened to us," Mr. Wozniak wrote. "I got 10x the credit limit. We have no separate bank or credit card accounts or any separate assets. Hard to get to a human for a correction though. It's big tech in 2019."
In addition to Goldman Sachs, Apple partnered with Mastercard on the Apple Card, which the companies hailed as a revolutionary "digital first" credit card that had no numbers and could be added to the Wallet app on the iPhone and used with Apple Pay.
A spokesman for Mastercard, which provides support for Apple Card's global payments network, referred questions to Goldman Sachs.
Mr. Hansson, a Danish entrepreneur and a California resident, is known for creating Ruby on Rails, a popular computer coding language used to create database-backed web applications. He is an author and a decorated racecar driver on the Le Mans circuit, according to a biography on his website.
In a subsequent tweet, Mr. Hansson said that the Apple Card's customer service representatives told his wife that they were not authorized to discuss the credit assessment process.
Mr. Hansson said that customer service employees were unable to explain why the algorithm had designated her to be less creditworthy but had assured his wife that the bank was not discriminating against women.
An applicant's credit score and income level are used by Goldman Sachs to determine creditworthiness, according to a support page for the Apple Card. Past due accounts, a checking account closed by a bank for overdrafts, liens and medical debts can negatively affect applications, the page stated.
On Friday, a day after Mr. Hansson started railing on the Apple Card's treatment of female credit applicants, he said his wife got a "VIP bump" to match his credit limit. He said that didn't make up for the flawed algorithm used by Apple Card.
Mr. Hansson said many women had shared similar experiences with him on Twitter, and urged regulators to contact them.
"My thread is full of accounts from women who've been declared to be worse credit risks than their husbands, despite higher credit scores or incomes," he said.

Texto completo: Sam Falk's pictures for The New York Times brought a vivid sense of art to its pages.
"To tell the story, completely and instantly," was how Sam Falk described his mission as a photographer.
A staff photographer at The New York Times from 1925 to 1969 -- a turbulent and transformative era in American history -- Falk brought a sense of timing, framing and narrative that enriched the visual sensibility of the paper. For just 3 cents, the reading public could see pictures that could have just as easily hung in a museum. In fact, many later would.
"Mr. Falk brings us into even more intimate communion with the city," wrote one reviewer of "New York: True North," a book from 1964 featuring Falk's work. "He has a reporter's knack of being in the right place at the right moment and an artist's ability to capitalize on the moment. With equal skill he shares with us a darkling glimpse of some crapshooters caught by police under a streetlamp, a sunny moment while little girls romp beside the lake in Central Park and the concentration of some British diplomats in huddled conference at the United Nations."
"Sam was a gem," said Barton Silverman, an award-winning photographer who joined the paper as a photo lab technician in 1962 and worked as a staffer from 1965 to 2014. When Mr. Silverman started, Falk was working for the Sunday department, where he had been since 1951, photographing news features, covers for The New York Times Magazine and portraits of luminaries such as Nina Simone, Marcel Duchamp and Sidney Poitier.
Mr. Silverman remembered Falk as a meticulous photographer and a storyteller who encouraged the younger staff members, explaining: "Everybody respected him. He had carte blanche anywhere he went."
Kathy Ryan, the current director of photography at the magazine, was working on the 1996 centenary photography issue when she first saw Falk's work. "I thought, 'Whoa, who is this Sam Falk?' He's a really good photographer. And that was it," she recalled. Drawing comparisons to such foundational photographers as Henri Cartier-Bresson, Elliott Erwitt and Bruce Davidson, Ms. Ryan sees in Falk's work a "total appreciation for the observed moment."
Falk emigrated to New York from Austria as a child, and was still in high school when he sold his first photograph, a box-camera image of a streak of lightning, to The New York Morning World. After spending a few years working for a commercial photographer, he joined The Times in 1925, just as photojournalism was beginning to come into its own. By the time he retired in 1969, pictures had become an essential way of presenting the news.
Falk and his camera witnessed events from the Lindbergh kidnapping trial to V-E Day observances in Midtown Manhattan. He also shot sports, later stating that such assignments were the best training for a press photographer, to develop a "lightning sense of timing." Between 1925 and 1964, he had more than 20,000 photographs published in The Times.
Along the way, he decided that the standard camera for newspaper photographers, the 4x5 Speed Graphic, was too cumbersome, and he began to also use a smaller, 35-millimeter camera. (Staff photographers, including Falk, also used a Rolleiflex 120 camera.) In a conversation published in 1955, Falk lamented the bulkiness of a large-format camera: "Occasionally I hear press photographers say, 'Don't look at the camera.' They are trying to get that candid-type picture. But how can you possibly get a candid picture with that thing?" With the 35-millimeter, Mr. Silverman said, "you picked it up and nobody knew when you were making a picture or not."
Falk was one of the first at the paper to experiment with the 35-millimeter format. In addition to enabling more candid photographs, the 35-millimeter could shoot better in available light. The Times's photo department didn't have the equipment to process 35-millimeter film, however, so Falk bought a camera and developing tank with his own money. In an interview with Popular Photography in 1981, he remembered being chided: "Why can't you leave things alone; everybody else is using the Graphic; why do you have to be different?" Falk's persistence was not misplaced. The Times eventually converted to 35-millimeter cameras and relied on them for decades.
"Camera-wise, I think that really changed the way a photographer could go out and document," said Mark Lubell, executive director of the International Center of Photography. "I mean, you could really begin to capture that sort of day-to-day life in a way that technically might not have been possible before. And I think that's what you see a great deal of in Sam's work, is the ability to tell a personal story without sort of alerting the subjects."
In a photograph of dancers taken at a nightclub in 1964, for instance, Falk captured a scene in motion, with moments of velvety definition: the hanging lanterns, the man's raised arms, the woman's necklace. The mood is intimate, drawing you closer, and the chasm of time between when Falk pressed the shutter and now is compressed in an instant. You're there, in the scene.
Todd Heisler, a Times staff photographer since 2006, noted that "great photographers just seem to leave enough room in their frame for serendipity."
"Being a news photographer for a daily newspaper you have to make images every day," Mr. Heisler said before discussing Falk specifically. "Whether it was an image of the subway or a construction photo, or anything that's really mundane, he really made something beautiful out of it. That level of consistency and sophistication is really special for his time."
Falk's work is imbued with his love of New York, from his row of silhouettes framed against a blazing neon movie marquee, to his view of passengers at the old Pennsylvania Station. As he once put it, "There is nothing equal to the adventure of discovering something different in ever-changing New York City."
It's something Ms. Ryan sees in his work. When asked what she would assign Falk today, she responded: "Something that he could fall deeply in love with. A subject that you could see his tremendous fondness for. Because my favorite pictures are ones like this one of papers going on the truck outside the Times building. Or the ones that he did of couples in love. The ones that he did where you can just see that he's completely enamored of New York City."
This love of the city and its people may have inspired Falk, in 1948, to find the owner of some lost negatives. Falk had bought a camera at an auction for property lost on the subway, only to discover it contained exposed film. It showed a couple's wedding day, at a church on East 13th Street. In one of the photos, a license plate number was visible, and Falk used it to track down the camera's owner -- a professional photographer and friend of the couple -- and returned the developed negatives. More than a year after getting married, the happy couple, Peter and Mary Kichura, finally saw their wedding photos.
Falk died in 1991, at the age of 90, but even during his lifetime his work was repeatedly honored by galleries and museums, including the Museum of Modern Art and the Smithsonian Institution, which devoted a solo exhibition to his photographs that ran for more than a year. In 1952, Falk received a citation from the City of New York, for his contributions to the "furtherance of the best aspects of life in this metropolis and advancement of the good will of its people."
The previous year, Falk had gone to Flushing, Queens, and positioned himself poolside to capture the Aquazanies, an acrobatic diving troupe. In the photograph, the divers hurtle like rag dolls toward the water below. The diving board juts out from the edge of the picture, the backdrop is an expanse of sky, but the focus is on the figures -- always falling, never landing -- suspended in everlasting motion.

Texto completo: In her new audiobook "Self-Tanner for the Soul," the quasi-reformed party girl tells listeners that you can, in fact, run away from your problems.
These days, Cat Marnell wakes up at 9 a.m. -- "early for me," she said.
She had been providing examples of her reformed life, including that she does Pilates videos on YouTube and sleeps every night, "for, like, a long time." She was sitting atop a picnic table in an empty private courtyard in Alphabet City, an impromptu interview setting she landed on after an hourlong, failed search for the treehouse where she used to smoke angel dust.
That was the old Cat Marnell, which she chronicled in her best-selling 2017 memoir, "How to Murder Your Life." The book showed her juggling an intense career as an up-and-coming magazine writer (at Lucky, xoJane, Vice) with an even more intense dependency on prescription pills; in defiance of other hard-partying confessionals, she didn't pretend to have conquered her addictions by the end. After she finished this anti-recovery memoir, she hit rock bottom. That's where her latest project, an Audible Original audiobook called "Self-Tanner for the Soul," picks up.
"It's said that you can't run away from your problems," Marnell, 37, said into a microphone in Audible's Newark studios in July, wearing an off-the-shoulder peasant dress, her black eyeliner thick, her wig platinum. She was reading aloud from the diary she kept during her two-year solo tour of the youth hostels, all-night supermarkets and grimy public beaches of Europe and Asia. "But guess what, babes? Untrue. Of course you can. You can do it fabulously."
Back in June 2017, when she impulse-bought a one-way ticket from J.F.K. to Lisbon -- the first of several flights she would miss -- the problems she had to run away from were many. She had achieved a kind of downtown Manhattan notoriety writing articles with headlines like "The Cockroach and the Cokehead" and "Trippy Terror Tuesday: Fantastic Hemp-Based Beauty for Vaguely Consensual + Very Stoned Hippie Sex Cult Orgies," all in deliciously strung-out prose.
The only thing was, she was strung out. One night in 2017, just before she was set to start promoting her book, she burned off all her hair and flooded her Chinatown apartment while high on Adderall. "It was complete beauty Chernobyl," she said, the culmination of substance abuse that stretched back to when she was 15. "Everything that I'd been doing my whole life caught up with me. All of a sudden, the inside matched the outside."
A few months later, she left New York City with little more than a Samsonite suitcase (nicknamed "Sammy") packed with neon wigs and amphetamines.
"Self-Tanner for the Soul" -- a title Marnell came up with forever ago, and here was the perfect chance to use it -- is a rambling tale of bus rides and breakfast-buffet binges, from Naples to Krakow and every consonant-laden town in between. As she recorded it in the studio, she interrupted herself with asides: "Cool, Cat, another airport? Fascinating." But she was committed in this project to authenticity, to telling it like it was. "This one was meant to be a break from writing writing," she said. In the introduction, she wrote a disclaimer that has since been cut: "These diaries are NOT what I'd call 'well-written.' They're just ... ME."
Her agent Byrd Leavell said that because of the debauchery, the drugs and the self-deprecation, people constantly underestimate Marnell.
"There's this magnificent brain that's inside that whole package," he said. "Cat is the first one to dismiss it, to always joke about whatever she's doing. But you realize, with the level of drug addiction she was essentially surviving, and then going to work, way back in the day, how tough she is, and how driven she is."
For Marnell, it is important that we not look at "Self-Tanner" as her Next Big Book, but as a real-time account of a journey that helped her get, if not quite healthy ("I'm definitely not in recovery"), then at least "the healthiest I've ever been," she said.
The result? "I think it's the most honest thing I've ever written," she said. "Because it's not glamorous at all. It's just a tired person moving through the world. And that's real."
As she describes in the audiobook, she begins as "still the crazy person I was in New York" but finds that Europe doesn't have the same tolerance for an adult woman parading around in a green wig, oversleeping past checkout time. "Also I was miserable because there's nothing going on at night anywhere," she said. "When I got there, I was dressed like I was in New York, it was like costumes, and by the end of it I dressed really normal. I just wanted people to like me. It really, really helped me."
After visiting more than 60 countries in two years, she felt she needed to come back to reality. "Actually, travel is kind of empty. That's what I've learned," she said. Since finishing the audiobook, she has been staying at her mother's house outside Washington. "She's very different now," said her mother, Stacey Marnell, certain that her daughter is no longer using.
"I knew her in all the dark days of her book as someone who couldn't keep a routine, couldn't focus," she added. "She's so focused now. If anything it's a little bit annoying, because her day revolves around an exercise class that she's doing on the floor of my living room."
But for Cat, reconciling herself to a more sober, more "normal" life has been a challenge. She started to well up recalling what came before: the "devastating" end of a toxic, eight-year on-again-off-again relationship; the 97-pound frame she had at her sickest ("I'm trying to embrace the fact that I'm never going to have that drug-addict body again, but of course I want it"); the dissolution of her so-called friendships with the graffiti artists who never knew she was smart or funny because they "never talked to me like a normal person." "I've really lost all my confidence," she said.
But then she tapped into that nonchalant resilience, the same instinct she must have used to whirl around the world alone, or to save her own life O.D. after O.D. "I need to let go of this stuff," she said, like she really meant it. Maybe she'll date, have a kid, move to London, maybe she won't. "What I'm excited about now is actually being a writer again."
A man appeared at the gate of the courtyard to tell us he was locking up, and stared at Marnell, as almost every passer-by does. "You look like an anime character with those lashes," he said to her.
"Thank you! Anime is always what I'm going for," she sang back, brushing past him onto the sidewalk.
Marnell slipped out of cartoon-doll mode just as easily as she'd slipped into it. "This next book I'm going to do is going to be so good. I'm not doing it voicey and bubbly. I'm doing it real tight, and focused, almost like poems are," she said. "I can do that. I know I can."

Resumen: [...]if I were advising the former vice president, I would tell him to take some time off. Biden is playing to the middle, at least compared to other candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass), who has a variety of crazy schemes which include eliminating private health insurance, free college for all, eliminating the Electoral College and a $52 trillion Medicare-for-all plan which, she says will not necessitate raising taxes on the middle class.

Texto completo: Joe Biden is going to win the Democratic nomination for president. I wouldn’t run to your bookie with this information. My track record is spotty, at best. But I’ll be shocked if I’m wrong and I’ll have plenty of company, including many Democrats. I don’t believe Biden is going to win because he’s putting together a great campaign or because he has the best ideas. In fact, if I were advising the former vice president, I would tell him to take some time off. Don’t do anything or say anything. Just kind of disappear for a while. The nomination is in the bag.
Biden will win because Democrats, in their collective heart of hearts, believe he’s the only one who can beat President Donald Trump. Sure, there will be a few more gaffes on the way to the nomination, and he might think he’s in Detroit when he’s actually in San Antonio, but that only makes him more kindly and relatable — an absent-minded uncle who pulls a silver dollar out of your ear.
If there is such a thing as a moderate Democrat these days, Biden is it. His positions on various hot-button issues, such as capital punishment and abortion have moved to the left over the years, but he has not endorsed a "Medicare for all" plan that his Democratic challengers are championing. He’s supported the "spirit" of the Green New Deal, if not the actual proposal, which left many climate activists wondering where he stands. Biden has a plan of his own, which includes elimination carbon emissions by 2050.
Erich Pica, president of Friends of the Earth Action, told The Associated Press in June that Biden’s commitment to climate change is "somewhat anemic."
Well played, Joe. A solid, C-plus, right in the meaty part of the curve.
Biden is playing to the middle, at least compared to other candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass), who has a variety of crazy schemes which include eliminating private health insurance, free college for all, eliminating the Electoral College and a $52 trillion Medicare-for-all plan which, she says will not necessitate raising taxes on the middle class. This, of course, is a lie. There aren’t enough rich people in this country to pay for Warren’s Golden Corral, all-you-can-eat, entitlement buffet.
The media love Warren but they also loved Hillary Clinton. They’re just bored with Biden. He doesn’t move the needle much either way. He’s neither particularly inspiring nor overtly offensive. And this is why he’s going to win the nomination.
While a recent Monmouth University poll showed Biden and Warren in a virtual dead heat, a Fox News poll of likely Democratic primary voters revealed 68 percent believe that Biden can defeat Trump, compared to 57 for Warren.
But here’s some news that should give Democrats the heebiest of jeebies; according to a New York Times/Sienna College survey, Trump trails Biden but leads Warren in the battleground states that will ultimately decide the election.
Think about that for a second. Looming impeachment, low approval ratings, unrelenting attacks from a media that can’t stand him and still, Trump is competitive in swing states. Considering that the Democrats are actively involved in a primary and Trump really hasn’t started campaigning yet, Democrats should be worried.
If they want to give Trump a gift, they should nominate Warren.
To be sure, there are many progressives who believe Biden is too moderate, too centrist, and that he does nothing to energize younger voters. His nomination, they say, would lead to a repeat of 2016.
Biden is, indeed, the safe, establishment candidate. You might argue that so was Hillary Clinton. But she had baggage Biden doesn’t — too many people just didn’t like her. Warren has likability issues as well, along with an extreme agenda. Will moderate, blue-collar, union-member voters in states like Michigan and Wisconsin vote for Warren? For what it’s worth, the Times survey says "no."
Of course, the Democratic Party will eventually support whichever candidate starts winning primaries and will jettison the others, much like the crew of the Star Trek Enterprise jettisoned Mr. Spock in Wrath of Khan. But for Democrats who believe in an alternative to tepid, "middle-class Joe," I leave you with the words of Spock himself: "It is curious how often you humans manage to obtain that which you do not want."

Texto completo: Aides to former Vice President Joe Biden were reportedly worried about the appearance of his son's employment with a Ukrainian gas company while his father was still in office.
Sources described as "people who worked with his office" told the New York Times that his staffers were concerned about the optics of Hunter Biden's employment on the board of Burisma while his father was publicly railing against corruption in the country.
"Hunter Biden’s activities struck many of the officials working on Ukraine policy as an unnecessary distraction, or worse," the publication reported Sunday. "Mr. Biden’s own aides were so worried about the optics, they enlisted State Department officials to gather facts to determine how to handle the story, according to people who worked with his office."
However, "few, if any, had raised the issue with Mr. Biden directly when it first arose." Most viewed Hunter Biden's position as an issue that was "simply not worth risking a scolding from Mr. Biden, who had reacted angrily when Mr. Obama’s aides raised the issue of his son’s lobbying during the 2008 campaign."
Others pointed to the personal loss of his son Beau Biden as another reason why aides shied away from discussing the matter with him.
Instead, they resorted to pushing the "private citizen" talking point about Hunter Biden, with a former adviser saying, "The independent activities of an adult child simply don’t create a 'conflict of interest' for the parent who is a public official."
Biden's son made $50,000 a month during his employment with the company, which he has since admitted was "poor judgment." The Bidens have insisted they did not discuss the younger's work and that the elder Biden simply told him, "I hope you know what you're doing" when he learned of his employment.
President Trump has accused the 2020 Democratic front-runner of corruption for his son's involvement with the Ukrainian company during his vice presidency. During a July 25 phone call, he pressed the president of Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, a conversation that launched House impeachment proceedings last month.

What national polls don't tell you about Trump's standing here

Texto completo: "There is a profound disconnect between the state-level polling on the horse race and what we're seeing in the national polling. I don't know whether Joe Biden is up by 17 points nationally or if he's only up a couple of points in Wisconsin, but both can't be true."
Ken Goldstein
Political scientist who conducts his own polls
With a year to go before the 2020 election, some national polls show Donald Trump facing daunting, double-digit deficits in his re-election bid.
But the polling in Wisconsin and other swing states paints a far more competitive picture.
Can both be right?
The gap between Trump's worst national polls and his best battleground polls is so big it simply doesn't add up.
But it also reflects something very real about the political landscape: that nationwide surveys don't always capture what's happening in the handful of states most likely to determine the Electoral College winner.
Wisconsin is a prime example. It is at the top of the list of pivotal battlegrounds in the eyes of most analysts, suggesting that public opinion here shouldn't deviate all that much from what it is nationally. Yet Trump has performed consistently better in Wisconsin than he has in nationwide polls.
The president is averaging in the low 40s in job approval in national surveys.
But in Wisconsin, he is at 46% approval in a Marquette Law School poll released two weeks ago, 47% in a New York Times/Siena poll released Monday, 44% in a Fox News poll released last month, and 42% in a poll just released by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Cook Political Report. Trump's average job approval in those four surveys is 45%, far from stellar but not crippling to his re-election prospects either.
"I think the battleground polls are more meaningful" than the national polls, said Diane Feldman, a longtime Democratic pollster who has conducted many surveys in Wisconsin.
The seeming disconnect between national surveys and battleground surveys was highlighted this week when the New York Times published polls showing Trump either tied, narrowly behind or narrowly ahead of his best-known Democratic rivals in the key states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Florida, Arizona and North Carolina.
Takeaway: In the states that matter most, the race is up for grabs.
A day later, a nationwide Washington Post-ABC News poll showed Trump trailing Joe Biden by 17 points, Elizabeth Warren by 15 and Bernie Sanders by 14.
Takeaway: Trump is in dire, dire straits.
"There is a profound disconnect between the state-level polling on the horse race and what we're seeing in the national polling. I don't know whether Joe Biden is up by 17 points nationally or if he's only up a couple of points in Wisconsin, but both can't be true," said political scientist Ken Goldstein, who conducts his own polls in Wisconsin and elsewhere.
Part of the explanation involves different pollsters using different methodologies and capturing different cross-sections of voters with different partisan leanings. Feldman said sometimes national polls oversample the populous coasts, which would skew a survey toward Democrats.
Part of the explanation involves the normal variations in polling that always produce occasional outliers.
But that still leaves the fact that, as the 2016 election showed, the Electoral College picture can deviate from the picture of the nation as a whole. Three years ago, Trump won the decisive battlegrounds of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania by under 1 point while losing the national vote by 2 points.
If that pattern holds, Democrats might have to win the popular vote by 3 points or more in 2020 to carry the key state battlegrounds they need to win the Electoral College.
Polling since Trump took office reinforces that point.
"In Wisconsin, our (Trump) approval number has been consistently about 3 points higher than his national average," said Charles Franklin, who conducts the Marquette poll. Trump has averaged a little under 46% approval in Wisconsin over the past year in Marquette's polling.
As a result of this gap, anyone focused on the polling in battleground Wisconsin is probably going to get a more competitive picture of the electoral fight than he or she would get from national surveys, where Trump is typically getting approval ratings of 41% to 44% — or, in the case of the Washington-Post-ABC poll, 39%.
"The news this week was unequivocally bad for the White House if you were looking at national polls and unequivocally bad for the Democrats if you were looking at state polls," said Goldstein, a political science professor with the University of San Francisco and before that, the University of Wisconsin-Madison. (The White House also got bad news with the GOP's election setbacks Tuesday, losing legislative control in Virginia and a contest for governor in Kentucky).
"Battleground states are battlegrounds precisely because they're close. We should expect Wisconsin and probably Pennsylvania and North Carolina or Florida and Arizona to be pretty close states," Franklin said.
There have been variations in both the state and national polls. Nationally, an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll shows Trump trailing Biden by 9 points, while Trump's deficit in the Washington Post survey is almost twice as large.
In Wisconsin, a Fox News poll released in early October had Biden leading Trump in Wisconsin by 9 points. The recent Marquette poll had Biden leading by 6. The New York Times/Siena poll had Biden leading by 3.
While the New York Times poll puts Trump's approval here at 47% and Marquette puts it at 46%, the new Kaiser survey puts it at 42%. One thing that could explain these differences is that in the Marquette poll, the mix of Republican and Democratic voters was close to even; in the Kaiser survey, the sample was more Democratic-leaning in its makeup.
But in the case of the state's most frequent poll (by Marquette), Trump's ratings have been remarkably consistent. The president's approval ratings in the last six Marquette polls dating back to October 2018 are: 46, 47, 44, 46, 45 and 46%. Those numbers have deviated even less than you would expect simply from random statistical variation.
Franklin said his numbers are very consistent with the possibility that Trump's true level of approval among all registered voters in Wisconsin hasn't changed at all over the past year.
What do Trump's job ratings in Wisconsin suggest about his prospects of winning the state again?
If you believe that a president's approval rating is highly predictive of the incumbent's share of the vote, that would suggest Trump is at a significant disadvantage in this state right now.
"Every president running for reelection over the last 60 years has received on Election Day a percentage of the popular vote within a point of their job approval number," ABC news analyst Matthew Dowd, a strategist for President George W. Bush who now considers himself an independent, wrote this week.
But some experts believe Trump can and will "overperform" his approval rating, as he over-performed his popularity rating in 2016.
Why? Because so many of his own supporters have such mixed feelings about him personally that it holds down his overall approval rating among people who are happy with key aspects of his performance — such as the economy — and will end up voting for him anyway. Others who dislike Trump may end up disliking the Democratic nominee even more, which happened in 2016.
"He has a vote that goes beyond the voters that approve of him," Feldman said.
Trump's flat approval ratings make it incumbent upon him to drive up the "negatives" of the Democratic nominee, said Ed Goeas, a GOP pollster.
"It's going to be driven by how high the negatives of his opponent are," said Goeas, who doesn't think Trump's approval number is as good a guide to his re-election performance as it has been for past presidents.
"His approval overall is kind of a worst-case scenario for him," he said.
Franklin said the Wisconsin polling suggests "the president's job approval has been consistently net negative, but not enormously so. He has been behind Biden in the (last two Marquette polls) but quite competitive with the other Democrats."
The Marquette pollster said, "it would be wrong to see the state as anything other than close," with Trump still facing an "uphill" battle due to his negative ratings.
"Everyone's obsession with Wisconsin isn't just hype. It's truly competitive," Goldstein said. "Trump is very much in a gray area, where he would be in trouble if this were a pure referendum (on him) but has a chance because it's going to be a choice."
Feldman, the Democratic pollster, said "We are maybe looking at a situation that is more similar to 2016 than (Democrats) would like it to be," meaning a very narrowly decided contest.
If that is true, then after all this time, Wisconsin would be right back where it was in the last election — on a knife's edge.
"There is a profound disconnect between the state-level polling on the horse race and what we're seeing in the national polling. I don't know whether Joe Biden is up by 17 points nationally or if he's only up a couple of points in Wisconsin, but both can't be true."

Domino's rolls out e-bike delivery Your pizza may soon be delivered by pedal power. Domino's Pizza has been testing delivery by e-bike in several cities, including New York. Domino's says the e-bikes mean more efficient delivery in congested areas and can attract a wider pool of workers, especially those without cars or driver licenses. Domino's intends to roll out the service in several cities by the end of the year. - PETER KING U.S. probes TikTok Multiple published reports say the U.S. government has launched a national-security review of the China-owned app TikTok. The social media app, where users share short videos, has become wildly popular with U.S. teens and young adults. The government has concerns about how TikTok collects users' personal data, its censorship of political content and its growing influence in the United States, according to The New York Times. - AP Tipping point Do you tip your Uber driver? If so, how much? A new study from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that 60 percent of riders never tip their drivers, and only 1 percent always tip. Crunching the numbers means only 15 percent of Uber rides results in a tip. Overall, the average tip - for those who actually do tip - is $3. -  PETER KING

Texto completo: Two sides to property rights

Eight years ago, I bought my dream home in a quiet waterfront residential neighborhood in Crystal River. In the last few years, our once tight-knit neighborhood became a hotbed for short-term vacation rentals. Last year, the street I live on became a parking lot full of cars, trucks, boats and trailers. Every few days, a dozen new people cycle in and out  trespassing on neighboring properties, leaving trash on the street, partying and causing traffic at all hours. Due to a grandfathered rental ordinance, city code enforcement pursued the short-term rental activity, and for now, we have a shaky peace. But for the past three years, state legislation (backed by Airbnb) has been proposed that would threaten more damage to communities by overriding the ability of local governments to regulate short-term rentals.

Similar legislation passed in Arizona in 2016. The article, They killed our city: Sedona residents confront lawmaker over short-term rentals, highlights how this has hurt the community of Sedona, another tourist destination where vacation rentals are overtaking residential housing. One legislator is quoted as saying, We never anticipated that somebody would go into a neighborhood, purchase a home and turn it into a mini-hotel. But thats what is happening.

A big argument surrounding this issue is property rights. However, bill supporters are using it to put the property rights of investors operating vacation rentals above the property rights of homeowners who dont want to live next to mini-hotels. These investor-owned homes are vacation rental businesses, and they should be designated, regulated and treated as such.

When the Hernando County legislative delegation meets on Nov. 18 at the Hernando County Government Center, I encourage community members to attend and make their voices heard. Our legislators need to represent the best interest of their constituents by protecting the well-being and quality of life in our communities.

J.D. Ross, Crystal River

What did people expect?

So, e-scooters are not all they are cracked up to be. I had to giggle at how people are riding those wonderful e-scooters: men with babies strapped to their backs, people riding on streets where they arent supposed to be, riders leaving them lying around all over the place, and now we have people destroying them.

Im sure there are many of you who think scooters are great, but there are many not obeying the rules, and we act like we didnt know this was going to happen?

Where are the cops to hand out fines to these people? Dont the companies who are renting out these nightmares know who has them so they can hand them a hefty penalty for leaving them all over the place or not obeying the rules? Serious fines would solve the problem, and it shouldnt be a small fine like texting on your phone while driving. Wait  are people allowed to text or use their smart phones while riding a scooter? What a madhouse.

Anna Carletti, Tampa

Beware of park cyclists

North Shore Park in St. Petersburg is a disaster waiting to happen. The park is being inundated by bicyclists who look to be training for the next Tour de France, cyclists talking on phones and others exercising their dogs. Few let their presence be known by word or bell. These riders are putting children and animals at risk. A simple solution would be to post a speed limit and require all riders to announce their presence or be subject to a ticket and fine.

Lee Puckett, St. Petersburg

Seeking out the truth

People have been brought to life on both sides of the issue. The problem with not caring about what other people think about us across the country and in other parts of the world is that it shows how narrow-minded those in office and the community can be. They dont want those people here anyway.

They act as if the New York Times writes only about the president  never mind all the information about issues in the rest of the world. Never mind that the Pulitzer Prize is not given out randomly. Never mind the science, the world, the arts and health news taught to those of us wanting to continue learning way after our formal educations have ended.

People with closed minds are rigid. There is no room for logic to squeeze through to give a thought that will differ from what they are convinced is the only truth. There is no room, or need, to grow.

The problem isnt that the request for digital subscriptions for Citrus County library card holders was denied. Its the reason behind it, the phrase fake news. The world knows what that means and where it comes from. Our county is famous now. I read the New York Times because I trust it. Have things been written that turned out to have not been fully vetted? Yes, and a correction is made.

The real fake news comes from the shows people with these views watch non-stop believing every lie because it fits their narrative. You cant argue with people like this. Some are very proud of this notoriety. The rest of us? Were okay because we actually know what the truth is. We are in the majority, just not in Citrus County.

A bill that will cut emissions

We should support mass transit to reduce auto traffic and pollution. We should also support legislation that prices fossil-based fuels for their negative effect on health, the environment and climate. The Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act introduced by Reps. Francis Rooney and Charlie Crist does that. It will incentivize the use of mass transit and electric cars, reducing pollution, by placing a fee on production of carbon-based fuels and returning the funds to citizens as a dividend.

Texto completo: The mouse puppet that she made in the late 1950s in Italy became a worldwide phenomenon, with the help of "The Ed Sullivan Show."
Maria Perego, an Italian puppeteer and the creator of Topo Gigio, the lovable mouse who became famous to American audiences as a frequent guest on "The Ed Sullivan Show" in the 1960s and early '70s and was known worldwide, died on Thursday in Milan. She was 95.
Her death was announced on her official Facebook page.
Ms. Perego, who worked alongside her husband, Federico Caldura, came up with the 10-inch-tall Topo Gigio in the late 1950s. Topo Gigio was a sort of cross between a puppet and a marionette; three puppeteers, hidden in a black background, moved various body parts with rods.
According to "Sundays With Sullivan: How 'The Ed Sullivan Show' Brought Elvis, the Beatles, and Culture to America," a 2008 book by Bernie Ilson, Mr. Sullivan saw a tape of the puppet from Italian television and booked Topo Gigio for a series of appearances on his popular Sunday-night CBS variety show. The first, the book said, was on April 14, 1963.
Ms. Perego and two other puppeteers were on hand to impart the movements, and a fourth provided Topo Gigio's voice -- but, Mr. Ilson wrote, Mr. Sullivan had not realized that someone would also have to serve as the puppet's straight man. Mr. Sullivan, who was famously wooden on camera, stepped into that task for the initial appearance, figuring he would arrange for a professional comic to take over for later ones if the bit caught on.
"It was evident from the very first appearance, however, that the chemistry between Sullivan and Topo Gigio worked extremely well," Mr. Ilson wrote. "The exchanges between Sullivan and the mouselike puppet revealed another side of the host, a warm and humanizing element."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Mr. Sullivan remained in the role of sidekick for what the book says were some 50 appearances by Topo Gigio over the years. (Other sources give higher numbers.) The appearances often ended with the mouse saying, in a thick Italian accent, "Eddie, kiss me good night."
"The line became famous," Mr. Ilson wrote, "and it was not unusual for passers-by to call out, 'Eddie, keees-a-me goood night' as Sullivan walked the streets of New York."
The exposure on the Sullivan show helped make Topo Gigio a worldwide phenomenon.
"When I was called to have my puppet perform at 'The Ed Sullivan Show' in the now distant 1960s, I could not believe it was happening to me," Ms. Perego told Italy Magazine in 2013. "It was like a dream. My puppet not only entered Americans' households, I believe he also entered their hearts."
Ms. Perego was born on Dec. 8, 1923, in Venice, and later moved to Milan. She had homes there and in France.
In a whimsical account on the official Topo Gigio website, the mouse tells the story of how he came to be:
A Christmas tree cut out of a spongelike material caught Ms. Perego's eye as it sat in a barbershop. The material, she realized, would be just right for making new types of puppets, ones that, according to the account, "would now have soft and smooth faces, easily supporting the close-ups on television."
Also, because of the malleability of the material, a plastic foam, she could incorporate mechanisms that would allow the movement of eyes, mouth and fingers, creating a lifelike illusion.
In 1958 she and her husband began making puppets for the Italian variety show "Canzonissima" and other programs, according to the account. Sometimes when working on musical numbers they would play with the recording -- speeding it up, for instance, to get a sound that matched the personality of a particular puppet.
According to Topo Gigio's account, one day in 1959 a recording by the singer Domenico Modugno was played at fast-forward speed, and Ms. Perego exclaimed, "This is the voice of a little mouse!" A bit of cutting and sewing brought Topo Gigio into being.
At first the mouse didn't draw as much interest in Italy as Ms. Perego had hoped, so she shopped versions of it to Swiss, Dutch, German and Spanish television outlets. Somewhere along the line Topo Gigio came to Mr. Sullivan's attention, and the character really took off.
Over the years there have been Topo Gigio books, cartoons, record albums, stage shows and films. One movie, "The Magic World of Topo Gigio," drew a favorable review from Howard Thompson in The New York Times when it played in New York in 1965.
"The general tone is jaunty," he wrote, "and the perky, pear-shaped mouse is a joy to see and hear, as he outwits an evil magician and saves two pals, a golden-curled girl mouse and a tart-tongued worm with an inferiority complex. Put it all down as a nice treat for the kiddies."
The character had a particularly big following in Latin America. In 2015 Ms. Perego published a book in Italy, "Io e Topo Gigio" ("Me and Topo Gigio"), and at her death she was said to be working on a new animated series featuring the character.
"Topo Gigio is a naïve character, but with his optimism he tries to justify himself, to invent, to introduce himself and to enter into fantasy and the absurd," Ms. Perego recently said on a program on RAI, Italian state television. "He's always on the edge between imagination and reality."
Information on Ms. Perego's survivors was not immediately available.

Texto completo: The outreach may not expand the president's meager support among African-Americans, but it appeared aimed at reassuring suburban white voters discomfited by his use of racist tropes.
ATLANTA -- After a summer of racial furor, President Trump reached out to African-American voters on Friday, arguing that his economic and criminal justice policies had done more for them than decades of false promises by Democratic leaders who he said took them for granted.
Kicking off a new campaign effort called "Black Voices for Trump," the president sought to recalibrate his message as he heads into next year's re-election effort. Addressing several hundred African-American supporters who signed up to help him win another term, he vowed to compete for support across racial lines.
"We're going to campaign for every last African-American vote in 2020," he told the crowd at the Georgia World Congress Center. "We've done more for African-Americans in three years than the broken Washington establishment has done in more than 30 years." He added that "the Democrat Party already left you a long time ago" and said, "If you don't want liberal extremists to run your lives, then today we say welcome to the Republican Party."
The outreach may not expand the president's meager support among African-Americans, but it appeared aimed at reassuring suburban white voters discomfited by his use of racist tropes and incendiary language. Mr. Trump has played to the nation's raw racial divide as no other president has in the modern era, repeatedly stoking public feuds with African-American athletes and lawmakers while describing Latin American migrants as marauding invaders and rapists.
Over the summer, he demanded that four liberal Democratic congresswomen of color "go back" to their home countries, even though three were actually born in the United States and the other was a naturalized citizen. He went after Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, describing his Baltimore district as a "disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess" where "no human being would want to live." Mr. Cummings died last month from a long illness.
Mr. Trump has insisted over the years that he is the "least racist person you've ever met" and said it is his critics who use race as a weapon against him. Some of his supporters amplified that argument at Friday's event in Atlanta.
"Let me tell you something, if he's a racist, he's an awfully bad one," Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development and the only African-American in the cabinet, said in introducing the president. "He needs to go get a lesson from the real racists."
Yet Mr. Carson obliquely acknowledged that Mr. Trump was not popular among African-Americans. "Thank you for your courage to be here," he told the audience, assailing what he portrayed as the tyranny of the politically correct left. "It takes a lot of courage to say you're supporting President Trump."
The event was like a Trump rally in miniature. Instead of a large stadium, it was held in a conference room with about 400 people. Among them were some of Mr. Trump's most loyal African-American supporters, including Herman Cain, the pizza mogul turned 2012 presidential candidate; Alveda King, a niece of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and anti-abortion leader; and Lynnette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson, two African-American sisters and internet stars better known as Diamond and Silk.
It did not go unnoticed on social media that at least a couple of the people wearing "Blacks for Trump" were actually white. The president asked the crowd whether they preferred "Blacks for Trump" or "African-Americans for Trump" and they began chanting, "Blacks for Trump! Blacks for Trump!"
The Democratic National Committee scoffed at the notion that Mr. Trump was a friend to African-Americans, citing his past statements as well as policies they say have disadvantaged blacks or removed legal protections against discrimination. "Donald Trump has shown our community his true self through his words and inaction," said Brandon Gassaway, the committee's spokesman. "All the rest is just hype."
Mr. Trump received about 8 percent of the black vote in 2016 and has an approval rating of about 10 percent among African-Americans. A poll by The Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research last month found that 81 percent of African-Americans believe he has made things worse for people of color while just 4 percent say he has made them better.
The president pointed to the record-low unemployment and poverty rate among African-Americans, his support for opportunity zones to promote development of impoverished areas, his financing for historically black colleges and university and the passage of the First Step Act expanding job training and early-release programs and modifying sentencing laws for nonviolent drug offenders.
"We're undoing the damage inflicted by decades of corrupt Democrat rule," Mr. Trump said.
He was correct in saying that African-American unemployment had fallen to a low, but what he did not mention was that the drop began under President Barack Obama. From a high of 16.8 percent in March 2010 as the economy was recovering from the Great Recession, it fell to 7.7 percent in January 2017 when Mr. Obama left office. Since Mr. Trump took office, it has continued to fall to 5.4 percent, meaning that it came down by just over nine percentage points under Mr. Obama and more than two percentage points so far under Mr. Trump.
Likewise, Mr. Trump's boast that African-American poverty is at a record low is true. But again, it is a trend that started under his predecessor. The poverty rate among African-Americans fell from a high of 27.4 percent after the recession to 21.8 percent in 2016, Mr. Obama's last full year in office, according to census data. It has continued to fall under Mr. Trump to 20.7 percent last year.
But there was no guarantee it would continue when Mr. Trump came to office and he has claimed the progress as among his proudest achievements. Seeking a second term, he promised to do more. "I just want to tell you very, very strongly," he said, "the best is yet to come."

Texto completo: Thousands of books were here, there and everywhere as Severna Park resident Maggie Cullman and Pasadena residents Stacey Hilder and Cathy Crowley were in the final stages of organizing them for the American Association of University Women's annual book sale on Oct. 30. The sale is AAUW's major fundraiser supporting scholarships for women.
Used book dealers invited from Baltimore, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Georgia had come and gone.
But there was still much to do prior to a reception for AAUW members, family and friends that evening. A three-day sale to the public would follow from Oct. 31 through Sunday.
Cullman, Hilder and Crowley breathed a sigh of relief as they placed the last of the books on shelves in a section marked "Thrillers". Neatly printed signs marked every section and price lists were posted.
Volunteers' work began the morning of Oct. 25, as used books collected over several months were trucked from donated storage spaces in Jeannie Hahn's Severna Park garage and at Easy Storage in Arnold to a donated Festival at Pasadena storefront.
The scene inside the storefront was hectic as AAUW members scrambled to deal with multiple loads. Movers carried in box after box of books, piling them from floor to ceiling in a back room and on the main floor.
Unpacking and arranging them continued every day from 9 am to 7 pm through October 30 with 37 AAUW volunteers and 11 guest helpers taking turns emptying boxes.
"Guest helpers included husbands, brothers and grandsons - anyone fit for heavy lifting," Crowley said. "When finished, we had a backroom full of empty boxes."
Book accumulation activities for 2019 began in July when AAUW members marched in the Severna Park Independence Day Parade and handed out bookmarks advertising collection days at sites in Annapolis, Arnold and Severna Park. They also personally picked up volumes from community residents wishing to donate their collections.
"These days, we're getting more books and people are buying more books so it takes us a full five days to unpack and organize," Cullman said. "A gentleman donated 7,000 books to us this year."
Deciding where to place books was challenging for volunteers. There were sections marked for children, youth, and teens and for science fiction, history, religion and health. There was a huge section for cookbooks.
A separate room boasting floor-to-ceiling shelving units marked "Thrillers" contained hardbacks from New York Times bestselling mystery writers like Robert B. Parker, Michael Connelly, David Baldacci and John Grisham plus action-adventure writers like Tom Clancey.
In addition, tables of paperback versions overflowed onto the floor.
The 6:30 pm reception was meant as a thank you to members who volunteered and as an invitation for 100 plus AAUW members to shop ahead of the official sale days. Hilder's son David and granddaughter Allison, a fourth-grader at St. Martin's-in-the-Field Episcopal School, arrived early. Both were guest helpers. Cullman's husband David turned up as well and said he enjoyed volunteering.
"I find it fascinating to open one of the boxes," he said. "It's like a person's whole history is exposed through the contents of the box...their interests, their religion, their health."
Price lists revealed that, for adults and teens, hardback books were $2, soft/trade books $1.50 and paperbacks $1. Children's large or hardback books were $1 and small books were 50¢.
So kids like Morgan Kokalis, who came with dad Darren, got lots of books. She had an armload when AAUW member Carolyn Kokalis - her grandmother - arrived with her aunt Debbie McKenzie and handed her an 11th book, "Better Homes & Gardens Cookbook for Children".
Amber Kaltz's son Nathan happily chose a book in the teen section called "Wildlife Preserves". Amber, communications coordinator for St. Martin's-in-the-Field Episcopal Church, helped with the book sale for three years before becoming an AAUW member.
"I eventually joined because I so love the sale and what the organization does with the funds raised," she said.
The day after the sale, Crowley reported a high volume of sales with traffic good all week.
"We moved more books than ever," she said. "Proceeds will fund scholarships for girls and women to Anne Arundel Community College and our Women to Women program for individuals returning to the workplace or opening businesses."
Removal Day on Monday saw BIG (Books for International Goodwill) coming to pick up remaining non-fiction books. The rest were bundled by helpers like member Coleen Kane's husband Tom and trucked to used book buyer Wonder Books in Hagerstown, Maryland.

Texto completo: Headnote 2020 ELECTION
Warren endorsed by Pressley, Black women activist group
Rep. Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts, the only member of the group of progressive first-term congresswomen nicknamed "the squad" who had not yet backed a Democratic presidential candidate, has endorsed Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a longtime ally.
Pressley announced her decision in an email to supporters on Wednesday afternoon and released a corresponding video announcement.
"Elizabeth has made it her life's work to pursue justice for working families and put economic and political power in the hands of people," Pressley said in the statement. "We find ourselves in a fight for the soul of our nation, and I know Elizabeth can win it."
In choosing Warren, Pressley provided her home-state senator with her most high-profile congressional endorsement to this point and avoided ruffling feathers in the closely knit Massachusetts Democratic Party.
She also split from her congressional cohort, as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan all endorsed the race's other ardent progressive, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, last month.
Pressley was elected to Congress last year, after a grassroots, multiracial coalition lifted her to victory over Rep. Michael E. Capuano in Boston's only majority-minority district.
She was the first Black woman elected to Congress from Massachusetts, and her endorsement gives Warren a prominent Black surrogate in a campaign that must gain traction with Black voters in order to overtake former Vice President Joe Biden in the race for the Democratic nomination.
Warren has done significant outreach to Black progressive groups and Democratic leaders over the past year - more than any other white candidate in the race. She earned the endorsement of the group Black Womxn this week.
The group calls Warren a "leader" and "partner" with a proven track record and understanding of structural racism and inequality who is willing to be held accountable.
The group's director, Angela Peoples, said she hopes the endorsement will encourage other Black women to support the Massachusetts senator publicly.
However, recent polls still show her trailing Biden among Black voters by almost 30 points, and she lags in South Carolina, the early primary state where Black voters make up more than 60% of the electorate.
"I have seen Ms. Warren in small church basements and in packed gymnasiums," Pressley said in her video. "And she is consistent. She never loses sight of the people.
"You've all heard about the senator's plans - but here's the thing," she added. "Her plans are about power: who has it, who refuses to let it go and who deserves more of it."
Pressley's endorsement was a must-have for Warren, who has risen sharply in polls and fundraising over the last six months but has lagged in some traditional measures of party support, including endorsements from governors, big-city mayors or fellow senators outside Massachusetts. In recent weeks her campaign has sought to reverse that trend by lining up endorsements from anti-establishment progressive champions popular among the party's left wing.
Rep. Katie Porter of California endorsed Warren over her home-state legislator, Sen. Kamala Harris of California. Mayor Jim Kenney of Philadelphia announced his support for Warren's campaign last month, her first endorsement from a big-city mayor.
Warren also recently rolled out endorsements from two of the country's most progressive district attorneys: Larry Krasner of Philadelphia and Rachael Rollins of Suffolk County in Massachusetts.
Krasner, who supported Sanders in 2016, received some blowback for endorsing Warren over Sanders, who remains in striking distance in most polls.
"I have not forgotten and no one should forget that Bernie Sanders, early in his prior campaign for president, said the only reason he ran was that he couldn't persuade his friend Elizabeth Warren to run for president," Krasner said in response. "I heard what he said, and I remembered what he said."
While Ocasio-Cortez, Omar and Tlaib have become household names partly out of their willingness to upset the Democratic establishment, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Pressley has gained a reputation as a cautious Capitol Hill operator.
Pressley, 45, was the first nonwhite woman elected to the Boston City Council in 2009 and had a robust local constituency before being elected to Congress. Unlike newcomers like Ocasio-Cortez, who speaks about how Sanders' presidential run in 2016 helped motivate her to seek elected office, Pressley was a delegate for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election and has close relationships with the party's traditional power brokers. She is also considered a prospective candidate for Warren's Senate seat should Warren win the White House.
Some in Massachusetts have speculated that Pressley could play the role of television surrogate for Warren, serving as a progressive ally who would implicitly counteract perceptions of her campaign as geared toward white elites. Ocasio-Cortez., Omar and Tlaib are helping play a similar role for Sanders, and have held rallies with him in their respective home districts of New York City, Minneapolis and Detroit.
In Massachusetts, where the congressional delegation only comprises Democrats and where a contentious Senate primary is currently underway, Pressley's endorsement speaks to the high-stakes political game of who to back - and when. Pressley was not a part of the initial round of home-state endorsements during Warren's campaign launch earlier this year, leading to speculation that she would sit out the presidential primary or back Harris, the 2020 race's only Black woman.
Instead, Pressley joined Warren's cause, politically cementing the informal friendship that has existed among them for years.
In 2018, when Pressley announced plans to run against Capuano, Warren stayed out of the race - a sign the grassroots campaign Pressley had built was exceeding expectations. Now, it's Pressley playing power broker, as Warren seeks to usurp the establishment herself.

D.C. Memo: I wish you wouldn’t

Autor: Schneider, Gabe. 

Información de publicación: MinnPost.com ; Minneapolis, Minn. [Minneapolis, Minn]. 08 Nov 2019.

Texto completo: Welcome to this week’s edition of the D.C. Memo. This week, a new Minnesota Democratic primary poll, Omar and Sanders take to the arena and Klobuchar qualifies for the December debate. Let’s get on with this.
A new Minnesota primary poll
A new poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Cook Political Report is out. And with it, we get a better sense of how Democratic-leaning voters in Minnesota are feeling.
* Sen. Elizabeth Warren: 25%
* Sen. Amy Klobuchar: 15%
* Joe Biden: 14%
* Sen. Bernie Sanders: 13%
* Pete Buttigieg: 7%
* Andrew Yang: 4%
* No one else above 1%.
The last Minnesota primary poll, conducted by Change Research, had Warren at 21%, Biden at 20%, Sanders at 19% and Klobuchar at 16%. (The margin of error on the Kaiser poll is ± 2%. The margin of error on the Change poll is ± 2.5%.)
Omar-Sanders rally
Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Ilhan Omar held a rally at the University of Minnesota’s Williams Arena this week, following Omar’s endorsement of the senator’s presidential campaign.
“What we are building is a multi-racial, multi-generational, working-class movement,” Sanders said to the crowd. “We are tired of the exploitation of working people of this country.”
Omar praised Sanders: “I am beyond honored and excited for a president who will fight against western imperialism and fight for a just world.”
The Sanders campaign said it would cover all expenses related to the event, which is slated to cost a total of $40,275. This comes after President Trump’s campaign said they would not pay $530,000 for police time and traffic control after his rally in the city.
New Power Generation , Prince’s longtime band, endorsed Sanders and performed at the rally.
On Saturday, Sanders will be talking climate change in Iowa. And not by himself. He will be joined by people like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), co-author of the Green New Deal, and Isra Hirsi , the co-founder of Youth Climate Strike. Hirsi is also Omar’s daughter.
Sanders aims to focus the next 100 days of his campaign in Iowa on the impacts of climate change, and what he intends to do about it if elected President.
The president next door
Klobuchar has qualified for the sixth Democratic debate, having received four polls over 4 percent. Quinipiac’s latest Iowa poll placed her at 5 percent — still well behind Sanders’ 17 percent or Buttigieg’s 19 percent — but enough to qualify and stay afloat.
The debate was supposed to be hosted at the University of California, Los Angeles on Dec. 19th, but the event was pulled due to the three year labor dispute between The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and the University of California.
And something else: In the Atlantic, a story about how Klobuchar would be poised to capture the moderate crowd, if not for Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
In other news
* Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) on Wednesday announced her endorsement of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren for president.
* The trash battle in St. Paul is over. Amid the excitement, the crowd chants “Trash, trash, trash.” In the end, the voters decided: they will keep the coordinated trash services offered by the city.
* “Does the Minnesota Secretary of state get to decide what information about voters is public?” Read more at MinnPost.com
Quote of the week
“During a confirmation hearing for the Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan, Ms. Klobuchar asked Ms. Kagan whether she was on team Jacob or Edward, a reference to the ‘Twilight’ series that was popular with teenage girls at the time. Ms. Klobuchar was simply trying to lighten the mood, but Ms. Kagan looked at her blankly and replied ‘I wish you wouldn’t.’” — The New York Times on Klobuchar’s use of humor.

What I’m reading

The Washington Post Guild: A Study of Pay the Washington Post
The Washington Post’s union found that women as a group are paid less than men, and that, on average, women of color in the newsroom receive $30,000 less than white men. This is following a trend of pay studies at media organizations that are not sanctioned by the outlets, but by their unions. Interesting for many reasons, but worth asking: How can you expect coverage to be reflective of the country if you’re paying certain journalists less?
Karl Evers-Hillstrom for Open Secrets: Maxine Waters’ blue seat isn’t up for grabs. But the lucrative chance to challenge her is
Running as a Republican in a deeply blue district is unlikely to yield an electoral win. But if you can fundraise, it does lead to some nice dinners and hotel stays.
That’s all for this week. Thanks for sticking around. Until next week, feel free to send tips, suggestions, and sound advice to: gschneider@minnpost.com. Follow at @gabemschneider . And don’t forget to become a MinnPost member.

Joe Biden's early state woes

Texto completo: Joe Biden continues to have a clear lead in national polls for the Democratic nomination. But, as we enter the stage at which early state polling starts to matter, he's in real trouble.
Recent polls have put Biden in fourth place in Iowa and third place in New Hampshire. True, he's ahead in Nevada, which is the third contest, and in South Carolina, where his strong support among black voters has given him a commanding lead. A New York Times/Sienna poll also shows him with a lead in some later states — Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. But as we've seen time and again, these primaries do not happen in a vacuum. If he falters in Iowa and New Hampshire, he'll likely see his numbers fall in Nevada and South Carolina, which in turn would hinder his performance in the states that come after that.
To be sure, there's enough of a traffic jam up top right now that it's perfectly conceivable that he can sweep Iowa and New Hampshire and be off to the races. But absent that, what he needs is a decent enough performance in the first two states to still be considered viable by the time the more favorable contests come along.
The next best result to winning the first two races would be an outcome in which Iowa and New Hampshire are won by two different candidates, and he ends up in second place both times. In that scenario, no other candidate would be able to claim clear front-runner status, and while Biden wouldn't have won a race outright, by coming in second, he will have beaten each of the winners one time.
Either way, short of victory, if he can at least ensure there's a jumble coming out of Iowa and New Hampshire, then he may be able to build a bridge from the earlier primaries where he's fading to the later ones where he's in better shape.
Of course, his declines in Iowa and New Hampshire, which receive the most attention early in the race, could be a leading indicator of where other polls are going to go once voters elsewhere have had more time to focus on the candidates.

Joel to be panelist at LI arts-education forum

Texto completo: In his continuing support of arts education, music icon Billy Joel will be a panelist before an audience of local educators Tuesday at the Long Island High School for the Arts in Syosset.
The private event, "An Afternoon with Billy Joel and Guests," will feature the Hicksville-raised Rock and Roll Hall of Famer and Long Island Music Hall of Famer speaking alongside his band's keyboardist, David Rosenthal; musician and visual artist Andy Friedman, class of 1993, a New Yorker cartoonist who also has written for The New York Times, Rolling Stone and other publications; recently retired Paul Taylor Dance Company principal dancer Michael Trusnovec, class of 1992; the American Ballet Theatre's Artistic Coordinator for Educational Outreach, Richard Toda; and Cheri Walsh, executive director of the organization Exploring the Arts, founded by Tony Bennett and his wife, Susan Benedetto.
Moderating is Robert Dillon, District Superintendent of the Nassau Country branch of BOCES, the state's vocation-oriented Board of Cooperative Educational Services, to which the high school belongs.
"We're going to have a conversation with them about arts education and why a school like Long Island High School of the Arts is a viable and important thing to have," said Theresa Schaefer-Bell, a Nassau BOCES spokeswoman. The New York Times in 2002 referred to LIHSA as "a suburban version of New York City's 'Fame' schools," a reference to the 1980 movie about students at what was then Manhattan's High School of Performing Arts.
LIHSA, founded in 1973, has programs in theater, dance, music, special effects, digital media, fine art and film. The panel discussion will be preceded by a video of successful alumni, which have included actress Heather Matarazzo ("The Princess Diaries"), of Oyster Bay.
In January 2016, six-time Grammy Award-winner Joel pledged $1 million from his foundation to help save the then financially troubled school.

Texto completo: Who's out of touch with reality, again?
Will the Democratic presidential nomination go to a centrist or a progressive? Which choice would give the party the best chance in next year's election? Honestly, I have no idea.
One thing I can say, however, is that neither centrism nor progressivism is what it used to be.
There was a time when arguments between centrists and progressives were framed as debates between realism and idealism. These days, however, it often seems as if the centrists, not the progressives, are out of touch with reality. Indeed, sometimes it feels as if centrists are Rip Van Winkles who spent the last 20 years in a cave and missed everything that has happened to America and the world since the 1990s.
You can see this in politics, where Joe Biden has repeatedly declared that Republicans will have an "epiphany" once Donald Trump is gone, and once again become reasonable people Democrats can deal with. Given the G.O.P.'s scorched-earth politics during the Obama years, that's a bizarre claim.
You can also see it in economics. There are many reasonable criticisms you could offer of Elizabeth Warren's economic proposals. But the one I keep seeing is that Warren would turn America into (cue scary music) Europe, maybe even (cue even scarier music) France. And you have to wonder whether people who say such things have paid any attention to either Europe or America over the past few decades.
Just to be clear, Europe does have big economic problems. But they're not the ones such people seem to imagine.
When people say such things, they seem to have in mind a picture of the U.S.-Europe comparison that did seem to have some validity in the 1990s. In that picture, nations with large social spending and extensive government regulation of markets suffered from "Eurosclerosis," persistent lack of jobs.
Employers, the story went, were reluctant to expand both because of high taxes and because they feared not being able to fire workers once hired. At the same time, workers had little incentive to accept jobs because they could live off generous social programs.
Europe also seemed to be lagging in the adoption of new technology: For a while, the U.S. surged ahead in making use of the internet and information technology in general, leading to arguments that Europe's high taxes and regulation were discouraging innovation.
But all of that was a long time ago. The jobs gap has largely vanished; adults in their prime working years are actually more likely to be employed in Europe, France included, than they are in America.
Any gap in the adoption of information technology has also long since vanished; households in much of Europe are as or more likely to have broadband than their U.S. counterparts, partly because the U.S. failure to limit providers' monopoly power has led to much higher prices for internet access.
It's true that European nations have lower G.D.P. per capita than we do, but that's largely because, unlike most Americans, most Europeans actually have significant vacation time and hence work fewer hours per year. This sounds like a choice about work-life balance, not an economic problem.
And on that most fundamental of indicators, life expectancy, the U.S. has fallen far behind: French residents can expect, on average, to live more than four years longer than Americans. Why? Universal health care and policies that mitigate extreme inequality are the most likely explanations.
Now, I don't want this to sound like praise of all things European. The nations on the euro remain terribly vulnerable to financial crises, because they've adopted a shared currency without a shared banking safety net; only the heroic leadership of Mario Draghi, the former president of the European Central Bank, avoided a catastrophic collapse of the euro in 2012.
Europe also suffers from persistent weakness in demand because key players, Germany in particular, have an obsessive fear of deficits, even when the European economy desperately needs stimulus.
These are big problems, severe enough that I wouldn't be surprised if Europe is the epicenter of the next global crisis. But the problem with Europe is not that its social programs are too generous and its governments too intrusive. If anything, it's almost the opposite: Europe's economy is vulnerable because a combination of political fragmentation and ideological rigidity has left its politicians unwilling to be Keynesian enough.
The point is that centrists who point to Europe as an illustration of the bad things that happen when you're too enthusiastic about pursuing social justice are stuck decades in the past. Modern European experience actually vindicates progressive claims that we can do a lot to make America fairer without destroying incentives. And even Europe's problems make the case for more government intervention, not less.
By all means, let's talk about whether "Medicare for all," wealth taxes and other progressive proposals are actually good ideas. But trying to shoot them down by going on about how terrible things are in France is a sure sign that you have no idea what you're talking about.

The 2020 Met Gala Will Make Celebs Dress Up as the Concept of ‘Time’

Every year, the Metropolitan Museum of Art‘s Costume Institute Gala provides celebrities with an opportunity to adhere (or not adhere) to the prescribed dress theme, and provides civilians with the chance to ogle at the possibilities of fashion attached to a limitless budget. The Met Gala, of course, is always tied to an exhibition that commemorates the institution’s continued existence: this year’s theme nodded to the notion of camp that was first popularized by Susan Sontag. On Thursday, the museum announced that the Costume Institute’s spring 2020 exhibition will “explore how clothes generate temporal associations that conflate past, present and future.” The title of this extravaganza? About Time: Fashion and Duration .
If time as a theme sounds a little vague and open-ended, that’s because it’s supposed to. “Fashion is indelibly connected to time,” Costume Institute curator Andrew Bolton told the New York Times . “It not only reflects and represents the spirit of the times, but it also changes and develops with the times.” Technically speaking, the exhibition will provide a retrospective of more than a century of fashion, beginning in 1870 and ending in the present. It will be structured around the conceptual thinking of the French philosopher Henri Bergson, who conceived of time as a thing that flows and accumulates and is resistant to the process of being fractured.
SEE ALSO: The Strokes’ Fabrizio Moretti Wants You to Invest in Old Master Paintings
In order to illustrate this “counter-chronological” mode of seeing things, garments in the exhibition will be paired with other, complimentary or juxtapositional garments from entirely different time periods. For example, a Comme des Garçons dress from 1997 could find itself paired alongside 19th century bustle ensemble. To cap things off, the Met’s press release states that none other than Virginia Woolf will serve as the “ghost narrator” of the exhibition, which essentially means that her writings will be used to give About Time: Fashion and Duration more context.
Illustrating the cyclical nature of time is a lovely conceptual idea, and it’s also a great deal of fun to imagine how the world’s most famous people will attempt to honor this through their Met Gala outfits. In an ideal world, our elegant superstars of the 21st century would show up in full, Edith Wharton-era regalia; dressed like the opera-going characters who populate novels like The Age of Innocence . However, since nuance is lost on most people, it’s more likely that Katy Perry will show up dressed like a giant clock.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo said pro-lifers 'have no place' in New York — a federal judge agrees

Texto completo: Gov. Andrew Cuomo once said that pro-lifers “have no place” in New York.

On Wednesday, a federal judge moved to make that recommendation a legal reality.

“A federal judge has struck down a Trump administration rule that would have allowed for healthcare workers to refuse to provide or refer to sterilizations, abortions, and medically assisted suicide if doing so violated their faith,” the Washington Examiner’s Kimberly Leonard reports.
She adds that the order, which was handed down Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in New York, “Blocks the rule from going into effect on its scheduled Nov. 22 enforcement date.”

The Department of Health and Human Services' conscience rule, Engelmayer claims in his 147-page order, violated “administrative procedures.” Moreover, the judge adds, HHS ignored public comments.
The conscience rule "represents a classic solution in search of a problem," Engelmayer's order reads.
The HHS conscience rule makes no changes to religious liberty laws already on the books, Leonard explains. Rather, the rule creates an enforcement mechanism by which healthcare professionals can report to the Office for Civil Rights if their employer compels them to “provide, discuss, or refer” abortions. The Conscience and Religious Freedom Division, which was added to HHS in 2018, has been tasked with investigating religious liberty violations. Healthcare organizations found in violation of religious liberty laws stand to lose their federal funding.
Engelmayer objects to the Trump administration’s characterization of the enforcement mechanism as “mere housekeeping,” arguing that the HHS rule would make it difficult for employers to avoid “inefficiencies and dislocations.” Because that is obviously the most important consideration here — not that healthcare workers may be forced to violate their consciences, in violation of federal law.
Take a bow, Gov. Cuomo. You are one step closer to realizing a New York free from all those pesky pro-lifers.

Commentary: Five things Kanye West, as a Christian, knows

Texto completo: Kanye West’s improbable and dramatic turn to traditional Christianity has stunned many of us. It also appears to have cultural legs. His new “Jesus Is King” debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 Chart this week. All 11 songs are among the top 100 in the nation, an astonishing feat for an album that is also ranked on the Christian and gospel charts.
The popular reaction has ranged from deeply skeptical, to genuinely confused, to overwhelmingly enthusiastic. Indeed, Google already has seen a massive rise in “faith-based searches” after the release of “Jesus Is King.” Some are even openly discussing the possibility of it sparking a new “Christian revival.”
Kanye has used this intense public interest, however, to elaborate on some of the themes of his conversion and of the music it has produced.
Like all of us, Kanye is on his own search for truth and meaning. But we have an opportunity to learn from a man who has experienced the searing highs and lows that life has to offer — from international fame and fortune to the death of his beloved mother.
Here are five things we have learned in recent days about what Kayne knows.
Jesus Christ is King of Kings and Lord of Lords
In the final track — titled “Jesus Is Lord” — Kanye simply writes and sings the following:
Every knee shall bow
Every tongue confess
Jesus is Lord
Jesus is Lord
In an age of equivocation, relativism and general desire not to offend others, Kanye is saying what he knows to be objectively true. His monotheistic claims are not the mealy-mouthed banalities of someone doing the equivalent of sharing a favorite lentil soup recipe. They are the powerful proclamations of someone who has been seized by the truth.
Not “a” truth or “my” truth. The Truth.
Accepting the lordship of Jesus has implications. Kanye recently preached a sermon in Atlanta calling for “radical obedience” to Christ. In one of many references to sacred Scripture, his new music exhorts “everything that hath breath praise the Lord.”
About the time Kanye’s conversion was lighting up social media, New York Times columnist Ross Douthat published a piece arguing that the demise of traditional Christianity in the U.S. has been greatly exaggerated. He cited a recent Pew Research Center survey that showed that the losses in Christian affiliation in the U.S. have come from “lukewarm” believers, not core adherents. Kanye’s new music is aimed at the latter.
“Freedom” as promised to us by the world is an addiction or slavery
Nobody has known our consumerist culture’s version of success better than Kanye. It nearly destroyed him, as it has destroyed so many others.
In an interview with James Corden, Kanye noted that God is using his story of triumph over this pain and suffering so those in a similar situation could better relate to his story. He knows from personal experience just how hard it is to reach people caught in our cultural trap: “People who don’t believe are walking dead. They are asleep and this is the awakening.”
He sings, “No more livin’ for the culture, we nobody’s slave.” While admitting that “the devil had my soul, I can’t lie,” he insists that “there is freedom from addiction.”
One addiction he’s discussed is his obsession with pornography. He’s not alone. Russell Brand, Chris Rock and Cameron Diaz are just a few public figures who have been open about how porn has devastated their lives.
In a clear call for resistance to a culture that has harmed so many, Kanye asked those collaborating with him on “Jesus Is King” to refrain from sex outside of marriage. He has witnessed to the fact that a culture that promotes extramarital sex brings slavery, not authentic liberation.
There are deep problems with our disconnected secular (sub)urban lifestyles
Kanye’s music career has had a global impact that has taken him to all corners of the earth. But his recent focus on rebuilding communities from the ground up — instead of top down — couldn’t be more timely.
In an interview with the radio personality and record producer Zane Lowe, Kanye went full Christian localism, a movement that works to counteract globalism by working to better our communities. He noted that our consumerist culture is seemingly designed to make others a great deal of money.
As an alternative, he proposes a living arrangement in which the things that really matter are intentionally put at the ideological — and sometimes literal — center of our lives. The “best form” of “gathering together” is family, says Kanye. We need to “keep our families close.”
The best way to do this? “To think of communities of where the church is at the center of the community, the school, the cafeteria, sustainable gardens and then the homes,” he told Lowe.
Abortion has taken a heavy toll on African American communities
In 2013, Kanye released a song titled “Blood on the Leaves” that some observers took to be clearly in support of abortion, while others thought the opposite.
Kanye has now left that ambiguity behind. In an interview about “Jesus Is King,” he railed against those who are “making us abort our children” as a key part of what African American communities have often had to endure as a social expectation from those in power.
He is in good company. African American leaders like Alveda King (niece of Martin Luther King Jr.), Ryan Bomberger (director of the pro-life Radiance Foundation), Jason Riley (columnist for The Wall Street Journal) and Christina Bennett (National Black Pro-Life Coalition) have used similar language to describe how abortion has hurt African Americans.
Kanye also makes clear, in a time when some people argue that climate change is a reason not to have children, that children are to be welcomed as a gift from God.
When asked by Corden about having more kids, his eyes lit up with excitement in saying that he wanted more than the four he already had. How many more? “Seven,” said Kanye. “The richest thing you can do is have as many children as possible.”
Conversion is only the beginning of our journey, which will be difficult
Kanye, like the rest of us, is not perfect. He is growing into his relationship with Christ and the church and, like the rest of us, he still has a way to go before being perfected by Christ’s redeeming grace. For instance, he recently seemed to say that God had something to do with giving him a large tax refund. Let us hope that Kanye dives into Scripture and tradition in ways that impress upon him the problems with dangerous idols like the prosperity gospel.
If someone like Kanye truly lives the kind of Christian life “Jesus Is King” indicates, it could be a cultural game changer.
It won’t be easy. Those who benefit from our culture’s status quo are already starting to resist this move. Indeed, as actress Patricia Heaton (herself a very public Christian) recently observed, they are “really going to scrutinize everything he does to catch him falling down.”
Let us join Heaton in praying for Kanye. Both for his own good and for the good of a culture that desperately needs to know what he knows.

The labels we use to casually slice up society — boomer, millennial, Gen X, Gen Z — are a nearly useless way of thinking about politics, culture or business in the U.S. The very idea that tens of millions of people across different classes and races and geographies might hold similar views on a range of subjects just because they happened to be born during the same 20-year span of U.S. history — the whole thing sounds a bit too much like astrology, doesn’t it?
In fact, demographers, whose profession came up with these labels, constantly stress the limitations and complications of generational analysis. Generations can be useful for observing broad-scale changes in attitudes over long periods of time, but they break down into clichés and stereotypes when they are used to make specific observations about the world.
Marketers and much of the media tend to be quite careless in how we wield generational labels. We invest these categories with too much meaning, often ascribing to generational ideology what is more likely a product of age, wealth and a variety of other factors. Consider, for instance, the absurd parade of stories about how millennials are “killing” various industries, from golf to wedding rings. They collectively paint young people as being somehow philosophically deficient as consumers rather than simply not very wealthy.
Of course, I would dismiss generations: I’m a Gen Xer, and our whole thing is rejecting labels.
On the other hand, I might be a boomer, because lately I’ve been nursing a crazy conspiracy theory about generational analysis: I think it’s a plot by The Man to keep us from changing the world. Focusing on generational differences distracts the masses from going after more salient differences in society — especially the power held by the wealthy, whatever their age.
All of this explains why I’m not really OK with “ok boomer,” the latest rallying cry in the permanent war between the Young and the Old. As Taylor Lorenz reported in The New York Times last week, “ok boomer” is a meme started by teenagers to shred older people who express a broad range of antiquated ideas about the world. (The grammar snoot in me — and my copy editor — would prefer the meme rendered as “O.K., boomer,” with periods and a comma, but of course that’s not how teenagers write.)
At first glance, the phrase — which, since Lorenz’s report, has been co-opted and repeated into cringing ubiquity by just about every other generation — is the perfect response to your racist grandpa on Facebook and your liberal uncle on Wall Street who is very worried about Medicare for All. It’s knowing, cutting, dismissive and almost impossible to gracefully recover from “ok boomer” and you’re done.
At the risk of sounding like a patronizing Old, I’ll concede that “ok boomer” means well, and I don’t begrudge teenagers their anger. They are certainly right that over several generations and across political ideologies, the holders of political and economic power in the U.S. totally screwed things up for the future. Boomer leaders (and their forebears) underinvested in long-term infrastructure and safety nets and economic and environmental rules. They overindulged in wars and tax cuts and systemic deregulation. They long overlooked racial and gender bias, sexual harassment and just about every other form of systemic discrimination. They brought the country and the world to the sorry place we’re in now.
Yet it’s a mistake to blame all boomers for the sins of the most powerful among them. As a taunt, “ok boomer” overlooks the vast differences within the postwar generation; there are rich boomers and poor boomers, far-left boomers and far-right ones, boomers who are fighting for right and those who are hopelessly stuck in yesteryear. And “ok boomer” lets other generations off the hook, neglecting the facts that millennials keep gaining greater economic and political power and that some of them are starting to act and sound like archetypal boomers.
Teenagers themselves seem to recognize this: “boomer is state of mind,” Lorenz writes of how the young think of the term. On the phone, she pointed to further evidence of the flexibility of “boomer” as a taunt. On Twitter, she notes, Pete Buttigieg, the youngest of the 2020 Democratic candidates, is frequently dismissed as radiating big boomer energy. Even though he’s a millennial, there’s something about his rhetorical style that feels antiquated. And Buttigieg’s boomerishness only underlines the hollowness of the whole idea of generational stereotyping. It suggests a more profitable political path for young people: Instead of canceling an entire generation, why not set your sights on a smaller, more specific group, one that bears more direct complicity in America’s widening dystopia?
Not to go full Chapo Trap House on you, but yes, I’m talking about the wealthy. Instead of “ok boomer,” how about “ok billionaire”?
I’ve been preoccupied with billionaires for much of the year. In February, I argued that we should “abolish” billionaires and wannabe billionaires because they exert outsize control over America’s resources. Insofar as they highlight the unforgivable ways that wealthy people have rigged the political system, billionaires are both a convenient and an appropriate political target of the moment.
On just about any important issue of the day, from climate change to mass incarceration to defeating President Donald Trump, meaningful political change will come about only through cross-generational coordination. It will require concerned people of all ages to band together to alter the status quo. One reason this is difficult in the U.S. is, we’ve been conditioned to think that people who are much older or younger than we are might be completely alien beings: Every millennial is an avocado-eating virtue signaler who won’t listen to opposing views; all boomers are white, affluent, selfish racists who can’t recognize their privilege; and the two sides will never see eye to eye on anything.
But that is plainly false. Last month, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who’s 30, endorsed 78-year-old Bernie Sanders for president — not despite his age, but because Sanders’ “decades of work” on progressive causes was a sign of his fidelity to the movement. In the summer, Ocasio-Cortez met Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate activist who has scolded older people for ignoring the issue. Among other things, the pair discussed how age was simply a mindset. “You can be much older and still part of a youth movement if you refuse to do things just because that’s the way they’ve always been done,” Ocasio-Cortez told Thunberg.
This is the sort of coalition we need to build a better future — not Gen Z fighting boomers, but a coalition of 16-year-olds and 30-year-olds and 78-year-olds joining together to demolish the rich who run the world today. The stakes are too great; we can’t afford to have any generation sit this one out.

Texto completo: El exalcalde de la ciudad de Nueva York, Michael Bloomberg, entre a competir a las primarias demócratas de 2020 en Alabama , según han hecho público varios medios este jueves.
El multimillonario neoyorquino dijo en mayo que descartaba concurrir a las elecciones presidenciales de 2020 pero The New York Times lanzó recientemente que Bloomberg lleva semanas sopesando su posible candidatura. Aunque el diario dejó claro que el exalcalde no ha tomado una decisión final, un vocero suyo le dijo a CNN este jueves que “es de esperar” que el hombre se presente a las primarias de Alabama.
De acuerdo al Times, un equipo de Bloomberg se ha dirigido a Alabama para recoger allí las firmas necesarias para las primarias . Aunque las primarias de Alabama no es una de las primeras, la fecha límite que tiene el candidato para presentarse es, según el diario neoyorquino, este viernes.

How a Lexington teen's song remix turned into an 'OK, Boomer' anthem

Texto completo: Grandparents chastising you for your ripped jeans? OK, boomer. Telling girls they can't play football? OK, boomer. Too hooked on technology? OK, boomer.
The short video clips emerging all the time on the exceedingly popular video app TikTok are always different. But the retorts — and the title of the gritty, bass-heavy song that often accompanies them — are the same: “OK, Boomer."
Those two simple words have become a favored riposte among frustrated and fed-up members of Generation Z. On social media, “OK, boomer" is used as a flippant dig against anyone young people perceive as haughty, close-minded, or unwavering in outdated points of view.
And behind the thousands of videos being created, liked, shared, and watched on TikTok, there is Peter Kuli, the 19-year-old from Lexington who produced a remixed song that's become the flash-in-a-pan anthem for his age group.
“It's been really incredible," said Kuli, a student at Champlain College in Burlington, Vt. “I didn't think I'd be at this moment when I started making music five years ago."
It's unclear where the phrase “OK, boomer" got its official start. But according to Know Your Meme, a sort of Wikipedia for documenting online catchphrases and other viral content, it's existed in nooks and crannies of the Internet for some time. You don't have to be part of the baby boom generation, born between 1946 and 1964, to be on the receiving end of an “OK, boomer" insult. But it doesn't help.
“For me, saying 'OK, boomer' is essentially like a digital middle finger," Kuli said. “The people who have the power are the boomers, basically, who just aren't willing to budge" on certain political and cultural issues.
“OK, Boomer" arrived in song form in July, when Jonathan Williams, a college student from California, shared it to Twitter. It featured biting lyrics accusing older people of being racist and judgemental against kids with tattoos and piercings. The chorus is him shouting “OK, boomer" repeatedly in response.
By October, the song's music files and a capella lyrics were made available so others could make remixes. Kuli, who studies music and graphic design, stepped up to the challenge, and created his own original music that he paired with Williams' lyrics.
“I thought it would just be fun to make a rap song that just sounded really [bad] on purpose," said Kuli, who made the song in 30 minutes on a laptop.
Kuli shared his version to Soundcloud. He also enlisted Distrokid, a music distribution service, to get it on TikTok and other platforms — with Williams' blessing. It didn't take long for his rendition to get shared by others and sprout like an invasive weed, its defiant limbs branching out across the video app.
One TikTok post became two, and two became 10, he said. By the end of the first few days, there were 100 videos using his song. One hundred became 400, which soon became 700, and so on.
“It was just out of my control at that point," Kuli said. “I really didn't expect any of this to happen."
As the term's popularity with a younger generation has bloomed — most notably on TikTok — the emergence of “OK, boomer" as a “rallying cry" for Gen Z, born between 1995 and 2015, was covered by the New York Times and NBC News, furthering its usage by a larger audience and igniting tensions online between age groups.
The spotlight on the phrase as a generational motto has helped further elevate Kuli's musical persona and the song's appearance online. While hard to quantify, a cursory glance of the app Monday showed Kuli's “OK, Boomer" being used in at least 21,000 videos on TikTok, most of which mock older folks for their treatment of Gen-Zers.
“They're definitely tongue-in-cheek and they're definitely not meant to be taken too seriously, entirely," Kuli said.
Videos tagged #OkBoomer on the app have been watched 44.6 million times, though not all use Kuli's song. More appear each day.
Kuli has a manager now. The song is on Apple Music and Spotify, where it's generating modest revenue. Kuli and Williams are splitting the profits, he said. There's even a music video. And on the campus of his small private college, Kuli has earned a reputation as the kid from the New York Times article.
“This girl who was walking on the sidewalk in front of me turned around, and she was like, 'How . . . did this happen to you?"' he said. “Word got out fast. I've just been really grateful for all of it."
But the term's sudden fame will almost certainly spell death for “OK, boomer," entombed alongside phrases like “the bomb dot com" or “all that and a bag of chips."
Adam I. Cooper, an associate teaching professor in the linguistics program at Northeastern University, said in an e-mail to the Globe that “OK, Boomer" is compelling because it stands out from other slang terms for its “direct acknowledgment of this generational power imbalance."
However, he added, slang is inherently an ephemeral phenomenon — and this case may be no different.
“As awareness — if not also usage — of this expression increases over time, across multiple groups, I'd expect its potency to wane," Cooper said. “As for the sentiment underpinning it, this may be longer-lasting, until the Gen-Z community finds themselves in positions of power."
One Twitter user put it like this:
At this point, what becomes of “OK, Boomer" for Kuli is as out of his hands as how the remix spread like it did in the first place. He's just relishing in this viral moment.
“I have gotten a lot out of it and learned a lot from it and I'm seeing how people share music online and seeing how and where internet culture and music cross paths," he said. “All of this — as crazy and surreal as it's been — it's made me a lot more confident in sort of knowing where to go next."

Florida officials call New York Times 'fake'

Texto completo: Regular readers may know I usually avoid writing about Donald Trump.
That's for two simple reasons:
1) I care more about state and local issues, where I think I can make a difference, and,
2) Nobody cares what I think about Donald Trump.
Still, Trumpian politics sometimes bleed into Florida politics, making it harder to ignore.
That's the case in Citrus County, where commissioners recently blocked the library's plans to buy a digital subscription to The New York Times, calling it "fake news."
The library carries printed copies of the Times and a few other papers. But the library's director and advisory board wanted to also provide shared digital access to the most Pulitzer Prize-winning newspaper in America - as many libraries already do. (I'll show you how to access Orange County's free newspaper-subscription service in a moment.)
But Citrus County commissioners said no.
"I agree with President Trump. I don't want the New York Times in this county," Commissioner Scott Carnahan said at last month's meeting. "I don't like 'em. It's fake news. And I'm voting no."
Asked Commissioner Jimmie T. Smith: "Why the heck would we spend money on something like that?"
Maybe, commissioner, because you want people to be informed.
Or maybe you don't.
As it turns out, the Citrus County Library System has a grand total of zero digital newspaper subscriptions for its 70,000 card holders, according to the Citrus County Chronicle.
Commissioners seem fine with that.
And that's the real issue here - a public library system that isn't fulfilling its own stated mission to "promote the pursuit of knowledge and deliver quality education to the community ... "
Before anyone gets worked into a lather, thinking this column is just a love letter to the Times, it's not.
The Times does outstanding journalism, but this is about something more - providing citizens with as much reliable information as possible. It's also about people who are scared of information that might challenge their preexisting opinions.
It may be mind-numbingly comfortable to bathe in the warm waters of bias confirmation. But it's not good for society's soul.
Local leaders shouldn't try to keep the Times out. They should try to bring the Wall Street Journal in. And The Washington Post. And the Citrus County Chronicle. And yeah, The New York Times.
Local information. National information. Analysis from the left and the right.
Print copies alone don't cut it anymore. All publishers know that. Cyber-delivery is the fastest-growing segment of newspapers and libraries alike.
It's about meeting consumers where they are - and also, as Commissioner Brian Coleman briefly acknowledged, serving an older or disabled population that might not be able to trek down to the library every day.
But none of that made a lick of difference to most Citrus County commissioners.
"Some of us support the president of the United States," Commissioner Ronald Kitchen said at a followup meeting this week. "I'm not backing off one inch."
Think about that comment for a moment. This is a man who equates supporting the president with denying his own library chief's request to share information with the people they both serve.
Some Citrus County residents showed up at Tuesday night's meeting to object.
"Access to information is at the heart of the library," one said. "You're elected to serve all of us, whether we're Republicans or Democrats," said another.
A retired school teacher wagged her finger at the board and barked: "This isn't the first time I've told young scalawags to stop talking and do your job!"
But commissioners had already made it clear they didn't want digital newspaper subscriptions infiltrating their library system.
"I don't feel like the county is obligated to subscribe to every major newspaper or every point of view," Commission Chairman Jeff Kinnard had said at the first meeting. "At some point you draw the line."
Apparently, Citrus County draws that line at zero.
The commission is scheduled to revisit this issue in two weeks.
And there's a solution ... if commissioners want it, anyway.
Instead of buying access to one paper (the Times) Citrus County could do what Orange County does - subscribe to distribution services that provide access to hundreds of papers.
They're not as user-friendly as individual subscriptions. Stories are just presented in list form. But in Orange County, anyone with a library card number and PIN can go to www.ocls.info/learning-research/articles-and-databases.
There, they can look for the link to "National Newspapers Core" to access the Wall Street Journal (with its right-leaning editorials), the New York Times (with its left-leaning ones) and several others.
The library spends $2,000 a month to offer that service to everyone in the county.
Why share so much information with so many people?
"We want people to use their library cards to learn, grow and connect to the world around them," said Orange library spokeswoman Erin Sullivan, "so we do our best to offer high-quality resources that offer people a chance to dig deeper and be more informed about current events, viewpoints and issues of local, national and global significance."
That concept seems pretty darn basic.
Especially for a library.

Lawmaker Seeks to Purge 'Opportunity Zones' From Wealthy Areas

Texto completo: Congressional Democrats are calling for investigations and legislative fixes in the wake of reporting by The Times.
Lawmakers are voicing mounting concerns about a federal tax incentive, known as an "opportunity zone," that is supposed to encourage investors to pump money into the nation's poorest neighborhoods.
Leading Democrats in the House and Senate have sent a flurry of letters demanding answers and action by federal agencies after recent New York Times articles detailed how wealthy investors and real estate developers, including those with ties to the Trump administration, are poised to profit on the initiative.
In August, The Times highlighted how tax-advantaged money was beginning to flow to development projects that were underway in affluent neighborhoods even before the opportunity-zone incentive was enacted as part of President Trump's tax cuts at the end of 2017. The initiative enjoyed broad bipartisan support.
An article last month described how the financier Michael Milken, a longtime friend of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's, is among the investors who stand to benefit from the way the Treasury Department is writing the rules governing the tax incentive.
Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, said he was introducing legislation this week that would eliminate hundreds of opportunity zones in relatively wealthy neighborhoods.
Other lawmakers have written letters, citing The Times's reporting, to Mr. Mnuchin and called for investigations by the Treasury Department's inspector general and the Government Accountability Office.
The tax incentive is supposed to help struggling communities by attracting new businesses, housing and other real estate projects. If investors with capital gains -- profits on stocks, real estate or other assets that have increased in value -- invest them in one of nearly 8,800 opportunity zones, they get a discount on their capital gains tax bill, as well as the potential to avoid any future capital gains taxes if the new investment increases in value.
While the incentive has driven money into economically ailing cities including Erie, Pa., and Birmingham, Ala., much of the money has gone to projects that were already planned or being built in rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods in places like Houston, Miami and New Orleans.
Two Democrats and a Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee introduced a bill on Wednesday to require funds that invest in opportunity zones to file annual reports with the Treasury that disclose details of their development projects and any new businesses.
The bill would impose $ 500-a-day penalties for failure to file the report and require the Treasury to make the reports public. The Treasury also would have to release an annual report on job creation and poverty reduction attributable to the tax break.
"It's our job to conduct oversight and ensure the zones work as intended everywhere," said Representative Mike Kelly, Republican of Pennsylvania, a co-sponsor of the bill.
Mr. Wyden's bill would go much further. It would make it harder for developments that were underway before the tax break to qualify for the incentive. It also would disqualify about 200 zones that are adjacent to low-income census tracts but are not themselves poor.
"We're seeing examples that are enormously troubling" among designated zones, Mr. Wyden said in an interview, citing the Times articles. "I am proposing to terminate those zones until we get out in front of this."
A number of industries are already not permitted to benefit from the tax break, including liquor stores, massage parlors and racetracks. Mr. Wyden's bill would expand that prohibition to self-storage facilities and luxury housing, which have been popular destinations for opportunity-zone money.
Some of the loudest calls for changes in the tax incentive are coming from members of the Congressional Black Caucus, who in many cases represent poor urban areas that were supposed to see some of the biggest opportunity-zone investments.
Representatives Emanuel Cleaver II of Missouri and James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, both Democrats, said they were extremely disappointed with how the opportunity-zone initiative was playing out, though they acknowledged that the results might improve over time.
Mr. Cleaver said he had spent many weekends organizing meetings in his district to bring together business leaders and local officials to try to lure opportunity-zone dollars to distressed neighborhoods in Kansas City and Independence, Mo.
"We thought the companies would be beating on our doors, saying, 'Please, please, we want to build this or build that,"' Mr. Cleaver said. "But it just hasn't happened."
Mr. Clyburn said that when a real estate project did come to his district, it was to serve college students, not poor residents.
"The program needs to be tweaked -- or it needs to experience its funeral," said Mr. Clyburn, the third-ranking House Democrat.
Representative Ron Kind, Democrat of Wisconsin, one of the original sponsors of opportunity-zone legislation, said he wanted to at least make sure that the measures forcing greater transparency were passed into law.
"There seems to be unanimity and bipartisan agreement that would be nice to move the reporting requirement bill forward," he said in an interview.
But Mr. Kind said he was troubled by the heavy investment that appeared to be taking place so far in "shovel ready" real estate projects that would most likely have been built even without the tax break.
Lawmakers asked the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, to evaluate the tax break, including how various census tracts were designated as opportunity zones. And at least two House committees are planning to hold oversight hearings into the tax incentive.
On Monday, the top Democrats on the two congressional tax-writing committees, Mr. Wyden and Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, wrote a letter to Mr. Mnuchin asking questions about The Times article on Mr. Milken and Mr. Mnuchin. The congressmen said it was "deeply troubling" that Mr. Milken appeared to receive special treatment.
Mr. Milken, in a five-page letter posted on his website after the article was published, said he had played no role in recommending to any government official that a county in Nevada where he had invested be designated an opportunity zone. He said he had never discussed his investment with Mr. Mnuchin.

Texto completo: To defend against shareholder lawsuits over its handling of sexual harassment, Alphabet, the parent of Google, has hired a law firm and is investigating allegations involving executives.
SEATTLE -- Alphabet's board of directors is investigating allegations of sexual misconduct and inappropriate relationships by current and former executives as part of its legal defense against shareholder lawsuits over its handling of the matters, according to documents viewed by The New York Times.
The internet giant's board formed a Special Litigation Committee of independent directors this year and hired the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore to investigate the allegations made in one such shareholder lawsuit, according to the documents.
In a statement, Alphabet confirmed that its board had formed a committee "to consider claims made by shareholders in various lawsuits relating to past workplace conduct." It did not elaborate further.
The board's actions show how it is continuing to grapple with the fallout from the way it previously handled sexual harassment at Google, which is owned by Alphabet. The shareholder lawsuits followed a New York Times article last year that revealed Alphabet's board had approved a $ 90 million exit package for a star executive, Andy Rubin, even though an investigation into a sexual harassment claim against him was deemed credible. The lawsuits accused the board of enabling the misconduct.
As part of the inquiry, Cravath's lawyers have reached out to women who made accusations against Google executives, according to the documents.
The lawyers are also looking into relationships involving David Drummond, Alphabet's chief legal officer and one of the company's most senior executives, who had an extramarital relationship with a woman who worked for him and recently married another woman from Google's legal department.
CNBC earlier reported the investigation by Alphabet's board.
News of the payouts to Mr. Rubin and other executives accused of wrongdoing, along with the continued employment of male executives who had acted inappropriately with women at Google, touched off outrage across the company and prompted a 20,000-person employee walkout a year ago.
In August, Jennifer Blakely, a former senior contracts manager in Google's legal department, published an essay on Medium about her relationship with Mr. Drummond. She wrote about how she was forced out of her position in the legal department after the birth of their son made it impossible to hide the relationship. Ms. Blakely was part of the Times article.
Ms. Blakely also said that after the two split, Mr. Drummond had affairs with other people at the company. Alphabet has not responded to Ms. Blakely's comments, but Mr. Drummond said at the time that he had never started a relationship with "anyone else who was working at Google or Alphabet."
Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive, said in October 2018 that Google had fired 48 people over a two-year period in response to claims of harassment and that none had received an exit package.
The employee anger over the payouts has also pushed Google's work force to speak out about a wide range of issues, including the company's policies toward contract workers and doing more to fight climate change.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON >> Nancy Pelosi is issuing a pointed message to Democrats running for president in 2020: Those liberal ideas that fire up the party's base are a big loser when it comes to beating President Donald Trump.
Proposals pushed by Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders like Medicare for All and a wealth tax play well in liberal enclaves like her own district in San Francisco but won't sell in the Midwestern states that sent Trump to the White House in 2016, she said.
"What works in San Francisco does not necessarily work in Michigan," Pelosi said at a roundtable of Bloomberg News reporters and editors on Friday. "What works in Michigan works in San Francisco talking about workers' rights and sharing prosperity."
"Remember November," she said. "You must win the Electoral College."
Pelosi was careful not to back any one candidate in the party's contentious presidential contest, but didn't hold back when asked about which ideas should and shouldn't form the party's case to American voters. Or about her fears that candidates like Warren and Sanders are going down the wrong track by courting only fellow progressives  and not the middle-of-the-road voters Democrats need to win back from Trump.
This is familiar ground for Pelosi, who has spent the year tussling with the "Squad," a vanguard of liberal newcomers to the House led by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.
"As a left-wing San Francisco liberal I can say to these people: What are you thinking?" Pelosi said. "You can ask the left they're unhappy with me for not being a socialist."
Her call for caution is backed by the authority she carries as a giant of Democratic politics who rose from the left wing of the party to become the first female speaker of the House and has earned grudging praise from her foes for her skill as a legislator.
She spoke as polls show a significant tightening of the race with Warren edging up on Joe Biden at the top of the field. A New York Times/Siena College survey of Iowa Democrats released Friday showed the top four candidates Warren, Sanders, Biden and Pete Buttigieg all bunched up in a five-point spread at the top of the field.
The speaker's concerns reflect those of many Democratic leaders and donors who believe that left-wing policies will alienate swing voters and lead to defeat.
Warren and Sanders are betting on a different theory that voters who float between parties are less ideological and can be inspired to vote for candidates who represent bold new change in Washington.
Pelosi said Democrats should seek to build on President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act instead of pushing ahead with the more sweeping Medicare for All plan favored by Warren and Sanders that would create a government-run health care system and abolish private insurance.
"Protect the Affordable Care Act I think that's the path to health care for all Americans. Medicare For All has its complications," Pelosi said, adding that "the Affordable Care Act is a better benefit than Medicare."
Warren has been under pressure from Biden and other candidates to demonstrate that her plan wouldn't require tax increases on middle-class Americans.
On Friday, her campaign said it would cost $20.5 trillion and would be funded by raising taxes on large corporations and the wealthy, cracking down on tax evasion, reducing defense spending and putting newly legalized immigrants on the tax rolls. The Biden campaign called that plan "mathematical gymnastics" intended to hide the fact that it would result in higher taxes for the middle class.
Warren swatted back at the criticism, accusing Biden of "running in the wrong presidential primary."
"Democrats are not going to win by repeating Republican talking points," the Massachusetts senator said in Des Moines, Iowa. "So, if Biden doesn't like that, I'm just not sure where he's going."
Pelosi also expressed worries about voters' reactions to the Green New Deal, which Sanders and Warren also support, that calls for radical, rapid reductions in carbon emissions. "There's very strong opposition on the labor side to the Green New Deal because it's like 10 years, no more fossil fuel. Really?" she said.
Pelosi said Democrats must stick with pay-as-you-go rules to avoid adding to the debt, a point of contention with left-leaning figures who want to permit more deficit spending for ambitious liberal priorities.
"We cannot just keep increasing the debt," she said.
Pelosi added that she doesn't understand the race to the left among some candidates, because "Bernie and Elizabeth own the left, right? Is anybody going to out-left them?"
She stopped short of endorsing a tax on wealth, an idea that Warren and Sanders have embraced as a means to reduce income inequality and expand the safety net. The speaker said she wants "bipartisan" tax changes that lower the debt and fix the "dumb" Republican tax cuts of 2017.
She also steered clear of backing a cap on pay for chief executive officers.
The speaker, who recently led the House to formally vote on an impeachment inquiry into Trump, said the most critical question candidates should be answering for voters is why they should be president.
"Show them what's in your heart, your hopes and dreams," she said. "It's not about you. It's about them."

Biden’s staying power&#xa0; is real

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — How can we miss Joe Biden if he won’t go away?
It’s beginning to look as if Democrats don’t want him to go away at all. The betting odds, along with many of my fellow pundits, assess Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., to be the likely nominee. So why, then, does Biden continue to hold a substantial lead in the national polls? And why, at the moment, is that lead growing?
The clear and simple answer has little to do with the Democratic Party’s progressive-vs.-moderate divide, which is more a theoretical chasm than a practical one. Biden’s staying power has everything to do with President Trump — and the imperative that the incumbent be defeated next November.
It now appears overwhelmingly likely that Trump will be impeached by the House and face trial in the Senate. The chance that 20 Republican senators will join with Democrats in voting to remove him from office is not zero — especially if public airing of the evidence against the president weakens his support among the GOP base — but remains, at this point, somewhere between small and minuscule.
We have no way of knowing how an incumbent president marked with the stigma of impeachment would fare in a bid for reelection, since such a thing has never happened before. But we’re likely to find out.
Hypothetical matchup polls taken over the last month show any of the leading Democratic contenders beating Trump in the general election. But almost all of them have Biden beating him by the biggest margin. A Fox News poll released Sunday, for example, showed Biden leading Trump by 12 points, while Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., led him by 8 points and Warren led him by 5.
It follows that the question is how risk-averse Democratic voters will prove to be. As long as Biden looks like the surest bet to beat Trump, he’s going to be hard for any of his rivals to knock off.
A set of New York Times polls of likely voters in battleground states, released Monday, offered more good news for the Biden campaign — and bad news for his nearest competitors. They showed him beating Trump narrowly in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida and Arizona, tying him in Michigan and losing by a whisker in North Carolina. In every one of those states, Biden was seen as faring better than Warren or Sanders. Warren was shown as beating Trump only in Arizona, and either losing to him or tying him in the other state matchups.
Numbers like those may be why Biden continues to lead the Democratic field in the Real Clear Politics national poll average, with 29.1%, followed by Warren with 20.6%, Sanders with 16.6%, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg with 7.1%. At this point, everybody else in the race is basically hanging around, waiting for lightning to strike.
That is not what anyone would call a commanding lead. But it has been remarkably durable, and I see no reason to doubt it reflects the reality of the contest.
It is true that Biden’s fundraising has been anemic compared to that of Sanders and Warren. If money and passion were dispositive, Biden would already be toast. Yet something else — I believe it’s his numbers against Trump’s — keeps him in front.
What, exactly, is going to prompt the Biden collapse that so many knowledgeable observers seem to think is coming? A lousy debate performance? He has survived several of those just fine. Some kind of off-the-wall utterance at a campaign stop? Biden has been a reliable source of flubs and non sequiturs for decades, and his supporters are unbothered.
Here is another way to look at the race. If all of today’s Real Clear Politics poll averages are borne out — they won’t be, but humor me — Biden would lose to Warren in both Iowa and New Hampshire, but then beat her in Nevada and South Carolina. That would set up a showdown on Super Tuesday, March 3, when 14 states hold their primaries, including California, Texas and five Southern states where the African American vote — perhaps Biden’s greatest strength — will be crucial.
The necessity of sending this historically bad president home to Trump Tower — or now, I guess, Mar-a-Lago — so overshadows the Democratic campaign that voters are commitment-shy. A recent poll in Iowa showed that the number of undecided Democrats there increased sharply over the summer. I admit that I don’t know what’s going to happen.
But anybody who hopes to win has to get past Biden. So far, nobody has.

Biden running fourth place in Iowa: Poll

Texto completo: Joe Biden is in fourth place in Iowa, a new poll shows, offering a sobering assessment for the former vice president's candidacy less than 100 days before the nation's first nominating contest.
The Quinnipiac University survey released Wednesday gives Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren 20% support, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg 19%, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders 17%, followed by Biden at 15%.
The poll echoes national surveys showing Warren leading the 2020 Democratic pack, with Biden slipping further down. It's also a boost for Buttigieg, who has mired in the single digits in national polls but is now seeing investment of time and resources in Iowa pay off.
"It’s a race that is up for grabs," Quinnipiac polling analyst Mary Snow said in a statement. "Half of likely Democratic caucus-goers who support a candidate say they may change their minds before February 3rd."
The Quinnipiac survey is the second this month that placed Biden in fourth in Iowa. A New York Times/Siena College poll released on Nov. 1 found Biden with 17%.
In multiple conversations with reporters, Biden's campaign team has repeatedly tempered expectations about his chances in early primary contests such as Iowa and New Hampshire. They see a path to victory in states such as South Carolina with a heavy black population. Despite outlining that strategy, a number of Biden's donors and supporters have expressed concern that early losses could spell the end of his campaign.
With the addition of the latest Quinnipiac's survey, Biden's position in the Iowa caucus has fallen further in the RealClearPolitics average of polls. He now sits six points behind Warren, two points behind Buttigieg, and is in a statistical tie with Sanders for fourth place.
The Quinnipiac poll also found Biden trailing much of the front-runners in support from young voters. Only 6% of Iowa Democrats age 18-49 support him, with 28% supporting Sanders and 24% backing Warren.
In the poll, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota sits at 5%, with Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 4%. Other candidates earned 3% or less.
Quinnipiac surveyed 698 Iowa likely Democratic caucusgoers from Oct. 30 through Nov 5. The margin of error was +/- 4.5 percentage points.

Texto completo: Bill Gates said he remains unsure if he could get Elizabeth Warren to have a conversation with him because of his personal wealth.
In an interview at the New York Times DealBook Conference, Gates explained his criticism of a tax structure that is too liberal and damages the economy.
“I do think if you tax too much, you do risk the capital formation, innovation, ‘U.S. is the desirable place to do innovative companies,’ I do think you risk that,” he said.
Gates acknowledged that he is a “primary beneficiary” of the current tax structure but said he would be concerned if that system changed too much.
“If I had to pay $20 billion, it’s fine. But when you say I should pay $100 billion, then I’m starting to do a little math about what I have left over,” he joked.
He said that he has not spoken to Warren about her proposed wealth tax, but noted that he is not sure she would be willing to speak to him.

“You know, I’m not sure how open-minded she is,” Gates said. “Or that she’d even be willing to sit down with somebody who has large amounts of money.”
He was asked if he would vote for Warren over President Trump but refused to say.
“I’m not gonna, you know, make political declarations,” he said, later adding, “I hope the more professional candidate is an electable candidate.”

EARLY ORGANIZING KEY TO RESTORING DEMOCRACY IN 2020; COMMENTARY

Texto completo: This past weekend, I knocked on strangers' doors in La Crosse, Eau Claire, and Portage to talk about the 2020 elections. And I wasn't alone. Thousands of volunteers knocked on more than 50,000 doors last weekend one year out from the 2020 election. It was a wave of organizing unprecedented in scope this far from an election.
Never have so many done so much, so early. Why do it? Three reasons: because Wisconsin is the pivotal state to defeat Trump; because good organizing takes time; and because, if we're serious about not taking anyone for granted or writing anyone off, we can't just show up a few weeks before the election.
Wisconsin is the state that could decide it all. As data wizard Nate Cohn wrote in the New York Times, "Wisconsin was the tipping-point state in 2016, and it seems to hold that distinction now." All the states where Trump is more popular than he is in Wisconsin don't add up to enough Electoral College votes to win the presidency. Neither do all the states where Trump is less popular than he is in Wisconsin. So, if the Electoral College vote is close, Wisconsin is the most likely state to tip the balance.
Wisconsin was the closest state in the country in the 2004 presidential election. In 2000, the vote was even closer just a 5,708-vote margin. Trump's under-1% margin of victory in 2016 was a return to form.
After the 2016 loss, my predecessor chair at the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, Martha Laning, took a long look at what had worked in organizing for 2008 and 2012 and what hadn't worked in 2016. The lesson: start early, and build from the bottom up.
Since the spring of 2017, our party has been applying that lesson, running a field organizing program year-round that is focused on building neighborhood teams in which volunteers are empowered to organize their own communities. In 2018, the neighborhood team model earned its stripes, mobilizing volunteers to knock on nearly twice as many doors as the 2016 presidential campaign, at half the cost. Those same teams powered our massive One Year to Win canvass this past weekend.
The stakes are simply too high to do anything else. Every issue we care about is on the line in 2020. Meeting people where they are, and taking their concerns seriously, is the essence of democracy. We want to be a Democratic Party that lives up to our name. And if we do, we can help restore and renew democracy itself to our state, and to our country.

Germany's Lufthansa cancels 1,300 flights because of strike

Texto completo: AVIATION
Cabin crew strike grounds Lufthansa flights Lufthansa cancelled about 1,300 flights on Thursday and Friday because of a planned strike by a union representing cabin crew in Germany. The UFO union has called members out on a 48-hour strike as part of a bitter dispute with Germany's biggest airline about pay and the union's legal status. Lufthansa said Wednesday it is putting together a special flight plan and passengers will be able to check their flight's status on its website. It said that it would be able to operate 2,300 of Thursday's 3,000 planned flights and 2,400 of those planned for Friday. Around 180,000 passengers will be affected by cancellations. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
WORKPLACE
Productivity down for first time in four years American workers were less efficient in the July-September quarter, pushing down productivity for the first time since late 2015. The Labor Department said Wednesday that productivity, a measure of economic output for each hour worked, fell 0.3 percent in the third quarter. The drop comes after two quarters of healthy gains. The Trump administration promoted its 2017 corporate tax cut as a policy that would raise productivity by encouraging businesses to invest in more computers, machinery, and other equipment. Productivity did pick up in the first half of this year after growing modestly in 2018, but it now appears to be dropping back to the slow growth that has occurred since the Great Recession ended. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
APPAREL
The queen's new clothes will be adorned with fake fur Buckingham Palace says new outfits designed for Queen Elizabeth II will not use real fur. The palace said Wednesday the decision does not mean the queen will dispose of all the fur outfits she has. The palace statement says "the queen will continue to rewear existing outfits in her wardrobe." The decision pleased animal rights activists, who have sometimes criticized the monarch for the fur pieces in her collection of designer clothes. Claire Bass, director of the Humane Society International/UK, says "we are thrilled Her Majesty has officially gone fur-free." She says the queen's decision will send a positive message that fur is no longer considered fashionable. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
MEDIA
New York Times added 273,000 digital subscribers in quarter Readers continue to shower The New York Times with money. Advertisers, not so much. The publisher added 273,000 online subscribers in the third quarter, for a total of 4 million digital readers, the company reported Wednesday. The number of total subscribers, including print and digital, hit 4.9 million, a high. Advertising was the weak spot, falling 6.7 percent overall, with digital ad revenue dropping 5.4 percent. The decline in print advertising was not unusual, as readers continue to prefer getting their news on screens. The drop in digital ads, however, was more surprising for The Times, an established publisher with a growing base of online readers. The company also revealed for the first time the size of its international readership: 500,000 digital subscribers, mostly from Britain, Canada, and Australia. The company said it was still on a pace to reach its previously stated goal of having 10 million total paying readers by 2025, with “at least 2 million" coming from outside the United States. In December, the company expects to buy back its headquarters building, at 620 Eighth Ave. in Manhattan, for $245 million. — NEW YORK TIMES
PHARMACIES
CVS revenue soars after buying insurer CVS Health revenue surged more than 36 percent in the third quarter, nearly a year after acquiring one of the nation's largest health insurers. The drugstore chain and pharmacy benefit manager also said Wednesday that it filled more prescriptions as net income climbed 10 percent to $1.53 billion in a performance that topped analyst expectations. The Woonsocket, R.I., company runs about 9,900 retail locations and processes over a billion prescriptions annually as a pharmacy benefit manager. Late last November, it added health insurance for more than 22 million people when it completed a roughly $69 billion acquisition of Aetna. That deal helped push revenue to $64.81 billion, while adjusted earnings totaled $1.84 per share in the quarter.
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
Xerox lines up financing in potential bid for HP Xerox Holdings Corp. has come up with financing from Citigroup Inc. as it weighs a potential bid for HP Inc., according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Xerox is considering making a cash-and-stock offer for HP, said the person, who asked to not be identified because the deliberations are private. Xerox chief executive John Visentin would run the combined company under the proposal being discussed, the person said. Xerox sees room for about $2 billion of annual cost savings from combining the two companies, the person said. — BLOOMBERG
TECHNOLOGY
Apple expands privacy website Apple is expanding its website on privacy with more explanations about its commitments, though its policies and practices aren't changing. The new site Wednesday is part of Apple's ongoing push to distinguish itself from data-hungry, advertising-fueled rivals such as Google and Facebook. Apple's privacy website is mostly a users' guide with papers on how to prevent apps and other third-party services from unnecessarily tracking users' location and behaviors. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
FAST FOOD
Papa John's rebounds, with an assist from Shaq Shaquille O'Neal's new ads for Papa John's promise a brighter day at the struggling company. At the very least, it was a brighter third quarter. The Louisville-Based pizza chain said its North American same-store sales grew for the first time in two years in the July-September period. Sales at locations open at least a year — a key metric of a retailer's health — were up 1 percent. Papa John's announced in March that O'Neal would serve as a pitchman. The move was part of a larger effort to repair the damage after the company's founder and namesake, John Schnatter, made racially insensitive remarks. Schnatter resigned as CEO and chairman in 2018. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
ONLINE DATING
Match stock falls after missed forecasts Romance may still be in the air, but on the balance sheet, things are not quite matching up for one of the online dating industry's top sites. Shares for Match Group Inc. plummeted after it gave quarterly forecasts that missed Wall Street estimates, due to mounting legal costs and economic factors that are denting sales growth. The shares slumped the most in a year. The Dallas-based company said fourth-quarter revenue will be $545 million to $555 million. Wall Street was expecting $560 million. In 2018, the company spent about $15 million on legal costs. This year, legal bills have climbed to around $40 million. Match is involved with three high-profile lawsuits. The company is suing rival dating app Bumble over allegedly stealing intellectual property from its star performer, Tinder. At the same time, Tinder's founders are suing Match for allegedly misleading them about the app's valuation. And last month, the Federal Trade Commission sued Match, accusing it of deceiving consumers by using messages from fraudulent accounts to encourage users to sign up for subscriptions. — BLOOMBERG

Texto completo: Fort Myers Beach got a little healthier this summer.
Sarah Strickland and Joshua Golter, who own the Fresh Connection location inside the Lani Kai Island Resort, opened a second shop a few blocks south on Estero Boulevard.
"We call it our closet at the Lani Kai," Strickland said of the shop's original location.
"When we saw this place become available, we jumped on it."
The new Fresh Connection is open year-round (the original Lani Kai location is seasonal), and serves an expanded menu of acai bowls, fresh fruit cups, smoothies, and coffee and tea beverages. The menu also features plant-based snacks and breakfast treats, including whole-wheat waffles, avocado toast, organic bagels, oatmeal and guacamole.
It's one of only a few vegan-friendly options on the beach, which is famous for its grouper sandwiches, conch fritters and other deep-fried delights.
"There's nothing wrong with fried food," Strickland said, "but you've got to have a balance sometimes."
She's seen a steady stream of customers since the location opened, locals and visitors who stop by to check out the shop's plant-based menu.
"The reception has been great," she said.
"A lot of people that come in are just relieved. Fort Myers Beach has that party aspect — we love that, it's fun — but it can be hard when you're drinking and eating crappy food and you have to get up and go to the beach all day."
Customers are drawn in by the promise of something different, such as smoothies made with frozen fruit blended with coconut milk or pineapple juice. The atmosphere of the shop has an easy-going vibe that's perfect for relaxing, socializing — or nursing a spring-break level hangover.
Strickland has puzzles and games for people to play. She keeps a steady playlist of chill music on the stereo, and she has National Geographic playing on the TV instead of news or sports.
"We're trying to create relaxed human interactions," she said.
Originally from Delaware, Strickland vacationed with her mother on Fort Myers Beach as a child. Her mother eventually moved to the beach full-time, and one day she spotted the Lani Kai space available.
Strickland had been living in California, where she discovered a wide range of plant-based food options, including the acai bowl. When she heard about the Lani Kai spot, she hopped on a plane from California to RSW, ready to launch her healthy-food eatery.
"This is my first business," she said, "but my dad raised my brothers and I on a produce stand. I know fruit very, very well."
With Fresh Connection, she works more than 100 hours a week, but she doesn't mind the hard work.
"It takes courage to start your own business," she said. "It would be easier to just get a pay check every week."
The experience has been worth it, she said, especially when it comes to bringing healthier food options to the beach.
"My goal is to make something just as tasty but way more wholesome and sustainable."

Texto completo: Readers condemn the president's action, and two teenage climate activists call on adults to "listen to science before it's too late."
To the Editor:
Re "U.S. Gives Notice of Intent to Quit Paris Agreement" (front page, Nov. 5):
The notice to withdraw from the Paris climate accord formalizes an ill-considered decision made by an American president who has called global warming a hoax and who refuses to accept the risks his policies pose.
Responsible presidential leadership would acknowledge the essential role of the United States in addressing climate change and would recognize that politics has no place in the sound decision-making required to deal with the urgency of this crisis. President Trump, by withdrawing the United States from this historic consensus agreement, is handicapping the efforts of nearly 200 participating countries in pursuit of his reckless policy of departure from decades of participation in beneficial international agreements and alliances.
Hopefully, responsible leadership will soon emerge in this country and renew America's commitment before time runs out.
Roger Hirschberg
Bondville, Vt.
To the Editor:
Re "Erased by Rising Seas by 2050" (news article, Oct. 30):
We are teenage climate activists from Fridays for Future USA, a youth-led, intergenerational climate strike movement, and we need adults to listen to the climate scientists.
Scientists repeatedly warn the public of the threat of climate change. According to the 2018 report from the Intergovernmental Plan on Climate Change, we have only until 2030 -- just over 10 years -- to drastically reduce our carbon emissions to have a 50 percent chance of avoiding runaway climate change.
Now a new report states that more cities will be underwater by 2050 because of climate change than previously thought. These reports, despite being terrifying and worrisome, receive minimal reaction from the general public.
If people aren't awakened by these alarming scientific reports, what will it take for us to realize that we are in the middle of a climate emergency?
We young people are sick of waiting for adults to listen to the facts. We must listen to science before it's too late.

President Trump probably won't grasp the significance of climate change until he has to call a kayak to get to the entrance of Mar-a-Lago.

Texto completo: According to Politico's autopsy of Kamala Harris's bid for the Democratic presidential ticket, Christopher Cadelago reports that the California senator's advisers have held forth hope in her campaign as "a possible consensus fallback" if front-runner Joe Biden begins to crumble.
"If Biden crashes, these people argue, it’s not an ideological moderate like Buttigieg or Klobuchar who stands to inherit his base of senior citizens and black voters (a good majority of them women)," Cadelago writes. "It’s Harris, if she can overcome her jitters and remind Americans what got her here."
If this is the logic Harris's brain trust is employing, she should stand down now and depart this race with dignity. Harris is no one's second choice, or at least, she's not the second choice for the lane where a second choice is needed.
Although Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders's base is as sticky as President Trump's, it's hard to imagine that the majority — perhaps a very large majority — wouldn't easily transfer to Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. The left lane of the primary doesn't need a new alternative. There's reason to believe that the center lane does, but it won't be Harris.
For starters, she's an ex-prosecutor who has repeatedly beclowned herself in attempting to win over the Left. Her entire campaign has read like a poorly interpreted focus group, with her positions twisting wherever the political winds seemed to blow. At various points in her campaign, she has emphatically endorsed and disavowed "Medicare for all," the Green New Deal, decriminalizing illegal immigration, banning private health insurance, and federally forced busing.
And that ignores a career's worth of 180-degree reversals on prostitution, sanctuary cities, marijuana legalization, civil asset forfeiture, and the death penalty.
She's already made herself toxic to the liberal lane of the party, and the polling demonstrates it.
Sanders and Warren are tied for Biden supporters' second choice if he falls, according to Morning Consult's latest polling, but third place after that isn't Harris: It's Pete Buttigieg. And if the South Bend, Indiana, mayor were to fall, his supporters would gravitate to Warren then Biden and then Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. In Iowa, the New York Times found that Buttigieg follows Warren and Sanders with the third-highest support for being likely caucusgoers' first and second choice.
Harris's national RealClearPolitics average has plummeted from the double digits in August to 3.6%. She is now less than a point ahead of Andrew Yang and exactly 1 point ahead of Klobuchar, who has seen a significant bounce in the polls over the past month. If you were going to bet on a backup for Biden, why wouldn't it be Buttigieg, who's built incredible early state ground games and maintained stable support? Or even Klobuchar, a Democrat who won her swing state by more than 20 points just two years after Clinton won it by 1 point?
Biden is old. Sadly, it shows. But if the Democrats' single best hope for defeating Trump does crumble in the polls, it won't be Harris taking his place. She should bow out now and salvage what remains of her credibility for a future run.

Obama's former EPA chief takes the helm of environmental group that's sued the Trump administration nearly 100 times

Texto completo: An environmental group that's sued the Trump administration nearly 100 times announced Tuesday that it has hired Gina McCarthy, who headed the Environmental Protection Agency under President Barack Obama, as its new president and chief executive officer.
In a phone interview Tuesday, McCarthy, who headed the EPA from July 2013 until January 2017, said she was joining the Natural Resources Defense Council to fight for stronger environmental protections and address the challenge of climate change.
"I really didn't want to sit on the sidelines. So the question was where to go," she said, adding that the current administration "is trying to undo not only fundamental protections that have been in place under multiple administrations, but it's undermining the science and the work of scientists to protect the environment and the public."
She added that she's particularly concerned about policies aimed at limiting the kind of scientific studies that can be used in rulemaking and those that change the makeup of scientific advisory boards, as well as plans to relocate agencies outside Washington. "It's not as much about the rollbacks, but it's diminishing the capacity of federal agencies to do their job."
McCarthy, who served as the EPA's air policy chief for four years before becoming administrator, helped craft many of the landmark climate policies that the current administration is unraveling. She also worked on the 2015 Paris climate accord, which the United States formally began withdrawing from Monday.
Since Donald Trump has taken office, the NRDC has emerged as one of the most aggressive groups challenging his administration's work to roll back federal climate rules and bolster policies aimed at promoting energy exploration and other forms of development. It has sued the federal government 96 times on issues such as endangered species, energy efficiency standards for lightbulbs, and more. According to the group, it has won 54 of the 59 cases that have been resolved so far.
McCarthy, a 65 year-old Massachusetts native who was hailed by conservationists but denounced by many energy industry officials during her time in office, has criticized President Trump and his deputies. After leaving the Obama administration, she joined the faculty of Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health as a public health professor.

Library denied New York Times subscription, officials cite 'fake news'
The librarians of Citrus County, Fla., had what seemed like a modest wish: a digital subscription to the New York Times. For about $2,700 annually, they reasoned, they could offer an easy way for their roughly 70,000 patrons to research and catch up on the news.
But when their request came before the Citrus County Commission last month, local officials literally laughed out loud. One commissioner, Scott Carnahan, declared the paper to be "fake news."
"I agree with President Trump," he said. "I will not be voting for this. I don't want the New York Times in this county."
In a move that is now generating intense online backlash, all five members of the commission agreed to reject the library's request. The discussion took place on Oct. 24, the same day when the Trump administration announced plans to cancel federal agencies' subscriptions to the Times and The Washington Post. While there's no apparent connection — the Citrus County meeting began several hours before the Wall Street Journal broke the news of the new edict — the controversy unfolding in central Florida highlights how politicians nationwide are parroting the president's disparaging rhetoric about the media.
While the Citrus County Commission is technically nonpartisan, the area, located amid the swamps and springs north of Tampa, is deeply conservative. At the Oct. 24 meeting, the proposal to budget several thousand dollars for a Times digital subscription was met with immediate disapproval and suspicion.
"Do we really need to subscribe to the New York Times?" Commissioner Ron Kitchen Jr. asked.
The other men seated at the dais chuckled.
"I actually was going say that," Carnahan responded. He had seconded a motion to hear the item only so that they could have a discussion about the Times, he said, volunteering his opinion: "I don't agree with it, I don't like 'em, it's fake news, and I'm voting no."
Suggesting that a lack of resources wasn't the problem, Carnahan said that the library could take the thousands of dollars that an institutional subscription to the Times would cost and ″do something else with it." And community members who really wanted to read the paper could simply sign up for home delivery. "I support Donald Trump," he concluded.
Afterward, two commissioners who hadn't spoken up during the meeting told the Citrus County Chronicle that they worried that agreeing to pay for the Times would lead to requests for subscriptions to more "radical publications."
The Chronicle noted that the four commissioners who agreed to be interviewed said that they did not read the Times.
As the paper also pointed out, the Citrus County library system spends about $3,000 annually on a print subscription to the Times. Two of the county's four branch libraries get the paper only on Sunday, however, and library officials had hoped to broaden its reach. Unsurprisingly, the commission's decision came as a disappointment.
"Someone's personal political view does not have a place in deciding what library resources are available for the entire county," Sandy Price, the chairwoman for the library's advisory board, told the Chronicle. "Libraries have to ensure all points of view are represented."

Writer who accused Trump of sexual assault sues him

Texto completo: A writer and longtime women's advice columnist sued President Trump on Monday, accusing him of defaming her this summer after she claimed he sexually assaulted her two decades ago in an upscale New York City department store.
E. Jean Carroll publicly described the alleged assault for the first time in June, in a published excerpt of a memoir. At that time and in the new lawsuit, she said that after running into the then-real estate developer at Bergdorf Goodman in late 1995 or early 1996, they chatted and shopped together before he attacked her in a dressing room. She said he knocked her head against a wall, pulled down her tights and briefly penetrated her before she pushed him off and ran out.
Trump has denied ever meeting her and has said she was trying to promote her book. The White House did not provide immediate comment after the suit was filed Tuesday morning.
"I am filing this on behalf of every woman who has ever been harassed, assaulted, silenced, or spoken up only to be shamed, fired, ridiculed and belittled," said Carroll, who is seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, in a statement. "No person in this country should be above the law — including the president."
One year before the 2020 election, Trump is grappling with a number of legal challenges, including the impeachment inquiry on Capitol Hill and lawsuits targeting his businesses and finances. Carroll filed her lawsuit in New York State Court, where another defamation suit against Trump has cleared some key hurdles.
In that case, Summer Zervos, a former contestant on Trump's reality TV show, "The Apprentice," says Trump groped her and kissed her without permission in 2007.
Zervos was among more than a dozen women in the weeks before the 2016 election who accused Trump of sexual impropriety, following the disclosure of a videotape in which he boasted about grabbing women's genitals. Trump called the women who accused him of wrongdoing "liars," prompting Zervos's suit.
But another defamation case against Trump did not survive. Adult-film star Stormy Daniels sued the president last year after he suggested she had lied about being threatened to keep quiet about their alleged affair. A federal judge in Los Angeles dismissed the suit last October, ruling that Trump's "rhetorical hyperbole" was ­political and ordering Daniels to pay the president's legal fees.
Carroll's assertion in the lawsuit that Trump "brutally raped her" stands apart from less violent allegations regarding Trump's treatment of women. Under New York law, the ­alleged incident occurred too long ago to try to press criminal charges.

Progressive group to spend $75m on 2020 campaign
A progressive organization is plunging itself into the presidential campaign, unveiling plans to spend $75 million on digital advertising to counter President Trump's early spending advantage in key 2020 battleground states.
The effort, by a nonprofit group called Acronym and an affiliated political action committee, is an outgrowth of growing concern by some Democratic officials that Trump could build an insurmountable edge in those key states through massive early advertising efforts. Trump has spent more than $26 million so far nationally just on Facebook and Google, more than the four top-polling Democrats — Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Pete Buttigieg — have spent in total on those platforms.
“The gun on this general election does not start when we have a nominee; it started months ago," said David Plouffe, who managed Barack Obama's 2008 campaign and was a key adviser to him in 2012, and who recently joined Acronym's board. “If the things that need to happen don't happen in these battleground states between now and May or June, our nominee will never have time to catch up."
Plouffe and Tara McGowan, the founder and chief executive of Acronym, said their digital campaign would kick off immediately with a heavy focus on shaping how the public views Trump and the Democratic Party during the primary season, well before a nominee emerges.
The campaign, which the organization is calling “Four is Enough," will focus initially on key swing states: Arizona, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.

Ex-NAACP leader to run for Cummings's House seat
Former NAACP chief and US lawmaker Kweisi Mfume said Monday that he will run for the Maryland congressional seat most recently held by his friend, the late congressman Elijah E. Cummings.
Considered an elder statesman in Baltimore politics, Mfume, 71, occupied the ­Seventh District seat from 1987 to 1996, when he stepped aside to lead the NAACP. Cummings then ran for the seat and won.
Mfume's up-from-the-streets story is well known in the ­district.
He dropped out of high school, was a teenage father, and turned to crime after his mother, who raised him in poverty, died of cancer in his arms when he was 16.
Inspired by her memory, he says, he returned to school, earning degrees from Morgan State University and later Johns Hopkins University.

Texto completo: She was also nominated for a Tony for her performance in the title role of "Anna Karenina" and was a member of the original cast of "Les Misérables."
Ann Crumb, the actress and singer who starred in Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Aspects of Love" in both London and New York, died on Thursday at her parents' home in Media, Pa., a suburb of Philadelphia. She was 69.
Kevin McAnarney, her publicist, said the cause was ovarian cancer, which was diagnosed in 2015.
Ms. Crumb starred in "Aspects of Love" when it opened in London in 1989. It was said that she was the first American cast in a lead role in an original production of a Lloyd Webber musical. She reprised the role in the Broadway production, which opened the next year.
The musical's story, a three-generational European saga, focused on a French actress, Rose Vibert, and her sexual attraction to her husband, her husband's young nephew and her husband's mistress.
It was Ms Crumb's most visible role, but not her most lauded.
Her most honored Broadway appearance was the title role in a 1992 musical adaptation of Tolstoy's "Anna Karenina." Although Mel Gussow of The New York Times found Ms. Crumb too strident for the character, who throws away her reputation for the sake of a grand passion, Tony Awards insiders disagreed and nominated Ms. Crumb for best lead actress in a musical.
Elizabeth Ann Crumb was born in Charleston, W.Va., on May 25, 1950, the daughter of the composer George Crumb, who would win a Pulitzer Prize for music in 1968, and Elizabeth May (Brown) Crumb, a violinist.
Ann studied violin and hoped for a concert career, but that plan was derailed when, in her teens, she injured her right arm in a fall from a horse. She earned bachelor's and master's degrees in music and theater at the University of Michigan but began a career in clinical medicine instead, doing some acting and singing on the side.
While working as a clinician in Philadelphia, she appeared to have a change of heart and was soon off on the national tour of "El Grande de Coca-Cola," a musical farce about a Mexican cabaret.
Ms. Crumb was about to turn 37 when she made her Broadway debut, in the original cast of "Les Misérables" (1987). She was an ensemble member whose characters were listed in Playbill as Factory Girl/Whore/Other Drinker/Young Prostitute. In 1988 she joined the ensemble of "Chess."
In the London production of "Aspects of Love," an onstage accident on a moving walkway severely damaged her foot. Doctors questioned whether she would walk again. She did, but despite numerous operations and specially designed shoes for the New York run, the injury caused her pain the rest of her life.
After "Anna Karenina," her last Broadway appearance, Ms. Crumb pursued her theater career outside New York. In 1992 she starred with Jonathan Pryce and Elaine Page in a concert performance of "Nine," recording a double CD at the Royal Concert Hall in London. She starred in London in a musical version of the movie "The Goodbye Girl." She headlined a concert tour devoted to the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber. And she starred opposite John Cullum in the 1995 national tour of "Man of La Mancha."
In 2010 she played Norma Desmond, the former silent screen star sinking into madness, in "Sunset Boulevard" at the Arvada Center near Denver; it was one of the first regional productions of that Lloyd Webber show. Back in Philadelphia, Ms. Crumb appeared in the Polly Pen musical "Bed and Sofa" (1999), played Maria Callas in Terrence McNally's "Master Class" (2010) and portrayed the sardonic aunt in Jon Robin Baitz's "Other Desert Cities" (2014).
She is survived by her parents and two brothers, David Crumb, a composer, and Peter Crumb.
An animal activist, Ms. Crumb was a founder of the Rescue Express, a nonprofit organization that transports and helps find foster homes for dogs and cats.
"I've always had a special love for dogs," she said in a 2010 interview. "I think I was a dachshund in a past life."

Texto completo: There are lots of metaphors for mass surveillance. The most common one is failing us.
Seven decades after the publication of George Orwell's "1984," "Big Brother" remains the go-to metaphor for surveillance, big and small. "Fried onion meets 1984," read the header of a Wired article on Outback Steakhouse's surveillance cameras. "China's Cryptocurrency Plan Has a Powerful Partner: Big Brother," a New York Times headline announced last month.
As surveillance technology grows more complex, it outpaces public understanding of the threats it poses. The future of surveillance looks far more expansive and invasive than the Big Brother metaphor can capture. Where we're headed, we're going to need better metaphors -- ones that accurately capture the diffuse, discriminatory and often secretive nature of both government and private surveillance.
When we talk in simple terms about complicated topics, metaphors are tremendously helpful. But they can often carry with them an implicit solution: If something is an "enemy," it must be defeated; if something is "cancer," it must be eradicated; and so on. Precise metaphors can lead to appropriate solutions, while imprecise metaphors can lead us to the wrong course of action (or to apathy).
In "1984," Big Brother never actually appears. Rather, he is the figurehead of a totalitarian political party that tries to break citizens of their free will, partly through warnings of persistent surveillance. "Big Brother is watching you" goes the (sinister) refrain. While chilling, this doesn't quite capture what we're up against today. In Orwell's Oceania, citizens don't also face the threats of privately funded drones, for example, or apps that spy on them, or police lineups containing their driver's license photos. In the real world, we face a panoply of surveillance threats that go beyond even the most frightening coordinated government surveillance. Big Brother captures only a slice.
In terms of usage, "1984" and Big Brother stomp other surveillance metaphors: In 2014, a study from PEN America found that in more than 100 blog posts and articles about surveillance, "1984" was the sole literary metaphor employed.
Little wonder that "1984" had a 7,000 percent swell in popularity on Amazon after revelations of cybersurveillance conducted by the National Security Agency in 2013. Yet even as many Americans visit (or revisit) the text, its ubiquity in media suggests that the metaphor has long since taken on a life of its own. (The reality television show "Big Brother" may have played a role, too.)
When it comes to proposing better metaphors, even heterodox thinkers have to kiss the ring before throwing down their takes.
Shoshana Zuboff, author of "The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power," created "Big Other." The sociologist William G. Staples warned of the proliferation of "Tiny Brothers."
Imagine: "China's Cryptocurrency Plan Has a Powerful Partner: Tiny Brothers." That's sort of alarming.
Others take a wide -- even metaphysical -- view. Benjamin Saltzman, an assistant professor of English at the University of Chicago, thinks that a helpful way to understand contemporary surveillance is to compare it to a medieval conception of an omniscient God.
Both require citizens (whether they have opted in or not) to operate in a society structured around a mysterious, all-seeing force. In the Middle Ages, God could even be brought in as a witness to court cases. Mr. Saltzman wrote in a recent article, "God knew all human secrets, yet God's secrets remained fundamentally unknowable to human beings." That's getting closer to a network of devices that are constantly gathering data and trying to predict human behavior.
"The idea of 'God's eye' is frequently used as a metaphor for surveillance. It speaks of a gaze that is all-seeing and, because it is God's eye, all-powerful," wrote David Lyon, director of the Surveillance Studies Center at Queen's University in Ontario. "For some, this implies fearful if not actually violent undertones, suggesting a God whose primary task is one of moral overseer who invisibly scrutinizes humanity for failure and transgression."
"China's Cryptocurrency Plan Has a Powerful Partner: God's Eye." Yikes.
Other metaphors capture the loss of control over personal information in a surveillance state. Franz Kafka's "The Trial," in which a man is told he's guilty but is never told of what, and plods under endless, uncoordinated bureaucracy, is more useful than Big Brother to describe our big-data reality, said Daniel Solove, a professor at the George Washington University Law School. Mr. Solove does not think that one metaphor is inherently better or worse; he just wants whatever we use to get an accurate diagnosis since, he said, "if you don't depict and understand and capture the problem well, you can't get a good solution to it."
Noah Berlatsky, a journalist, made the argument in The Atlantic that using "Big Brother" is actively misleading the public to think that the weight of the surveillance state falls equally on all citizens, rather than more heavily on vulnerable and marginalized people. He thought Philip K. Dick's "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" presented this truth better than "1984." In the book, androids are more heavily surveilled than people. "The surveillance apparatus and the murderous force of the state are targeted, specifically, towards those defined as different," he wrote.
In their 2013 Slate article "The Eye of Sauron Is the Modern Surveillance State," David Rosen and Aaron Santesso wrote that it's the vulnerabilities of J.R.R. Tolkien's Sauron that make him a good metaphor.
"China's Cryptocurrency Plan Has a Powerful Partner: Sauron." Boom!
Andrew Ridker, the editor of "Privacy Policy: The Anthology of Surveillance Poetics," warned, "If we can't devise a way to talk about what's going on in a new and unnerving fashion, we'll just become completely inured to it." Poets in his volume engage a wide range of metaphors, from more obvious ones like light and windows to God.
What if a proliferation of new, untested metaphors confuses people further? Overselling the intrusive capabilities of a particular technology isn't helpful, either. "Choose the wrong story, and you can overstate the risk," the author Deji Bryce Olukotun wrote in his analysis of the PEN study.
Unless overselling is the point. "Gorgon Stare" is the name of a surveillance drone flown by the Pentagon over battlefields like Afghanistan and Iraq. Designed to track insurgents, it has nine camera sensors that can both monitor entire cities and zoom in on multiple moving targets at once. Its dystopian edge is no accident: Its engineers appear to have been inspired by the 1998 blockbuster movie "Enemy of the State," in which Will Smith's character is persistently (and wrongly) surveilled.
The choice of this nefarious name, plumped up by a sinister Greek mythology reference (the Gorgon turns people that gaze upon it into stone), was no accident, either, said Arthur Holland Michel, a co-director of the Center for the Study of the Drone at Bard College. "Part of the goal of surveillance is to give your adversary the impression that you're constantly watching them," he said.
In the civilian sphere, creators of mass surveillance often take the opposite approach. In Baltimore, when the city started secretly surveilling citizens a few years ago using technology similar to Gorgon Stare, the company providing the technology put a sign on its door reading "Community Support Program."
As surveillance technology reaches dystopian dimensions, the use of apt, specific language and sharper metaphors can better inform the people who live under its gaze. It could even inspire action to rein it in.

Texto completo: NEW YORK -- The Justice Department has sent a letter to the publisher and literary agency of the anonymous government official whose book is scheduled to come out later this month. The letter raises questions over whether any confidentiality agreement has been violated and asked for information that could help reveal the author's identity.
The publisher, Hachette Book Group, responded Monday by saying it would provide no additional information beyond calling the author a "current or former senior official."
The book, "A Warning," is by the official who wrote an essay published last year in The New York Times, alleging that numerous people in the government were resisting the "misguided impulses" of President Donald Trump. News of the Justice Department letter was first reported by CNN.
Stelter
"A Warning" has a release date for Nov. 19. The DOJ letter, dated Monday, is from Assistant Attorney General Joseph H. Hunt and addressed to Hachette general counsel Carol F. Ross and to Keith Urbahn and Matt Latimer of the Washington, D.C.-based Javelin literary agency.
"If the author is, in fact, a current or former 'senior official' in the Trump Administration, publication of the book" might violate "that official's legal obligations under one or more nondisclosure agreements, including nondisclosure agreements that are routinely required with respect to information obtained in the course of one's official responsibilities or as a condition for access to classified information," reads the letter, which Hachette shared with The Associated Press.
"We request that you immediately provide us with your representations that the author did not sign any nondisclosure agreement and that the author did not have access to any classified information in connection with government service. If you cannot make those representations, we ask that you immediately provide either the nondisclosure agreements the author signed or the dates of the author's service and the agencies where the author was employed, so that we may determine the terms of the author's nondisclosure agreements and ensure that they have been followed."
Ross wrote back that the publisher was not "party to any nondisclosure agreements" that would require pre-publication review. Ross added that "Hachette routinely relies on its authors to comply with any contractual obligations they may have" and that it was committed to maintaining the official's anonymity.
"Hachette respectfully declines to provide you with the information your letter seeks," she wrote.
reply
Other recent books have drawn attention from Trump and the DOJ. In September, the U.S. government filed a lawsuit against former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, alleging he violated nondisclosure agreements by publishing the memoir "Permanent Record" without giving the government an opportunity to review it first.
In 2018, a Trump lawyer sent a cease-and-desist letter to the publisher of Michael Wolff's inflammatory account of the Trump White House, "Fire and Fury." The letter was ignored, and the book became a million seller. As of midday Monday, "A Warning" was No. 50 on Amazon.com's best seller list. It briefly topped the list after its announcement last month.

Texto completo: London • Over the centuries, Great Britain spawned the Industrial Revolution and nurtured representative democracy. It ruled the waves and created common law. It nurtured the first anti-slavery movement and stood up to Hitler.
And now Britain has gone nuts.
To paraphrase Churchill, if the nation should last for 1,000 years, people may look back and say: This was their saddest hour. Actually, never mind: Brexit may cause the United Kingdom to fragment, so that the country might not last a decade more, let alone last a millennium.
The U.K. is headed for a new election on Dec. 12, at a time when both its major parties are headed by people who should never be trusted anywhere near Downing Street. What’s more serious is the likelihood that Prime Minister Boris Johnson may eventually manage to drag a wearied Britain out of the European Union.
It’s baffling for friends of Britain to see Johnson leading in the polls as he recklessly pursues a path that is damaging his country economically and risks dismembering it. Those of us sentimental about the U.K. — Shakespeare! Cream tea! The Beatles! The Famous Five! — feel as if we’re watching a dear friend quaff a few pints of bitter and hurtle toward a cliff.
Economists largely agree that Brexit will cause both trade and GDP to suffer. One study estimates that Britain may already be 3% poorer simply because of planning for Brexit. Another puts the long-term decline at 3.5%; a different one estimates a 6% drop in the medium term. As The Economist magazine noted, Johnson’s Brexit plan would be even worse for the U.K. economy than that of his predecessor, Theresa May.
Johnson’s Brexit would leave Northern Ireland more integrated with Ireland than with the rest of Britain. And as religion becomes less important on both sides of the border, pressure for Irish unification will grow. One recent poll found a small majority in Northern Ireland in favor of leaving the U.K. and merging with Ireland — although the brakes may come from an Ireland wary of inheriting the weaker Northern Ireland economy.
“Paradoxically, Mr. Johnson and Brexit may have done more for a United Ireland than the IRA ever did,” Jonathan Powell, who was chief of staff to Prime Minister Tony Blair, wrote in The Financial Times. Powell warned that Johnson’s plan may “mark the end of the union, leaving a Little Englander government ruling a Little England.”
In Scotland as well, a poll shows a plurality now in favor of independence, and there are already calls for a new referendum on independence.
“The best future for Scotland is one as an equal, independent European nation,” said Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland. “That is a choice I’m determined to ensure is given to the people of Scotland.”
Pragmatism may restrain Scots in the end, for Scotland presumably would then be out of the EU and would find itself creating a border with England as well. It’s far from clear that the EU would welcome Scotland back, for fear of encouraging separatists in places like Catalonia.
Even Wales seems fed up. One survey found that 41% of people in Wales would favor separation if they could remain in the EU.
A fractured Great Britain would no longer be great; ultimately, all that would be left might be England. A mighty union that had lasted hundreds of years, running from the Orkneys to Cornwall, from Belfast to Llanfair Pwllgwyngyll, would have been torn asunder by the demagoguery of politicians like Johnson who can’t manage even their personal lives, let alone a nation.
London is a tribute to the great man theory of history, with statues and street names and monuments underscoring how leaders change history. Yes, they do — and if the U.K. fragments and Britain’s economy continues to decline, it will be because of the foolhardy and mendacious campaign by Johnson and his enablers. He would be remembered perhaps as the 21st-century version of Guy Fawkes.
This election reflects sordid calculations all around: Johnson hoping that he can win a majority, the Scottish National Party wanting the balloting over before it is discredited by a sexual assault trial next year involving its former leader. If no party wins a majority, it’s possible that we’ll be back where we started, or that Labour will cobble together a government with the Liberal Democrats and hold another referendum on Brexit. I hope so.
One of my British ancestors was Ralph the Wrecker, a pirate from Hunmanby in Yorkshire who set lights on the coast to fool ships so that they would crash on the rocks. He was finally arrested and sentenced to hang. As he stood on the gallows, the noose ready, a messenger galloped up with a pardon. Otherwise I might not be here.
So I know that the British are capable of a change of heart — and we friends of England are hoping for another so that Britain can remain Great.

Texto completo: Surging presidential candidate and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg criticized Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's $20 trillion plus plan to fund "Medicare for All."
Warren on Friday said she would find a way to fund Medicare for All, a government-run health insurance plan that would eliminate private insurance without raising taxes on the middle class. Warren said her proposal relies on cuts to government spending and steep taxes for the wealthy, among other measures.
How to reform the nation's health care system - and how achievable the reforms are - have emerged as a top issue in the Democratic primary.
Buttigieg told "This Week" anchor George Stephanopoulos on Sunday, "the math is certainly controversial."
"What is just not true is that hers is the only solution," he said of Warren. "This my way or the highway idea, that either you're for kicking everybody off their private plans in four years or you're for business as usual."
He said he's "proposing Medicare for all who want it."
"Not everyone wants to go" off their private plans, Buttigieg said.
He said he does not support kicking Americans off their private plans and said his plan would be funded in 10 years through rolling back corporate tax rate cuts and allowing Medicare to negotiate rates.
Buttigieg said Medicare for All "could very well be the long-run destination, but I think there's got to be some humility in our policy here. Let's put this out there and see if it's really the best plan for everybody."
"If it's the right plan," he continued "then everybody will move to it until it is the single payer. And if it's not the right plan for everybody, then we're going to be really glad we didn't kick some Americans off their private plans."
Buttigieg's poll numbers have been rising nationally and among likely Iowa caucus goers.
Buttigieg overtook former Vice President Joseph Biden in a recent New York Times/Siena College poll, garnering 18% of support behind Sanders, with 19, and Warren, with 22%.
A Washington Post-ABC News poll released Sunday showed Biden in first place in national polling, with 28% support. He was followed by Warren, with 23%, and Sanders, with 17%. Buttigieg, with 9%, was in fourth place, showing a five-point jump since September.
Buttigieg appeared to say on Showtime's "The Circus" that he sees a possibility in which the race could narrow down to just him and Warren - "it's coming down to the two of us."
Buttigieg said, "Not yet, no. Look, there is a - a tremendous amount of energy for a range of candidates who are extremely capable." Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) said in an interview that aired Sunday on CBS' "Face The Nation" that it is "naive for him to think that at this point, that the fate of this election has been determined. Just look at history." 
Harris, who let go of most of her New Hampshire staff last week, said she was "all in" in Iowa. Harris said in an interview Saturday that she had not read the details of Warren's plan, but said, "I'm not taking choice from people."

Texto completo: Kanye West has had it with "cancel culture." He's sick of the woke mobs that take people down for what they deem transgressions. "I've been canceled," the hip-hop artist told a Los Angeles radio station this month. "I've been canceled before they had cancel culture." His sins include sporting a MAGA hat and disparaging Taylor Swift, but also, more seriously, calling slavery a "choice" and chanting misogynistic lyrics.
Kanye isn't excusing his behavior, but he announced that he converted to Christianity and has started hosting gospel-music "Sunday Services." Woke folks see it as a transactional trick. "These performances have helped grant Mr. West a certain grace that . . . has not been afforded to artists who have been maligned for similar sins of a smaller scale," Shamira Ibrahim writes in the New York Times.
Whatever the state of his soul, Kanye has revealed something important: Cancel culture doesn't understand redemption. There's no hope for the canceled but to avoid further cancellation, which requires capitulation to the canceling furies. Witness Laurence Fink, the BlackRock CEO who's in trouble with progressives for the companies he invests in. He's hoping his past acts of social responsibility will cover his sins, but it's not working. Student activist Kyle Kashuv apologized for bigoted remarks he made at 16, but Harvard still pulled his admission offer. When an Iowa security guard stumbled into money and gave it to a children's hospital, a local reporter dug up and published two racist tweets from seven years ago. Canceled.
Some are immune. Bill Clinton is only mildly canceled; Al Franken is toast. Many canceled people have committed wrongs for which it's fair to expect an apology or resignation. But woke culture is bitter. It demands penance but doesn't forgive, encouraging cynicism more than uprightness.
Kanye appears to have adopted a more demanding code of conduct. His pastor says Kanye no longer swears, and he reportedly asked people working for him to abstain from premarital sex. He sings about the value of family and prayer, and in interviews he remarks on the evils of porn.
Paradoxically, this stricter code makes him freer than woke rules would. His newest album, "Jesus Is King," is a joyous tribute to deliverance. Lines include "He saved a wretch like me" and "I know God is the force that picked me up." A gospel choir sings "hallelujah" almost shrilly, like someone so relieved he can only scream. Unlike the woke mob, Christianity understands that everyone sins—but it offers unmerited grace.
Kanye's Christian turn prompts reflection on the way in which we condemn misdeeds. In Dostoevsky's "The Brothers Karamazov," one of the brothers, Dmitri, looks up to God even as he laments his own base sensuality: "When I fall into the abyss, I go straight into it, head down and heels up. . . . And so in that very shame I suddenly begin a hymn," he says.
Kanye is likewise singing a hymn. Music aesthetes can debate the merits of "Jesus Is King," but grace is a sweet sound to those who know they need it.

Texto completo: Mr. Flannery took over as chief executive in 1980, when the company was in its "darkest hour." He then fended off a hostile takeover bid by Carl Icahn.
Joseph P. Flannery, a corporate executive who saved the rubber company Uniroyal from financial collapse and later thwarted a hostile takeover bid, died on Oct. 20 at his home in Wellesley, Mass. He was 87.
The cause was kidney disease and lymphoma, his daughter Mary Flannery said.
Mr. Flannery took over as chief executive of Uniroyal in February 1980, when the company, based in Middlebury, Conn., was in financial distress. It had lost $ 119.7 million the previous year after a strike by rubber workers shut down 12 plants for 40 days.
"It was this company's darkest hour," Mr. Flannery said later. "I said to myself, 'This company must not collapse!"'
He was true to his word. Within 18 months, he had turned the company around, closing factories and selling off its tire business in Europe and Australia to focus on the domestic market. Some on Wall Street declared the company's revival a "miracle."
"He always said that people need to make tough decisions," Mary Flannery said. "He was somebody who wasn't going to hem and haw and think he could kick the can down the road."
But there were more difficulties to come. The climax of Mr. Flannery's tenure arrived in April 1985, when Carl Icahn, the Wall Street raider, made a bid for a hostile takeover, proclaiming in newspaper advertisements that he intended to buy more than half the company's 33.9 million shares.
"I feel challenged," Mr. Flannery said in an interview then with The New York Times. But over the next few months he managed to fend off the bid. In September 1985, stockholders approved a leveraged buyout by a group of the company's managers and the New York investment firm Clayton & Dubilier.
It was a relief. But also a disappointment. "He did not anticipate in any way having his company taken away from him," Ms. Flannery said. "And because of Icahn's attempt, he was sort of forced to set that ball in motion."
Joseph Patrick Flannery Jr. was born on March 20, 1932, in Lowell, Mass. (He did not use the suffix Jr.) His father, who died when his son was 4, was a printer; his mother, Mary (Egan) Flannery, was a teacher.
As a child, Joseph liked to spend the summers outdoors, and at 13 he became the youngest Eagle Scout in Lowell, his family said. He went on to receive a bachelor's degree in textile chemistry in 1953 from the Lowell Textile Institute and a master's of business administration from Harvard Business School.
Mr. Flannery joined Uniroyal in 1959 as a research chemist before moving into sales and marketing. Throughout his career he would have dinner with his wife, Margaret Flannery, every night and then keep working until late, his daughter Mary said.
A year after the leveraged buyout, Uniroyal merged with Goodrich to form the Uniroyal-Goodrich Tire Company, which was eventually subsumed by the French tire manufacturer Michelin.
After the buyout, Mr. Flannery served on the boards of Kmart, Amstar and other companies. He became a partner at Clayton & Dubilier, the private equity firm that had helped him wrest control of Uniroyal from Mr. Icahn.
In addition to his daughter Mary, he is survived by his wife; two other daughters, Elizabeth Flannery and Diane Knight; three sons, Joseph, James and David; and 13 grandchildren.

Polarized by White House visits

Texto completo: They say history repeats itself and it's hard to argue when looking at the events that have unfolded in this country over the last week.
The Washington Nationals won the World Series and are scheduled to meet President Trump on Monday. The first time the Washington Nationals went to meet the president was in August 1865 when they-- along with the Brooklyn Atlantics -- met President Andrew Johnson, in what is widely believed to be the first time a sports team was invited to the White House.
Johnson ascended to the highest office following a president from Illinois. Trump, the same. Johnson would go on to become the first United States president to be impeached, avoiding removal by the Senate. Trump, as I'm sure you are well aware, has similar difficulties in the House and a Senate that is unlikely to remove him.

Trippy, right?
The only wrinkle is Johnson, along with fellow impeachment-facing presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, dealt with bipartisan chastisement. In the case of President Trump, not one of the 194 House Republicans who voted on Thursday's resolution to formalize the impeachment investigation voted "yes."
It's a clear snapshot of how the country is perhaps just as divided politically as it was when Johnson became president shortly after the conclusion of the Civil War.
All of which leads to this question: When it's all said and done, will the tradition survive?
Over the course of the 154 years between the Nationals first visit and the pending one, teams would accept White House invitations if for no other reason than out of respect for the office of the presidency.
Yes, we've always had players skip the celebration for a variety of reasons, but for the most part those reasons did not overshadow the occasion. That no longer feels true. Who declines the White House invitation -- and more importantly, why -- have become far more compelling than awkward photo ops.
From Boston Red Sox manager Alex Cora choosing not to attend the celebration because of how the Trump administration handled Hurricane Maria relief to Puerto Rico to U.S. women's soccer star midfielder Megan Rapinoe saying she's "not going to the ... White House" in protest, we are inching closer to the point in which accepting an invite from the president is conflated with accepting the president.
It's an unfortunate but understandable development. Historically sports was one of those aspects in American life in which fans from various walks of life could find common ground, if only for nine innings or four quarters. But now not even the euphoria of winning a championship appears powerful enough to overcome the divisive sludge that is oozing out of our smartphones, televisions and radios.
It's hard to paint Nationals relief pitcher Sean Doolittle as anything other than a decent person. He volunteers to help displaced military veterans, he hosted Thanksgiving dinner for Syrian refugees and he listens to his mom and dad, telling the New York Times, "when I was a kid, I remember my parents would say, 'Baseball is what you do, but that's not who you are' -- like that might be my job, but that's not the end-all, be-all."
When Trump tried to characterize his infamous "grab [women] by the ... " remark as locker room talk, Doolittle took to Twitter to say, "As an athlete, I've been in locker rooms my entire adult life and uh, that's not locker room talk."
Yet despite these and other examples of his humanitarianism, his choosing to not visit the White House in protest of Trump's rhetoric is going to place him in a bad light for a lot of people. They will view his actions as disrespectful, even unpatriotic. Maybe Trump will call him a son of a bitch the way he referred to NFL players who were protesting police corruption.
Again, this isn't the first time an athlete has declined such an invitation in protest. But this is the first time in recent memory that the lines being drawn are authored by the president himself, thus posing a dilemma for his supporters -- are you with me or with them?
And now that this precedent has been set, will we be able to recover?
Regardless of what happens with the impeachment inquiry, the partisan hostility is requiring athletes, teams and universities to think beyond travel logistics with each White House invite. Now they must consider the message being sent.
Once upon a time the message was about respecting the office. Increasingly it has become about the person in the office. Today team's are skipping the visit because they don't like Trump. Tomorrow perhaps teams skip because they don't like the policies or rhetoric of the new guy ... or gal.
Remember there was a time in which the White House Correspondents' Dinner was the hottest ticket in town. Three years of poisonous rhetoric and hostility later, it is barely an afterthought. That is the same trajectory the sports invitation is headed. It is becoming a PR nightmare for the White House and more trouble than what it's worth for teams with vocal athletes -- and that was before the impeachment inquiry.
Face it, Doolittle's absence for political reasons is the new normal and so for a segment of people looking for an escape, they may want to try another route. This, sadly, leads to a dead end.

There's nothing wrong with having 'dual loyalties'

Texto completo: Political scientist on a Ukraine-born White House official
President Trump's supporters were quick to challenge the patriotism of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the alarmed National Security Council official who testified Tuesday about the July phone call between Trump and Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky. Vindman was born in Ukraine, when it was part of the Soviet Union; his family left when he was 3 years old, as Jewish refugees from Soviet persecution. "I don't know about his concern [for] American policy," said CNN commentator Sean P. Duffy. ". . . We all have an affinity to our homeland, where we came from." After the New York Times reported that Ukrainian officials had turned to Vindman for advice on how to deal with Trump's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, Giuliani himself tweeted: "A U.S. gov. employee who has reportedly been advising two gov's? … End of impeachment."
Trump and his supporters often suggest that first- or second-generation Americans - from federal judge Golanzo Curiel, whose parents were Mexican immigrants, to Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), a former refugee from Somalia - are really loyal to their ancestral countries. Supposedly, these people possess "dual loyalty," a charge that historically has most often been lodged against Jews. The slander that Jews prioritize Israeli interests over American ones has come from politicians in both parties this year. Omar herself suggested that American Jews "push for allegiance to a foreign country," and Trump bizarrely complain ed that they demonstrate "great disloyalty" to Israel by not loyally supporting him.
These views are spurious and bigoted, and some Republicans have risen to Vindman's defense. (Omar apologized for her comments; Trump didn't.)
Dual loyalty doesn't have to mean disloyalty. In denying these false accusations, it is easy to concede too much to an overly rigid, nationalist conception of belonging. But people in complex modern societies have loyalties to their religions and identity groups, their families, their cities and states, their parties and political causes, their associations or unions or professions. They balance these all the time. Political membership in a nation-state doesn't - and shouldn't - eliminate subnational, transnational and international attachments of many kinds. These loyalties may require trade-offs, but they rarely come into real conflict.
The perspective that rejects such pluralism maintains that we must prioritize one membership, one attachment, absolutely and unconditionally over all others: We cannot be American and Catholic, British and European, Muslim and French. It casts free-traders and supporters of liberalized migration policies as sinister "globalists" who undermine the countries to which they should be loyal - a supposed ideological dual loyalty that is often used as a dog-whistle for anti-Semitism.
This error rests in part on worries about extreme cases of conflict: When the sacrifice that loyalty calls for is killing or dying in the national defense, which side are you on? But these instances are exceptionally rare. Most of the time, people make complementary choices and sacrifices for their plurality of allegiances.
The notion that disagreement and pluralism are problems, diseases of the body politic, has been dressed up in various ideological languages over the centuries. Some political theorists, like Locke and Rousseau, conceived of politics as resting on a social contract that requires unanimous consent, a pre-political "people" that is so naturally unified that each and every person will endorse the same terms of constitutional founding. Nationalists cling to the idea that each sovereign state naturally shares a homogeneous ethno-cultural community. And recently, we've seen a resurgence of populism, which limits who counts as the real national people and casts political opponents as invaders, elites and parasites.
Eighteenth-century civic-republican thinkers, including many of the American founders, thought political parties contributed to something like dual loyalty; they distinguished the "common good" from the interests of "factions." George Washington's farewell address denouncing parties and partisanship included an attack on "excessive partiality for one foreign nation and excessive dislike of another," such as Democratic-Republicans' tilt toward revolutionary France and the Federalists' toward monarchical Britain. The imagined connection between domestic division and something like treason outlasted that particular dispute.
This skepticism of political differences wasn't exactly the same as 19th-century ethnic and cultural nationalism, but the concepts blended easily enough. We can hear the combination in the Pledge of Allegiance, created in 1892 to teach immigrant children loyalty to both "the [political] republic" and "one [cultural] nation, indivisible." The author of the pledge, Francis Bellamy, was concerned about the ideas of "fanatical" immigrants such as anarchists and about the arrival of members of "races which we cannot assimilate without a lowering of our racial standard" - that is, southern and eastern Europeans.
Political experience quickly taught Americans that Washington was wrong, that democratic government in modern states requires parties. They organize different groups' interests and ideas into competing perspectives on the common good; they make opposition, disagreement and contestation normal parts of a political system. But as the Harvard political theorist Nancy Rosenblum has shown, the founders' anti-party spirit persists in the obsession with independent voters and the perpetual fantasy of an unaffiliated president riding to the rescue (Ross Perot, Michael Bloomberg). And anti-partyism provides an ideological weapon that can be used against the other party: Since our side is obviously in the right, the other side must be a divisive special interest, opposed to the common good - a view Trump has embraced with zeal. Democrats are "bad people," he said at a rally in October , "on a crusade to destroy our democracy."
In addition to parties, a healthy pluralistic democracy draws on its citizens' diverse attachments to religions or causes as sources of different perspectives and knowledge. Socialists and Catholics can disagree with a particular government, not because of "disloyalty," but because they bring distinctive ideas about what the right thing for America is.
This holds true even when the attachments are transnational. An environmentalist, free-trader or human rights activist might criticize her country's actions around the world, arguing, for instance, that the United States is wrong to abandon the Kurds in Syria or withdraw from a pact to slow global warming.
The sympathy and attachment that many Americans have to their ancestors' countries is another source of such perspective. Such attachments don't prioritize some other part of the world over American interests but offer varied insights on what those interests are . They provide knowledge, understanding, moral motivation and reasons for advocacy for a wide range of positions: that the United States should boycott Cuba, defend Taiwan, accept refugees from Venezuela or Honduras - or take seriously the Russian threat to Ukraine. Emigres from tyrannical regimes can bring a particular understanding of those regimes' injustices.
This was commonly understood during the years when Irish Americans pressured politicians with respect to British policy in Northern Ireland, but the same understanding is too often denied to American Jews making the case for the alliance with Israel. Trump's defenders seek to deny it to Vindman as well. While there's no evidence that Vindman cared about anything other than U.S. interests, it's certainly possible that he felt a special commitment to work on Ukrainian affairs because of his past. If so, surely that perspective improved rather than diminished his contributions to the National Security Council. Perhaps it strengthened his willingness to make the hard choice to speak up on behalf of a security relationship Congress had endorsed, in the face of a president trying to undermine it.
Transnational and ideological commitments provide distinctive perspectives on a country's interests and ideals. The monist view attacks them both. This is perhaps most obvious in the ways that suspicion of Jews' transnational sense of cultural community has gone hand in hand with denunciation of the transnational political causes - socialism, liberalism, globalism - Jews are imagined to dominate. Embrace of such causes is often painted as secret, illegitimate, foreign.
The point is not that there's no such thing as a traitor. Confederates turned on the United States from within to defend slavery, and Julius Rosenberg betrayed his country to the Soviet Union. But the extremes of war (civil or international, hot or cold) are not the normal conditions of democratic life. The nationalist always exaggerates how homogenous we are, and how different we are from them outside our borders. Those of us who reject that pernicious image shouldn't accept the terms of debate that it sets. We will be better off when the phrase "dual loyalties" ceases to be an epithet - but instead a simple recognition of the pluralism all of us bring to political life.

Texto completo: Farewell, little dynasty.
That splat you heard was the the Warriors, who dominated the NBA the past five seasons as it went from marginally profitable to immensely wealthy, hitting the pavement like an egg dropped from space.
Of course, it’s still way early to write them off, as TNT’s Charles Barkley did, predicting they wouldn’t even make the playoffs … at halftime of their opener … or, at least it was until Steph Curry broke his hand in the fourth game.
There’s now a common theme in Warriors stories
Will they tank?
Shouldn’t they tank?
Are they tanking?
Isn’t it timely that they lost Curry, removing the temptation to claw into the playoffs so they can tank … as owner Joe Lacob seemed to suggest to The Athletic (“Potentially, there’s a silver lining in all of this, who knows?”)
Not that the Warriors may have a choice with all of last spring’s nine rotation players, and all three of their Big Three, out or gone for the duration: Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston, DeMarcus Cousins and Quinn Cook.
That left Draymond Green, who hurt just his left index finger, and Kevon Looney, who’s out with a pulled hamstring.
Things started off challenging with Las Vegas setting their over-under at 47 wins, No. 6 or 7 in the West.
Then, unfortunately for the Warriors, the season started.
Game 1: In the opening of the new Chase Center, the Clippers beat them by 19 points, after leading by 31.
Thompson, recovering from knee surgery, goes on with TNT at halftime, airs his hopes … and has Barkley inform him to his face they won’t make the playoffs.
As if agreeing, Coach Steve Kerr notes, “This is not a one-off. This is the reality. There are going to be nights like this this year.”
Game 2: Showing Kerr was right, they lose by 28 in Oklahoma City … after trailing by 41 … to the Thunder, a 1-4 team going into this weekend.
Game 3: Win in New Orleans!
Game 4: Lose by 11 in Phoenix … after trailing by 33.
In the very bad, awful, no good, worst possible news, Curry breaks his left hand early in the third quarter with the Warriors down by 29.
Game 5: Back home, lose to Spurs by 17 … after trailing by 25.
They now start Green, D’Angelo Russell, Glenn Robinson, Willie Cauley-Stein and rookie Jordan Poole, looking more like an expansion team than a dynasty.
This isn’t just a fall. This is the end of the pride of the NBA.
The Warriors didn’t invent the modern offense, spacing the floor with three-point shooters. That was Mike D’Antoni in coaching stints at Phoenix, New York and Houston.
Nevertheless, it was Steph, Klay & Co. who took it and ran with it, popularizing an approach that had always been anathema, expressed by the mantra, “Live by the jump shot, die by the jump shot.”
With their unprecedented firepower came a coincidence of personalities that made the Warriors a delight for the press and lured KD as a free agent in 2016: the personable Kerr … the sweet-tempered Curry, everyone’s favorite … the unaffected Thompson … the trash-talking, stand-up guy, Green.
“To me, they speak not just to the modern NBA, but to the unique place that sports can have in society,” said Commissioner Adam Silver before the season.
“And it’s not just the spirit they bring to the game on the floor, but, I think, the spirit they bring as citizens and to their participation in their community.”
The ascent was symbolized by the $1.4 billion Chase Center they built in San Francisco with money they raised privately, leaving the boondocks of the East Bay.
With personal seat licenses estimated at $18,000 each, revenue is projected to zoom from last season’s $400 million that was already ahead of the Lakers’ $398 million, according to Forbes, to $700 million … ahead of every team in every U.S. league except the Dallas Cowboys.
This is a new reality, indeed. The Lakers, long the NBA’s richest team, used to wish there was no salary cap so they could spend whatever they wanted. Now they can thank their lucky stars there is one
(Giannis Antetokuonmpo, anyone? He’s not free until 2021 but the big teams are eyeing him in all they do.)
The Warriors cherished the fact they were all in this together, but it was no longer true.
Things began unraveling last fall when Green argued with Durant, who had spurned an extension to sign for one year, signaling his intention to become a free agent.
“We won without you,” snapped Green, according to Yahoo’s Chris Haaynes. “We don’t need you. Leave.”
Dray and KD made up, insisting it was behind them in countless interviews … until last week when Durant, now in Brooklyn, acknowledged the blowup had been a factor in his decision to leave (“I mean, your teammate talked to you that way, you think about it. … Definitely, for sure. I’m not going to lie about it.”)
Nevertheless, the Warriors clung to their illusions to the bitter end when Durant went down in Game 5 of the Finals.
GM Bob Myers choked back tears in the interview room. Teammates were glum, despite having just won to cut the Raptors’ lead to 3-2.
If KD wanted most of all to be loved, it looked like the outpouring of grief might persuade him to stay.
Instead, he signed with the Nets to play alongside Kyrie Irving, who is already reportedly showing the mood swings in Brooklyn that he had in Cleveland and Boston.
Of course, the Warriors will try to put Humpy Dumpty back together next season, but they’re not the kids they were when they won the first of their three titles in 2015.
Curry, 31, was averaging 20 points and 2.3 threes, compared to his pre-KD zenith of 30 and 5.1 … as Kerr noted they can’t just turn Steph loose, a la James Harden (“That kind of basketball wears you out, especially for a guy who’s 180 pounds like Steph is.”)
With all those shot attempts and points gone, Green, 29, is averaging a pale 9.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, 5.2 assists and 0.0 blocks, compared to his pre-KD zenith of 14-10-7 with 1.4 blocks.
Thompson, 30, may be coming off a missed season.
You can’t say they didn’t enjoy the journey. In 2015 after winning their first title, Lacob told the New York Times, “We’re light years ahead of probably every other team in structure, in planning, in how we’re going to go about things. We’re going to be a handful for the rest of the NBA to deal with for a long time.”
So they were, but “a long time” is over, the Warriors just learned.

Republicans question why Schiff is running impeachment

Texto completo: Under normal circumstances, the House Intelligence Committee would not have jurisdiction over the string of witnesses who have filed into the impeachment proceedings in the Capitol basement, or the subject matter they are talking about.
None of the material is classified, and those who have appeared before the panel are mostly diplomats whose testimony about a July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky would more suitably be scrutinized by the House Foreign Affairs Committee or the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.
Both the Foreign Affairs and Oversight panels have been invited to participate in the closed-door inquiry, but it is Schiff and the Intelligence Committee staff Democrats who run the proceedings and who will write the final report that will determine whether the House votes on articles of impeachment.
Republicans say the mismatch raises questions about how Democrats are proceeding with the impeachment inquiry and why Schiff, and Intelligence, was chosen to run it.
“There is absolutely nothing whatsoever in the whistleblower complaint that has any kind of intelligence component at all,” a top GOP aide told the Washington Examiner. “A presidential phone call with a foreign leader is not an intelligence matter.”
The whistleblower complaint shifted the impeachment proceedings to the control of Schiff and away from the Judiciary Committee and Chairman Jerry Nadler who had declared he was running impeachment proceedings without the blessing of Pelosi.
While the Judiciary Committee has traditionally handled impeachment inquiries and has held those hearings in public, Nadler had run afoul of Pelosi over his handling of the investigation and his decision to hold a series of highly partisan public hearings that were criticized by both parties.
Republicans believe Democratic leaders were looking for a way to transfer control to Schiff, who is more closely aligned with Pelosi and runs a committee that traditionally holds hearings behind closed doors.
Schiff, an outspoken Trump critic, first accused him of colluding with the Russians ahead of the 2016 election and appears determined to impeach the president.
“Soon, the American people will see new evidence of the President's abuse of power,” Schiff tweeted Friday. “Every Member of Congress will have to answer: is soliciting foreign interference in our elections acceptable? The answer must be no. Americans decide American elections.”
The whistleblower complaint prompted Pelosi to give Schiff total control over impeachment proceedings that he has so far conducted mostly out of the public’s view.
“This is a different set of rules that Chairman Schiff and Speaker Pelosi have embarked upon, but why?” Rep. Mark Meadows, a member of the Oversight Committee, said. “Because it wasn't working with Jerry Nadler when everybody go to view it.”
In the coming weeks, Schiff will be tasked with completing a report on the findings from the impeachment investigation, which began in late September after an anonymous whistleblower complained about the Trump-Zelensky call. Details of his report to an inspector general were leaked to the media.
Schiff first told reporters his office had no prior contact with the whistleblower but acknowledged through a spokesman in an Oct. 2 in a New York Times article that “the whistle-blower contacted the committee for guidance on how to report possible wrongdoing within the jurisdiction of the intelligence community.”
Republicans suspect Schiff or his committee staff directed the whistleblower to file his complaint specifically with the inspector general of the Intelligence Community, Michael K. Atkinson.
The move would ensure Schiff maintained jurisdiction over the whistleblower testimony and ultimately the impeachment process, Republicans believe.
Democrats have positioned Schiff to act as a special investigator, akin to former special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigated alleged Trump-Russia campaign collusion, or Independent Counsel Ken Starr, whose investigation of Bill Clinton led to his impeachment.
“I call it faux impeachment,” Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, told the Washington Examiner recently. “By running it in the House Intelligence Committee, they’re trying to keep all of the information from the American public. And I understand why, because every witness we have that comes in bombs out for them."
A spokesman for Schiff has not responded to questions about the role committee Democratic staff played, if any, in funneling the whistleblower complaint to Atkinson.
Schiff has since declared he will not seek testimony from the whistleblower, which Republicans believe is aimed at preventing GOP lawmakers from asking the whistleblower about his coordination with the intelligence panel.
According to the New York Times and other media reports, the whistleblower is a CIA officer who was at one point detailed to work at the White House. While the contents of the call might not fall under the Intelligence Community, the whistleblower’s employment with the agency justified reporting the complaint to Atkinson and ultimately authorizing the oversight of the intelligence panel, Democrats have argued.
Democrats believe Republicans are attacking Schiff’s role because they do not want to talk about the underlying complaint that Trump sought Ukraine’s help investigating his chief political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.
“I don’t think there is any process we could propose that Republicans, who prefer to circle the wagons around the president, would accept,” said Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern.

'So sad!': Beto O'Rourke campaign 'cheer guides' uncovered in Des Moines arena

Texto completo: A reporter disseminated a picture of fliers that gave crowd instructions for Beto O'Rourke supporters at an Iowa conference center.
New York Times politics reporter Katie Glueck noticed the papers abandoned on a table at the Des Moines, Iowa, conference center where O'Rourke had been scheduled to speak before abruptly dropping out of the race Friday. "A stack of these Beto cheer guides were in a box on an abandoned table at the arena here in DSM [Des Moines]," she tweeted. "There were rolls of stickers, too— passersby stopped to grab some. 'So sad! It’s so sad!' one woman said."Tweet
O'Rourke ended his campaign under financial duress, which would likely have meant laying off campaign workers in the near future. The former Texas congressman was never able to duplicate the momentum he gained during a run for Senate in 2018, a race that he narrowly lost to Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in his bid for reelection.
O'Rourke started his campaign on a strong note with more than $6 million raised on the first day, but he was never able to consistently poll above more than 1% or 2%, leaning heavily on proposals for stricter gun control, more liberal abortion laws, and punitive taxes for churches that do not endorse gay marriage.
[Related: Beto O'Rourke says churches should be taxed if they refuse to support gay marriage]
O'Rourke ended his campaign via Twitter on Friday, becoming the latest Democrat in the large pool of candidates to bow out of the race. "Our campaign has always been about seeing clearly, speaking honestly, and acting decisively," he said in a tweet. "In that spirit: I am announcing that my service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee."

Have an extra hour? Try passing through the ‘Daylight Saving Doughnut’

Texto completo: Joshua and Hannah Bowman were driving through northeast Arizona on a cross-country road trip a few years ago, after deciding to move to California from Massachusetts. They had left Four Corners, safely taking U.S. Route 160 as evening rolled in, when something strange started happening on their phones.
“We saw that we were changing time zones fairly quickly,” Bowman said. “The twilight added a little bit to the mystery.”
Without knowing it, they had entered the Daylight Saving Doughnut.
[ Read how daylight savings affects your health ]
It’s that time again — daylight saving time ends at 2 a.m. Sunday, when clocks are turned back one hour. And while most people in the United States get to enjoy an extra hour of sleep, confident their phones will attend to the task of winding back the clock, two states — Arizona and Hawaii — will not “fall back” because they did not “spring forward.”
But what does that have to do with doughnuts?
OK, not all of Arizona holds out on daylight saving. In the northeastern quarter of the state, the Navajo Nation observes the time change in the spring.
But the Hopi Nation, which is encircled by Navajo territory, does not, making it the figurative “doughnut hole.”
The Navajo Nation is semiautonomous, with the power to set its own time system. Since the Navajo reservation extends into neighboring states that recognize daylight saving time — Utah and New Mexico — the nation decided to follow suit to keep the same time throughout its land.
“That means every summer, you have the Hopi Reservation with standard time, surrounded by the Navajo Reservation with daylight time, surrounded by the state of Arizona in standard time,” said David Prerau, a time policy expert and the author of “Seize the Daylight.”
“It is a very interesting, and confusing situation, and they’ve had that for years.”
The time change on Sunday brings everyone to standard time.
Who decided the rules for daylight saving time to begin with?
To understand how we got to where we are, we have to turn back time to the years after World War II, when there was no uniform national system.
At one point, there were 23 different pairs of daylight saving start and end dates in the state of Iowa. There was also a bus route that ran between Moundsville, West Virginia, and Steubenville, Ohio, that saw passengers changing time zones seven times in only a 35-mile stretch.
“Anybody could do what they wanted,” Prerau said. “You had a lot of unusual circumstances.”
But in 1966 Congress established the Uniform Time Act, which standardized daylight saving time across the country. Any state could exempt itself, and Arizona opted out of the law in 1967.
Why did Arizona get rid of it?
If you ask an Arizonan, they’ll probably tell you it’s all about energy conservation.
“It’s not unique to Arizona culturally, it’s more geographic,” said Calvin Schermerhorn, a professor of history at Arizona State University.
Arizona’s most populated areas, around Tucson and Phoenix, are very, very hot in the summer, and an extra hour of daylight to stay outdoors was not an incentive. Rather, the best time to go outside is often after the sun goes down.
“Instead of saving fuel, daylight saving time saw more fuel being spent on air conditioning, because of the extra hour of daylight” at the end of the day, Schermerhorn said.
But even now, there are those who would rather see Arizona follow daylight saving time. Many issues arise while traveling to, from or through the state. Businesses have complained of difficulties coordinating with their national or global branches. Communication is a problem, with many missed calls.
“It puts Arizona out of sync with everybody else,” Prerau said.
Are any other states going to make the change?
Hawaii’s choice against observing daylight saving time causes less disruption than Arizona’s given that it is isolated from other states and near the Equator, where the sunrises and sunsets don’t vary much.
Several overseas territories, including American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands also do not observe daylight saving time.
And many other states are pushing to drop daylight saving time all together. Over the past few years states including Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, Alaska, Texas, Utah and Washington have pushed back against daylight saving time.
But others have fought to permanently stay in daylight saving time. Proposals have been filed in Florida, Idaho, Oregon and New Mexico.
“We’re marching away from that uniformity, which could wreak havoc on all the systems that rely on synchronized time,” Schermerhorn said.
There is support for getting rid of the time changes. Seven in 10 Americans would rather not have to switch their clocks twice a year, according to a poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research released this past week.
What is less clear is whether they want to stay on standard time year round, or daylight time. Four in 10 Americans would like to stay on standard time, the poll found, while about three in 10 prefer full-time daylight time.
Even if everyone was on the same page with daylight saving, there would still be temporal fissures across the nation, with 14 states split by two different time zones. There are even some instances of towns which recognize time zones unofficially, such as Kenton, Oklahoma, in the western edge of the Panhandle. Officially, it’s on Central Time, but the town informally follows Mountain Time to be in sync with New Mexico, which is only 3 miles away.

Texto completo: Following his breakout debate performance, presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg has surged into striking distance of a win in Iowa, putting up his best showing in recent polls in the state with the first nominating contest.
In a New York Times/Siena College poll released Friday morning, the mayor of South Bend is polling at 18%, behind Elizabeth Warren at 22% and Bernie Sanders at 19%. He edged out Joe Biden, who entered the race at the top of the polls in Iowa, but slipped to fourth place at 17%.
The poll has a margin of error of 4.7%, meaning the race remains tight, with the top three in a statistical tie. The remaining candidates are polling at 4% or less.
In some ways it's no surprise. Pundits think Buttigieg is positioned to contend in mostly white Iowa and New Hampshire, but caution his continuing struggle in South Carolina, a state with a larger African American population, might be more noteworthy.
"He's bound to do well in Iowa," said Larry Sabato, a political science professor at the University of Virginia. "He's Midwestern and Iowa is 90 percent white. I'm still very skeptical that he can go on to win the nomination (given his lack of support among African Americans). I just don't see how he does it."
Buttigieg has had a sometimes bumpy relationship with African Americans in South Bend, most recently thrust into the spotlight when a white police officer shot a black man wielding a knife this summer.
It's not his only obstacle. Acceptance of marriage equality and LGBTQ rights among African Americans and Latinos is growing, but isn't as high as among other groups, a potential problem for the first openly gay Democratic candidate for president.
Still, pundits say a win in Iowa would give him more time to win over those voters. And if Biden continues to stumble, many might be looking for a more moderate candidate than Warren and Sanders, a point Buttigieg reinforced again and again at the October debate.
"If he can be successful in Iowa and in New Hampshire that gives him more time and opportunity to really reach out to voters and try to get them on his side," said Laura Merrifield Wilson, assistant professor of political science at the University of Indianapolis.
In fact, the national takeaway from the recent polls has been the continuing collapse of Biden, pundits say, which is leaving the door open for other candidates like Buttigieg.
"Biden is now, I think you can make an argument that he's out in Iowa and New Hampshire," Sabato said. "That ought to be a concern for him, though he has a chance to recover in South Carolina (where he remains popular with African American voters)."
The poll had more good news for Buttigieg, who has been positioning himself as a moderate alternative to the former vice president. The South Bend mayor is the second choice of 31% of caucus goers, behind only Sanders at 34%.
Buttigieg fared somewhat better with older voters than younger voters, according to the poll.
There was some bad news for him, too. Among the top four candidates, voters were the least confident in his chances of defeating President Donald Trump, at 70%. Warren was at 81%, Biden at 80% and Sanders at 76%.
The poll of 439 Iowa Democratic caucus goers was conducted Oct. 25-30.
Buttigieg has been a leader in collecting campaign money, and he appears to be putting it to good use, said Andy Downs, director of the Mike Downs Center for Indiana Politics.
"It's being put to work in Iowa and in New Hampshire and in South Carolina and we'll see if the same sort of thing can happen (elsewhere)," Downs said.
The survey comes just a week after Buttigieg polled at 20% in the latest Iowa State University/Civiqs poll, behind only Warren at 28%.
Sanders was at 18% and Biden at 12% in that poll of 598 likely Democratic caucus attendees surveyed between October 18-22. The margin of error was 5%.
Buttigieg moved up from fourth place in the same poll in September.
There was trouble for the mayor in this poll, too, foreshadowing his issues in more diverse states.
Among non white voters in Iowa, Buttigieg was at fifth place at 9%, behind Biden, Warrem, Sanders and Kamala Harris. The mayor also ranked poorly as a second choice, ranking behind Warren, Sanders and Tulsi Gabbard.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The ascension of Paula White as an official member of Donald Trump's White House highlights how closely the president is relying on his inner circle of evangelical Christian supporters as he fights an impeachment probe during his reelection bid -- while giving liberal evangelicals a new opening to push back at his administration's mingling of religion and policymaking.

White is a televangelist who has sparked division among fellow Christians over her association with the so-called "prosperity gospel," an assertion that God rewards believers with personal as well as financial success. She's also frequently identified as personal minister to the president and is now set to become an adviser heading Trump's Faith and Opportunity Initiative, according to a White House official.

In some ways, White's new position only formalizes her long-standing influence in the White House. The 53-year-old has known Trump for more than 15 years and frequently meets with the president alongside fellow evangelical Christian advisers, including a White House visit this week where the group laid hands on Trump in prayer. But White is a more contentious figure within her faith than other pro-Trump evangelicals and was the subject of a years-long investigation into her finances by Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley.

That profile makes White, who uses her married name White-Cain, a compelling symbol for liberal Christians who are making an increasingly vocal appeal to religious Americans who do not align with Trump's broader political agenda.

"The rise of the religious left has been given a shot in the arm every time Trump doubles down on his white evangelical base," said Guthrie Graves-Fitzsimmons, a religious activist on the left who created an anti-Trump network called The Resistance Prays. "Yes, he may score short term political points. But in the long term, he really is energizing and mobilizing this whole swath of people who are religious and are astonished by what's happening with the Paula Whites of the world."

Jonathan Wilson-Hartgrove, a liberal evangelical preacher who works with the progressive group Red Letter Christians, said White's use of her ministry "to exploit the poor ... should be of real concern to all people of faith."

"While we often frame religion in public life as progressives to conservatives, it's important to say that even within that frame, Paula White is an extremist and always has been," Wilson-Hartgrove said.

The White House role for White, whose ministry did not immediately return an interview request, was first reported by The New York Times. White distanced herself from the prosperity gospel in a 2017 statement that said she would "reject any theology that doesn't affirm or acknowledge the entirety of scriptural teaching about God's presence and blessing in suffering as much as in times of prosperity."

The Florida-based White's website features a pitch for followers to purchase a $130 "Favor Seed" in order to help battle "an enemy of debt, depression, a job, or a health issue prevailing against you."

The White House initiative she will advise was created by the Trump administration last year to help faith-based groups partner with the federal government. White's advisory role, according to the executive order setting up the initiative, empowers her to suggest "changes to policies, programs, and practices that affect the delivery of services by faith-based and community organizations."

Beyond White's new position, Trump's meeting this week with his closest conservative evangelical supporters included some discussion of how they would try to energize their contacts on the president's behalf, according to attendee Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council. Perkins said that while the Tuesday meeting with Trump was not entirely "a planning session," attendees did perform "a quick inventory" of their own networks to determine what "we can do" to help the president.

"Several of us have daily radio programs and some of us have TV programs and some of (us) lead very large churches and ministries," Perkins said. "It was more looking around the room and how do we be more intentional about getting this out there and using the platforms that we already have."

Texto completo: Bloodless revolutions from Armenia to Lebanon are about ending the fatalism corrupt rule engenders.
YEREVAN, Armenia -- It has been 30 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall. A guard threw open a gate, the Soviet imperium folded, more than 100 million people in Central and Eastern Europe were freed, a divided continent was made whole, and the end of history was announced.
What to make of the three decades after Nov. 9, 1989? Poverty receded. Lives got longer. Human exchange became borderless. Artificial intelligence started making things smart. China rose, as did sea levels. The United States, attacked and wounded, tried managed decline, and at last, in wild frustration, elected a loudmouthed con man to its highest office. History, not terminated after all, ushered in a new wave of nationalism, nativism and xenophobia.
Water is the new oil. Data is the new plutonium. Climate is the new Armageddon. The talk in 1990 of the inevitability of a world of liberal democracy turned to predictions of a world of autocrats buttressed by the surveillance states that technology has enabled. It has proved impossible for technology companies to do no evil.
The best of all possible worlds was deferred yet again. Joachim Gauck, the Lutheran pastor and anti-Communist East German activist who later became president of a united Germany, captured the illusions and shattered hopes of 1989 best: "We dreamed of paradise and woke up in North Rhine-Westphalia."
Of course, North Rhine-Westphalia is not bad, but in our polarized all-or-nothing political age not bad is generally not good enough. In the forgotten-words stakes, compromise rivals statesmanship.
Big things changed, and small. My lackluster soccer club, Chelsea, got a Russian oligarch as owner and, with his billions, started winning trophies. I'd never thought the fall of Communism could so directly affect my mood. The Russians arrived -- on the Côte d'Azur, on the beaches of Vietnam and, of course, in Syria. And here in Armenia, the great Armenian saga of tragedy, migration, reinvention and survival took another twist.
The Soviet Union fell apart. The Republic of Armenia became an independent state in 1991. It got a tiny piece of the worst possible real estate Armenia had occupied over the millenniums of its history, but still it was something.
In every office there are images of Mount Ararat, which rises in Turkey, a symbol for Armenians of longing, pride, the hope of return and the suffering of the Armenian genocide that began in 1915 and involved the Ottoman Empire's killing of more than one million Armenians.
The House of Representatives, defying familiar Turkish warnings, this week passed a resolution recognizing that genocide. President Barack Obama never recognized it publicly, despite a promise to do so as a presidential candidate in 2008. Realpolitik won out over his principles.
Turkey, which insists there was no organized campaign to slaughter Armenians, is not Armenia's only problem. Comrade Stalin loved to tinker with nationalities and borders. Decades later, this caused friction between Armenia and Azerbaijan as the Soviet Union collapsed. The disputes culminated in war over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region a quarter-century ago. Today, Armenia's border with Azerbaijan is closed. Its border with Turkey is closed. Only the borders with Georgia and Iran are open.
Yet I found Armenians in upbeat mood! What do physical borders matter these days? The nearly three million citizens of Armenia are in constant touch with the many more millions of Armenians in the diaspora, who are sending money home. With a strong tech sector, Armenia sees itself as a start-up country. It's looking forward more than back.
The country's bloodless revolution in 2018 has not delivered paradise, but it has eliminated fatalism. People feel they have the freedom to try what they want.
Weeks of mass protests against corruption and cronyism brought down the old Armenian political class, much as massive demonstrations in Beirut, Baghdad and Santiago in recent weeks have brought down or shaken the governments of Lebanon, Iraq and Chile.
The spirit of 1989 has not been trampled underfoot by Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping, after all. People prefer agency to the dead hand of unaccountable rule. They prefer the rule of law to arbitrary arrest. That's why they are in the streets of Hong Kong.
Liberal democracy is not, as Putin has insisted, "obsolete." It just needed a jolt.
Armen Sarkissian, the Armenian president, told me in an interview that old systems would not work. "We are living in a quantum world because more than half of life is virtual," he said. The notion of democracies functioning through elections every few years is outdated. He called Armenia "one of the first labs" to find new "rules or behavior" for a world where every individual has a voice that "is exercised and expressed daily."
On the Armenian genocide, and Turkey's denial, Sarkissian said this: "Recognition of something that you have done wrong in ordinary life, in your family, with your friends, recognition is a strength. It's not a weakness. If you take Turkey recognizing the Armenian genocide, that will also be recognition of the fact Turkey is on its way to become a tolerant state."
One enduring lesson of 1989 is that the truth will out. Even the Trump White House will one day discover this.

Texto completo: The economy added 128,000 jobs in October, a figure that would have been higher without the General Motors strike and other factors.
The American jobs engine has been beaten and battered, but it just keeps chugging along.
Employers added 128,000 jobs in October, the Labor Department said Friday, and revisions to prior months' data tacked on another 95,000. The figures for October would have been stronger had it not been for the strike at General Motors, which shaved close to 50,000 workers from the employment rolls, and for the layoff of some 20,000 temporary census workers.
The unemployment rate ticked up to 3.6 percent, still near a half-century low. Stocks rose Friday after the report reassured investors about the health of the economy, with the S&P 500 reaching a record high.
All told, the report and other recent data paint a picture of a job market that is weathering the storm of trade tensions and a cooling global economy. The manufacturing sector is in a slump, business investment is falling, and overall economic growth has slowed this year. But consumers are still spending, employers are still hiring, and fears of an imminent recession, which reached a fever pitch over the summer, have quieted for now.
"It helps reduce the concern that the slowdown was becoming more broad-based and recession risks were right around the corner," said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist for Barclays. "I think most people have a slightly more positive view of the U.S. economy now than even two or three weeks ago."
The report was good news for President Trump, who has made the strength of the economy a selling point in his bid for re-election. He hailed the "blowout JOBS number" in a Twitter post on Friday. October was the 109th consecutive month of job growth, more than double the previous record.
The strong job market is creating opportunities for workers who were left out of earlier stages of the recovery. The unemployment rate for African-Americans hit 5.4 percent in October, a record low, and the labor force participation rate, which measures the share of the population working or actively looking for work, hit a six-year high. Desperate to fill jobs, companies are recruiting stay-at-home parents, retirees and people with disabilities and criminal records.
"One of the beauties of the tight labor market is that people who once wouldn't have been considered get a second chance at jobs," said Diane Swonk, chief economist for the accounting firm Grant Thornton.
[Even with the low unemployment rate, many Americans are having trouble finding work after losing it . | Times readers shared their stories of struggling to find work .]
Until a few weeks ago, Joann Fields was cobbling together a living delivering meals for DoorDash. But last month, Ms. Fields, 50, finished a driver-training course at Austin Area Community College in Texas, and immediately got a job driving a truck for Swift Transportation -- her first regular job in three years.
"I'm excited, I'm really excited," Ms. Fields said. "I'm ready for the road."
The trucking industry has been working to recruit more women in a bid to broaden its hiring pool. Companies in other industries are making similar decisions.
Right at Home, a provider of in-home elder care services, is struggling to keep up with surging demand as the population ages and more people need care. So it is casting a wider net, aiming its recruiting efforts at retirees, nursing students and immigrants. And it is stepping up retention efforts by offering more predictable schedules and opportunities for professional development.
Michael Flair, a vice president at the company, pointed to a recent study that found that annual employee turnover in the industry recently hit 82 percent, up 15 percentage points from a year earlier. He said he often lost workers to e-commerce warehouses, fast-food restaurants and other industries that offer more than the $ 12-an-hour wage that is typical in the home health industry.
"A lot of people say, 'Just pay more money,"' Mr. Flair said. "But you can pretty quickly price yourself out of business and make that care that is already not cheap more of a burden for that family that is struggling to pay for their parent's cost."
Becky Frankiewicz, president of Manpower Group, the staffing firm, said she often heard stories like Mr. Flair's. Companies are willing to eliminate degree and certification requirements, improve perks and benefits and even offer cash bonuses. But they are reluctant to raise base pay.
"It continues to perplex me," she said. "The defining challenge for economic growth is going to be bringing people in from the sidelines, and I absolutely believe that's going to require wage acceleration."
Wage growth has been anemic for much of the recovery, and has stalled again recently. Average hourly earnings were up 3 percent in October from a year earlier, down from a peak of 3.4 percent earlier this year. Wage growth for nonsupervisors has held up better, but is also not seeing the acceleration that would suggest a red-hot job market.
The overall pace of job growth has slowed this year, although the revisions for August and September mean the slowdown was milder than it previously appeared. Employers have added an average of 176,000 jobs per month over the past three months, down from 222,000 over the same period a year ago, a slowdown only partly explained by the G.M. and census effects.
In his Twitter post celebrating the report, Mr. Trump said the economy had added 303,000 jobs, a figure much bigger than the official Labor Department total of 128,000. The Council of Economic Advisers broke down that figure in a blog post later in the day, explaining that it accounted for the revisions (95,000 jobs), the laid-off census workers (20,000 jobs) and the effect of the G.M. strike, which it estimated at 60,000 -- larger than most independent estimates.
For policymakers at the Federal Reserve, the jobs report could be a sign that their bid to shore up the economy and prevent a recession was working. The Fed cut interest rates on Wednesday for the third time this year, but the bank signaled it would probably pause to assess fresh data before cutting again.
Still, Mr. Trump's trade war is taking a toll on manufacturing and other sectors that are exposed to the global economy. Job growth in manufacturing was weak even accounting for the G.M. strike, and separate data from the Institute for Supply Management showed that the sector contracted in October for the second straight month.
MSC Industrial Supply, a distributor of metalworking products, has seen demand slow this year, and last week said it expected sales in the current quarter to fall outright. In a conference call with investors last week, Erik Gershwind, the company's president and chief executive, attributed the decline to the "overhang of uncertainty due to tariffs" and a cooling global economy.
"The weakness in industrial demand is broad-based, with some acute pockets of softness in areas like automotive, heavy truck, oil and gas and agriculture," Mr. Gershwind said.
In response, the company has cut more than 100 jobs, and says it expects to reduce employment further this quarter.
Economists worry that as companies like MSC cut jobs, consumers could grow wary, allowing the weakness in the industrial economy to spill over into the much larger service sector. So far, however, that has not happened. Consumer spending was strong in the third quarter, and measures of consumer confidence, though down from a year ago, remained high.
Hotels and restaurants added more than 50,000 jobs in October, and even the struggling retail sector posted a second straight month of gains after months of steady losses. And revisions to earlier data erased hints that the slowdown was spreading.
"We could accept data that shows weakness in manufacturing," said Michelle Meyer, head of United States economics for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. "Where it becomes a lot more problematic is if that weakness is spreading. We were starting to see indications of that the last few months, but they've now been revised away. It's painting a brighter picture of the service sector of the economy."
That divergence -- between confident consumers and wary businesses -- cannot continue forever. Eventually, either businesses will start to cut jobs, a sure way to erode consumers' confidence, or free-spending shoppers will set executives' minds at ease and encourage them to ramp up production again.
So far, consumers appear to be prevailing.
"As long as confidence remains pretty elevated, as long as job gains continue albeit at a slower pace," said Ben Herzon, an economist for Macroeconomic Advisers by IHS Markit, a forecasting firm. "And as long as those job gains continue to deliver wage growth, consumption should continue to drive the economy."

Texto completo: NEW YORK -- Martin Scorsese's crime epic "The Irishman" landed in theaters Friday, but not nearly enough of them for theater owners.
John Fithian, president and chief executive of National Association of Theater Owners on Friday lamented Netflix's rollout of one of the year's most acclaimed films, from one of cinema's top filmmakers.
"Martin Scorsese deserved better," Fithian said in a statement.
Netflix was unable to come to terms with the largest movie theater chains on "The Irishman." The traditional theatrical window is 90 days, something Netflix has declined to follow.
That has left Netflix films essentially boycotted by the majority of multiplexes. Netflix has instead carved out a roughly three-week exclusive run in independent theaters.
"The point of an exclusive theatrical window is for movies to reach their full commercial potential. Netflix chose to artificially limit 'The Irishman's' theatrical release," Fithian said. "That sends a message to filmmakers who are not Martin Scorsese. If you want a full theatrical release, take your film to their competitors."
Netflix and theater chains, including AMC and Cineplex, negotiated extensively earlier this year on a compromise but ultimately failed to reach agreement.
A Netflix executive who spoke to The New York Times about its "Irishman" strategy said the company cares about box office, but also wants viewers to watch films the way they want.
"The Irishman" is opening this weekend on eight screens in New York and Los Angeles, including Broadway's Belasco Theatre. It begins streaming on Nov. 27.

Texto completo: In the last years of the 19th century, a bicycling craze swept the United States. At that time horses remained the most common means of personal transportation. Automobiles were rare and unaffordable; more a plaything for the rich than a way of getting from one place to the next.
With a chain drive, inflatable tires and equally sized wheels, all technological improvements developed in the 1880s, the bicycle became the first affordable means of conveyance that didn't require feeding or cleaning up after.
"...the bicycle promises a splendid extension of personal power and freedom, scarcely inferior to what wings would give," gushed an 1896 article from the New York Times.
More than a century later, a new bicycling craze is sweeping the nation once again. Electric bicycles have arrived, carrying with them the potential to vastly expand the number of people who choose a bicycle as their primary means of transportation. Riders who have already converted to an e-bike frequently describe their experience in terms no less effusive than those of the New York Times.
"The most fun I ever had on a bike was on my uncle's Turbo DEVO," said Jason Rosales, speaking of one of his first encounters with a high-end electric mountain bike. "It's a blast when you don't have to struggle to go uphill. You're constantly going that fast – get your adrenaline going and your heart pumping the whole time, instead of just trying to get up the hill."
Rosales, who manages the Knicker Biker bike shop in Great Falls, still prefers his traditional mechanical bicycle for his daily commute.
"I like the exercise (of a muscle bike), and an e-bike takes it away," Rosales said.
But he's quick to endorse e-bikes as a perfect alternative for people who want to experience the pleasures of riding without being physically tested on every slope.
"There are older riders, and there are younger people who want to get around town without a lot of exercise," Rosales said. "And then there's the hard cores who don't want to slow down going up the hills or have to walk their bikes on the single tracks (trails) around Great Falls."
The basic concept of an electrically propelled bicycle is nearly as old as the bicycle itself. In 1895, Ohio inventor Ogden Bolton Jr. received a U.S. patent for an electric bicycle with no gears and a 10-volt battery attached to its frame. However, e-bikes did not become commercially practical until the development of high storage density batteries in the 1990s.
Generally speaking e-bikes, also referred to as "pedelecs," are bicycles equipped with a battery-powered motor that engages while pedaling, or in some cases through the use of a throttle. As classified in the United States, e-bikes are "pedal assist" only, meaning they can not be propelled exclusively by their battery.
Depending upon the jurisdiction in which it operates, the motor of an e-bike is required to automatically disengage once the bike attains a speed of either 20- or 28 miles-per-hour. Electrically powered vehicles that do not require pedaling, or which continue to supply power in excess of 28-mph are legally classified as either mopeds or motorcycles and are, by definition, prohibited from traveling on paths and trails where traditional mechanical bikes are commonly found.
The intent of an e-bike is not to blast cyclists down the road without any effort at all, but instead to make their cycling experiences easier and more enjoyable.
"I always emphasize that it's fun, fun, fun," Kern Lee said of his e-bike riding experience.
Lee has been an avid cyclist and mountain biker for decades, but as he aged into his mid-60s, Lee found that he couldn't attack the steep grades as aggressively as he had in the past, and that it took longer for his body to recover. The experience wasn't as enjoyable as it once had been.
Last May, Lee bought an e-bike after riding a friend's electric mountain bike. In just more than four months, he's already put more than 800 miles on it.
"They're making bikes now that are both nimble and capable," Lee said of high-quality mountain e-bikes. "I'm riding rough stuff, doing jumps. These bikes really perform."
At 67, Lee is more fit and has greater endurance than most people half his age. The pleasure he finds in e-biking is closely connected to the exercise he continues to obtain from riding them.
"My average rides before on a regular bike were 10 to 12 miles," Lee said. "I felt like I could ride about as fast as I have ever ridden, but I couldn't sustain it. If I went too hard for too long, I wasn't riding the next day. My body just couldn't recover that fast."
"Now, I'm out riding longer, and I'm riding faster," he continued. "My average ride now is around 25 miles, and the next day I wake up feeling good."
Production line e-bikes are typically equipped with hand controls that adjust the amount of mechanical assistance the battery delivers to the bike. Range is a factor of the battery's storage capacity, the amount of assistance the rider dials up and the terrain over which they are traveling.
A fully charged e-bike delivering maximum assistance over steep terrain may have a range of fewer than 20 miles. Riding across a flat course with minimal assistance, the same bike could travel more than 100 miles without fully discharging. If the battery dies completely, the bike remains rideable, but since e-bikes are typically 15- to 20 lbs. heavier than comparable muscle-powered bikes, the ride would be sluggish.
Kern Lee's wife, Beverly, was never as avid a cyclist as her husband. Around town, running errands, a leisurely ride down a paved bike path were the bike rides Bev was most comfortable in. But as time went by, Bev's traditional bike began spending more time in her garage and less time on the road.
"I just kind of quit riding," she said. "I kept thinking, I've got to get back into this because it's good exercise, but it wasn't fun. It wasn't something I wanted to do anymore."
Shortly after buying his own mountain e-bike, Kern Lee bought Bev a commuter style e-bike more appropriate for the type of riding she was accustomed to doing. Bev soon rediscovered her enthusiasm for biking.
"At first, I was a little nervous because I hadn't been riding for a long time," she said. "But then it was so easy, it's so care free. It makes you feel like a kid again. It's fun. It's not work."
Americans have been comparatively slow warming up to e-bikes; Montanans even more so.
According to the market analytics firm Mordor Intelligence, global production of e-bikes topped $17. 7 billion in 2018 and is expected to grow to $18.7 billion by 2024. China is both the world's largest producer and the largest consumer of e-bikes, where 210 million are ridden daily. In European countries like Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, e-bikes now make up nearly a quarter of all bike sales. City planners applaud their growing popularity, heralding e-bikes as a zero-emissions transportation alternative that helps reduce traffic congestion. Six e-bikes will easily fit in a parking space designed to accommodate a single automobile.
Compare this to the United States where just 263,000 e-bikes were sold in 2017, with only 48,000 of those (18 percent) manufactured domestically. While American interest in e-bikes may be lagging, it's growing rapidly.
E-bike sales in the U.S. increased 83 percent between May 2017 and May 2018, with e-bikes making up 10 percent of all bike sales for that period. Most major U.S. bicycle brands now sell e-bikes, with manufacturers positioning themselves to capitalize on the growing market.
Knicker Biker has been selling e-bikes at its Great Falls store for a little more than three years, and according to Rosales, both inquiries and sales have grown rapidly in the past year.
"I don't see it as a fad at all," he said of the future of e-bikes. "I think Great Falls is slow to catch up with other markets. I know for a fact it's far bigger in other areas, even close by like Missoula and Bozeman."
Perhaps the greatest deterrent to increased e-bike sales is their cost. Low end e-bikes start at around $1,400, while a specialized performance model can run as high as $14,000. E-bike advocates note that the high cost of an e-bike can be justified if the buyer is willing to replace short trips typically made by a car, thus realizing reduced costs in fuel and maintenance.
According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, half of all driving trips in the United States are less than three miles in length, a distance easily covered by e-bikes. Students at Columbia University's School of Engineering and Applied Science found that on average e-bike owners replaced 46 percent of their car commutes and 30 percent of their driving errands with e-bike rides.
However, e-bikes are not without their critics. The most common source of concern focuses upon the potential safety risks of introducing a vehicle capable of a sustained speed of 28-mph onto paths and bike lanes already crowded with pedestrians, motorists and other cyclists.
In October 2017, the New York City Mayor's Office issued a news release boastfully announcing how the city had more than doubled the number of e-bikes it had seized over the preceding year.
"E-bikes are illegal to operate on New York City streets," the release states. "According to the City Administrative Code, an 'e-bike' constitutes a 'motorized scooter' and 'no person shall operate a motorized scooter in the City of New York. So far this year the NYPD (New York Police Department) has seized 923 e-bikes compared to the 341 it confiscated this time last year."
New York's crack down on e-bikes was short lived. It came in response to a sharp increase in the number of restaurants using e-bikes to make food deliveries in the crowded urban center. Fast and virtually silent, e-bikes were identified as the source of a sudden rise in pedestrian versus cyclist crashes.
"Electric bikes are dangerous nuisances in my Senate district for pedestrians, cyclists and drivers," New York State Senator Brad Holyman asserted. "Moreover, they're illegal, so it's outrageous that some irresponsible businesses in Manhattan brazenly flout the law by using e-bikes to make deliveries."
Delivery riders took to New York's streets to oppose the e-bike ban, arguing that city was unfairly impeding their ability to make a living. The impasse was resolved less than a year later when state lawmakers amended New York law to permit throttle-trolled bikes with a top speed of 25 mph.
A similar dispute has recently played out in the nation's national parks. Until a few weeks ago, the National Park Service was inconsistent on whether e-bikes were permitted on established bike paths. Some parks prohibited their use, classifying e-bikes as motorized vehicles. Others did not differentiate between path use by traditional muscle-powered bicycles and e-bikes.
In August 2019, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt issued a directive compelling all national parks to give greater access to e-bikes on trails designated for traditional muscle-powered bike use. The move prompted the following response from one cyclist writing to National Parks Traveler digital magazine.
"Mixed use bicycle and pedestrian paths are dangerous enough without adding any propelling device," the respondent wrote. "Changes as suggested will open rental companies to pressing the limits of the motors and throttling. The simplest and safest solution is to maintain these paths as non-mechanical only. At Yosemite I was required to walk from the parking lot on mixed use paths. While I was trying to dodge groups of pedestrians who covered the width of walkways, the bicycles created a definite hazard."
Jeff Mow, superintendent of Glacier National Park, recently told the Great Falls Tribune that there are only a handful of trails in Glacier that currently allow bikes of any type, and so the prospect of negative e-bike/pedestrian interactions is limited. Mow did say, however, that there are concerns about the safety of inexperienced cyclists overestimating their skills on Glacier's roads, particularly in the Spring when Going-to-the-Sun Road is opened to cyclists before motorized traffic is allowed.
"The roads haven't been cleared of rocks necessarily, so your dodging them," Mow said of the park's spring biking experience. "In some places the guard rails for cars haven't' been put up. It's not necessarily a place for the inexperienced."
"We already have these issues with traditional bikers - with people maybe not stopping to think, 'Am I really prepared for what is up ahead," he continued. "We will continue to address these issues in the future."
While the growing popularity of e-bikes may present some regulatory challenges, they are a mode of transportation with the potential to change how Americans commute and recreate. The "splendid extension of personal power and freedom" promised by mechanical bicycles more than 100 years ago could ultimately be realized by electric bikes in the 21st century.

Texto completo: America will cease to be America if Congress fails to impeach President Trump, according to top Democrats and their allies in the press.
Just ignore all those other "tipping points." Now it is for real.
"When we have a president who says, 'Article Two says I can do whatever I want,' that is in defiance of the separation of powers. That's not what our Constitution says," Speaker Nancy Pelosi said this week on the floor of the House.
She added, "What is at stake in all of this is nothing less than our democracy. What are we fighting for? Defending our Democracy for the people."
There is a broad consensus in the press that Pelosi is right. If Congress does not impeach the president, American democracy itself and the republic will cease to exist.
“We don’t live in the American republic that existed from 1787 until 2017,” MSNBC regular Steve Schmidt declared Thursday. “It’s a different type of country. And that’s why this is such a grave day because the question that’s coming is one of the most important questions that the country has ever faced.”
“This will cause even worse division in the country. And it’s hard to imagine we could be more divided,” he added, apparently forgetting all about 1861-1865.
Writing for the Washington Post, CNN host Fareed Zakaria drew comparisons between Congress' failure to impeach Trump and the rise of the Third Reich.
“Were Trump’s position to prevail, the U.S. president would become an elected dictator,” he warns. “A democracy can turn into a tyranny not all at once, with a bang, but over time. … Liberty is eroded slowly but steadily. The Weimar Republic was a well-functioning liberal democracy that, within a few short years, using mostly legal processes, became a totalitarian dictatorship.”
New York Times contributing writer Will Wilkinson claimed essentially the same thing in early October.
“Impeachment is … imperative,” he declared, “not only to protect the integrity of next year’s elections but to secure America’s continued democratic existence.”
The always-good-for-a-laugh Independent stated earlier last month, “If Democrats don't impeach Trump now, there's no point in having impeachment at all," adding, “Our democracy depends on it.”
“The cost of allowing such a person to remain in office is far greater than the bitterness his removal is bound to cause,” Princeton University professor Sean Wilentz writes for Rolling Stone magazine. “Trump’s war against the U.S. government, his rage to turn every federal institution into an instrument of his own self-aggrandizement, aims to void government of any other purpose.”
Lastly, there are those Democrats and media pundits who say the quiet part out loud.
“I'm concerned that if we don't impeach this president, he will get re-elected. If we don't impeach him, he will say he's been vindicated,” Rep. Al Green of Texas, said in May of this year.
He added, "We have a constitutional crisis. We must impeach this president. If you don’t, it’s not the soul of the nation that will be at risk only, it is the soul of the Congress that’s at risk."
Then there is the press’s favorite “ethicist,” Richard Painter.
“It's critically important that the House not only start impeachment investigations formally," he said in September, "but that they vote on articles of impeachment. All of the evidence is already there. We don't need more to impeach this president and if they don't do it, I think the Democrats are going to lose in 2020, and probably deserve to lose."
MSNBC’s Ari Melber responded, "Wow.”
Wow indeed.

Texto completo: Abundan las evidencias de que la política migratoria del país está en manos de gente extremadamente cruel e inepta.
En una entrevista de radio hace años, Ken Cuccinelli comparó a las familias hispanas con “ratas”, “mapaches” y otras plagas. Hoy, Cuccinelli —cuyos ancestros italianos escaparon pobreza y miseria emigrando a Estados Unidos— es el director interino del Servicio Federal de Ciudadanía e Inmigración. Y la facción más cruel sobre política migratoria en la Casa Blanca quiere convertirlo en el nuevo Secretario de Seguridad Nacional.
Según el libro “Guerras Fronterizas: Dentro del Asalto de Trump a la Inmigración” del New York Times, un frustrado Donald Trump llegó a ordenar a sus consejeros clausurar la frontera con México, disparar a los migrantes en las piernas, y fortificar el muro con un foso lleno de caimanes y serpientes.
Trump no logró realizar su sueño medieval, pero su cruel racismo sigue causando estragos en la frontera . La Unión de Libertades Cívicas informó recientemente que la administración separó a más de 1.500 niños inmigrantes de los que se tenía constancia, elevando así el total a más de 5,400 menores arrancados de los brazos de sus padres en la frontera.
Otro reporte de Human Rights First reveló que la política de Trump de forzar a los solicitantes de asilo a que esperen en México —hasta el momento unas 50,000 personas— ha generado más de 350 casos de violación, secuestro, tortura y otros crímenes en ese país. Un informe similar del Centro de Política Inmigratoria que entrevistó a más de 600 solicitantes a la espera en México confirmó esta nueva crisis innecesaria de la administración. Uno de sus autores expresó al The Washington Post que “estamos literalmente enviando a personas a su muerte potencial” , agregando que al hacerlo Estados Unidos incumple sus compromisos internacionales de derechos humanos.
En medio de este caos y crueldad, la construcción del muro medieval de Trump avanza con devastadoras consecuencias para el medio ambiente . Hasta el momento ha diezmado más de 600 acres de terrenos públicos, arrasando plantas autóctonas, interrumpiendo corredores migratorios de la fauna y malgastando cruciales recursos hidráulicos en el Suroeste.
El daño causado en Arizona incluye la destrucción de cactus y sitios arqueológicos en el Monumento Nacional de Organ Pipe Cactus. Bombear agua subterránea para mezclar concreto para esta construcción amenaza con secar frágiles humedales del desierto en Quitobaquito Springs y el Refugio Natural de Vida Silvestre de San Bernardino, en Arizona.
Al mismo tiempo, en Texas, empezó la construcción del muro en lugares adyacentes al Refugio Nacional de Vida Silvestre del Bajo Río Grande, al sur de una sección de 3,300 acres de Las Palomas, hogar de la paloma de ala blanca y muchas otras especies nativas de esa región.
Aún así, dejando a un lado todo atisbo de vergüenza profesional, el director en funciones de la Oficina Federal de Gestión de Terrenos (BML), William Pendley , mintió diciendo que el muro fronterizo “está solucionando la crisis ambiental que impacta los terrenos más vulnerables de nuestro país”. Este ecologista de opereta —un acérrimo negacionista climático— defiende la catástrofe ecológica que es el muro fronterizo argumentando falsamente que la frontera “está abrumada por ilegales, gente con armas, gente que trafica drogas”.
En realidad, la frontera, sus maravillosos parajes y, sobre todo, las personas que la habitan y transitan están abrumados por la insensata y racista política migratoria de Trump, Cuccinnelli, Pendley y tantos más.
Sus palabras sobre ratas, mapaches, caimanes y serpientes dejan claro que, para ellos, la crueldad es política de estado.

Texto completo: In a federal complaint, a former chief of staff to Mr. Neumann said she was demoted twice after she became pregnant.
When the chief of staff to the WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann became pregnant in March 2016, she was reluctant to share the news with her boss right away.
But ultimately, the employee, Medina Bardhi, felt she had no choice. She had to explain that she could no longer accompany Mr. Neumann on business trips "due to his penchant for bringing marijuana on chartered flights and smoking it throughout the flight while in an enclosed cabin," according to a complaint she filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in New York on Thursday.
What followed, the complaint said, was a pattern of discrimination, as Ms. Bardhi was repeatedly derided and marginalized by Mr. Neumann and other WeWork officials. Mr. Neumann referred to her maternity leave as a "vacation" or "retirement," according to the complaint, and another high-level company official, Jennifer Berrent, commented, "Wow, you're getting big," in front of a WeWork executive.
Mr. Neumann, who had promised to champion women at WeWork, stepped down as the company's chief executive in September as its attempted initial public offering collapsed in dramatic fashion. As part of a deal to turn over control of WeWork to its largest outside investor, SoftBank, he received $ 185 million to work as a consultant to the company for four years.
Over the last year, other women, including a senior executive, have filed lawsuits accusing WeWork of gender discrimination. Their complaints have added to the storm of criticism WeWork and Mr. Neumann have faced from bankers, analysts and current and former employees since the attempt to go public failed. Mr. Neumann's leadership has come under particularly intense scrutiny: He has been criticized for maintaining a lavish lifestyle and giving outsize power to family members, including his wife, Rebekah.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Neumann declined to comment, referring questions to WeWork. In a statement, a WeWork spokeswoman, Gwen Rocco, said the company "intends to vigorously defend itself against" the complaint.
"We have zero tolerance for discrimination of any kind," Ms. Rocco said. "We are committed to moving the company forward and building a company and culture that our employees can be proud of."
During her five years at WeWork, Ms. Bardhi became pregnant twice and was demoted both times, the complaint said. She was fired in early October, shortly after Mr. Neumann left, according to the complaint. Company executives told her that "there was no longer a role for her after Mr. Neumann's departure," the complaint said.
"This assertion and supposed justification rings hollow, as Ms. Bardhi already had been pushed out of Mr. Neumann's office," the complaint said. "It is clear that Ms. Bardhi's firing was motivated by the Company's sustained discriminatory bias and retaliatory animus against her and other female employees who become pregnant, take maternity leave, and/or complain about gender-based discrimination."
The complaint also said that WeWork had a broader culture of abuse and disrespect toward women -- a work environment in which excessive alcohol consumption fueled "offensive sexual conduct" and women were routinely paid less than male colleagues with similar jobs.
Ms. Bardhi's lawyer, Douglas Wigdor, said he hoped that the E.E.O.C. would view her experiences as part of a systemic problem at the company and bring class-action charges against WeWork.
The discrimination Ms. Bardhi faced began before she even started at WeWork, the complaint said. During a job interview in October 2013, Mr. Neumann "unlawfully and intrusively" asked Ms. Bardhi whether she planned to get married or become pregnant -- a question that left her "stunned and uncomfortable," according to the complaint.
When Ms. Bardhi became pregnant three years later, the complaint said, Mr. Neumann replaced her with a male employee who was paid more than twice as much.
Then, rather than restoring her to the job of chief of staff when she returned from maternity leave, the complaint said, the company gave her no clear direction on her day-to-day responsibilities.
Eventually, she got the job back, the complaint said. But when she became pregnant a second time in February 2018, the cycle repeated -- a male employee was hired to replace her, and she found herself sidelined when she returned to work.
"She was given no information about what her new role would be," the complaint said. "This was obvious retaliation for her taking maternity leave and discrimination against a pregnant employee and new mother."
Her difficulties continued during the buildup to the failed initial public offering, the complaint said. As Mr. Neumann and Ms. Bardhi drove back from the offices of JPMorgan Chase on Sept. 16, the complaint said, Mr. Neumann said to her, "I hope you enjoyed your vacation."
Mr. Neumann founded WeWork, which leases office space, on an idealistic promise to change the way people work and elevate global consciousness. And he pledged to make the start-up an inviting place for women.
"We like to say that right now we're bringing in the most talented women in the world at an early stage," he said in an interview hosted by the Economic Club of New York in 2017. "We're going to grow them all as leaders."
As the company has gained prominence, however, news reports and court filings have painted a picture of a raucous workplace with a culture of heavy drinking where complaints of sexism and even harassment went unheeded.
Now the company is aiming to reinvent itself without its erratic founder.
After weeks of uncertainty about its future, WeWork got a last-ditch lifeline earlier this month, when SoftBank launched a multibillion-dollar takeover, installing one of its own top managers, Marcelo Claure, as executive chairman.

It's Halloween on Thursday, so we thought we'd take a look at something scary that's probably lurking in your home: energy vampires.
Also known as phantom power and ghost load, the term refers to items plugged into an outlet that draw power even when they aren't being used.
"It may not seem like a big problem," said Michael Goldschmidt, a housing and environmental design expert at the University of Missouri. But an average home, he said, racks up roughly a whole month's worth of vampire power annually. "It's a really big deal."
The Natural Resources Defense Council puts the cost at about $ 165 per United States household, or $ 19 billion nationally. That translates to around 44 million tons of carbon dioxide, or 4.6 percent of the country's total residential electricity generation. In an office, things like printers, computers and phone chargers can consume a quarter of a building's energy.
You can get a general sense of the vampire power in your home by checking your energy meter during low-use times like late at night or early morning. Then, to see which household items are frequent phantoms, you could try a free smartphone app called Dr. Power. It has a library of more than 100,000 appliances and devices. Another option is a Kill-a-Watt meter, which measures how much energy individual appliances are using. They're available at most hardware stores and can sometimes be borrowed at public libraries.
When it comes to reduction, Lisa Schmidt, chief executive of Home Energy Analytics, a California-based start-up that develops energy analysis software, recommends focusing on the higher consumption items first. "You may find one device is taking up 30 percent of the phantom load," she said. "That's the one you want to focus on."
Home entertainment systems are a common energy suck, Ms. Schmidt said, especially surround-sound stereo systems. Heated towel racks are an increasingly common electricity hog. There are also things that people rarely use but keep plugged in, like the set-top box in the spare bedroom. Older items, like VCRs, also tend to be less energy efficient.
In the case of those power-hungry devices, the savings can be surprising. Shutting-down a computer, for example, can cut energy use by 65 percent compared with leaving the device in idle mode.
Because unplugging and re-plugging devices can be tedious and difficult, Ms. Schmidt recommends smart power strips. There's a whole range of options, including motion-sensing versions and strips that can be controlled remotely on your phone.
There are limits to what can be unplugged or managed. Your main refrigerator, for instance, should be kept on. Some older internet routers and TV cable boxes can crash when unplugged, though that's fairly uncommon. And safety devices like smoke detectors should always be on.
Overall, though, slaying those energy vampires can lead to significant energy savings and that means lower greenhouse gas emissions. And, according to Mr. Goldschmidt, any investments in strips, plugs or other energy-management technology should have a very quick payback.
"It saves you money and you're helping the environment," he said.

One of the central planks in Donald Trump's campaign in 2016 was his promise to save coal. So you might think that the bankruptcy filing this week by Murray Energy, one of the largest privately owned coal mining operations in the United States, would hurt the president in coal country in next year's election.
Murray Energy, after all, was the latest in a string of coal companies to go belly up amid a shift to renewable energy and cleaner-burning gas. One respected analyst placed a big share of the blame for those bankruptcies squarely on the president's shoulders.
"Trump failed. It's that simple," said Tom Sanzillo, director of finance at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a nonprofit research firm that supports the shift to renewable power. "They had the keys to the kingdom, the coal industry did, and they couldn't fix it."
But will that translate into lost votes for President Trump in coal country? Maybe not, other analysts said.
"Politically in West Virginia I don't think it's going to change things," said John C. Kilwein, an associate professor of political science at West Virginia University.
"The narrative has been created in a pretty shrewd way," Professor Kilwein said. "It's, 'Look we're struggling against these liberals and these environmentalists. At least Trump is trying for us."'
"I can almost guarantee he's going to win the state," he said.
Thomas J. Pyle, president of the Institute for Energy Research, a think tank that supports fossil fuels, agreed. "Symbolically it's frustrating," he said of the Murray Energy bankruptcy.
But, he added: "I don't think it impacts Trump's standing in coal country at all. And, more importantly, where are they going to go?"
Mr. Sanzillo said coal workers were realistic about the future of the industry but wanted to hear about concrete plans for job creation in a post-coal world.
"I think people in coal country know that the industry is in decline and that's pretty permanent. The question for whether or not that hurts Trump is really a question for the Democrats," he said. "What are they offering?"

Texto completo: The results are in, people, and it’s a landslide. Your choice for Worst Trump Cabinet Member is...
Attorney General William Barr! Barr was cited for multiple non-achievements. There was his misrepresentation of the findings of the Mueller report. And the decision to respond to Robert Mueller’s warning about Russian intervention in American elections by — as one voter put it — “opening investigations into the investigators.”
The bottom line was a quaint conviction that the attorney general is supposed to work for the public, not the president.
“I cannot believe I am stating this, but Jeff Sessions had more respect for the law,” wrote Diana from Centennial.
Second place went to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. “Silence on Ukraine, sycophant to Trump, continues to demoralize the State Department, lack of support for his ambassadors,” wrote Isabelle Stillger, launching off in a very long list of complaints about Pompeo’s failure to ... pretty much everything.
“First in his class at West Point and he ends up polishing Trump’s boots,” added Phyliss Dalmatian.
Still, the results weren’t even close. Besides his dedication to protecting the president from, um, criminal justice, Barr unnerved readers with his war against secularism. “The chief enforcer of the Constitution recently gave a speech decrying those who would interfere with Christian religious control of our government,” noted Sharon from Montana, who predicted Barr “will go down in history as the worst attorney general.”
Maybe it was partly the name. So many possible Barr rhymes.
“The new star — By far — Is Billy Barr,” announced Stephen Glynn. “Where’s the tar and feathers?”
We can skip tar and feathers. Our goal is not physical torture. Just humiliation.
As usual, we got a lot of complaints about the Worst Cabinet Member contest from people who said it was impossible to pick just one. (“There is a dead heat with all of them tied at the bottom.”)
Nobody, however, claimed there was a problem of shortage of possibilities.
Perpetual contender Betsy DeVos finished third. Readers pointed out that the secretary of education was recently held in contempt of court for refusing to support students victimized by crooked for-profit schools. But the bottom line was that Donald Trump’s top education official doesn’t like public schools. End of story.
On the plus side, DeVos has always gotten a bit of a slide from those who argue she’s too incompetent to be a major threat. There are several Cabineteers in that category. “I’ve been thinking that Ben Carson must be in the Witness Protection Program,” wrote a voter from Nashua, New Hampshire, about our secretary of housing and urban development. “Really, has anyone seen him in the last several months?”
The last Worst winner, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, dropped down to the middle of the pack despite his heroic bid for attention by threatening to fire officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, who had the temerity to reassure the public that Trump’s do-it-yourself weather map threatening Alabama with a hurricane was fictional.
“The meteorology thing was awesome,” wrote John Merrill.
Perhaps our respondents have decided that Ross, for all his awfulness, also is too inept to pose much trouble. Nearly three years into the job, “he appears to be perpetually stuck on Level One of the learning curve,” theorized John Evans.
Still, there were a few whimpers about lack of achievement by officials like Elaine Chao, secretary of transportation and wife of Mitch McConnell. “The secretary, who would have never gotten a Cabinet job without her spouse, has made Infrastructure Week into a punch line,” wrote a voter who gets extra credit for bringing infrastructure into the conversation.
A number of people suggested a Worst shout-out to Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, plus acting White House chief of staff. (Mulvaney is also winner of Longest Title award.) You’ll remember that famous interview in which Mick announced that Trump wanted to host the G7 summit at his hotel because “he still considers himself to be in the hospitality business.”
Rick Perry may be departing as energy secretary, but he’ll be hard to forget. His role as one of “the three amigos,” federal officials allegedly charged with handling Ukraine, would be enough. But Perry voters also seemed bathed in nostalgia for ineptitudes past. “Who are the three amigos? If he says ‘me, Volker and oops,’ he’s my guy,” wrote LJR from South Bay.
The Cabinet members regarded as truly terrible were the non-inept ones. “He’s both energetic and fiendishly clever,” complained Edith Frick, casting her vote for Barr. Frick added, however, that if Worst had the “normal meaning of incompetency, clear winner is Ben Carson.”
It’s amazing how familiar you readers are with Trump’s top officials. Especially since they come and go so quickly. William Barr has only been attorney general since February, and you’re thinking about him all the time.
A lot of our correspondents seemed torn between Barr and the duo of Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt and Andrew Wheeler, head of the Environmental Protection Agency. Penny White wavered back and forth, then finally decided she had to go with Bernhardt/Wheeler “from a sheer survival viewpoint.” She also wondered if anyone had contemplated Cabinet-level Halloween masks.
Prize to the first person who goes trick-or-treating as the attorney general.

Texto completo: "It was a shock at first, but maybe we should not have been surprised."
Ken Rosenberg
Applied conservation scientist, Cornell University
When a team of Cornell University researchers and others published a bird study in the online journal Science on Sept. 19, they didn't expect the worldwide reaction that followed.
The findings: North America has lost 2.9 billion birds in the past 50 years — 29% of the avian population.
The impact: An ecosystem is losing a key component and it's a sign of a quickly changing environment that will affect other wildlife, plants and more.
The spotlight: Once the study was released, the New York Times picked up the story and highlighted a startling statement from David Yarnold, president and chief executive of the National Audubon Society, who called the findings "a full-blown crisis." Other major media outlets picked up the story, and conservationists around the world were shocked and inspired to take action.
"The reaction to the study has been phenomenal. We were hoping for a big response," said Ken Rosenberg, an applied conservation scientist at Cornell, the study's lead author and a leader of research and planning on joint initiatives by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology Lab and the American Bird Conservancy.
"We expected some response, but this is the biggest thing we've seen for a bird paper. It was amazing to see the findings on the front page of the New York Times and the Washington Post. All of networks talking birds for one day was so great. The trick now is how to keep the interest and keep the momentum going so it is not a headline that disappears."
From Ithaca and beyond To publish the study, the team of scientists tracked birds for decades, and parts of the study came from Ithaca's backyards and skies, as countless passionate non-professional bird-watchers submitted their observations to databases and helped carry out studies of bird populations every year.
Some of the most fascinating parts of the study came from weather radar maps as the researches found some types of birds were declining in population, but others, such as waterfowl and raptors, were increasing in numbers.
"It was quite overwhelming," said Adriaan Dokter, a research associate at Cornell. "It reached Europe, too. It went all over the world. It was more than what we expected."
Dokter noted he and Rosenberg were interviewed by Australian, Dutch and Spanish media.
"People see this trend not just here, but in Europe," Dokter said. "It's not just a local U.S. phenomenon, but a trend all over the world."
To Dokter, the confirmation of the population decrease across hundreds of bird species is like a canary in a coal mine.
"It's a decrease in the vitality of the ecosystem that we see. Birds depend on insects. Insects are important to the ecosystem of plants," he said. "It means something fundamental in our environment ... It's a warning sign that we have to be careful. Things are rapidly changing."
How scientists researched the decline in birds Surveying: Scientists and amateurs observed birds to complete censuses.
Weather radar: Scientists examined weather radar maps to determine the cumulative weight of birds in the sky.
Research: Researchers examined hundreds of different surveys.
Analysis: After finding the best data from the surveys, scientists conducted statistical analyses to determine how much populations have decreased.
The team at Cornell partnered with the American Bird Conservancy, National Audubon Society, Bird Conservancy of the Rockies, Canadian Wildlife Service, the Georgetown University Georgetown Environment Initiative, United States Geological Survey and the Smithsonian National Zoological Park Conservation Biology Institute.
"'Were there declines or shifts?'" Rosenberg said about the questions researchers had years ago. "Someone never did this comprehensive work."
Researchers then obtained answers they were searching for — there's been an overall decline in the bird population, and the largest declines have been in the most common species.
"It was a shock at first, but maybe we should not have been surprised," Rosenberg said.
Using weather radar, Dokter was able to pick up the cumulative weights of birds migrating, which he later analyzed. The birds he researched tended to be long-distance migratory birds, which contribute more to the bio-life on radar maps.
"The U.S. has a very large network of radars that cover ... anything in the sky — not just weather, but also wildlife," Dokter said. "Birds give strong signals. More and more have realized this, and it's an important data source for biologists. If you look at it on your iPhone, you don't see the individual bird, but a blob of bio-life moving. That's what is used for birds.
"We don't see the numbers, but the kilograms of birds in the skies. What we did see recently is the amount of migration that has changed. It's a nice complement to what's seen on ground. Radar gives really good coverage. With radar, we can count many more birds than what we could count on the ground."
Bird biomass in the skies has decreased by about 14% since 2007, Dokter told the Cornell Chronicle, Cornell University's in-house publication.
"The decline in night skies might be steeper than what we see on the ground. It's migratory birds, especially birds that travel long distance ... they seem to be not doing too well," Dokter said. "It's what I want to document next, and the why and what we can do to turn it around. Where do they face the most problems and challenges?"
Outside of weather radar data, scientists looked through more than 500 surveys, Rosenberg said. They then used a statistical model to analyze the data.
Locals get involved in tracking bird population The primary data source was the North American Breeding Bird Survey, which started in 1966 as a collaboration between scientists and bird-watchers.
While there have been studies on the changes of bird populations on the continent, the most recent study was the first time anyone has ever collected and analyzed 50 years' worth of data and findings in North America.
For decades, countless passionate non-professional bird-watchers have submitted their observations to databases. In the new research, professionals examined those studies to estimate the populations of 529 species from 2006 to 2015.
"The study published in Science was shocking to me, with its report of just how deeply bird populations have crashed since 1970," said Diane Morton, president of the Cayuga Bird Club. "The paper let us know that it is not just our subjective impression that there are fewer birds now, but that hundreds of different bird species really are much, much less abundant than they used to be.
"Among other alarming declines, the authors reported that forest birds like warblers, and grassland species like meadowlarks and sparrows, now number hundreds of millions fewer than in the 1970s."
The Cayuga Bird Club's annual Christmas Bird Count contributed to the findings. In addition, the club also counts birds for the New York State Breeding Bird Atlas.
"It was rewarding for those of us who participate in the annual Christmas Bird Count to know that the numbers we gather in our bird counts year after year were useful for these analyses," Morton said. "We did not provide any direct input, but our participation in citizen science projects generated some of the data that this extensive study used."
Surveys by Rosenberg and other local scientists contributed as well.
"The birders are the eyes of the world," he said. "You need to have all the eyes and ears out there because scientists can't do it alone. But it's not just the observation of amateurs. It's data collected for the purpose of the survey."
Birds that have seen the largest decrease The research shows most of the birds lost belong to 12 families, including warblers, finches, sparrows and swallows.
Birds associated with farmlands have seen the largest decline in numbers and percentage.
"Some birds in our backyards are the steepest in decline that we see," Dokter said. "Hopefully, it will lead to action take care of nature."
Out of all of the bird families, the largest decline was among larks. There are 70 million fewer Eastern meadowlarks, 60 million fewer Western meadowlarks, and a 67% decline for all larks.
"We're seeing this loss of abundance, because birds are integral parts of ecosystems. They perform ecological functions like seed dispersal," Rosenberg said. "The loss of this chunk of birds is causing ecological consequences. Because we have this data on birds, the fear that is happening with birds is happening across the board with other animals."
What's being done for North American birds The National Audubon Society has responded strongly to the report and is mobilizing its 1.65 million members to urge lawmakers to act on bird conservation.
The organization is pushing for the passing of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act and implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. Both plans focus on providing an optimal environment and water for birds in the regions.
The group also wants lawmakers to defend and reinforce the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which the Trump administration has been trying to weaken. Conservationists say the Migratory Bird Treaty Act protects close to 1,000 species of North American birds and is the most import bird conservation law in the U.S.
How you can help the birds Individuals can take a variety of actions to help, including making windows safer, reducing plastic use, keeping cats indoors, using native plants and avoiding the use of pesticides. To learn more, visit 3billionbirds.org/.
What's next for the bird population The Cayuga Bird Club will census birds for the next New York Breeding Bird Atlas, which will have five years of surveys starting from January 2020.
"The Science paper is a call to action," Morton said. "It has sparked more urgent discussion about how to address the decline of bird populations — through conservation management, changing the developed landscape to provide better habitat for birds, and taking individual steps to reduce the threats that birds face. Continued monitoring of bird populations will also be important for prioritizing conservation efforts."
Because the study did not state the reasons for the decrease in bird populations, Rosenberg said he and the researchers are assembling a group of experts early next year to investigate the causes of the declines.
"The most important thing is that this doesn't become a news flash," Rosenberg said "We want people to pay attention and to track birds.
"People who love birds have to speak up. ... We won't reverse the declines unless people who love birds demand action."

Texto completo: From " Trump, Zuckerberg & Pals Are Breaking America ," Thomas Friedman, New York Times, Oct. 30:
Look at Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who was questioned last Wednesday at a House hearing by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. A.O.C. was trying to grasp why Zuckerberg thinks it's O.K. for politicians to run political ads that contain obvious lies. . . .
This is all about money for Zuckerberg, but he disguises his motives in some half-baked theory about freedom of the press.
From the New York Times " Advertising Acceptability Manual ":
We believe that the broad principles of freedom of the press confer on us an obligation to keep our advertising columns open to all points of view. Therefore, The New York Times accepts advertisements in which groups or individuals comment on public or controversial issues. We make no judgments on an advertiser's arguments, factual assertions or conclusions. . . . We do not verify, nor do we vouch for, statements of purported fact in advocacy/opinion advertisements. We reserve the right, however, to require documentation of factual claims when it is deemed necessary. . . .
Our stance with regard to the acceptance of political advertisements is the same as it is for the acceptance of opinion advertisements.

Heirs introduce the digital world to Jerome Liebling photography 'that no one knows'

Texto completo: AMHERST — Most people remember the photographer Jerome Liebling for his black-and-white photographs: workers, children, people going about their lives. A boy spreads his overcoat like two wings, poised to fly. A mother on the streets of Málaga, Spain, clutches her child as a bike whirs past. A slaughterhouse worker spattered with blood steadies himself on a wall and glances down.
But type “Jerome Liebling" into Getty Images's search engine, and color pops into view: lush greens and reds of an apple orchard, turquoise stripes on Art Deco apartments in Miami Beach, orange-and-pink swirls on a patterned dress in Brooklyn. There are famous faces, too: politicians, writers, filmmakers.
It's a surprising selection, and it's no accident. When Rachel Liebling, the photographer's daughter and primary manager of his estate, decided to make 640 of her father's photographs available for licensing through Getty Images, she had a plan.
“I was like, 'I'm putting out the work that no one knows,"' Rachel said, sitting at the kitchen table in her late father's Amherst home this summer.
Born in 1924, Jerome Liebling worked early in his career with the Photo League, a group that pioneered socially conscious street photography in midcentury New York City. His work is featured in the permanent collections of the Museum of Fine Arts, New York's Museum of Modern Art, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, to name a few. He also was widely known as a teacher, especially in photography circles. “But you'd think he'd died in 1960," Rachel said with a laugh.
With control of an artist's archive comes control over his or her legacy. Unless the artist has a large foundation — think Picasso or Dalí — the responsibility usually falls to heirs. Since her father's death in 2011, Rachel has managed his archive with a mind to showcasing later and lesser-known works. She hopes to reframe his artistic legacy, to avoid “this idea of one Liebling," she said.
Rachel was thrown into archive management sooner than she anticipated. Just a few days after her father died, she got a call from The New York Times asking for photos for a memorial article. She was already busy grieving and preparing for her father's service. “Right away, I was dealing with, 'What body of work are we going to put out?' " Rachel said. “I hadn't really thought about it."
When Liebling died, he left behind 15,000 images, stored as prints and negatives in his Amherst study — proof of an active, six-decade-long career. Liebling cared deeply about social issues, a passion informed by his childhood during the Great Depression and service in World War II. He took pictures, he said, to “figure out where the pain was, to show things that people wouldn't see unless I was showing them."
Before he died, Liebling placed his archive in a family trust managed by his widow, Rebecca Nordstrom, and four daughters from a previous marriage. Rachel, the youngest, had experience working in the art world, so she was the logical choice to spearhead the management of her father's archive. In the next years, she helped organize a handful of retrospective exhibitions.
Then, in February 2018, René Aranzamendez contacted Rachel about licensing her father's photos through Getty Images. Aranzamendez is the senior editor of Getty Archive, a branch of the gargantuan online photo library dedicated to licensing editorial photographs taken before the year 2000. He had seen Liebling's photographs online.
“A lot of these folks digitize their content, and it's going on a website that's fairly local. So they're spending their resources and a lot of energy into content that's fantastic, but the reach is never going to be 20-offices' worth," Aranzamendez said in a phone interview, referring to the more than 20 locations that Getty has around the globe. Photographic estates that have licensed with Getty include those of Ansel Adams, Berenice Abbott, and Andreas Feininger.
An inherited photography archive is “a wonderful legacy, but a huge responsibility,"' Mary Engel said in a phone interview. Daughter of the well-known photographers Morris Engel and Ruth Orkin, Engel is founder and president of the American Photography Archives Group, a nonprofit organization that educates its members about the preservation and management of privately-owned photography archives.
Since Engel founded APAG, in 2000, new ways have emerged to promote a photographer's legacy. Through social media, websites, online licensing, and online galleries, archive managers can increase exposure, build audiences, and monetize more works. But they also risk losing control of the images and how they're used and circulated on the Web. “You know, it's scary, because anything that gets out on the Web gets out," Rachel said. “People just think they're public domain."
Pursuing legal action against every Pinterest account or blog that uses your image without permission just isn't feasible, Engel said — especially when the archive is handled by family members. Archivists can either make their photos viewable online and vulnerable to improper use, or not put photos online at all. “A lot of this is about: How much control do you want to keep?" Engel said.
The Lieblings and Nordstrom talked over the offer from Getty Images before deciding to go ahead with the project. “It was definitely an opportunity that we saw for getting Jerry's images out there in the world," said Nordstrom, Liebling's widow.
After seven years of fielding individual requests, Rachel also looked forward to handing over some of the responsibility for licensing. Her contract with Getty would be nonexclusive, meaning she could still handle some requests herself. But it would free up time and extend the archive's reach.
Rachel was still careful to impose limits. The Liebling estate's contract with Getty allows photos to be licensed only for editorial use — meaning images can run in newspapers, but not on mugs or T-shirts. Some archivists, like Engel, will produce posthumous prints; Rachel decided against it, which means all Liebling works are “lifetime prints," produced while he was alive.
The Lieblings receive a small percentage of the profits from each image they license through Getty. They're not expecting to get rich from the deal, Rachel said. The most important thing is increasing exposure and rewriting the narrative about her father's career.
Liebling's well-known works were of anonymous people — workers, children, every-men and -women. “Most people don't know he actually did a lot of portraits, too," Nordstrom said. The archive includes many recognizable faces: the novelists Chinua Achebe and James Baldwin, the photographer Paul Strand, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, candid portraits of a young Ken Burns from when the filmmaker was a student of Liebling's at Hampshire College, to name just a few.
“There was so much material there that other people — other than family, our close friends — haven't ever seen. And some of it is extraordinary work," Nordstrom continued. She found negatives from Liebling's travels to Spain, which she had never seen — although Rachel remembers trailing after her father at bullfights as a girl. There were also street scenes, like one featuring three young women leaning against a car in Holyoke.
Liebling, they said, knew about the growing importance of new technologies. He always shot on film but experimented with digital printing techniques late in life. “Jerry embraced the change, because he knew it was a way for people to see his work," Nordstrom said. “So I think he would be very much in support of this initiative that we've taken."
But Rachel and Nordstrom agree that Liebling wasn't thinking much about posterity before he died. He was just too busy. “Even at the end of his life, he was he was still working and still wanting to publish and get more of his images out there," Nordstrom said. “He was going a mile a minute."

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES -- "The Morning Show" started life as a behind-the-scenes peek at a slice of network TV as familiar and routine as a wake-up cup of coffee. Then shocking revelations of sexual misconduct engulfed NBC's "Today" and beyond, and the story changed.

The 10-part drama series, part of the first wave of shows launching the Apple TV Plus streaming service Nov. 1, expanded its original focus on women's role in media to include the repercussions of workplace bad behavior. It all plays out in the lucrative, hypercompetitive world of A.M. news-and-fluff programming.

"When the Me Too movement happened it was really hard to ignore, nor would we want to ignore it. We would be negligent," said Mimi Leder, an executive producer and director for "The Morning Show."

Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon lead the cast that includes Steve Carell, Billy Crudup, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Mark Duplass, Nestor Carbonell and Desean Terry. Aniston plays Alex, the long-reigning queen of the now-slumping "Morning Show," and Witherspoon is Bradley, an outspoken TV reporter with a shaky job history who lands hard on Alex's turf.

But Alex's longtime co-anchor Mitch (Carell) has already wreaked havoc. The drama opens with him fired by network UBA for multiple instances of alleged misconduct, evoking Matt Lauer's dismissal from "Today." Mitch's banishment creates career and psychological upheaval for Alex and opportunity for those waiting in the wings for their shot at network glory.

Among them is Daniel (Terry), an African-American co-anchor who chafes at what he considers pressure to downplay his ethnicity and hopes the top anchor job will be his reward. There are impressive displays of ambition and plot twists galore in the three episodes Apple made available of the glossy, expensive-looking drama that's debuting three episodes on Nov. 1. Remaining episodes will be released consecutively on Fridays.

Apple TV Plus costs $4.99 a month after a seven-day free trial, and a subscription can be shared with up to six family members. The streaming service is free for a year to buyers of a new iPhone, iPad, Mac or Apple TV box.

Alex's somber on-air response to the scandal evokes memories of Samantha Guthrie and Hoda Kotb telling "Today" viewers about Lauer's November 2017 firing for what NBC called "inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace." The fallout has yet to subside: co-anchors Guthrie and Kotb returned to the subject of Lauer earlier this month after further allegations against him emerged in Ronan Farrow's new book, "Catch and Kill."

Series executive producer Michael Ellenberg began work on what became "The Morning Show" before #MeToo, saying he was intrigued by "what it means to be a woman in media" and specifically a woman with power in the morning network realm. He found the "authentic, precise" details he needed in journalist Brian Stelter's 2013 nonfiction book, "Top of the Morning: Inside the Cutthroat World of Morning TV."

Ellenberg optioned the book, Aniston and Witherspoon were attached and Kerry Ehrin ("Friday Night Lights," ‘'Bates Motel") was brought in as writer and showrunner (Stelter, a former reporter with The New York Times and now with CNN, is a consultant-writer). Leder said the drama from a nearly all-female slate of executive producers -- including Aniston and Reese -- is at its core about the relationship between Alex and Bradley.

The two are "colliding at a certain point in their lives," Leder said, with Alex at "a plateau where ageism is starting to hit, and Bradley being this character who's trying to make her mark, and what can these two women give each other?"

Texto completo: A reader says they should be criminally liable for the deadly crashes. Also: A new capitalism; gender transition and loss; America's overstay in Afghanistan; being alone isn't bad.
To the Editor:
Re "Boeing C.E.O. Had Warning Before a 2nd Crash" (front page, Oct. 30):
Will we never learn? Or do we just not care enough?
This time it was hundreds of lives snuffed out -- not just money lost and lives economically devastated. It is painfully obvious to anyone with an objective eye that Boeing's executives made deadly decisions with their bottom line as their primary interest.
"The marketplace will self-regulate." How many times have we heard that nonsense being used as a tactic against government regulation? Enron, Volkswagen, Wells Fargo and Wall Street, ad nauseam.
This will stop when the executives of these companies are prosecuted criminally and, if convicted, imprisoned and fined not with company money but with seizure of their personal assets.

Social Capitalism
To the Editor:
Re "We Need a New Capitalism" (Op-Ed, Oct. 14):
I couldn't agree more with Marc Benioff's article on the need for a new capitalism. It should be called social capitalism. This new capitalism's underlying aspiration should be the enrichment of the society at large, not the few individuals.
This can be achieved with tax, economic and educational policies that empower the working class. This should include not taxing income earned by work at a higher rate than the income from capital gains. Also, companies should share the profits fairly with the workers who made that income possible, not paying 300 to 400 times more to chief executives.
Stable inequality is an illusion. History shows that inequalities polarize society, leading to dysfunctional governance, and in the long run to riots and violence.

A Child's Gender Transition: Love and Loss
To the Editor:
Re "I Wish My Dad Had Celebrated My Transition," by Meredith Talusan (Sunday Review, Oct. 20):
That a parent struggles with the news of his or her child's gender transition is not a measure of cisgender privilege but of the very human reaction to loss. And when your child changes gender, wipes out a shared past and transforms inside and out from what parents lived and experienced, it's a loss whether you like it or not.
You can bully parents and family about their emotions all you want, and hurl accusations that their grief is transphobic, but it won't change the fact that parents often need to grieve this news whether or not Ms. Talusan or the transgender community approves.
Grief is grief. It has its own timetable.
Patricia Garrison
Union, N.J.
To the Editor:
Meredith Talusan's troubling take on the emotional reactions of others to her life choices strikes me as sad, naïve and judgmental. She expects her own feelings about herself, her life and her choices to be honored and respected by others, but she refuses to grant others, whom she claims to love, the same autonomy of feelings, thoughts and selfhood.
Respect and love are always granted without self-interest, or not at all. Those things cannot be commanded or coerced by others, regardless of the history of the relationship or the need a person may feel for those kinds of connection with another person.
In the hope for a world that welcomes all, regardless of their suffering, shortcomings, gifts or appearance, each of us must recognize that love and respect are precious treasures that we can only hope for and be grateful for when we receive them.

The Limits of American Power
To the Editor:
Re "Making Deals, and Mistakes" (news analysis, front page, Oct. 22):
After 18 years of an American military presence in Afghanistan, lamentations about the loss of "leverage" now that President Trump has ordered the removal of 2,000 troops seem woefully misplaced.
It should be obvious by now that this military presence has done nothing to advance United States objectives, nor has it made Afghanistan more stable. And while the particulars vary, the reliance on military power has not ended the Syrian civil war, nor has it brought a peace settlement to the Koreas.
The overriding need is for improved diplomacy, which was shamefully absent when the president impetuously pulled troops from northern Syria. But successful diplomacy might also require more modest goals and recognition of the limits of American power.

Being Alone Isn't a Burden
To the Editor:
Re "There Are Benefits to Spending Time Alone" (Smarter Living, Oct. 28):
A lifelong Francophile, I often travel to France to visit friends and do photography.
Having lunch one day in a small restaurant in a medieval village, the other diners, all older women like me, asked if I was traveling by myself. When I said yes, one said: "Oh, that's sad. You're alone." I replied: "I'm not alone. I'm free."
With that, all the women applauded!

H.I.V. Scandal Puts Focus on Pakistan's Health Care System

Texto completo: After the reuse of syringes infected hundreds of children in a small city, health workers say the entire system needs to be revamped.
A pediatrician accused of reusing syringes and infecting scores of Pakistani children with H.I.V. is now practicing in a government-run hospital after his private clinic was shuttered, in a case that is raising widespread questions about the integrity of Pakistan's health care system.
The pediatrician, Muzaffar Ghanghro, was initially the sole focus of blame in an H.I.V. outbreak that has hit more than 1,100 people -- so far nearly 900 of them are children -- in the small city of Ratodero.
But government officials believe that he is not the only cause there, and that the bad practices he is accused of, including reusing syringes and IV needles, are so widespread across Pakistan that the entire health care system needs better regulation.
Health workers say the government needs to revamp the national medical syllabus to prioritize infection control, currently a minor part of doctor training. And they say hospitals often scrimp on the sterilization process for tools.
"The only good thing about the outbreak has been that it laid bare the multiple flaws in the system that the government with support of U.N. agencies needs to address," said Dr. Fatima Mir, a pediatric infectious disease expert working at the Aga Khan University in Karachi. She was one of the first medical workers to help with the outbreak in Ratodero.
"What the outbreak in Ratodero says about Pakistan's health care is that infection control is poor or nonexistent. Pakistan's health care system is now trying to integrate infection control as a formal part of the system," Dr. Mir added.
She said that Pakistan's medical practitioners often lack the logistics and supplies necessary to prevent and contain infections. When she was in Ratodero to help, Dr. Fatima said it was a challenge finding clean water to wash her hands with while seeing patients.
"With the lack of infection control, this outbreak is not unexpected. What is unexpected is that this time, children are the main victims, and there are a lot of them," she said.
Of the nearly 36,000 residents in Ratodero tested since late April, 1,112 have tested positive for H.I.V., 889 of them young children. With not even a quarter of Ratodero's population tested, officials worry the real numbers are much higher.
The police investigation into Dr. Ghanghro is continuing, and he has been cleared only of the charge that he intentionally spread the virus, the district inspector general in charge of the case said in an interview. Dr. Ghanghro's court case for medical malpractice is still continuing, said the district inspector general, Irfan Ali Baloch.
Dr. Ghanghro has denied that he reused syringes, which is illegal.
"A team of medical experts came and interviewed him," Mr. Baloch said. "The medical board determined that he did not intentionally spread H.I.V., but his clinic was in such a condition that the protocols were not being maintained."
Dr. Ghanghro still faces criminal charges, making it unclear how he is able to continue practicing, and why he was recently posted to a government-run hospital near Ratodero.
Provincial health care officials in Sindh Province, who would be responsible for reassigning Dr. Ghanghro, said that he has not been given the permission to resume practicing medicine and that his medical license was not recently renewed.
But Dr. Ghanghro said in an interview with The New York Times last week that he recently renewed his license, and was practicing in a government hospital with a stream of patients waiting to be seen by him, questioning the government's ability to regulate the system.
"He has applied to us to start practicing again," said Abdul Sami, an official from the Sindh provincial health care commission. "But so far, we have not allowed it."
"If he has already started practicing, it is not to our knowledge," added Mr. Sami, who is based in the district of Larkana, where Ratodero is.
Officials from the governing Tehreek-e-Insaf party blamed the outbreak on the poor governance and corruption of the local government of Sindh Province.
Other observers said the outbreak is more about systemic failure.
Zaigham Khan, a development expert who writes a column for the newspaper The News, noted that Pakistan spends less than 1 percent of its G.D.P. on health care, and that only one doctor is available for every 6,000 people, mostly concentrated in urban areas.
"Pakistan is facing a full-blown public health crisis, mainly rooted in ineffective governance and dominance of special interests," Mr. Khan said.
"Pakistan is one of the two countries in the world where polio persists, the other being Afghanistan," and treatable conditions like rabies and dengue contribute to dozens of deaths annually, he added. "In rural areas, most people are treated by quack doctors. As if that was not enough, even doctors often administer expired medicine. Doctors are hardly ever made accountable for these practices in the legal system."
Dr. Baseer Khan Achakzai, the program manager of the central government-run National AIDS Control Program, said that Ratodero's conditions were not unique, and that much of Pakistan was struggling to combat the spread of H.I.V., which causes AIDS. Unregulated clinics were continuing to operate, he said, and used syringes are frequently repackaged to sell as new, although they are supposed to be incinerated after use.
From 2010 to 2018, the number of H.I.V.-positive people in Pakistan nearly doubled, to about 160,000, according to estimates by U.N.AIDS, the United Nations task force that specializes in H.I.V. and AIDS. During that time, the number of new infections jumped 38 percent in those 15 to 24. And only about 10 percent of people thought to be H.I.V.-positive are being treated.
"With the help of U.N. agencies, a state-of-the-art AIDS control center is being established," Dr. Achakzai said. "It will ensure that contaminated syringes will not be used and all medical waste would be put in the incinerator."
With the exception of the capital, Islamabad, medical laboratories across Pakistan are not under any regulatory framework, Dr. Achakzai said.
"There is no check and balance," he said.

Texto completo: Halloween is nigh. These screamers are bound to get your blood curdling.
Netflix has done a fine job in recent years of stockpiling horror films -- from established classics to newer pictures discovered at international film festivals. But which are the scariest? It's a pleasure to watch a smart, artful and culturally relevant fright flick. But it's even better when it spooks you into leaving the lights on after bedtime. Looking to be thoroughly terrorized this Halloween season? Here are 13 devilish films that will have even the most stoic souls jumping at shadows.
'The Blackcoat's Daughter' (2017)
Stream it here .
The writer-director Osgood Perkins sets his atmospheric feature filmmaking debut, "The Blackcoat's Daughter," at a mostly empty private Catholic girls' academy, where a worldly senior played by Lucy Boynton reluctantly looks after a timid freshman played by Kiernan Shipka. While the two young ladies wait for their parents to pick them up, they investigate strange noises around the building. Meanwhile, in a separate story line, a mysterious woman (Emma Roberts) races toward that same school. Perkins brings these pieces together for a gruesome final act, rooted in the idea that one bad choice in youth can haunt a person forever. (Read The New York Times's review.)
'Candyman' (1992)
Stream it here .
Based on a Clive Barker short story, this disquieting riff on urban legends has become a model for countless horror movies about supernatural monsters who emerge when their names are repeatedly called. Tony Todd plays the vengeful ghost of a man lynched by a racist mob. Virginia Madsen plays a grad student who traces the "Candyman" legend to a crime-ridden Chicago neighborhood, and inadvertently becomes the killer's accomplice. The British writer-director Bernard Rose offers some sly comments here on superstition and prejudice, in a complicated thriller with a sharp hook. (Read The New York Times's review.)
'Carrie' (1976)
Stream it here .
In the director Brian De Palma's gore-soaked adaptation of Stephen King's debut novel, "Carrie," Sissy Spacek plays a misfit telekinetic teen who gets bullied by her classmates at school and abused by her Bible-thumping mother at home. De Palma plays up the adolescent angst in the film's first half but cranks up the suspense in a shattering climax, which is set at a prom where a mean prank goes horribly awry. The innovative cinematic style -- involving split-screens and slow-motion -- gives this movie's frightening finale the feel of an inescapable nightmare. (Read The New York Times's review.)
'The Conjuring' (2013)
Stream it here .
The most dominant horror subgenre of the 2010s has been a relentless take on the haunted house picture, in which pleasant American families are tormented by objects and locations with tragic histories. The first film in the "Conjuring" franchise is one of the most effectively spooky of this lot, telling the loosely fact-based story of two paranormal investigators (played by Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson) who try to purge the ghosts from a Rhode Island farmhouse. A terrific cast (which also includes Ron Livingston and Lili Taylor) and the director James Wan's crafty deployment of jump-scares make this movie as entertaining as it is spine-tingling.

'Creep 2' (2017)
Stream it here .
"Creep" -- the first found-footage horror collaboration between the director Patrick Brice and his co-writer and star, Mark Duplass -- is also available on Netflix, and is deeply unsettling. But it's O.K. to jump straight to the superior "Creep 2," in which Desiree Akhavan plays a YouTuber named Sara who agrees to spend a day shooting video of a man who claims to be a prolific serial killer. Duplass plays Sara's subject, who may be lying for the sake of soaking up this young woman's attention ... or who may be luring her to her doom. (Read The New York Times's review.)
'The Eyes of My Mother' (2016)
Stream it here .
The writer-director Nicolas Pesce's short-but-stunning debut feature opens with a sequence of stomach-turning violence, as a nomadic psychopath terrorizes a farming family. What follows over the next hour is less visceral but is in some ways even more upsetting, as Pesce tells the story of a reclusive young woman (played by Kika Magalhaes) whose personality has been shaped by the horrors she witnessed as a girl. From its stark black-and-white imagery to its unflinching scenes of vivisection, this film is a sometimes strikingly beautiful study of a damaged soul, told with an unusual attention to visual texture.

'Hush' (2016)
Stream it here .
Netflix helped establish the reputation of the smart genre filmmaker Mike Flanagan by providing a home for several of his features, along with the acclaimed horror series "The Haunting of Hill House." Flanagan's most pulse-pounding film is the home-invasion thriller "Hush," co-written by his wife and leading lady, Kate Siegel. With minimal dialogue -- but dynamic sound design -- the movie follows a masked serial killer (John Gallagher Jr.) as he stalks a deaf-mute writer in a remote country house. By shifting perspectives, Flanagan cleverly keeps the audience on its toes -- and more aware than both the predator and his prey about what's happening. (Read The New York Times's review.)
'Scream' (1996)
Stream it here .
Here's a rarity: a slasher parody as terrifying as what it mocks. In "Scream," the director Wes Craven and the screenwriter Kevin Williamson affectionately pick at the clichés of the eternally popular "attractive teens get picked off by a costumed maniac" genre. The filmmakers set their violent murder-mystery among a group of hip high school students who know the "rules" of horror movies. This likable cast of youngsters keeps the film fun and energetic, making it all the more alarming each time the "Ghostface" killer strikes. (Read The New York Times's review.)
'Train to Busan' (2016)
Stream it here .
One of the more thoughtful and thematically rich films to emerge from the zombie glut, the South Korean post-apocalyptic action picture "Train to Busan" documents an epidemic of the undead right as it begins, as one infected passenger spurs an outbreak across a commuter train. What follows is an exciting monster movie. But like the similarly rail-bound "Snowpiercer," "Train to Busan" is also a commentary on how social divisions can hasten the breakdown of order, as passengers quickly condemn their fellow citizens to a misery that eventually consumes everyone.

'Under the Shadow' (2016)
Stream it here .
In the writer-director Babak Anvari's politically charged ghost story "Under the Shadow," a doctor's wife (played by Narges Rashidi) and her young daughter try to survive both missile attacks and an insidious evil spirit in a mid-1980s Tehran apartment building. The film starts as a character study about an educated woman who put her dreams aside to play house in a conservative religious society. By the final 20 minutes, when mother and child are all alone and being chased around their home by a demon, viewers understand that the world outside the heroine's door is in some ways as hostile as the one within.

'Under the Skin' (2014)
Stream it here .
Like an art-house deconstruction of "alien predator" science-fiction movies like "Alien" and "Predator," director Jonathan Glazer's adaptation of the Michel Faber novel "Under the Skin" stars Scarlett Johansson as a deadly hunter who uses her sex appeal to lure men into a bizarre extra-dimensional slaughterhouse. Glazer puts the audience in the anti-heroine's shoes, using a combination of gritty docu-realism and visual abstraction to illustrate what the world might look like to a curious creature who barely understands human behavior -- beyond what it takes to entrap her next meal. (Read The New York Times's review.)
'The Witch' (2016)
Stream it here .
Colonial America's lonely, haunted wilderness provides a backdrop for Robert Eggers's dark folk tale about a deeply religious farmer (played by Ralph Ineson) whose family destroys itself after a baby disappears. Unsure whether God is punishing them for their sins or a satanic cult is to blame, they are left to punish each other. Add a suspiciously alluring teenage daughter (played by Anya Taylor-Joy) and a possibly evil goat, and "The Witch" has all the right elements for a nerve-racking creepshow. (Read The New York Times's review.)
'Would You Rather' (2013)
Stream it here .
A sick spin on a popular party game, "Would You Rather" carries an idle thought experiment to its most wonderfully appalling extreme. When a group of cash-strapped folks accept a dinner invitation from an eccentric millionaire, they find themselves attempting gross, life-threatening dares. Will they slice open their own eyeballs? Hold firecrackers in their hands? Murder their fellow guests? In this provocative and wince-inducing shocker, the director David Guy Levy and the screenwriter Steffen Schlachtenhaufen expose the perversity of the American class system, which allows the decadent rich to buy the complicity of the needy.

Texto completo: Things have changed, they agreed, since President Bill Clinton's 1993 nomination of the justice was approved by a vote of 96 to 3.
WASHINGTON -- President Bill Clinton, who put Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court in 1993, joined the justice on Wednesday for a public conversation. So did Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state, who might have named Justice Ginsburg's eventual successor had she won the 2016 presidential election.
The conversation, at Georgetown University Law Center, focused on what the participants said was a radical change in federal judicial nominations. Mrs. Clinton, without naming names, said the Trump administration has been appointing unqualified judges.
"We've seen people largely chosen on the basis of age, and therefore longevity, and political ideology being pushed through despite having no relevant experience," she said. "Before the last several years people took seriously the selection of judges. Even if they were trying to find somebody who would get to the result they wanted, they wanted to be able to say that this was a distinguished lawyer, that this was a judge with experience."
By contrast, Mr. Clinton said, he was taken by Justice Ginsburg's career as a pathbreaking women's rights litigator when he was considering her for the Supreme Court. He said he was also struck by her forthrightness when they met in 1993 for an interview.
"I knew after about 10 minutes that I was going to give her the job," he said.
They discussed abortion, Mr. Clinton said. Justice Ginsburg, then a federal appeals court judge, had been critical of aspects of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that established a constitutional right to abortion.
The Supreme Court had moved too fast, Justice Ginsburg wrote in 1992. It would have sufficed, she wrote, to strike down the extreme Texas law at issue in the case and then proceed in measured steps in later cases to consider other abortion restrictions.
Mr. Clinton said Judge Ginsburg talked freely about all of this. "She made a heck of a case," he said. "We were just two people alone, and she was telling me what she honestly thought."
He recalled thinking, he said, that "this woman is completely on the level."
Justice Ginsburg, now 86, was 60 when she was nominated. "Some people thought I was too old for the job," she said. "Now I'm into my 27th year on the court and am one of the longest-tenured justices. So if you worried about my age, it was unnecessary."
Justice Ginsburg's appearance with the Clintons was part of her remarkably busy public schedule since the Supreme Court announced in August that she had been treated for pancreatic cancer.
That was Justice Ginsburg's fourth brush with cancer, after surgery in December to remove two malignant nodules from her left lung, surgery for early-stage pancreatic cancer in 2009 and treatment for colon cancer in 1999.
Some liberals had hoped she would retire under President Barack Obama, but she stayed on, indicating that she expected a Democrat to succeed him.
"I think it's going to be another Democratic president," Justice Ginsburg told The Washington Post in 2013. "The Democrats do fine in presidential elections; their problem is they can't get out the vote in the midterm elections."
President Trump, whose election proved her wrong, has been critical of Justice Ginsburg, saying in 2016 that "her mind is shot" and suggesting that she resign. His sharp words came after Justice Ginsburg criticized Mr. Trump in a series of interviews. She later said she had made a mistake in publicly commenting on a candidate and promised to be more "circumspect" in the future.
In 1993, she was confirmed by a vote of 96 to 3. "Our Senate was working the way it should and the way I hope it will again in my lifetime," Justice Ginsburg said on Wednesday.
Mrs. Clinton said one thing had surprised her in the intervening years. "I always knew Justice Ginsburg would be a great Supreme Court justice," she said. "I did not know she would be a really popular cultural icon."
Mrs. Clinton said she had given her husband "The R.B.G. Workout," a book on the justice's exercise routine.
Both Clintons said they had completed the workout, but at a cost. "It was a problem," Mr. Clinton said. "It was a real struggle."

Apple Forecast Is Upbeat as Profit Falls

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO -- Apple said on Wednesday that its profit shrank for the fourth consecutive quarter -- the longest such streak since 2016 -- but it forecast that better days were ahead.
The tech giant said its profit fell 3.1 percent to $ 13.69 billion in the latest quarter, from $ 14.13 billion a year ago, largely because of continued declines in iPhone sales. Yet the results beat analysts' expectations and were quickly cheered by investors because of indications that its new iPhone models would be a hit.
Apple reported a 9 percent fall in iPhone sales in the quarter, smaller than the declines in other recent quarters. More important, the company said it expected strong sales in the current holiday quarter -- news that seemed to confirm Wall Street expectations that people like the iPhones introduced last month.
Apple also showed signs of recovery in China, a crucial market where the company had struggled for months. After a drop in sales of roughly 20 percent in the region over the previous nine months, Apple said sales there were down 2.4 percent in the last quarter.
The results suggested that the issues causing Apple's business to shrink in China and elsewhere in recent months had been resolved -- or at least temporarily patched.
Apple had blamed some of its struggles in China on the country's slowing economy and its trade war with the United States. Luca Maestri, Apple's finance chief, said in an interview on Wednesday that those issues were subsiding.
"These trade tensions have not been helpful to the Chinese economy and to our business, and we think that as you've seen from our results, the peak of those tensions were at the beginning of the year," he said.
Apple got off to a rocky start this year when it cut revenue forecasts because of slow sales in China, prompting a sharp sell-off of its stock. Since then, Apple's financials have improved and its market value has rebounded. Apple shares rose about 2 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday.
"The company is still benefiting from low expectations, from when they set the bar really low" in January, said Tom Forte, an analyst at D.A. Davidson. "And since then, they've been telling a different story, which is that they're pivoting to be less dependent on the iPhone."
Apple became a $ 1 trillion company on the back of the iPhone, one of history's most successful products. But as the smartphone market became saturated, Apple increased iPhone prices to keep growing.
The strategy worked for a time. But as prices went up, sales of new phones slowed, particularly in markets like China. In recent months, Apple has propped up iPhone sales in places like China with price cuts and financing.
Apple's latest iPhones -- the iPhone 11 family -- seem to be bucking the trend. The latest quarter represents just nine days of sales of the iPhone 11, but the drop in iPhone sales were lower than in the previous three quarters. "It's obviously a bit early," Mr. Maestri said. "But the initial signs are very positive."
Apple's overall revenue increased 1.8 percent to $ 64 billion in the quarter ending in September. Apple predicted $ 85.5 billion to $ 89.5 billion in revenue for the current quarter, compared with $ 84.3 billion a year prior.
Many analysts had increased their estimates for iPhone sales in recent weeks after certain signs, including reports from factories in China, suggested that demand for the new phones was strong. Analysts attributed some of that success to Apple's decisions with the latest phones, including dropping the price of its flagship phone while adding an additional camera lens to its higher-end models.
Apple has made up for the declines in iPhone sales with growth in other areas, such as wearable devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, as well as its business of selling apps and other services like music and news.
Wearables revenue grew by 54 percent to $ 6.5 billion and services revenue increased by 18 percent to $ 12.5 billion in the quarter. Apple is trying to bolster that business with a gaming service introduced last month and a streaming service set to start on Friday.

Never Forget: A Look at the Legacy and Work of Congressman John Conyers, Jr. a Political Legend

Texto completo: When the legendary actor, playwright, and producer Ossie Davis delivered the eulogy for Malcolm X on a cold February day 54 years ago, he spoke movingly of Malcolm's commitment to the uplift of the race.
Davis lauded the Black Muslim leader's uncompromising demand that black men and women; "Afro-Americans" as he demanded to be called, be respected and treated fairly and with dignity on our terms, not anyone else's.
"Malcolm was our manhood, our living, black manhood! This was his meaning to his people. And, in honoring him, we honor the best in ourselves," Davis exclaimed.
Now, nearly six decades later, another legendary African American leader, Detroiter, and contemporary of Malcolm X has departed. And like Malcolm, the late Congressman John Conyers Jr., was uncompromising in his blackness and demand for fairness, equity, and respect within the political process.
And by recognizing his importance to the advancement of people of color in the United States and all over the world; including South Africa where he played a critically important role in dismantling apartheid and freeing the late South African freedom fighter, Nobel-Prize winner and President, Nelson Mandela, we also honor ourselves.
The fact is, other than former President Barack Obama, John Conyers Jr. was arguably the most influential African American politician of the late 20thcentury. Having won office in 1964, he was the longest-serving African American congress-person in the history of the United States and was consistently among the most progressive politicians in Washington, D.C.
According to The New York Times:
Worked with Senators Edward M. Kennedy and Howard H. Baker in the 1960s and defeated legislation to undo Supreme Court decisions requiring congressional districts in any state to have roughly equal populations.
In 1968 days after the the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. began a long and ultimately successful effort to make Dr. King's birthday a national holiday, which was declared in 1983.
In 1970 began a long campaign for a government-run, single-payer system of national health insurance and he proposed banning private ownership of handguns after assassination attempts against President Gerald R. Ford.
In the 1980s Mr. Conyers opposed the Reagan administration's missile defense plans and its policy of "constructive engagement" with the apartheid regime in South Africa. He criticized the death penalty and began a series of hearings on police the brutality that angered New York's mayors, Ed Koch in 1983 and Rudolph W. Giuliani in 1997. But he also worked to create and enlarge federal death benefits for police officers and firefighters who died in the line of duty.
The newspaper also noted that throughout his 53 years in Congress, Conyers had more than a 90 percent lifetime rating from the liberal watchdog group American for Democratic Action.
Distilled to its essence, that simply meant Conyers remained consistent in his strong support for social, economic and racial justice, regardless of who was president. Unlike many of his fellow Democrats, he never felt the need tone down such basic demands for equality even as many white Americans grew weary of African American demands for equal rights and justice.
Indeed, right in his backyard, in Macomb County, an the entire population of white voters came to symbolize white voter backlash and resentment to the gains of African Americans during the height of the civil rights movement. They began demanding white politicians oppose such fundamental rights as integration, Black voting rights, affirmative action, criminal justice reform, and even labor rights although though many of these same voters were working-class and union members themselves.
By 1972 enough white voters in the Michigan Democratic Primary in Michigan voted for arch-segregationist and racist George Wallace that he won the primary. Eight years later they voted for Republican Ronald Reagan - whose views on race were only marginally more moderate - and who deliberately opened his 1980 presidential campaign in Philadelphia, Mississippi calling for "state's rights" where three civil rights worker were murdered in cold blood for registering
Black Americans to vote.
These people came to be known as Reagan Democrats and were slavishly catered to by Republicans and many Democrats, often at the expense of their most loyal voters, African Americans. They were so influential, that many of the hardest fought civil rights victories became imperiled as these white voters mobilized to vote for far-right politicians on a state and federal level and who subsequently have viciously gone after minority voting rights, affirmative action in education and the workforce, and even efforts at equal access to healthcare.
Thus, to understand John Conyers Jr. is to understand that he came into Congress fighting for the most basic rights of African Americans in Detroit, Michigan, and the entire country. And for years was one of only a small handful of Black congresspeople battling racism on all fronts. He even co-founded the Congressional Black Caucus to help those few Black congresspeople to leverage their power.
As the racial backlash to Black progress metastasized and spread throughout Congress and the federal courts, Conyers remained committed to the cause of social and racial justice; even as he grew elderly, would become harassed by allegations of personal improprieties and eventually feel betrayed by many of those he thought were allies.
"John Conyers was much bigger, much larger than the CBC that he founded which subsequently has fallen into political disrepair, said Sam Riddle a close family friend and consultant to the congressman. "For decades he was not just the Black congressman for Detroit, he was forced to be the congressman for Black America because we only had a handful of black congresspeople any-where."
He ended leaving Congress in 2017 under a cloud following several accusations of his sexually harassing female subordinates. Conyers adamantly rejected such allegations but lost the confidence of the Democratic leadership in the House of Representatives.
Riddle, who is also the host of the popular Detroit radio talk show Riddle at Random on 910 am said during his tenure, Conyers was able to get more things done with a simple phone call than most politicians today with all their social media platforms and press people.
"John Conyers believed in the law of the land while understanding the importance of civil disobedience," Riddle said. "He introduced Jesse Jackson to Dr. Martin Luther King. We have to look at his serving for over a half a century and as a Korean War vet. You can't just dismiss that over spurious allegations."
Regardless of where you come down on Conyers personal behavior, one thing can never be denied, John Conyers Jr., for all of his career carried the torch of justice for Black folks in the United States and all over the world. He never gave up on the struggle even in the face of white backlash and personal turmoil.
If the meaning of Malcolm X was to recognize that he represented our manhood to the nation. Then John Conyers Jr. represented our citizenship to this nation. And he fought every single day of his life, to ensure it was valued by this nation.

Texto completo: BY MATT O'BRIEN
The Associated Press
BOSTON - Concert promoters in the U.S. are stepping back from plans to scan festivalgoers with facial recognition technology, after musicians and others gave it some serious side-eye.
Although it remains entirely possible that music venues will eventually take a second look at the controversial technology.
Live-entertainment giants AEG Presents and Live Nation both recently disavowed any plans to use facial recognition at music festivals, despite earlier indications to the contrary. Their public pronouncements have led a group of musicians to declare victory after a months-long campaign to halt the technology's use at live shows.
Advances in computer vision have enabled businesses to install cameras that can recognize individuals by their face or other biometric characteristics. Venue operators have talked about using the technology at gateways to secure entry for select groups or to offer perks for repeat customers.
Privacy advocates worry that such uses might also pave the way for greater intrusions, such as scanning audience members to analyze their behavior.
Both concert organizations seemed to be edging toward remembering more faces. AEG, which operates the Coachella festival in southern California and other major events, updated its online privacy policy earlier this year with language stating that it may collect facial images at its events and venues for "access control," creating aggregate data or for "personalization."
Now, however, both organizations have done an about-face. AEG's chief operating officer for festivals, Melissa Ormond, emailed activists earlier this month to say: "AEG festivals do not use facial recognition technology and do not have plans to implement." AEG confirmed that statement this week but declined further comment.
Live Nation said in a statement that "we do not currently have plans to deploy facial recognition technology at our clients' venues." The company insisted that any future use would be "strictly opt-in," so that non-consenting fans won't have to worry about potentially facing the music.
Facial recognition isn't seen in many musical venues. The biggest location known to employ it is New York City's Madison Square Garden, which confirmed this week that facial recognition is one of the security measures it uses "to ensure the safety of everyone" in the arena. It declined to say what it looks at and why. The New York Times first reported its use last year.
While the music industry paused, Major League Baseball stole a base by rolling out biometric ticketing in the U.S., usually involving fingerprints or iris scans to get into ballparks. Authorities in some parts of Europe have bounced around the idea of using either facial or voice recognition to keep tabs on unruly soccer fans, such as those participating in racist chants. Police agencies in China have used facial recognition at concerts featuring pop singer Jacky Cheung to identify and arrest people wanted as criminal suspects.
American music event promoters this fall have been pressured to disclose their facial recognition plans by digital rights group Fight for the Future, which asked dozens of festival organizers to pledge not to use a technology it describes as invasive and racially biased.
Rage Against The Machine guitarist Tom Morello co-authored an opinion column in BuzzFeed last week that described the pledge as the "first major blow to the spread of commercial facial recognition in the United States."
The CEO of Blink Identity says opposition to its Ticketmaster partnership is misguided.
"They're talking about mass surveillance," said Mary Haskett, who co-founded the Austin, Texas startup. "We're against mass surveillance.... Nobody's talking about doing what they're protesting against."
Haskett said Blink's system allows concertgoers to opt in by taking selfies with their phones, which the company transforms into mathematical representations and deletes. The system might offer access to a shorter line or a VIP section.
But protesting musicians fear their fans' mugshots could still end up in the hands of law enforcement or immigration authorities.
"Of course it's going to be used by security," said Joey La Neve DeFrancesco, a guitarist for Rhode Island punk band Downtown Boys, which played Coachella in 2017. "Of course it's going to be used by law enforcement."
Punk rockers aren't the only ones fixing the technology with a death stare. A June survey by the Pew Research Center found that while people are generally accepting of facial recognition used by police, only 36% said they trust tech companies to deploy it responsibly. Just 18% trust advertisers.

Texto completo: For childhood trauma, we need much more than the resilience advised by the keynote speaker at the recent Behavioral Health Community Forum. Though she pointed out that causes of trauma included racism and poverty, she left out other important factors. When a mother gets riled up because she is about to be evicted again, do we just give her a tranquilizer? When a child whose parents are stressed by continually shifting schedules throws tantrums at school, do we just get him some counseling?
Lets not lose sight of the systemic problems. How about encouraging local employers to stop unpredictable scheduling and have social service agencies devote more time and money to making sure families have a stable place to live? As the Shift Project found, hourly workers described going hungry, not being able to pay bills, scrambling to arrange child care, losing housing, losing sleep and feeling stressed and unhealthy. Unpredictable schedules were a major predictor of hardships. Parental stress affects the children who are much more likely to exhibit anxiety, guilt or sadness than children of parents with stable schedules. Such children are prone to destroy things and have tantrums (New York Times, Oct. 16).
Lets help those who have experienced adverse childhood events by all means! But lets not see this as just a question of improving the family dynamics, but also as a systemic societal issue that has public policy dimensions we might address. We need to find ways to reduce the stressors, not just helped the stressed!

Betrayed, Kurds still helped find Baghdadi

Texto completo: For Bloomberg News
One could be forgiven for concluding that the widespread national security panic following President Donald Trump’s abrupt withdrawal of U.S. forces from northeastern Syria was overstated.
As that withdrawal was happening, we now know, U.S. special forces were homing in on the location of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Islamic State’s leader and founder, in al-Qaida controlled territory near the Turkish border. Trump himself said the intelligence that led to his capture came together in those fateful weeks as Kurds and Turks briefly fought and dozens of Islamic State prisoners escaped.
What’s more remarkable is that as the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces concluded that they were being betrayed by Trump, they nonetheless continued to track al-Baghdadi and work closely with their U.S. counterparts in the operation that killed him.
Kurdish spies began to focus on al-Baghdadi’s location last spring, after the last Islamic State stronghold in Syria fell. “We began to investigate the presence of Baghdadi, where he was located, in March,” said Ilham Ahmed, the president of the Syrian Democratic Council, in an interview Sunday.
“Our intelligence units were always following his movements. They were in a high-level coordination with American intelligence.”
Ahmed said the chaos of the initial Turkish invasion did not stop Kurdish spies in the anti-terrorism unit of the Syrian Democratic Forces from continuing to gather and analyze information gleaned about Baghdadi’s location. The New York Times reported that the initial tip about al-Baghdadi’s location came in the summer, following the arrest of one of his couriers and one of his wives.
Ahmed is now in Washington to make the case for repairing a partnership that frayed dramatically after the Turkish army invaded that region earlier this month. Despite Trump’s public comments that he sees no reason why U.S. forces should stand between Kurdish fighters and the Turkish army, Ahmed said she hopes Trump will use America’s vast political and economic leverage to deter Turkey from trying to resettle the 3 million Syrian Arab refugees in historically Kurdish areas.
For now, she said, the Syrian Kurds have received guarantees from Russia to protect some 2 million Kurdish civilians in the area from the Turkish army and allied Islamist militias. She finds this Russian assurance cold comfort. The Kurds would prefer U.S. protection, she said, but “this is our only option.”
Part of the new arrangement for Syria’s Kurds means they will have to rely on Syrian regime forces to provide protection. This is particularly dangerous in light of recent Syrian history. Syrian leader Bashar Assad’s father, Hafez al-Assad, launched campaigns to cleanse Syria of Kurds.
And while there has been a pause in the Turkish-Kurdish war in the last week, Ahmed is still deeply worried about the long-term prospects of the Kurdish people. She still wants the U.S. to play a role in the Syrian peace process, she said, and to defend Kurdish autonomy within Syria. “America promised us support for negotiations with the Syrian government,” she said. “They should keep that promise.”
The Syrian Kurds have kept their promise. They have continued to assist the U.S. war against Islamic State, even as they had to seek protection from Russia. The least the U.S. can do now is to use its remaining leverage to deter Turkey — and to advocate for an autonomous Kurdish region in Syria.

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO -- WhatsApp sued the Israeli cybersurveillance firm NSO Group in federal court on Tuesday, claiming the company's spy technology was used on the popular messaging service in a wide-ranging campaign targeting journalists and human-rights activists.
WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, claimed in the lawsuit that an NSO Group program that was intended to piggyback on WhatsApp was used to spy on more than 1,400 people in 20 countries.
The lawsuit did not say who was using NSO Group technology to target WhatsApp users. But the area codes for a number of phones that had been attacked indicated a focus on people in Mexico, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates.
The filing of the lawsuit, believed to be the first by a tech company against a for-profit digital surveillance company, could be the "beginning of the end" of the rapid and largely unregulated adoption of these surveillance technologies, said John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab.
WhatsApp worked closely with Citizen Lab, a research group affiliated with the University of Toronto that aids victims of digital surveillance, in its investigation of the attacks, which took place from April to May.
The messaging service said the victims included 100 journalists, prominent female leaders, several people who had been targeted with unsuccessful assassination attempts, political dissidents and human rights activists -- as well as their families.
The suit was filed in the United States District Court in the Northern District of California. NSO Group, which sells its surveillance technology to governments all over the world, said in a statement Tuesday that it disputed the claims in the WhatsApp lawsuit in the "strongest possible terms" and "will vigorously fight them."
NSO Group added that its technology was used by intelligence and law enforcement agencies in lawful antiterrorism efforts and crime-fighting, and it "has helped to save thousands of lives over recent years."
The investigation started after Citizen Lab charged that NSO Group's technology had been used to exploit a WhatsApp security hole to hack the phone of a London lawyer. The hole was patched in May.
The lawyer had represented several plaintiffs in lawsuits that accused NSO Group of providing tools to hack the phones of a Saudi Arabian dissident living in Canada, a Qatari citizen and a group of Mexican journalists and activists. He contacted Citizen Lab.
The researchers said they discovered that NSO technology left digital crumbs that helped them uncover the spy campaign. The weakness: Whoever was using the NSO Group hacking tools had to place a WhatsApp call to their target. Even if the target did not pick up the phone, NSO's technology would become embedded in the phone and provide access to all of its contents.
The missed calls, however, tipped off the lawyer, he told The New York Times.
After WhatsApp patched the security hole, NSO employees lamented that the company closed off a major espionage channel. An NSO employee even told a WhatsApp employee in a message: "You just closed our biggest remote for cellular," according to the WhatsApp complaint.
Citizen Lab and WhatsApp would not name the individuals targeted, citing privacy policies.
WhatsApp said in a statement that it was informing affected customers with special WhatsApp messages. The company is seeking a permanent injunction to block NSO from its service, and called on lawmakers to ban the use of cyberweapons like those sold by NSO Group to governments.
"This should serve as a wake-up call for technology companies, governments and all internet users," Will Cathcart, the head of WhatsApp, wrote in an opinion article in The Washington Post on Tuesday. "Tools that enable surveillance into our private lives are being abused and the proliferation of this technology into the hands of irresponsible companies and governments puts us all at risk."
Mr. Cathcart also urged technology firms to join a call from the United Nations special rapporteur, David Kaye, for an immediate moratorium on the sale, transfer and use of dangerous spyware.
NSO Group is one of dozens of digital spy outfits that provide technology to track everything a target does on a smartphone. Its spyware allows governments to track the location, communications, contacts and web activities of targets. But such access can be easily abused.
NSO Group has said in the past that it limits the sale of hacking tools to governments with poor human-rights records, but it has little insight into how its tools are used once they are in government hands. The company has said it only learns and investigates cases of abuse when they surface in the media.
NSO Group's technology has repeatedly been discovered on the phones of civilians.
In 2017, The Times helped uncover the use of NSO spyware on journalists, dissidents and consumer rights activists in Mexico. Since then, the spyware has been uncovered on the phone of the wife of a murdered Mexican journalist and, last year, on the phone of a close confidant of Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist whose murder was linked by United States intelligence services to the Saudi Arabian government.
The WhatsApp complaint that was filed on Tuesday claims that NSO Group is closer to the deployment of its spyware than it portrays to the public. WhatsApp traced several servers that deployed NSO's spyware back to internet addresses operated directly by NSO Group. The company leased servers -- including servers in the United States -- from Amazon and two other cloud services called Choopa and Quadranet, to help deploy its spyware, the lawsuit said.
Amazon did not return a request for comment.
Since NSO Group was founded in 2011, its spy technology, called Pegasus, has become the preferred mobile spy tool of many governments. An early NSO commercial proposal leaked to The Times claimed Pegasus could overcome encryption to grant "unlimited access" to everything on a target's mobile device.
"Pegasus silently deploys invisible software on the target device," the company's early pitch read. "Installation is performed remotely over-the-air, does not require any action from or engagement with the target and leaves no trace whatsoever on the device."
For years, commercial spyware makers have been unregulated, in part because governments are the clients.
"They get close to governments and when those governments do bad things with their products, commercial spyware companies can claim it's not their fault," said Mr. Scott-Railton, of Citizen Lab.
Earlier this year, Novalpina Capital, a private equity firm, acquired a stake in NSO Group. The firm has been trying to help NSO Group polish its image, highlighting the use of its technology in notable crime fighting, like the arrest of Joaquín Guzmán, the drug cartel leader known as El Chapo.
Stephen Peel, Novalpina Capital's founding partner, said in a letter to human rights groups that the company was determined to make sure its technology was used for "the prevention of harm to fundamental human rights arising from terrorism and serious crime," and not abused.
But Citizen Lab said in a statement that it had repeatedly raised questions to Novalpina about whether its public statements about human rights compliance made any difference, given how frequently NSO's spyware had been abused.

Texto completo: I have a friend I’ve never met in person. She is one of my dearest friends, and would immediately fit in with all my friends in Cheyenne. I began corresponding with her four years ago, via email, and something just clicked between us.
She is Sy Montgomery, a New York Times bestselling author. She writes about wild, and not so wild, animals, and travels all over the world to do so. Her bestseller about her pet pig, Christopher Hogwood, who grew to more than 700 pounds, is hilarious and endearing. Reading “The Good, Good Pig” was probably sufficient unto itself, but I was highly motivated to continue reading Sy’s books.
I cannot remember the order in which I read them, but my two favorite books by Sy are “Journey of the Pink Dolphins” and “Spell of the Tiger.”
The pink dolphins live in the mysterious Amazon River, which is actually two rivers that don’t combine; one is brown, and one is blue. There is a high degree of mythology that the people who live beside the river impart to the pink dolphins. It is said they take on the form of a man and join humans along the riverbank, seducing a woman and taking her to live with them under the water. That’s a dizzily marvelous piece of mythology; it would be wonderful to know how it came to be. Do people from the villages actually disappear?
At the end of this book, Sy actually got to swim with the dolphins at the mouth of the Amazon River. I told her that the book should have ended with her permanently swimming with them, and she said that if the book is ever made into a movie that is the way she imagines ending it, too!
“Spell of the Tiger” is terrifying – and funny, too. The subtitle is “The Man-Eaters of Sundarbans.” Sundarbans is the largest tidal delta in the world. From Wikipedia, I learned the following:
The Sundarbans is a mangrove area in the delta formed by the confluence of Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers in the Bay of Bengal. It spans from the Hooghly River in India’s state of West Bengal to the Baleswar River in Bangladesh. It comprises closed and open mangrove forests, agriculturally used land, mudflats and barren land, and is intersected by multiple tidal streams and channels.
It is here that tigers hunt and kill people, not just on land, but in the water, as well.
I said that the book is funny, too. It is undoubtedly a conundrum that a book about man-eating tigers could be funny, but the red tape Sy encountered in getting access to the Sundarbans reminded me of Major Major in the book and movie “Catch-22.” The “catch” was that if someone went to Major Major’s office, and Major Major was in his office, the person wanting to see him was told that the Major was out. If Major was out of his office, the person was told he was in.
And that’s what the bureaucracy in Calcutta was like for Sy and her companion. After waiting for hours to meet someone in the Forestry Department, they were finally “seen” by someone who totally ignored them and read a newspaper instead.
It struck me as funny, and I felt guilty for laughing about a passage in a book about man-eating tigers. Sy assured me it was meant to be funny, and that she was glad I “got” it.
But I didn’t really get the gist of the book until weeks later. It was one of those “aha” moments! I recently gave a copy of this book to a friend to see if he would also find the hidden message of this book. It’s not a spoiler for you to know it ahead of time, but it is a magnificent reward to find it yourself. If you really want to know what it is before you read the book, email me, and I’ll tell you the message.
It took me years to find this soulmate of mine, but we traveled along similar paths, although mine was through books and hers was through doing. Years before I met Sy through her books, we both developed a love for octopuses. I bought a paperback book about these gentle, intelligent creatures, only to find out that Sy had written a blurb for its hardback edition and knew the author. I bought another book about Kanzi, the bonobo chimp who taught himself how to verbally interact with people using symbols, and told Sy about it; she replied that she knew all about Kanzi.
She is friendly and witty and funny. I also have a preoccupation with spiders (I had a cat-faced spider living above my back door all last summer), and I jokingly said to Sy, “What are the odds? Spiders and octopuses?” She replied, “I’d say about 8 to 1!”
I have tried and failed to meet with her, but I may have another opportunity in June when I travel with a friend who is attending a college reunion. The reunion is in Middlebury, Vermont, and Sy lives in Hancock, New Hampshire, a distance of less than 150 miles.
Even if all I get to do is hug her while crying tears of joy to be finally meeting her in person, the extra miles will be worth it.

To better understand what is currently motivating rock star billionaires (such as Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates, Marc Benioff of Salesforce and Tom Steyer of Farallon), organizations like the Business Roundtable and the lower-class of just millionaires (Patriotic Millionaires) to save capitalism, it might be helpful to use an analogy.
Imagine there is an ocean liner, like the Titanic, going too fast in ice berg strewn waters surrounded by fog. The first-class passengers are enjoying every luxury, while those in steerage are miserable and sea sick in the lowest decks.
SEE ALSO: How a New AI Breakthrough Could Undermine the Finance Industry
An experienced seaman in steerage understands the ship is going too fast. However, he is not allowed out of the lower deck. His voice does not matter. In first class, some knowledgeable yachtsmen also know disaster could be imminent. Unlike the seaman, they can summon the captain and make their concerns known. They alone can prevent disaster.
Ray Dalio has written a series of articulate articles on inequity. Warren Buffett has long called for a tax structure not tilted to the ultra-wealthy. Marc Benioff just declared capitalism “dead” in a New York Times op-ed, and the Patriotic Millionaires have banded together to pay more taxes!
As the crisis of capitalism grows in America, the titans of industry, technology and finance know the ship is in danger, and they, in order to save themselves, want to change course. Not surprising, since self-preservation is near the top of Maslow’s hierarchy list. If it were only the left-wing progressives who were concerned, it would be construed as partisan politics. However, serious economists on the right, like David Stockman (former Reagan budget director), have raised the alarm. Stockman’s bestselling doorstopper of a book, The Great Deformation: The Corruption of Capitalism in America , is chilling reading on how off-track our economy is.
If you have not read The Communist Manifesto , you should. It’s short, more of a pamphlet than a book. However, its description of late-stage capitalism is so prescient, so accurate, as to be unnerving. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engel’s depiction of the Lumpenproletariat , the impoverished class capitalism created in England’s 19th century, mirrors today’s homeless, opioid-addicted and incarcerated masses to a T. Our society’s economic inequality and resultant anger is exactly as The Manifesto chillingly predicted.
Marx’s basic belief was that capitalism would destroy itself by creating the conditions wherein workers would no longer feel they had a stake in the game and so would revolt. Marx may have been off in his prescription (communism) for what ails the world, but as an economic diagnostician, he has few equals.
As countless books, including both The Economists’ Hour and Capitalism, Alone , tell us, a myriad of familiar factors got us here: rising inequality in which the top 0.1% in America own more wealth than the bottom 90%; the loss of millions of middle-class jobs to off-shore manufacturing and automation; the relentless rise in education costs (and the resultant debtor class of millennials); the rise of corporate monopolies that force governments to give them huge tax breaks (corporate welfare); high housing costs; medical costs, including unexpected hospitalizations, leaving 43 million Americans with debt, resulting in more bankruptcies than any other factor.
The 2008 economic crisis seems to have been the breaking point. Bank bailouts plus job and home losses attributed to Wall Street greed and stupidity created a political backlash against capitalism. President Donald Trump, Senator Bernie Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren have all called for an end, in one form or another, to the “rigged system.”
There is the perception that Buffett or Steyer have credibility when they call for reform. Benioff, in his op-ed, is not manning the ramparts or threatening to tear down the walls of the temple of wealth. He’s just saying he worries the country will not be safe for him, or anyone, if there is not real economic change.
Why would he and other billionaires think that? For one, they are well traveled. They’ve seen up-close what wealth disparity does to societies in Asia and Latin America, where, for example, bodyguards take elite kids to school. They’ve been greeted at five-star restaurants in Jakarta by security guards, packing serious heat. They know no one will be safe if we go down the road of $50 million mansions in the sky (Manhattan’s 57th St., anyone?) while blocks away is public housing with perennially broken elevators and urine-reeking stairwells.
Every month seems to bring a new convert to the “Billionaires for Social Justice Club.” Take the Roundtable, that citadel of corporate capitalism, which recently announced “shareholders” (i.e., stock owners) would be replaced by “stakeholders” (i.e., the larger community) as the receivers of corporate profits! In essence, the Roundtable, with a wave of a recommendation wand, just re-classified the entire S&P (70-80% of all listed companies) as “Certified B” corporations.
When the billionaires are worrying about economic injustice… it must be getting pretty bad.

There's a piece of Delaware in New Jersey

Texto completo: The Delaware River is the official border between the First State and New Jersey, right?
Yes and no.
Unbeknownst to many residents, the two states actually share two land borders, one of which is nearly 2 miles long.
Not only does Delaware own a small chunk of Artificial Island, where the Hope Creek Nuclear Power Plant is, but there's a weird swath of land just outside Pennsville, New Jersey, that belongs to the Diamond State.
The entire thing is only about 580 acres, but it and rights to the nearby Delaware River have been the subject of not one, but three U.S. Supreme Court cases, the most recent of which concluded in 2008.
Local residents call it "The Point" or "The Baja."
"It's weird, and it has been weird for a long time," Pennsville Mayor Robert McDade said of property's existence. "Most people wouldn't even know that it's out there."
So why is the tiny piece of land such a big deal? And why does it exist in the first place?
The answers to both questions are surprisingly complex.
How was the border established? The answer to the second question, which we'll tackle first, lies with Delaware's northern border, which is curved instead of a straight line.
Its existence dates from a deed to William Penn from the Duke of York on Aug. 24, 1682, which granted Penn all the land west of the Delaware River within a 12-mile compass circle beginning at the courthouse in New Castle.
Unlike other territorial boundaries, however, where rivers are essentially split in half between two states, the deed gave Penn rights to the entire waterway up to the low-tide mark on the east side.
Originally, that also gave Delaware ownership of a marshy wetland just outside Pennsville, which was designated a federally protected bird habitat in the 1930s.
It was called Killcohook National Wildlife Refuge.
But then, in the first part of the 20th century, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began dredging the river and depositing silt at Killcohoook, eventually turning it into solid land.
Tim Boyle, a spokesman for the Corps, said the process took several decades.
Dredging helps keep the river deep enough for shipping traffic, and during and after World War II preserving nature took second priority to finding an easy place to dump silt and mud, according to The News Journal's archives.
The wetland was transformed into fields of tall plume grass and dusty hills, and Killcohook's status as a refuge was revoked in 1998. Conservationists cried foul and raised concerns about chemicals and pollution from the mounded dredge spoils.
Thousands of geese, mallards, ducks, teal and pheasants were replaced by empty beer bottles and junked cars. On a recent Thursday, the only sound one could hear at The Baja was that of the wind racing through invasive phragmites, a species of reed that crowds out native vegetation.
The New York Times, which wrote about the dredge-spoil dumping in 1985, said the failed wildlife area was perhaps one of New Jersey's "ugliest ecological secrets."
Ownership and management of Killcohook was "a real ball of wax," the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service told the newspaper.
The land is part of Delaware, is owned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and has been managed as hunting grounds by wildlife agencies in both New Jersey and Delaware.
"It was a bastard within the national wildlife system," an official later told The News Journal in 1998. "It really has been kicked back and forth between its parents."
Today, Boyle said the land isn't used for anything specific. McDade, Pennsville's mayor, said dredge spoils are still routinely dumped there.
The Army Corps of Engineers has since become more environmentally conscious and uses dredge spoils to create or restore wildlife habitats, replenish beaches and more, according to its website.
What were the court cases about? New Jersey has long argued that the small strip of land created by dredging shouldn't be Delaware's in the first place.
There have been three Supreme Court cases between the two states over its ownership and rights to the Delaware River.
The first was resolved in 1905 with a compact between the two states that addressed fishing rights but didn't define the border. The second lawsuit, in 1934, concluded that Deleware owned "the river and the subaqueous soil" up to the low tide mark.
A third case in 2007 was sparked by a liquid natural gas plant. In 2005, a fight erupted between the two states over British Petroleum's then-proposal to build a $500 million LNG import facility just across the river from Claymont.
Under the plan, New Jersey would have built a delivery pier that jutted into Delaware's territorial waters. While New Jersey saw jobs and economic development, Delawareans feared potential explosions of the condensed fuel.
In 2006, Sen. Harris McDowell, D-Wilmington, co-sponsored a bill, likely in jest, that would have authorized then-Gov. Ruth Ann Miner to send the Delaware National Guard across the river to physically block construction of the port's bulkheads and piers.
New Jersey jokingly threatened to bring the Battleship New Jersey down.
By 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court intervened, ruling that Delaware's laws could, in fact, prevent the plan from progressing.
No man's land While Delaware hasn't ceded the small strip of land outside Pennsville to New Jersey, it has relied on the other state to help maintain order there.
It's a bit of a no man's land, referred to by some local residents as "The Baja," Pennsville police Chief Allen J. Cummings said. He's not sure what inspired the nickname but said it's been referred to as that since he was a kid.
In the past, New Jersey police had no jurisdiction over the property, which means people would go there to commit crimes, according to a 1990 Baltimore Sun story.
Teens could do drugs and drink there without fear of arrest.
Then, in 1987, Pennsville police found the body of a 45-year-old hunter who had been shot in the head.
The department had to call Delaware coroner's office to pick up the body because no one in New Jersey was authorized to do it. The man was only 10 feet over the state line, authorities said.
The death, which was eventually ruled a suicide, highlighted jurisdictional issues over the land. Eventually, the two states agreed that the Pennsville Police Department could enforce laws on the property.
That doesn't mean Cummings and his officers patrol The Baja, the police chief said. They only go out there if they get a call about something.
"We've had a few fatalities up there, kids on four-wheelers or motorcycles or dirtbikes," Cummings said.
The mayor said for a time, after word got out that the land was a good place for off-roading, people were coming from nearby states like Pennsylvania with big trailers full of ATVs.
Accesses to the property are blocked off by iron gates, but they can be circumvented by small recreational vehicles, Cummings said. There are fewer off-road vehicles now, thanks to enforcement efforts, but teens likely still use the area to party.
Even so, it's better than it used to be when he was in high school. He said the department hadn't gotten any calls from the area in a couple of years, though if you walk along the shoreline there are signs of recent bonfires and drinking.
"We don't have to drive up there and check it every night," Cummings said. "It's not like that anymore."
The department also gets calls about human remains found in The Baja. Sometimes, when someone takes their own life by jumping off the Delaware Memorial Bridge, they will wash up on its shores.
Years ago when Cummings was a detective, a child even found a human skull on the beach, which he brought into the police department in a milk crate.
Near the site it was found, police found a pair of pants with a set of car keys in the pocket, which were matched to a vehicle found abandoned near the bridge.
When there are fatalities or human remains are found in the water or the land belonging to Delaware, Pennsville officers call the Delaware State Police Department, which recovers the bodies and heads up any subsequent investigations.
"It's an interesting place," Cummings said. "There's a lot of history there."

DOUBLE STANDARDS FACEBOOK SHOULDN'T BE THE ARBITER OF SPEECH

Texto completo: Misinformation, spin and false claims have been part of politics since America's founding.
To secure the 1800 presidential election, Thomas Jefferson infamously hired a hatchet man named James Callender to spread false rumors about John Adams wanting a war with France. The American approach to political speech has always been to promote more speech to counter such attacks, with the media tasked as the institution responsible for informing the public of the truth. But some appear ready to try a new approach.
As Facebook has been updating its policies regarding ads, it's met with backlash focused on its refusal to ban political ads with false content. Some in the media, and many Democrats, are demanding that Facebook police the content of political ads on their platform. Facebook responded with proposals of its own - including a planned policy of labeling false posts as such and providing users with links to other sources - but that wasn't enough for its critics. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren accused the company of "taking money to promote lies."
News organizations have framed the story as one in which Facebook is allowing politicians to lie to voters on its platform. That narrative relies on the dubious presumption that the platform should be tasked with determining the veracity of political speech, and that has never been the way we have treated political ads.
In fact, some of the people complaining about Facebook's treatment of political ads work for networks such as ABC, NBC and CBS, which often run political ads that can be considered false or misleading. Of course, they don't really have a choice: The FCC has interpreted the Federal Communications Act to mean that stations cannot generally reject political ads because they believe them to be false.
So why the outrage over Facebook's applying the same standards that those television networks do?
First, right-leaning news sources have been very successful at spreading their message on Facebook. Outlets such as Fox News and the Daily Wire regularly place among the most shared news outlets on Facebook.
Second, many Democrats (and their allies in the media) view the Facebook kerfuffle as an opportunity to outsource censorship of their political opponents to a private company. That became rather obvious during the testimony of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg at a congressional hearing this week. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., used her time to badger him, insisting that Facebook was choosing to allow politicians to use their platform to spread falsehoods. She also demanded to know what Mr. Zuckerberg said to allegedly "far-right figures" at private dinners, using her platform as a member of Congress to shame him for associating with people she disagrees with politically.
Some of the people whom the congresswoman attempted to portray as beyond the pale include mainstream conservative media figures such as Townhall's political editor Guy Benson, former Washington Free Beacon editor Matt Continetti and CNN commentator Mary Katharine Ham.
The exchange was telling. The real source for the pushback against Mr. Zuckerberg on the left is the desire to force online platforms such Facebook to censor their political opponents.
It is worth noting that those attempting to cajole Facebook to censor political speech do not want these same standards applied to themselves. After all, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is the same congresswoman who, when confronted with several examples of her false statements, famously asserted that being "morally right" was more important than being "factually accurate." Mainstream-media fact-checkers have noted her falsehoods on numerous occasions. Yet, when it comes to these claims, there's been silence among the members of the media outraged over Facebook's current approach.
In keeping with the American tradition, Facebook is taking the right approach by providing users with more speech instead of trying to police speech it does not believe is accurate. More speech is always the answer to bad speech. But Ms. Ocasio-Cortez or her media allies will be hard to convince of that bedrock proposition, because it forces them to debate people they disagree with. One could be forgiven for thinking that all they really want to do is silence their political opponents.

Texto completo: Catch Rob Zombie's unmasking of Michael Myers, and stream an experimental silent film about the history of witchcraft.
What's on TV
HALLOWEEN (2007) 9 p.m. on AMC. In his New York Times review of John Carpenter's 1978 slasher film "Halloween," Jason Zinoman wrote that Michael Myers isn't like other movie monsters: "He never speaks and offers no hint of a motivation for his killing spree. He is not a character so much as an absence of one, an abstraction in the middle of a mundane slice of suburban life." But this take on that film, directed by the heavy metal singer Rob Zombie, upends that idea by exploring Myers's back story and unmasking his motive to kill. It follows his childhood as a socially awkward, bullied boy with a stressful home life, which fuels his rage, leading him to enact his first murderous rampage on Halloween night at just 10 years old. He's then locked away in a mental institution and breaks out 15 years later in an attempt to reconnect with his younger sister, who's now a teenager. In his review for The New York Times, Matt Zoller Seitz wrote that "the case study part of the film re-establishes Mr. Zombie's status as modern American horror's most eccentric and surprising filmmaker."
FRONTLINE: FIRE IN PARADISE 10 p.m. on PBS. Last fall, the deadliest wildfire in California's history tore through the town of Paradise, killing more than 80 people and destroying nearly 19,000 homes. This documentary looks at the aftermath of that blaze through interviews with survivors and emergency medical workers. It also explores the chain of events that caused the fire, which was sparked by power lines.
What's Streaming
HAXAN Stream on the Criterion Channel; Rent on Amazon, iTunes and Vudu. Witchcraft has long been a source of fascination in pop culture, and is even currently enjoying somewhat of a feminist resurgence. But its thorny history serves as the inspiration for this ambitious silent film directed by Benjamin Christensen, which draws from a 15th-century treatise on witchcraft called "Malleus Maleficarum." In the early 1920s Christensen, a Danish director, used innovative lighting and staging techniques to create macabre scenes of grave robbing, torture, possessed nuns and satanic rituals. He even makes a cameo as the Devil. In exploring the origins of witchcraft, Christensen also confronts the ways in which the misunderstanding of mental illness fueled the hysteria of witch hunts, victimizing an overwhelming majority of women often at the hands of powerful men. The film, which was also released under the English title "Witchcraft Through the Ages," faced censorship at the time for its controversial content, but a New York Times critic still found it "fantastically conceived and directed, holding the onlooker in a sort of medieval spell."
ARSENIO HALL: SMART & CLASSY Stream on Netflix. This comedian has starred alongside Eddie Murphy in "Coming to America," hosted his own late-night talk show and even won a season of the "Celebrity Apprentice," but he's never had his own stand-up special until now. Hall will use the stage to examine today's comedy climate, touching on Roseanne Barr, Bill Cosby and his former TV boss, President Trump.

Texto completo: Selective deficit hysteria has done immense damage.
So the federal budget deficit just hit $ 1 trillion (actually $ 984 billion, but close enough). That's about $ 300 billion more than the Congressional Budget Office was projecting in the summer of 2017, before the Trump tax cut was enacted. And basically everybody yawned.
Were there fiery speeches in Congress, denouncing fiscal irresponsibility? No. Was there intense media coverage? No -- the story was tucked deep inside major newspapers. Was there severe market reaction? No -- interest rates are substantially lower than they were before the deficit surge.
This lack of reaction to a deficit that would have been considered shocking only a few years ago is sort of the fiscal policy equivalent of Sherlock Holmes's dog that didn't bark in the night. It tells us a lot about economics, politics -- specifically the utter hypocrisy of the G.O.P. -- and the news media, which on economic matters has a de facto conservative bias.
Start with the economics.
The budget deficit has now soared back roughly to where it was in 2012, when the unemployment rate was more than twice its current level, and the economy desperately needed deficit spending to sustain demand.
Back then, however, the inside-the-Beltway crowd was obsessed with deficit reduction. And it wasn't just politicians. As Ezra Klein, now the editor of Vox, noted at the time, "the rules of reportorial neutrality don't apply when it comes to the deficit. On this one issue, reporters are permitted to openly cheer a particular set of highly controversial policy solutions." And those of us who argued that reducing the deficit shouldn't be a high priority were treated like freaks.
But the deficit wasn't a crisis then, and it isn't one now. In fact, leading economists are now telling us that concerns about government debt have been greatly exaggerated all along. The Very Serious People were completely wrong, and those who opposed austerity have been vindicated.
Of course, while practically everyone in Washington was hyperventilating about debt circa 2012, the most apocalyptic warnings came from Republicans -- people like Paul Ryan (remember him?), who declared then, "In this generation, a defining responsibility of government is to steer our nation clear of a debt crisis while there is still time." His pose as the ultimate deficit hawk won him media adulation, which in turn propelled him into becoming speaker of the House.
The truth, however, is that right from the beginning it was obvious that Ryan was a phony. All you had to do was look at the actual content of his budget "plans." But the media narrative demanded that there be serious, honest Republicans, so that blame for the deficit could be equally divided between the parties; so Ryan was slotted into that role even though he was totally unsuited for the part.
[For an even deeper look at what's on Paul Krugman's mind, sign up for his weekly newsletter.]
And then, when he and his party got a chance to exercise the fiscal responsibility they declared essential, they blew up the deficit instead. Republicans only pretended to care about debt as an excuse to hobble President Barack Obama and slash social programs. They were and are complete hypocrites when it comes to budgeting (and other things too, like patriotism, but that's another topic).
Which brings me to the issue of double standards.
When progressives propose new or expanded social programs, they face intense media scrutiny bordering on harassment over how they intend to pay for these programs. Republicans proposing tax cuts don't face anything like the same scrutiny; they are seemingly able to get away with blithe assertions that tax cuts will pay for themselves by boosting economic growth, even though every single piece of evidence we have says that this is nonsense.
We're talking about big numbers here. As I said, the Trump budget blowout, overwhelmingly driven by tax cuts, seems to have raised the deficit by around $ 300 billion, or around 1½ percent of G.D.P. Over the course of the next decade, that would amount to something like $ 3.8 trillion -- substantially more than, for example, the combined cost of all of Elizabeth Warren's proposals other than Medicare for All, which we're still waiting to hear about.
And the truth is that proposals like universal child care are far more likely than tax cuts to repay a significant fraction of their upfront costs, partly by freeing up adults to work, partly by improving the lives of children in ways that will make them more productive adults.
The point is that the media clearly leans conservative in covering budget issues. Progressives face intense grilling over the cost of fairly modest social programs, while conservatives get a virtual free pass on budget-busting tax cuts.
Let me be clear here: I'm not complaining about the lack of panic over our trillion-dollar deficit. We shouldn't be panicked. The problem is the selectivity of deficit hysteria, which somehow kicks in only when a Democrat is president or progressives propose spending that would make American lives better.
That selective hysteria has done enormous harm. And those who propagate it need to be called out for their bias.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The U.S. government said Monday that it is extending protections for more than 200,000 citizens of El Salvador who have been living in the country under temporary protected status, in a boost for Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele.
U.S. Ambassador Ronald Johnson, appearing in a video with Bukele, said that agreement "extends the (temporary protected status) for Salvadorans who are in the United States for one more year."
Later, Ken Cuccinelli, acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, appeared to contradict the ambassador, saying via Twitter that the actual TPS program for Salvadorans wasn't being extended in legal terms: "That's not what happened."
The effect, however, appeared to be essentially the same: Salvadorans who have been living in the U.S. under the TPS program - safe from deportation and allowed to work legally - will continue to do so for at least a year after courts resolve a challenge to the Trump administration's attempt to end TPS for El Salvador and several other countries.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that Salvadorans with TPS will have the validity of their work permits extended through Jan. 4, 2021.
"This is recognition of the achievements and good work of the government of Nayib Bukele," Johnson said.
The DHS statement said there was concern that "the sudden inflow of 250,000 individuals to El Salvador could spark another mass migration to the U.S. and reinvigorate the crisis at the southern border."
Man arrested in Texas shooting that left 2 dead, 12 hurt at party
GREENVILLE, Texas - A man suspected of opening fire at an off-campus college party in Texas, killing two people and injuring 12 others, was arrested Monday.
Brandon Ray Gonzales, 23, of Greenville, was taken into custody less than 48 hours after Saturday's shooting, Hunt County Sheriff Randy Meeks said. Gonzales, who was arrested at the auto dealership where he worked, was booked into the Hunt County jail on a charge of capital murder of multiple persons. Bond was set at $1 million.
The shooting happened around midnight Saturday outside Greenville, 15 miles southwest of a satellite campus of the Texas A&M University System. Authorities believe the shooter may have been targeting one person at the party of about 750 people, and that others may have been shot at random, Meeks has said.
Air Force's mystery space plane lands, ends 2-year mission
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. - The Air Force's mystery space plane is back on Earth after a record-breaking two-year mission.
The X-37B landed at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida early Sunday. The Air Force is mum about what the plane did in orbit after launching aboard a SpaceX rocket in 2017. The 780-day mission sets an endurance record for the reusable vehicle.
It looks like a space shuttle but is one-fourth the size at 29 feet.
Officials say this latest mission successfully completed its objectives.
This was the fifth spaceflight by a vehicle of this sort. No. 6 is planned next year from Cape Canaveral. According to Air Force Secretary Barbara Barrett, "Each successive mission advances our nation's space capabilities."
Pope declares Secret Archive of Vatican not so secret anymore
VATICAN CITY - Pope Francis has declared that the Vatican Secret Archive isn't so secret after all.
Francis on Monday officially changed the name of the Holy See archive to remove what he said were the "negative" connotations of having "secret" in its name.
From now on, the vast trove of documents, manuscripts and papyrus of popes past will be officially known as the "Vatican Apostolic Archive."
In a new law, Francis noted that the archive has long been open to scholars.
He said the name change better reflects the archive's reality and "its service to the church and the world of culture."
The archive contains the documentation on the life of the universal Catholic Church from the eighth century to the present.
Students join Iraq protests as clashes kill 3
BAGHDAD - Thousands of students joined Iraq's anti-government protests Monday, as clashes with security forces firing tear gas canisters killed at least three demonstrators and wounded more than 100.
The students skipped classes at several universities and secondary schools in Baghdad and across Iraq's majority-Shiite south on Monday to take part in the protests, despite the government ordering schools and universities to operate normally.
One of those killed was a 22-year-old female medical student, the first woman to be killed since the protests began this month.
In a separate development, three rockets struck a large military base north of Baghdad that houses U.S. and Iraqi forces, according to a senior Iraqi security official who said there were no casualties.
NC judges throw out congressional map for 2020
RALEIGH, N.C. - North Carolina judges on Monday blocked the state's congressional map from being used in the 2020 elections, ruling that voters had a strong likelihood of winning a lawsuit that argued Republicans unlawfully manipulated district lines for partisan gain.
The panel of three Superior Court judges issued a preliminary injunction preventing elections under the district lines, starting with the March 3 primary.
In the ruling Monday, the judges - Paul Ridgeway, Alma Hinton and Joseph Crosswhite - agreed that "there is a substantial likelihood that plaintiffs will prevail on the merits of this action by showing beyond a reasonable doubt that the 2016 congressional districts are extreme partisan gerrymanders" in violation of the state constitution.
In Silicon Valley: Hundreds of Facebook employees have signed a letter to CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other executives saying they oppose the social network's policy of letting politicians lie in advertisements.
The New York Times reported Monday that more than 250 workers have signed the letter urging Facebook leaders to change the policy that they say is a "threat to what FB stands for." While that's a small fraction of Facebook's workforce of more than 35,000, it's a rare showing of employee dissent.
Facebook spokeswoman Bertie Thomson said the company appreciates its employees voicing concerns but it "remains committed to not censoring political speech."

Shifting Course, Democrats Plan First Floor Vote on Impeachment Inquiry

Texto completo: NEW YORK — The House plans to take its first formal vote Thursday on the impeachment inquiry into President Trump, Democratic leaders said Monday, ushering in a new phase as they prepare to go public with their investigation into his dealings on Ukraine.
Democrats described the vote, which will come more than a month after they launched the inquiry, as a necessary next step to lay out the rules for conducting it in public, rather than a response to accusations from Republicans and the White House that the process has violated precedents and denied the president due process rights.
It marks a shift for Democrats, who have resisted for weeks the idea of holding a vote on the impeachment inquiry, arguing that doing so was unnecessary to authorize their work, and privately worrying that doing so could put politically vulnerable Democrats in a difficult position.
But in scheduling the vote, Democrats were effectively challenging Trump and his congressional allies who have called the inquiry an unfair sham of a process but avoided any substantive discussion of the president's conduct. Whether they can pick up the votes of moderate Republicans remains to be seen.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the vote in a letter to colleagues Monday afternoon.
“This resolution establishes the procedure for hearings that are open to the American people, authorizes the disclosure of deposition transcripts, outlines procedures to transfer evidence to the Judiciary Committee as it considers potential articles of impeachment, and sets forth due process rights for the president and his counsel," Pelosi said in a statement.
Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat from Massachusetts, chairman of the House Rules Committee, said he would introduce the resolution, which has not yet been finalized, Tuesday. His panel plans to consider it Wednesday, followed by a vote of the full House on Thursday.
The rules will also allow for staff aides of the House Intelligence Committee to question witnesses directly during public hearings, according to an official working on the inquiry who described the measure on condition of anonymity because it had yet to be made public. It was not immediately clear if the two other panels contributing the inquiry, the Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform committees, would also convene public hearings.
So far, the impeachment inquiry has played out almost entirely behind the closed doors of the Intelligence panel, where Republican and Democratic staff and lawmakers have questioned a string of witnesses. But Democrats leading it had long forecast that they would begin to move some witness testimony and a presentation of facts gathered in private into public view.
“We are taking this step to eliminate any doubt as to whether the Trump administration may withhold documents, prevent witness testimony, disregard duly authorized subpoenas or continue obstructing the House of Representatives," Pelosi wrote
Republicans signaled they would oppose the measure en masse. Shortly after the vote was announced, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the top House Republican, said Democrats called the announcement “an admission that this process has been botched from the start," and said Republicans “will not legitimize" it.
Similarly, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said that Pelosi "is finally admitting what the rest of America already knew — that Democrats were conducting an unauthorized impeachment proceeding . . . "
In another shift in strategy, House Democrats will forgo using the federal courts to try to compel testimony from recalcitrant witnesses in their impeachment inquiry, and warned that lawmakers would instead use the lack of cooperation to bolster their case that Trump has abused his office and obstructed Congress's investigation. Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, confirmed the plan after Charles M. Kupperman, the former deputy national security adviser and one of Trump's “closest confidential" advisers, defied a House subpoena for testimony that had been scheduled for Monday morning.
The White House on Friday said that Kupperman was absolutely immune from testifying and directed him not to appear in defiance of a subpoena. That prompted the former official to file a lawsuit against Trump and congressional Democrats asking a federal judge whether he could testify, raising the prospect of a drawn-out legal battle over weighty questions about the separation of powers that could effectively stall the impeachment inquiry for months.
“We are not willing to let the White House engage us in a lengthy game of rope-a-dope in the courts, so we press ahead," Schiff told reporters outside his secure hearing rooms.
In earlier oversight disputes, House Democrats have turned to the courts with some frequency, but those lawsuits have already eaten up valuable months of time without signs of resolution any time soon. Schiff indicated Democrats now did not have the luxury of waiting, given the gravity of the allegations that Trump abused his power to enlist help from Ukraine in smearing his political opponents.
“If this witness had something to say that would be helpful to the White House, they would want him to come and testify," Schiff said. “They plainly don't."
Schiff acknowledged that the White House would most likely try to invoke similar privilege to try to block other high-level witnesses, including John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser said to be alarmed by Trump's dealings with Ukraine. Doing so would only fuel another article of impeachment charging Trump with obstructing Congress's fact-finding, he said.
The remarks came as impeachment investigators braced for a busy week, which will include testimony from another five or more witnesses.
Around the time Schiff was speaking, the Justice Department said that it would appeal a Federal District Court ruling handed down on Friday that said the House's effort was a legally legitimate impeachment inquiry, and ordered the executive branch to provide secret grand jury evidence to the House Judiciary Committee collected by the former special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who investigated Russia's interference in the 2016 elections.
The Trump legal team has argued that the impeachment inquiry is illegitimate because the full House has not voted to formally authorize one. The ruling by Chief Judge Beryl Howell undercut a key argument the White House has invoked to justify its orders to executive branch officials to defy congressional subpoenas about the Ukraine affair.
Judge Howell had ordered the department to turn over the grand jury evidence by Wednesday. In notifying the court that it would appeal the order to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the administration asked Judge Howell to suspend that deadline while the higher court weighs the issues.

DUI driver took away my family

Justice was not served when the woman who killed my daughter and her family was sentenced to only 50 years in prison for driving drunk and causing a crash on the Lee Roy Selmon Expressway. She should have been sentenced to life in prison. A life sentence is what my family now has to serve. When that driver drank and then got behind the wheel, she knew it was wrong and that she had the potential to kill someone, in this case our family  my daughter Rita Felipak, her husband, Luiz, and their 8-year-old daughter  our granddaughter  Giorgia.

Time and time again society is told that drinking and driving dont mix, but we are supposed to accept the outcome and call it manslaughter. But, no, we dont accept it. DUI is unacceptable. This driver should be in prison for life, and even that isnt good enough.

We want our family back. Nothing else could ever give us peace, but we will never see our loved ones again. Our daughter, Rita, was our world. She was kind, she was loving, and she was the best mother anyone could ever have. We were so proud to be her parents. And as parents, that is all we can ask for from our kids.

Our granddaughter, Giorgia, was one of a kind. Her love for her grandmother was unlike anything I have ever seen. The two together were a pair to behold.

We will never forget them. They will be in our hearts forever.

Michael Ciranni, Tampa

The writer is the father of Rita Felipak, the woman who was killed along with her husband and daughter in a crash on the Lee Roy Selmon Expressway in 2017.

Old solutions dont work

Florida should be leading the charge on climate change mitigation. But instead the road builders are developing a plan to make things worse. They are offering a 20th century solution for a 21st century problem: how to provide transport in the era of global warming and sea-level rise. A recent New York Times article says that the Federal Reserve Bank is already worried about decreasing property values in flood-prone areas, suggesting that flood-prone properties have already decreased in value by 15 percent. New roads mean the burning of more fossil fuels and even more carbon dioxide and can only make matters worse. All flood-prone communities should be up in arms about this plan. It will put Florida financially underwater and eventually, physically underwater. Any analysis of the cost/benefit of these roads must include the toll on all of Floridas communities, especially those that worry about flooding.

Heres what ails me

I am fairly new to the Medicare supplemental program, having just signed up for the first time last year. It was absolute torture. I had to compare a plethora of policies with varying coverage and fees while trying to discern (guess) what types of ailments and prescriptions I might need in the coming year. I told my agent at the time that if I could see into the future with any certainty I would be at the blackjack tables in Las Vegas, not sitting at my kitchen table sweating the details. I had no idea that I would have to do it again this year and next year, and the year after that because each plan changes.

Texto completo: Flo and Clue, two popular period-tracking apps, recently introduced health tools that evaluate a woman's risk for the hormonal imbalance known as polycystic ovary syndrome.
In September alone, more than 636,000 women completed the Flo health assessments, said the app's developer, Flo Health. The app then recommended that 240,000 of those women, or about 38 percent, ask their doctors about the hormonal disorder. (BioWink, the developer of Clue, declined to provide similar usage statistics.)
But what many women who used the Flo and Clue health tools may not have known is that the apps did not conduct high-level clinical studies to determine the accuracy of their health risk assessments or the potential for unintended consequences such as overdiagnosis. As a result, some experts said, the new tools could lead some women to be labeled with a hormonal imbalance they did not have or that may have no significant repercussions for their health.
"You could be making a lot of people concerned they have a problem that they don't know will have absolutely no clinical consequences for them," said Dr. Jennifer Doust, a professor of clinical epidemiology at Bond University in Queensland, Australia, who has studied polycystic ovary syndrome, which is known as PCOS.
Flo's and Clue's health assessments are part of a broader shift in digital medicine. Health tracking apps have for years helped people collect and chart data on their heart rates, moods, sleep patterns and menstrual cycles. But now some of these apps are going further by using that data to predict an individual's risk for problems like heart conditions. In other words, they are moving from simply quantifying consumers' health data to medicalizing it.
While some of the apps' new evaluation tools may be useful and helpful, determining whether they are accurate can be difficult. Of the several hundred thousand health apps available globally in major app stores, most lack high-level evidence on their outcomes, according to a recent study in Nature Digital Medicine. And as long as consumer health apps make vague health promises -- like improved well-being -- and do not claim to diagnose or treat a disease, they are not typically required to submit effectiveness evidence for vetting by the Food and Drug Administration.
"It's certainly become confusing as a consumer if you go onto these app marketplaces and these apps are making claims about helping you learn about mental health, PCOS, heart disease, diabetes," said Dr. John Torous, director of the digital psychiatry division at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, one of the authors of the Nature study. "Do we know this helps or it doesn't help?"
Flo, which has more than 30 million active monthly users, and Clue, with more than 12 million, have good intentions. Their developers each said they had worked with medical experts to develop the assessments and had based them on international medical guidelines for identifying PCOS. The apps also include prominent disclaimers saying that their assessments for PCOS should not be construed as diagnoses.
But in a recent news release, Flo described its service as a "digital, pre-diagnostic tool" to help women "discover if they have PCOS and also bring peace of mind to others who may suspect they have it." Clue said its "probabilistic statistical model" for the hormonal imbalance offered a "smart assessment that can be shared with doctors."
One woman, a product manager in the San Francisco Bay Area, interviewed by The New York Times who used Flo said it gave her more information about PCOS than her doctor had. But Sasha O'Marra, a copywriter in Toronto who tried a beta version of Flo's health risk feature in July, said she found the assessment irresponsible.
The app said Ms. O'Marra's symptoms -- acne and menstrual cycle changes -- "may indicate a hormonal imbalance which is probably a manifestation of PCOS." She took the company to task on Twitter, explaining that her period had changed because she had just changed birth control pills.
"It's very concerning to me," Ms. O'Marra said in an interview. "Telling people they might have something like PCOS without understanding the context behind their symptoms is a slippery slope."
The company responded on Twitter: "Here at Flo, we use medically approved algorithms." It explained that its algorithm considered multiple factors. "If some symptoms match, we encourage a user to visit a doctor just to make sure that everything is fine."
In an email, Flo said the app includes a disclaimer that its PCOS assessment is not designed for women who use long-term birth control methods.
Polycystic ovary syndrome is a prevalent health problem among women of childbearing age. Its symptoms can include elevated testosterone levels, irregular periods and abnormal facial hair growth. The syndrome can make conceiving without fertility treatments more difficult for some women.
The apps' PCOS risk assessment tools are easy to use. They ask women a series of questions about possible symptoms, adapting to certain answers with follow-up questions. After people complete the questionnaires, the apps tell them whether their symptoms seem suggestive of the hormonal imbalance and may recommend they ask their doctors about it.
Professional medical groups disagree over which symptoms are needed to identify the hormonal imbalance -- and whether it is overdiagnosed or underdiagnosed. One 2017 study of about 1,400 women who eventually received a PCOS diagnosis, for instance, reported that about one-third of them consulted at least three physicians before the syndrome was identified.
Women who have been misdiagnosed with PCOS said the experience could be jarring.
"I was really stressed during that time because I really thought maybe I wasn't going to be able to have kids," said Sabrina Wisbiski, a human resources coordinator in the Detroit area, who said she was erroneously told by an endocrinologist a few years ago that she had the disorder. She said she later discovered that she had a different hormonal problem set off by intensive bodybuilding.
"I feel like a lot of doctors did not have the right knowledge or experience with women who lose their periods from overtraining and they turned to PCOS as a blanket diagnosis," she said.
Clue and Flo each said their assessments did not make definitive health judgments. If the apps detect a risk, Flo tells its users that their symptoms "could be a manifestation of PCOS," while Clue tells its users that PCOS is "a possible cause" of their irregular periods.
Clue also said it had tested its risk models for the hormonal disorder on nine hypothetical patients who were assigned different symptoms. The prediction models incorrectly detected PCOS in one to two of the virtual patients -- and also typically assigned the virtual test subjects a risk score more than 15 percentage points higher than a physician did.
"We err on the side of caution," said Daniel Thomas, Clue's head of data science. "Even if we think it's more likely that they don't have PCOS than having PCOS, but it's one of these gray zone cases, we would also still ask them to see the doctor."
Dr. Torous, who has published studies on the evidence supporting health apps, said the validation method could skew Clue's health risk assessments.
"If you're training a model on virtual patients, the model learns how to treat virtual patients," he said. "But a virtual patient is not you or me or a real person."
Flo offered its PCOS assessment tool to all of its users last month, but it has now limited it to women with irregular periods who have logged at least six menstrual cycles on the app. Kamila Staryga, vice president of product at Flo Health, said the system aims to make more women aware of PCOS and help them "weed out whether a condition is something that they should call the doctor" about.
But the Flo app -- unlike Clue -- did not ask about eating disorders or workout routines, factors that could explain irregular periods. Flo said its assessment didn't ask users about them because international medical guidelines for identifying PCOS did not include those criteria. The Flo app also frames certain questions in ways that could tilt women's responses toward the hormonal disorder.
"Irregular periods may be a symptom. Do your periods always start in the same timeframe?" one question on the Flo app said. Another said: "Plenty of acne in more than six months that usual skincare fails to cure could mean a hormonal imbalance caused by PCOS. Do you experience acne?"
"It's kind of suggesting the answer, isn't it?" said Dr. Doust of Bond University. "If you were in any way thinking in your head already, 'Oh, I must have PCOS,' then it's kind of suggesting what you have to say to get that answer."

Texto completo: At 21, Duluth bookkeeper Henry Carlson got a crazy idea 100 years ago. He saved up about $300 to buy a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, complete with a sidecar and a V-twin engine that engineer Bill Harley had first designed 10 years earlier.
In September of 1919, Carlson and co-worker Harvey MacFarlane quit their staid accounting jobs at Standard Oil Co. and headed west on a 1,400-mile odyssey across the unpaved plains of North Dakota and the mountains of Montana. The roads were awful, the bike broke down often but they had a blast with the 6-foot-3 MacFarlane squeezed into the sidecar and Carlson straddling the roaring V-twin.
"Henry is some pilot and I just sit and look on (when I am not two or three feet in the air) of course," MacFarlane wrote in a postcard from the Aitkin Hotel after Day 1 to Carlson's girlfriend, 18-year-old Louise Nelson, back in Duluth.
Before embarking, Henry had taken some test runs from Duluth to his hometown of South Range, Wis., 15 miles to the south -- with Louise in his sidecar. "I am not as enjoyable ballast as he had on those trips to South Range," MacFarlane quipped in his postcard.
Wearing tightfitting breeches known as jodhpurs tucked in high boots, Carlson and his buddy visited Yellowstone National Park and made it to Spokane, Wash., where they landed jobs at the Great Northern Railroad for a while before returning to Duluth.
Three years after the long ride, Henry sold his Harley to pay for an engagement ring. He and Louise were married 61 years, raised two kids and launched a long successful career in the Duluth grain milling business.
"I'm bitten with regret that none of us seem to have asked Grandpa more about the trip before he died" in 1983, said Kathryn Oakley, 72, Carlson's granddaughter in St. Paul. "The 1919 trip was probably the most adventurous thing he did in his very responsible, hardworking life."
Carlson's hearing loss in later years inhibited the storytelling, but he loved to repeat the tale of hocking the Harley for an engagement ring, according to his 91-year-old sole surviving child, Dick Carlson.
Luckily for Oakley and other descendants, Louise kept a book with 15 blurry black-and-white photographs from the 1919 trek -- along with postcards and telegrams. Some of the images show bleak dirt roads, others include Carlson and MacFarlane with the Harley loaded down with their bedrolls, duffel bags and kitchen supplies.
Sifting through the stories and pictures, Oakley devised a theory about what might have inspired her grandfather to trade in his desk job for the bumpy open road.
In the summer of 1919, just before Carlson's epic ride, the U.S. Army embarked on the first transcontinental motor convoy -- sending 81 trucks, cars and motorcycles cross-country from Washington D.C. to San Francisco. The New York Times called it "the largest aggregation of motor vehicles ever started on a trip of such length."
It took two months to cover the 3,251 miles and test wartime military mobility along what was then known as the Lincoln Highway and is now Interstate Hwy. 80.
Among the drivers was a 28-year-old Army officer, Lt. Col. Dwight Eisenhower.
"In Nebraska, the first real sand was encountered," the future World War II hero and 34th U.S. president wrote of his journey.
"From Orr's Ranch, Utah, to Carson City, Nevada, the road is one succession of dust, ruts, pits and holes."
Ike marveled at the German autobahn network as he led the U.S. military against the Nazis in World War II. Along with that 1919 trip, he grew convinced that the United States needed to construct an interstate highway system -- one of his signature initiatives during his two presidential terms in the 1950s.
We don't know for sure if that's what sparked Henry Carlson and Harvey MacFarlane to make their own trip a month later. Carlson's granddaughter used the distances between towns mentioned in the postcards to estimate the pair averaged about 30 mph and 250 miles a day -- taking about 10 days to make it to Spokane.
"All these years later," Oakley said, "it's hard to know whether Spokane was their ultimate goal or whether they were just tired of bouncing along the road."
A roll of adding machine paper, with notes from 20 co-workers back in Duluth, is among the artifacts her grandmother saved. One note on the paper mentioned Mildred Coleman, MacFarlane's girlfriend, who was doing "fine but sure she is lonesome."
A photo in her grandmother's album shows Mildred and Louise in the wide-brimmed, feathered hats of the era -- looking somewhat forlorn.
Like Henry and Louise, Mildred and Harvey wed not long after the motorcycle journey west. He enjoyed a long career in the insurance business in Green Bay, Wis.
"The two couples met at least yearly in Duluth or Green Bay to renew their long friendship," Oakley said, "and to reminisce about that motorcycle trip out west in 1919."

Texto completo: It was raining in Ireland, and it was starting to get me down.
Before you say, "It always rains in Ireland!" let me tell you: I've been to Ireland many times, and yes, it rains. It rains, and then it gets sunny, or it rains, and then it stops. Many's the time I have worn sunglasses and had the windshield wipers going because the weather couldn't make up its mind.
But this trip was different. This trip was all-day-and-all-night-and-all-day downpours.
It might not have mattered that much, but my husband and I were there to hike.
In the remote village of Allihies where we were holed up, rain streamed past the windows of our B&B and flags snapped in the wind. The trails we had planned to walk squelched with standing water, the mountaintops we hoped to cross were enshrouded in fog. We couldn't hike, and so we read.
Allihies consisted of a tiny grocery, a cafe, a pub and a scattering of houses. There was no bookstore, no library. Fortunately, we had crammed our suitcases with books.
So I switched on the tea kettle and dove into "Say Nothing," Patrick Radden Keefe's nonfiction book about the Irish Troubles. It was so good that it made me wish we were in Belfast instead of West Cork, though it was also raining in Belfast.
It rained the next day, too, and I turned to "She Said," by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, the New York Times reporters who had broken the Harvey Weinstein story. Meanwhile, my husband was steadily reading Kevin Barry's "Night Boat to Tangier," a novel about two aging Irish thugs.
Each afternoon, the rain eased, we went for a hike, the rain started up again, and we returned to our books.
Would we rather be hiking the planned 15 miles from town to town? Of course; that was why we were there. But when something gets in the way of your plans, you have to make new plans.
So we tried to look at this forced relaxation as a good thing. When, other than during vacation, do we have hours of uninterrupted time in which to read? When else do we get a chance to sink into a book and consume it in a day?
From Dublin to Cork City to Allihies to Wicklow and back to Dublin, it rained hard almost every day. Instead of hiking over the mountains to the next B&B, we rode in taxis with our luggage and took shorter hikes in the afternoons. The rest of the time, we read.
In Wicklow, my husband chuckled over "The Shakespeare Requirement" by Julie Schumacher. I finished Charles Portis' "True Grit," which I loved so much I wished I hadn't yet read it, and started on Patti Smith's "Year of the Monkey."
We ended up in Dublin for the last few days. Dublin, city of bookstores! (And rain.) Good thing, because by now we were out of books.
We sloshed the mile from our B&B to the Winding Stair Bookshop. Rain dripped off our hoods as we tramped to Easons bookstore. We popped into Hodges Figgis. At each stop, we loaded up on Irish books: "Diary of a Somebody," by Brian Bilston; Joseph O'Connor's "Shadowplay"; "This House Is Haunted," by John Boyne; a novel by Dermot Bolger, whose play we had just seen at the Abbey Theatre; a collection of stories by Nicole Flattery.
When the rain got too wet, we hoofed it back to our B&B, switched on the tea kettle, and read.
Trips don't always go as planned. Life doesn't always go as planned. Sometimes you have to tear things up and start over. For us, for this trip, books kept us going.
Do you have stories about vacations and books? Send them to books@startribune.com and we'll run them on a future Sunday.

Texto completo: The Trump administration faced a bevy of accusations that a Situation Room photo showing President Trump watching a raid by U.S. special operations forces in Syria that killed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi after his predecessor's White House photographer pointed out a small detail.
On Sunday, the White House shared a photo of the president and a handful of his advisers monitoring the Saturday raid.
Tweet
White House photographer for former President Barack Obama, Pete Souza later noted on Twitter the raid took place at 3:30 p.m. Washington, D.C., time, but that the timestamp on the photo was marked over an hour and a half later at 17:05:24, or 5:05 p.m.
Tweet
Critics were quick to pick up on Souza's tweet and began questioning the authenticity of the photo as well.
Tweet
Others compared the picture to the famous Situation Room photo depicting Obama watching the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011, noting that one appears less staged than the other.
TweetTweet
Souza later clarified his observation, tweeting, "Just to be clear, I didn't say it was staged. Trump himself said he didn't arrive to the Situation Room until 'around 5pm'. So it's definitely possible the photo was taken during the raid."
Tweet
He also noted that the New York Times reported "the helicopters left Iraq at 5PM (Washington time), and they reported it was about a 70-minute flight to Syria. So actual raid had to happen some time after 6:10PM."
Tweet
While the timeline is unclear, Trump's schedule indicated that he was at his golf club in Virginia at 3:30 p.m. and arrived back at the White House at 4:18 p.m. on Saturday.
Photo Caption:In this photo provided by the White House, President Donald Trump is joined by from left, national security adviser Robert O'Brien, Vice President Mike Pence, Defense Secretary mark Esper, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley and Brig. Gen. Marcus Evans, Deputy Director for Special Operations on the Joint Staff, Saturday, Oct. 26, 2019, in the Situation Room of the White House in Washington.

The Silent Heart Attack You Didn’t Know You Had

Texto completo: When my Aunt Gert had a heart attack in her mid-70s, the examining doctor told her that it was not her first. Tests done to assess the damage to her heart revealed a section of dead muscle from a previous unrecognized heart attack. Sometime in the past, she had had what doctors call a “silent myocardial infarction,” or SMI - silent in that any symptoms she might have had at the time did not register as related to her heart and were not brought to medical attention.
My aunt was lucky. She survived her second attack and, by keeping cardiac risk factors under control, lived two decades more without further heart-related problems.
There are millions of people in this country who, like my aunt, are oblivious to the fact that they have had an SMI and face an increased risk of having another, more obvious one that could cause severe heart damage and possibly death.
You might think a silent heart attack is better than a recognized one: “What you don’t know can’t hurt you.” Unfortunately, it can. Although knowing you’re at risk of a heart attack can be emotionally distressing, not knowing can have much more serious consequences, prompting you to continue living in ways that endanger the health of your heart and your life.
A recognized heart attack is a warning to adopt medical and lifestyle measures that can minimize cardiac risk, like normalizing blood pressure and cholesterol levels, quitting smoking, losing weight if you’re overweight, getting regular exercise and controlling Type 2 diabetes. If diet and exercise are not sufficiently protective, there are medications that can help nature along.
Helping yourself
Even without medication, if everyone at increased coronary risk adhered to a heart-healthy lifestyle, “the incidence of heart disease would be reduced by 80%,” Dr. Rekha Mankad, cardiologist and director of the Women’s Heart Center at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, told me.
Recent studies conducted in Iceland and Finland, which maintain excellent medical records on all citizens, have helped to determine how often SMIs occur and the long-term consequences associated with them. The findings, published in JAMA Cardiology last October, highlight the critical importance of not waiting until your heart sends a clear message that its life-sustaining ability has been compromised; instead, acknowledge the presence of coronary risk factors and take preventive measures to bring them under control before it’s too late.
Perhaps most revealing was the very thorough study conducted in Iceland among 935 men and women initially aged 67 to 93 who were followed for up to more than 13 years. When they enrolled in the study, each participant underwent a noninvasive test called cardiac magnetic resonance imaging that can most reliably show whether a silent heart attack had already occurred. Initially, 17% were found to have had an SMI and 10% had had a recognized attack.
After the first three years of follow-up, there was no difference in death rates between those who had an SMI and those who did not. The death rate in both groups was 3%, significantly lower than the 9% mortality rate among participants who had a recognized heart attack.
But as time went on, those with an SMI fared increasingly worse. By 10 years after their enrollment, half the participants with silent heart attacks had died, a death rate no different from that of men and women who entered the study with a history of a recognized heart attack.
While death was the most serious result after an SMI, there was also an elevated risk of developing congestive heart failure, which leaves people increasingly short of breath and excessively fatigued. Legs swell, fluid collects around the heart, exercise tolerance is greatly reduced and patients are ultimately dependent on supplemental oxygen. Half of those who develop congestive heart failure die within five years of diagnosis, a death rate similar to some cancers.
The second recent study, published in JAMA Cardiology in July, involved autopsy findings among 5,869 men and women, average age 65, who had died suddenly in northern Finland, where autopsies of such deaths are done automatically. Evidence of an SMI was apparent in 1,322 individuals who had no prior history of coronary artery disease. Furthermore, those who succumbed to sudden cardiac death during physical activity were more frequently found to have enlarged hearts, a sign of abnormal strain.
Making it worse
An enlarged heart by itself is a risk factor for sudden cardiac death, the authors noted, but when combined with heart muscle scars from a prior SMI, the prognosis is worse.
“Individuals with SMI were unaware of their disease and presumably did not limit their physical exertion when unrecognized symptoms occurred,” the authors from the University of Oulu in Finland and University of Miami Miller School of Medicine wrote. They suggested that a scarred heart can trigger abnormal heart rhythms and result in sudden death during exercise.
“A silent heart attack is not always so silent, but its symptoms - mild chest discomfort, heartburn, nausea, shortness of breath - happen to lots of people and are typically attributed to other causes and not brought to medical attention,” Dr. Robert O. Bonow, a cardiologist at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, told me. Women, whose symptoms are often vague, are especially unlikely to realize they are having a heart attack.
Screening large groups of people for evidence of an SMI is not economically or practically feasible. Although an electrocardiogram, often done before surgery and sometimes by one’s personal physician, can show heart scarring in some people, “it is not as sensitive as a cardiac MRI that was used in the Iceland study,” Bonow said.
“While screening with cardiac MRI is not recommended, identification of risk factors certainly is,” he wrote in an editorial accompanying the Iceland study.
“It’s important for doctors to recognize people at risk and prescribe appropriate treatments to reduce that risk,” he said. “Although it’s human nature to ignore certain things until you have an event, adherence to preventive treatment can be lifesaving. In the United States, a heart attack is the leading cause of sudden death in people 65 and older.”
For people at high risk or who are suspected of having had a silent heart attack, doctors may recommend an imaging test, like a resting echocardiogram, nuclear stress test or, for people capable of exercise, an echocardiogram with a stress test, Mankad suggested.

Show Biz: Changes afoot for Bette Midler, Bruno Mars

Texto completo: Hawaii’s M&M stars — that would be Bette Midler and Bruno Mars — have been grabbing headlines in recent weeks.
Midler is selling her New York lair, a trilevel vertical mansion on the Upper East Side of the Big Apple, for $ 50 million. Reason: The Tony winner (“Hello, Dolly!”) and her husband, Martin van Haselberg , are downsizing, since their daughter, Sophie , no longer lives in the 14-room home the Divine Miss M calls “a country house in the city,” since the family moved in in 1996, combining two apartments for the mega-space.
The Midler property is an entertainment showcase with 7,000 square feet, renovated for partying, according to the New York Times. The penthouse on the top floor boasts a 900-foot garden and a mammoth floor-to-ceiling library plus a fireplace and full bathroom; the private living area has a master bedroom with park views and the space can be configured into seven bedrooms. The kitchen, with wood cabinets and marble countertops, boasts high-end appliances. Certainly, a palatial pad for a queen of song, stage and films.
Mars, who has been a New Year’s Eve attraction in Las Vegas for a couple of years, is going global this year, heading to Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. He’ll headline a festive Resolution by Night event on Yas Island on Dec. 31; tickets start at about $ 95. A family-friendly Resolution by Day follows on Jan. 1 at Du Arena.
Mars previously has toured the UAE capital so the year-end countdown will be a homecoming becoming of an international star like the multi-Grammy Award winner. Clearly, Abu Dhabi spared no expenses to attract its global crowd to ring in the New Year in style.
Further, Mars evidently is in the midst of recording a new album (he’s posted a Twitter image himself, showing his Vans footwear atop a keyboard) and the buzz is that the project will be released in 2020. Wonder if he’ll another record-breaker; Mars’ “Uptown Funk,” in collaboration with Mark Ronson , has just been named the No. 1 Vevo clip in America and the United Kingdom, and No. 2 globally. Vevo monitors video streaming hits. …
THOROUGHLY THEROUX
I love this quote, from travel writer Paul Theroux , who has residences in Hawaii, Cape Cod, Mass., and Maine; the author often has a reputation of being a grouch, but rejects it thusly: “I often get criticized for being overly critical, but all I’ve done is write about the world as it is, rough around the edges. All I’ve ever done is try to see things as they are.”
Sage advice for all, including journalists; say it as you see it, write it as you feel it.
The comments are from a conversation with Joshua David Stein , for New York magazine’s One Great Story online feature, about the globetrotting, storytelling, culinary critic and book-writing wizard. The quote emerged over a meal that demonstrated Theroux’s gusto — in chronicling life, meals and travels. …
JACOB’S LADDER
Hawaii actor Jacob Batalon , a fixture in the current revival of “Spider-Man” adventures, climbs the Christmas tree ladder in Netflix’s “Let It Snow,” one of a series of yuletide streamers this fall.
The teen comedy, based on a young adult novel, drops Nov. 8. It’s about teens in a small town, who become trapped together during an unexpected snowstorm on Christmas Eve.
Batalon was last seen on the big screen in “Spider-Man: Far From Home.” The film’s young cast includes Netflix regulars Kiernan Shipka (“Chilling Adventures of Sabrina”), Odeya Rush (“Dumplin’”), Liv Hewson (“Santa Clarita Diet”) and Anna Akana (“You Get Me”) and teen flick stars Shameik Moore (“The Pretenders”), Matthew Noszka (“Star”), Mitchell Hope (“Descendants”), Isabela Moner (“Instant Family”) and Miles Robbins (“Halloween”). …
LOUNGES GONE, TOO …
A couple of readers emailed, “Why aren’t there lounges with island entertainment anymore?” This, after I recently reflected on the disappearance of main showrooms.
Lounges were not as spacious as supper clubs but also became an endangered species. Not surprising, since most hotels shuttered nightclubs in the past three decades, eliminating the cozy performance spaces thereby cutting back on show amenities. Freestanding spaces, too, were closed — not sure if the reason was operational costs or wavering crowd support.
Remember Jimmy Borges at Trappers, Loyal Garner at the Canoe House, the Kahauanu Lake Trio at the Royal Hawaiian’s Surf Room, Kit Samson’s Sound Advice at the Kahala Hilton’s Maile Lounge, the Makaha Sons at Hank’s Place and the Ranch House and Carole Kai at the Hilton Hawaiian Village’s Garden Bar? Those joints were jumping in the height of lounge-hopping.
More casual sounds were provided by Myra English and Martin Denny at the Outrigger Waikiki’s Blue Dolphin Room, Jay Larrin at the Gangplank Lounge, and Al Lopaka and Iva Kinimaka at the Cock’s Roost. Those were the days.
The scarcity of lounges — training ground for entertainers seeking a Waikiki spotlight — also explains why there are virtually no main attraction “name” headliners anymore. …
And that’s “Show Biz.”

Texto completo: What's on TV
MRS. FLETCHER 10:30 p.m. on HBO. This series is based on Tom Perrotta's novel "Mrs. Fletcher," which was published in 2017 and tackles themes of misogyny, sexuality and female empowerment. Like the book, the limited series follows Eve Fletcher, a divorced mom (Kathryn Hahn) in her mid-40s, and her son Brendan (Jackson White), an entitled jock starting his freshman year at college, as they embark on respective journeys of sexual enlightenment. While Brendan struggles to connect with his political-minded peers and confronts conversations about consent, Eve indulges in her newfound freedom by going down an internet pornography rabbit hole. "'Mrs. Fletcher' is a very right-now show," Margaret Lyons wrote in her review for The New York Times. "It's one of many short-run half-hour dramedies about a woman entering a new phase of her life who discovers new vectors of sexuality and self-actualization while also being treated shabbily."
KILLER SIBLINGS 8 p.m. on Oxygen. When Lyle and Erik Menendez were convicted of murdering their wealthy parents, they became perhaps the highest profile case of killer siblings. "It led many to wonder what dark family history or twisted psychology might have led two privileged, handsome and self-assured youths to do away with their parents in the most savage way," Kenneth B. Noble wrote in his coverage of the trial for The New York Times. "And it raised a question of almost biblical dimensions: Can a child ever be justified in murdering a parent?" This new true crime series delves deeper into that phenomenon, focusing on other cases of murderous siblings, starting with the Gustafsons, three siblings who sought revenge against the star witness in their brother's murder trial.
NO TIME LIKE CHRISTMAS 8 p.m. on Lifetime. While most of us are still trying to wrangle up a suitable Halloween costume, Lifetime has gone straight into the Christmas season with its annual slate of original holiday programming. Over the next two months, It's a Wonderful Lifetime will screen 28 premiere movies. In one of those films, "No Time Like Christmas," Emma (Kyla Pratt) teams up with her former college boyfriend, Fletcher, (Ed Ruttle) in an attempt to save a local theater. As they plan a Christmas Eve showcase, with help from Emma's sister and Fletcher's daughter, iced-over romantic feelings begin to thaw.
What's Streaming
THE WITCH (2015) Stream on Netflix. Rent on Amazon, iTunes, Google Play, YouTube and Vudu. Like his latest film "The Lighthouse," Robert Eggers's first feature directorial effort "The Witch" harnesses a specific kind of New England eeriness. In it, a family of God-fearing Puritan settlers wrestles with their faith as rumors of witchcraft swirl around the eldest daughter, Thomasin. In her review for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis wrote that the director's "sharpest decision, what makes you and the movie jump, is that he stays inside the characters' worlds and heads, all disastrously close quarters."

Texto completo: In July 2015, the two of us stepped off a plane at the newly opened airport in Pyongyang, North Korea. It was our first time in the country. As architects based in Beijing, we were well acquainted with the world's cities and skyscrapers, but North Korea was a dark spot in our mental map -- filled in, as it was for most people, by preconceptions and stereotypes that rendered the so-called Hermit Kingdom in black and white. We had tried to leave those ideas behind, but we didn't expect that this first visit would leave us with such a sense of confusion, one where the difference between what was real and genuine was muddled by what was ostensibly staged or faked.
As soon as we left, we knew we had to return. Over the next four years we made three more visits, facilitated by a Beijing-based travel company called Koryo Tours. Over time we decided to try to represent the complicated reality of Pyongyang through photography, which ended up in the form of a book, "Model City: Pyongyang."
Pyongyang, a city of 3.2 million people, has a long history, but it was largely rebuilt after the Korean War (called the "American War" in North Korea) by the newly founded Communist government, which intended it to be a model city for a new society. North Korean society is built around "juche ideology," a homegrown form of socialism based on self-reliance, and it infuses everything in the city, especially the architecture. "On Architecture," an essay by Kim Jong Il, who ruled from 1994 to 2011, sets out juche-informed rules regarding axis, control of heights, framing of space and so on, and they are recognizable everywhere in the city.
Still, different architectural phases are noticeable in the city, from an early radical, brutalist period to the modernist and postmodern, up to the new developments created under the current leader, Kim Jong Un, where pastel colors and futuristic shapes are applied to super high-rise buildings, in a retro science-fiction style.
Architects have long dreamed of such "total planning," so it was not difficult for us to fall in love with this city. We wanted to reveal to the world its beauty, a beauty of a different kind, to be preserved when a necessary and inevitable change will eventually occur. In the last four years, the initial fascination we had as architects slowly transformed into empathy for a city with such a strong and peculiar cultural identity, and especially for its people, for whom we hope the future will unfold for the better.
Our photography portrays the puzzling feeling of "fictional reality" that we experienced in North Korea. We took inspiration from a ubiquitous feature in North Korean art: In painting, sculpture and propaganda posters, the sky is represented as a simple gradient of colors, like a hyper-saturated sunset or sunrise, transforming the real into the ideal, a metaphor for the "utopia" of Pyongyang itself. The buildings and cityscapes in the book are framed using a classical architectural approach, with no significant editing, while the sky is completely replaced by a soft gradient of pastel colors, taken from the color palette used by Korean artists for the posters or by the architects for the facades. The contrast between the two parts of the photographs creates a visual juxtaposition where the real part (the building or the city) looks unreal and the unreal part (the sky) could actually be real.
Sticking to the rules is part of the game when you decide to go to North Korea. We won the trust of our guides, the only Koreans we had the opportunity to interact with. This trust not only gave us a certain level of freedom in photographing and getting information but also allowed us to achieve a closer human relationship with them, so we could talk about our lives and their lives, our reality and their reality.
We were amazed by some of our interactions. For example, one of them asked us if Michael Jackson had really died. We were in North Korea on Nov. 9, 2016, with no access to the news, and our guides -- surprisingly -- informed us about the election of Donald Trump. We met the architect who designed the new Pyongyang airport (which was a surprise, as some media reports said he had been killed because Kim Jong Un didn't like the design), and we discovered that he spoke perfect Italian, having studied in Rome for five years. We ate a kimchi pizza together in a new futuristic residential neighborhood, and we ended up in a karaoke bar singing "Bella Ciao," an old Italian song of the resistance against fascism, with our guides. They all knew the lyrics by heart.
The human side of Pyongyang is barely visible in the book; people are small presences in the grand urban space or in front of gigantic statues. But it's there if you look carefully. For all the sober, clean, monumental urban structures, there are hidden spaces for leisure and entertainment, like the many parks -- the city is one of the greenest in Asia -- where people enjoy picnicking, singing and rollerblading. The political space of Kim Il Sung Square, where military parades and mass dances take place, faces the quiet riverfront stroll on the Taedong River, where people walk with children and enjoy the afternoon light.
Cristiano Bianchi, an Italian architect and photographer, and Kristina Drapic, a Serbian architect and graphic designer, are the authors of "Model City: Pyongyang."

Texto completo: The joy in planning a vacation in Europe comes from booking Mediterranean boat trips or researching restaurants in Paris, not the boring details of how you pay for those experiences. But there I was, stuck in a parking lot in Lerici, Italy, because I had forgotten to set up a personal identification number on my credit card (many unmanned kiosks in Europe, like parking ticket machines, require one). That I write about such things for a living only makes the story more embarrassing, so the following checklist has been a crucial part of my European travel prep ever since.
Bring at least two credit cards from different networks
A well-chosen travel credit card should be your main form of payment in Europe. From the London Tube to a neighborhood patisserie, the fraud protection a card offers is unbeatable: You would rather have a thief using your card for their Mitte district shopping spree in Berlin than depleting your actual bank account with your A.T.M. card. Also, the larger spending limit won't crimp your style if a hotel or a rental-car company places a 200 euros hold on the card.
Pick a credit card that does not charge a foreign transaction fee and you'll save yourself up to 3 percent of each purchase. And if you have an American Express or Discover card, carry a Visa or Mastercard too, since these cards are more widely accepted abroad.
Before you leave, alert your bank that you'll be traveling, either with a phone call or through its app. This should let you use your card without incident, although overly cautious financial institutions sometimes mess up and ping you with a fraud alert anyway. While in touch with your bank, see if it allows you to set a P.I.N. on the card (some cards, like the Bank of America Travel Rewards credit card, give you the option). If you don't have a P.I.N., you should still be able to use your credit card in person, and some unmanned kiosks sometimes allow you to skip this step. Chase, which issues Wirecutter's favorite travel rewards card, recommends you push the Enter, Continue, or Cancel button when asked for your P.I.N. If these don't work, you'll have to pay in cash.
Bring one debit card that you can use at European A.T.M.s
Smaller shops may not accept cards or might "pass on the extra processing fees associated with credit cards to customers," said Aaron Klein, a Brookings Institution fellow.
So if you want to pay for that pieróg in cash, consider opening a checking account that doesn't nickel-and-dime you abroad. The ideal option doesn't charge A.T.M. fees, reimburses A.T.M.-operator expenses worldwide, and forgoes foreign transaction fees. Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com, recommends the Schwab Bank High Yield Investor Checking Account, which gives you those benefits. (You need a Charles Schwab brokerage account to get that checking account, but neither one requires a minimum balance.)
If you don't want to set up a bunch of accounts just to avoid fees, check your bank's international A.T.M. partners. Bank of America customers can avoid fees in a host of countries by using designated partner machines (Deutsche Bank in Germany, for example). You likely get better exchange rates at an A.T.M. than you do at a currency-exchange window, or from your bank before you depart.
Bring your mobile wallet
Apple Pay and other digital wallets are picking up steam abroad, and these mobile contactless payment systems (where you wave your phone in front of a payment terminal) could save you a lot of hassle -- especially if you lack cash or don't want to fumble with your wallet.
Make sure you've loaded your cards with no foreign transaction fees on your phone before you take off. Apple Pay should work even if you're in airplane mode, so you don't need a local SIM card to use it.

Texto completo: He makes us believe we already knew about every new exposé,
says media strategist
First, an excerpt from "All the President's Women," a new book by Barry Levine and Monique El-Faizy, ran in Esquire. It detailed 43 new allegations of sexual misconduct and assault by Donald Trump, including an incident in the early 2000s when he was said to have hidden behind a Mar-a-Lago tapestry to grab a woman. Within a week, ProPublica published an investigation into new tax documents indicating that Trump's businesses lied either to lenders or tax authorities (or both) about their value to make more money.
Either story, in any other administration, would be devastating for the president, but these reports barely registered. News organizations moved right along, focusing on Ukraine, Syria and other political matters, while Trump's approval rating barely budged. That's because the president has a way of making any story seem like it's something we already knew about him. Nothing feels revelatory, or like a shock to the public consciousness.
But this is not Trump's genius at work - it's a function of our own cognitive biases. We measure people against what we perceive to be their baseline behavior. If, as evidenced by his history, we believe that Trump is a bad-faith actor with no moral compass (a belief that even some Republicans have expressed), malfeasance is to be expected. We react little to behaviors that in absolute terms are horrifying but that conform to the norm. We're moved only by deviations from our expectations.
So it would be less surprising if a notorious criminal were guilty of a number of crimes than if an upstanding citizen were guilty of a misdemeanor: Each has set a standard of behavior against which their subsequent actions are measured. In Trump's case, he stiffed contractors and drove his own business into bankruptcy six times; lenders stopped loaning him money. He has treated women horribly, with some of that behavior documented by women he's been horrible to, including his ex-wife Ivana, who claimed in a deposition that he raped her. (Trump denies this, and she later said that she did not want her words to be taken in "a literal or criminal" sense.) Before he ever ran for president, Trump had a long history of lying on the record about his business success, his personal life, his intelligence and the time of day (according to an acquaintance). Even his persona on "The Apprentice" was cutthroat, selfish and oblivious to the needs of others. The consistent through-line: Trump views ethics as dispensable features of the middle and lower classes, who have to consider the lives of other people because they lack the power or money that enables contemptuous disregard.
In 2016, it seemed that it might behoove Trump to clean up that image as he went on the campaign trail. Yet when asked about his taxes, he admitted he didn't pay them, which supposedly made him "smart." And when an "Access Hollywood" video featuring him bragging about sexual assault became public, he displayed no embarrassment or remorse beyond a pro forma statement: "I apologize if anyone was offended," he said, while in the same breath dismissing his comments as "locker room banter." Polling showed that the tape's revelations did not change people's opinions of Trump: Both before and after its release, 59 percent of the public said they thought that Trump did not respect women, according to HuffPost. Today, after scandals such as the payoffs to Stormy Daniels, and after E. Jean Carroll's essay alleging that Trump raped her, that figure has somehow fallen to 51 percent. In 2016, 44 percent of Americans said that if the allegations of sexual assault were true, they should disqualify Trump from the presidency; today, only 40 percent would consider them disqualifying.
Years into his presidency, why would anyone be jolted by additional women coming forward, or by the growing paper trail pointing to financial malfeasance? He has long since admitted to both, in public. Trump has made being openly terrible an asset, at least in terms of weathering blowback from additional misdeeds. When Politico/Morning Consult asked voters in May their opinions of Trump as a businessman, after a New York Times report that he had lost more than $1 billion in the 1980s and 1990s, they were evenly split: Forty-three percent said he'd succeeded in business, and 41 percent said he'd been unsuccessful.
The baseline effect is so strong that when Trump does minor things that you'd expect any decent human being to do, like expressing sympathy for hurricane victims and not immediately smearing an alleged sexual assault victim as a liar, the public applauds him. People see a deviation from his normal behavior and take it as a vast improvement, declaring that he seems more "presidential." This defines "presidential" downward to about the altitude of Dante's eighth circle of hell (which is where fraudsters go).
It also explains why scandals from people who produce fewer of them are blown out of proportion. When Hillary Clinton uses a private server for government business, she has to weather endless investigations, but when senior White House advisers Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner do it, Democrats shrug because they're unsurprised, and Republicans attribute it to all manner of good-faith negligence (they're naive; they mean well; how can they be expected to know these things?). Conservatives accuse Joe Biden of allowing his son to grift his way through Ukraine as a beneficiary of nepotism, while Trump installs his daughter in the White House in an official capacity and his sons gleefully utilize the presidency to enhance the Trump Organization, all while pocketing millions of dollars from his golf courses.
In my day job, we create messaging for political candidates and conduct polls. Over and over, messages about Trump's corruption land with a thud. The reality is that voters have a hard time buying the idea that such misconduct affects them in any way at all. They might think it's unfair, but they also overwhelmingly think everything that happens in Washington is corrupt, and that all elites in politics and business are corrupted on some level. They view Trump as a data point on a continuum of corruption, not as an outlier. (Here the baseline is defined by perceptions of elites as a class: selfish cheaters who deceive nonelites all the time to get what they want.)
That appears to be changing incrementally with the impeachment inquiry. So many of Trump's recent misdeeds are wholly unprecedented - including soliciting help from foreign adversaries in damaging his political enemies, openly, publicly and live on television. It's hard not to notice them. A civic education process has begun: If most Americans didn't know that it's illegal to solicit foreign interference in an election, because the issue hadn't come up in their lifetimes, they're learning that now. We're primed as humans to register danger in terms of severity, magnitude and immediacy of threat, and Trump's impeachable offenses affect the whole country. The potential removal of a president has profound implications for all Americans.
In this case, it's important - for ourselves as individuals and for the sake of our democracy - to rethink our baseline expectations. Do we want a Trump presidency that is, to invoke a metaphor from the president's favorite and most expensive hobby, par for the course? Or do we want occupants of the Oval Office to respect its gravity, and to understand that they are public servants who exist to serve the office and not the other way around? Our expectations for Trump may be reasonable in the context of his historical behavior, but we cannot conflate our baseline for Trump with our baseline for the American presidency. They are not the same.

Texto completo: Readers weigh in on a literary divide. Also: Brave Americans who come forward.
To the Editor:
Re "Did Harold Bloom Win the Canon Wars?," by Joe Karaganis and David McClure (Sunday Review, Oct. 20):
The "canon wars" involving the literary scholar Harold Bloom and the novelist Toni Morrison constitute little more than a grandiose name for a squabble in American English departments. This is not meant to diminish the achievement of either but simply to reassess their influence.
I served on faculties with both: as a graduate student and assistant professor at Yale along with Mr. Bloom, and as a professor and dean of the Graduate School at Princeton with Ms. Morrison.
In the departments with which I was associated -- specifically German and comparative literature, and more generally classics, medieval studies and foreign languages -- neither name played a role. With no assistance from Mr. Bloom the Western canon has thrived in those fields, and the additions of Ms. Morrison have had no impact.
If the humanities have declined, it is because the battles over theory and canon have distracted too many colleagues in English departments. As for the STEM subjects, several recent studies have shown that students trained in the humanities have the intellectual flexibility required to adapt when technological change kills jobs in many fields.
When all our students know the linguistic origin and meaning of quid pro quo they will survive nicely.
Theodore Ziolkowski
Princeton, N.J.
To the Editor:
Joe Karaganis and David McClure ask whether Harold Bloom or Toni Morrison "won" the canon wars. It's the wrong question.
The marginalized books and writers Ms. Morrison supported did not replace the works Mr. Bloom promoted. They transformed how we read and understand Mr. Bloom's "classics."
Once you have read Sterling A. Brown's poem "Ma Rainey," with its distinctive presentation of the art and the subject matter of the blues singer, you will inevitably begin to rethink the art and subject matter of landmark poems like T.S. Eliot's "Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock."
Ms. Morrison argued that understanding the powerful "Africanist" presence in American culture transforms how we read American books. She was right. That is her triumph.

To the Editor:
Regarding the brave Americans -- career Foreign Service officers and others -- who are coming forward at great risk to themselves to give evidence of the crimes and corruption of Donald Trump: They are the much-reviled "deep state." Americans, conservative and liberal alike, are very lucky to have them.

Texto completo: Mr. Maurer's wonky fascination with technology led to lamps he made out of scribbled memos, tea strainers and incandescent bulbs with feathered wings.
Ingo Maurer, a German lighting designer who was Promethean in his delivery of illumination -- fashioning lamps out of shattered crockery, scribbled memos, holograms, tea strainers and incandescent bulbs with feathered wings -- died on Monday in Munich. He was 87.
His death, at a hospital, was announced by his company, Ingo Maurer GmbH, which said the cause was complications of a surgical procedure.
Mr. Maurer had a wonky fascination with technology that took nothing away from his reputation as a poet of light, as he was often described.
His first lamp, designed in 1966, was a large crystal bulb enclosing a smaller one. Called simply "Bulb" (his product names would become more fanciful), it won praise from the designer Charles Eames and in 1968 became part of the Museum of Modern Art's collection in New York.
For "YaYaHo," which he made in 1984, he fashioned a lamp in the form of parallel low-voltage wires draped with shaded halogen bulbs that dangled like jewelry. In 2001 he made an early desk lamp using LEDs ("EL.E.DEE") then later attached LEDs to wallpaper in a pattern that resembled twinkling rosettes ("Rose, Rose on the Wall"). In 2005 he embedded wafer-like organic LEDs in glass tabletops, creating starry clusters with no visible connections. In 2012, he collaborated with Moritz Waldemeyer, another German designer, to produce a narrow table lamp with 256 LEDs simulating flickering candlelight ("My New Flame").
"He loved the technology that was coming out, but to him it was like Houdini," said his longtime friend Kim Hastreiter, the co-founder of Paper magazine. "He used the technology in his lamps like a magic trick."
Even so, Mr. Maurer never renounced the old-fashioned incandescent light bulb, with its golden hue and emotional power.
With "Lucellino," he attached goose-feather wings and suspended the bulb like a hovering Cupid, and with "Wo bist du, Edison ... ?" ("Where are you, Edison?") he reinvented it as a hologram projected on a shade.
But while the materials he used for his lamps made them artful and cheeky, Mr. Maurer professed to be more interested in the medium of light itself.
"I'm very lucky to work with the material which does not exist," he said in 2017 on a podcast produced by the design retailer Arkitektura. He couldn't take light in his hand and bend it and look at it from different sides, he explained; light is not a thing, he said, but "the spirit which catches you inside."
Ingo Raphael Maurer was born on May 12, 1932, to Theodor and Henny (Boeckmann) Maurer on Reichenau, an island in Lake Constance, in southern Germany near the Swiss border. His father, a fisherman and inventor, died when Ingo was 15, and his brother, the eldest of his four siblings, ordered him to leave school and find work. He could apprentice, he was told, either as a butcher or as a typographer at a local newspaper.
He chose the newspaper. Though it wasn't an obvious career path for a lighting designer, he would later point out the lessons taught by the airy gaps between letter forms. The sparkling water of Lake Constance had also been a mesmerizing influence on him, he said.
Mr. Maurer traveled to the United States in 1960, settling in San Francisco with his German girlfriend, Dorothee Becker, and working as a graphic designer. He was there for three years, soaking up Pop Art inspirations that resurfaced throughout his career.
Returning to Munich as a newlywed, he founded a company called Design M to produce his Bulb lamp, as well as a wall storage unit called Wall-All invented by Ms. Becker. (It is currently sold by Vitra under the name Uten.Silo.) The couple divorced in the mid-1970s.
His company, now known as Ingo Maurer GmbH, eventually expanded to include 70 employees and took on all of its own manufacturing locally. It also executed ambitious civic and private commissions.
Mr. Maurer is survived by his daughters, Sarah Utermoehlen and Claude Maurer, the company's managing director; and four grandchildren. Mr. Maurer's second wife, Jenny Lau, died of cancer in 2014.
A handsome man with a square jaw and flowing hair that turned paper white in his last decades, Mr. Maurer had a great deal of charisma, which helped propel him through hard economic times.
"The Italians even thought he was Italian," said Mariangela Viterbo, the head of a public relations firm in Milan, who met him in the late 1960s when he presented Bulb at a trade show in Turin. "In that period the big vision of modern design was Danish or Finnish. Ingo came with something more similar to our temperament -- more ironic, more joyful. It made a difference."
A crowning moment of disruption occurred at the 1994 Euroluce lighting fair in Milan, where Mr. Maurer introduced a chandelier made of suspended porcelain dish shards. The fixture was initially called "Zabriskie Point," after the Michelangelo Antonioni film, which has a scene of a house exploding in slow-motion. At least one startled Italian visitor to the fair exclaimed, "Porca miseria!," a phrase that translates roughly as "Dammit!" Mr. Maurer decided that he preferred that name for the chandelier.
Several Porca miserias! are still made, by hand, each year, but Mr. Maurer was never comfortable with the high price tag, upward of 30,000 pounds (about $ 38,000), as quoted by at least one website. He donated some of the profits to a family he once met in Aswan, Egypt.
Not everyone was charmed by his antic designs. Reviewing a 2007 retrospective of Mr. Maurer's work at the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum in Manhattan, Ken Johnson wrote in The New York Times, "While some of his pieces are lovely to look at, his work in general is so precious and so busily eager to please that it will make you pine for the reproving austerity of the fluorescent-light Minimalist Dan Flavin."
Paola Antonelli, the senior design curator at the Museum of Modern Art, disagreed.
"I've never seen anyone experiment with such abandon," she said, "and experimentation is the opposite of wanting to please."
Ms. Antonelli provided Mr. Maurer with a showcase in 1998, when she included his lamps in a design exhibition, and hung "Porca Miseria!" in the current MoMA exhibition called "Energy."
She said that at one of his design events, Mr. Maurer handed out paper 3-D glasses that created a vision of little hearts when the viewer looked toward the light.
"That was so him," she said of his whimsy. "In a pair of throwaway glasses."

(1994); and halogen bulbs dangling like jewelry in "YaYaHo" (1984). (PHOTOGRAPHS BY FRED R.

More about the Hoffman family ghost

Texto completo: Last fall — just before Halloween — I wrote a column about a mysterious ghost who allegedly invaded the Wooster home of the David Hoffman family 150 years ago. The information, sent to me by Wooster historian Harry McClarran, had appeared in a book of newspaper articles from the 1870s.
Back then, the Wooster poltergeist received wide-spread press coverage ... all the way to the East Coast where an article appeared in the May 24, 1871, edition of The New York Times.
Not long after last year’s Daily Record column ran, author Chris Woodyard of Dayton wrote to say she had more Hoffman ghost information. She wrote about the poltergeist in her book “The Face in the Window: Haunting Ohio Tales” under a chapter titled “A Family Bewitched: The Hoffman Poltergeist of Wooster.”
“The ghost,” explained the author, “had been labeled ‘IT’ by those it tormented. The mysterious pranks that afflicted the Hoffman family were begun in June 1869, while the family lived in Millersburg.”
At first, Mr. Hoffman noticed his money was disappearing. Then food items and articles of clothing began to disappear. It was reported that crockery fell without the aid of human hands, and stones, eggs and other small objects were tossed wildly through the house.
Having tried unsuccessfully to rid the home of its malignant spirit, Mr. Hoffman decided to move his wife and three children from Millersburg to Wooster — hoping to escape the mischievous “IT.” At the same time, Mr. Hoffman decided to move into his own temporary quarters at the mill where he was employed and where, it turned out, he escaped further ghostly pranks.
But, the ghostly spirit followed his wife and three children to their new address at 504 W. Liberty St. The clothes of the mother and eldest daughter were slashed and the family linens were found stuffed into the mouth of the cellar drain. Poundings were heard on the walls at night, dishes rattled and stones were thrown through doors and windows.
The Wooster Republican reported on May 25, 1871, “clairvoyant and medium Madame Thompson of Cleveland” had come to Wooster attempting to communicate with the spirit.
Woodyard explained the local press declared “a most helpful watch had been kept” and hundreds of men and women had visited and inspected the premises without finding any clue to solving the mystery.
Eventually the Hoffman family moved to Akron. Although husband and wife never divorced, they never lived together again.
Today the existence of the Hoffman ghost remains a mystery.
FYI
Countless nationally known entertainers have performed on the College of Wooster campus. Among them were actors Raymond Massey, Charles Laughton, Vincent Price, Ernest Borgnine, musicians Doc Severinson, the Beach Boys, Chicago, Sly and the Family Stone, Charlie Daniels, Ravi Shankar and basketball whiz kids the Harlem Globe Trotters. Recently musician Pharrell Williams spoke on campus.

Texto completo: Add CNN’s Chris Cuomo to the list of Democrats and media liberals perpetuating the myth that there’s a law somewhere granting anonymity to government whistleblowers.
No such law exists. Yet Cuomo, who claims to have completed law school, looked so uncomfortable on his show Thursday night as he tried to invent one.
“The reason you protect the whistleblower is because there is a law that protects whistleblowers from whatever it is that they reasonably have a fear of,” he said, making up a policy on the spot. “That’s why we protect their name.”
He admitted that he had personally “heard names, one specifically, about who this is supposed to be,” referring to the career government employee who has set off an impeachment inquiry over President Trump’s phone call with the president of Ukraine. But, Cuomo said, he wouldn’t divulge the name “because I respect the law.”
Cuomo may respect the law, but what about the intelligence of his viewers? It must have been obvious to them that he was trying to pull one over.
If there’s a law that forbids Cuomo from naming a “whistleblower,” shouldn’t CNN tell us which one it is? Perhaps he could even put up one of those sassy “fact check” graphics that explains it.
But no, they didn’t do that, because the statement is false. There is no such law.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York promulgated the same fiction earlier this week, writing to the intelligence community to say, in part, that “the whistleblower anonymity is protected by law.”
No, it’s not. The Whistleblower Protection Act and the follow-up law that enhanced it do nothing more than shield a federal employee from demotion, termination, or disciplinary action by superiors if he discloses information about waste and abuse or a violation of law within the government. There is no guarantee of anonymity.
The law does mandate that the inspector general of any agency where a complaint is filed not disclose the person’s identity, but that does not apply to anyone else, let alone journalists in the business of uncovering and reporting government secrets.
If the anonymity of the “whistleblower” is “protected by law,” there are a few people at the New York Times who should be in jail right now. Four of the paper’s journalists authored the first story to break details about who the career government employee is. The editor, Dean Baquet, subsequently defended the decision to report the information about him, which means he knows who it is too.
Why haven’t any of them been prosecuted for knowing the identity of this guy? Why aren't their sources for the information being investigated and prosecuted? Easy! It is because there’s no law that says the public doesn't get to know his name!
Literally, the only reason we don’t know his name is because it’s being hidden, in large part by the national media. (The Washington Examiner’s editorial position is that the public has a right to know this person’s identity.)
It looks like Chris Cuomo, just like many journalists in Washington, knows who the “whistleblower” is. If he doesn’t want to tell us the identity, that’s fine. But there’s no law preventing him from doing so.

Muslim student disqualified in Ohio high school cross-country race for wearing hijab

Texto completo: Noor Alexandria Abukaram ran a personal-best time in a cross-country meet last Saturday. Then the 16-year-old Ohio high school student found out her race didn't count.
Abukaram was disqualified from her team's meet for wearing a hijab while in competition. A practicing Muslim who attends private Islamic school in Sylvania, Ohio, Abukaram competes in athletics for the local public school, Northview High School.
"It was like your worst nightmare to have to compete and then find out that you got disqualified and it's because of something that you love," Abukaram told CNN. "Why should you have to sacrifice your religion and a part of who you are to run, to do another thing that you're very passionate about?"
NFL TRADE DEADLINE: Five teams that should be buyers and five that should be sellers
NOT ENOUGH: Astros must pay a steeper price for lies
Abukaram told several news media outlets she had competed in six meets this season without any problems. She also said officials did not address her hijab immediately after the race. Meet officials told her that her coach ultimately didn't fill out the correct paperwork.
“When (her coach) told me that, I was like, what do you mean I have to have a signed waiver for me to race?” she told The New York Times. “They don’t have to prepare anything special for me, I don’t have any disabilities, I am just running just like anybody else. When he said that, I didn’t think, ‘Oh, Coach, why didn’t you do this?’ I thought, ‘Why do we even have to do this in the first place?’”
In an emotional Facebook post, Abukaram wrote, in part: "I feel like my rights as an athlete were violated this weekend. . . . . I should not have to get a waiver signed and approved by OSAA to allow me to race due to my religious head covering. "
Tim Stried, a spokesman for the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA), told USA TODAY in a statement Friday that the organization had been examining the rule and was considering dropping the waiver requirement.
“The student-athlete can run this weekend at regionals, and the OHSAA is also already looking at this specific uniform regulation to modify it in the future so that religious headwear does not require a waiver," Stried's statement read.
"If the coach or school had obtained the waiver previously, all this could have been avoided. The race official was simply enforcing this rule since a waiver had not been submitted. After the race, the OHSAA communicated with the school, which then submitted a waiver request. The request was approved immediately. This emphasizes our continual requirement to also assist in educating our coaches on all sport rules. We support the student-athlete and wish her the best of luck this weekend at regionals. ”
Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate, heard about the situation and expressed her criticism of the school on Thursday over Twitter, blasting "discriminatory dress codes. "
“I’ve got your back, Noor,” Warren wrote. “Every kid should be able to feel safe and welcome at school — and Muslim students should never be denied participation in school activities. ”

U.S. News: Barr Probe Shifts Into Criminal Inquiry

Texto completo: Attorney General William Barr's expanding review of the Russia probe has evolved into a criminal investigation, according to a person familiar with the matter, giving a federal prosecutor who is leading the inquiry the ability to subpoena witnesses and use a grand jury.
It couldn't immediately be determined what prompted the change or what evidence of a crime Mr. Barr and the federal prosecutor leading the probe, John Durham, may have found. When the inquiry was announced in May, Justice Department officials described it as a review that could prompt changes to counterintelligence investigations of political campaigns.
The ramping up of the review into an investigation that could bring criminal charges comes as Congress pursues an impeachment inquiry centered on President Trump's efforts to persuade Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, including former Vice President Joe Biden and his son. Mr. Trump and his Republican allies have long urged the Justice Department to prove whether the president and his associates were unduly targeted for surveillance during the 2016 campaign by biased investigators.
Mr. Barr and Mr. Durham are looking into the underpinnings of the FBI's probe into Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election, a review by the attorney general that has prompted criticism abroad and in the U.S. Mr. Barr has said he wants to understand if the U.S. government's intelligence-gathering efforts in the probe's early stages were legal and appropriate.
It is unclear when the change in the status of the probe, which was earlier reported by the New York Times, occurred.
"These reports, if true, raise profound new concerns that the Department of Justice under Attorney General William Barr has lost its independence and become a vehicle for President Trump's political revenge," said Reps. Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.) and Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), chairmen of the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, respectively.
Meanwhile, Italy's prime minister and high-ranking officials in Australia defended their participation in Mr. Barr's inquiry in the face of attacks by opposition parties and said their governments didnt engage in wrongdoing.
The Italian intelligence services made clear they have no connection to a professor whose encounter with a Trump campaign aide in 2016 helped spur the Federal Bureau of Investigation's counterintelligence probe, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said Wednesday.
During two meetings in Rome in August and September, Mr. Barr expressed interest in London-based academic Joseph Mifsud, who was affiliated with a university in Rome at the time he told a Trump campaign adviser in 2016 that the Russians had "dirt" on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of her emails.
The adviser, George Papadopoulos, relayed the tip to an Australian diplomat, who gave the information to the FBI, triggering what later became special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation that ultimately didn't find the Trump campaign conspired with Moscow's election interference.
Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne defended a decision by the country's ambassador to the U.S. to offer to assist in Mr. Barr's review, rather than wait for help to be requested.

Texto completo: The New Jersey attorney general sent a letter to President Trump's club in Colts Neck giving it 30 days to contest being stripped of its liquor license.
New Jersey officials are moving to revoke the liquor license at one of President Trump's golf clubs, which they say continued to serve a man who was already intoxicated and got into a fatal car crash shortly after leaving the club in 2015.
If successful, the move, first reported by The Washington Post, would be a financially damaging blow to the club, in Colts Neck, depriving it of the ability to meet the needs of thirsty golfers coming off the course and wedding parties eager to celebrate into the night.
The potential punishment is described in an Oct. 21 letter sent to the golf club by the office of the New Jersey attorney general, Gurbir Grewal, who was appointed to the position last year by Gov. Philip D. Murphy, a Democrat.
The letter gives the golf club 30 days to contest the move. If the license is ultimately revoked by the state, the decision could be challenged in court or the club could seek to have it reinstated in two years.
A representative of the Trump Organization did not respond to a request for comment.
The club in Colts Neck, near the Jersey Shore, is one of three in New Jersey that Mr. Trump owns. The ability of the others, in Bedminster and Pine Hill, to sell alcohol could also be threatened by the state's action. Under New Jersey law, the holder of a liquor license that is revoked must relinquish any others it controls for two years.
Liquor sales are a crucial revenue source for many golf clubs, said Jay Karen, the chief executive of the National Golf Course Owners Association.
"Golf is a combination of sport and leisure," Mr. Karen said. "And alcohol finds itself at the crossroads of that."
"Just the golf itself is not a high-profit-margin business," he added. That, he said, means alcohol sales become "pretty important to the whole operation from a profit standpoint."
Though he did not refer specifically to the Colts Neck club, which bills itself as a premier destination for weddings and other events, Mr. Karen said that clubs like it could be hit especially hard by the loss of a liquor license.
A notice of charges attached to Mr. Grewal's letter says the action was prompted by two infractions committed by the club on Aug. 30, 2015: serving liquor other than beer from carts out on the course -- in violation of the club's license -- and by serving liquor to the man, Andrew Halder, who already appeared to be intoxicated.
The two infractions together might typically result in a 25-day suspension of the club's license, says the notice, from the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control.
"However, due to the aggravating circumstances in this case, the division will seek revocation of the license based upon the total circumstances," the notice says. It does not elaborate on those circumstances, and a spokeswoman for Mr. Grewal declined further comment.
Shortly after leaving "a local golf club" on that date, Mr. Halder, of Woodcliff Lake, N.J., flipped his car on a highway ramp several miles from the Trump club, according to local news reports.
The car rolled over, and Mr. Halder's father, Gary, a passenger, was tossed out. The elder Mr. Halder later died at a hospital, news reports said.
Law enforcement authorities said at the time that Mr. Halder's blood-alcohol level was over the legal limit when the accident happened, according to news reports. He was charged with vehicular homicide and driving while intoxicated.
Mr. Halder pleaded guilty to vehicular homicide in January 2018, according to a court document. He was sentenced to three years' probation in April 2018. Mitchell Ansell, the lawyer who represented him at the sentencing, did not return a call seeking comment.
Mr. Trump bought the Colts Neck club, previously known as Shadow Isles, in 2008 for a reported $ 28 million. According to his most recent financial disclosure, he took out a mortgage from Amboy Bank, which is based in Old Bridge, N.J., that he is still paying off.
Mr. Trump's latest financial disclosure shows that the club had about $ 6.76 million in revenue last year, about 5 percent less than it took in the previous year.

Texto completo: A federal judge said the education secretary had violated an order to stop collecting on loans owed by students from a now-defunct for-profit chain of colleges.
WASHINGTON -- A federal judge on Thursday fined Education Secretary Betsy DeVos for contempt of court, ruling that she had violated an order to stop collecting on loans owed by students from a now-defunct for-profit chain of colleges.
Magistrate Judge Sallie Kim of the Federal District Court in San Francisco ordered the Education Department to pay a $ 100,000 fine. The money will go toward various remedies for students who are owed debt relief after President Barack Obama's Education Department found they were defrauded by the chain, Corinthian Colleges, which collapsed in 2014.
The ruling is a victory for the more than 60,000 students who have been on a financial roller coaster since Corinthian imploded, after state and federal officials found that it lured students through deceptive recruitment practices and falsified job placement rates.
The decision stems from a class-action lawsuit filed in 2017 by the Project on Predatory Student Lending of the Legal Services Center of Harvard Law School and the group Housing and Economic Rights Advocates, both of which represent former Corinthian students. For more than a year, the students' lawyers argued that Ms. DeVos had illegally punished thousands of cheated students who were owed relief from the federal government.
Toby Merrill, director of the project, said that the ruling demonstrated "the extreme harm" of Ms. DeVos's actions. "Secretary DeVos has repeatedly and brazenly violated the law to collect for-profit college students' debts and deny their rights, and today she has been held accountable," she said.
In a video statement posted on Twitter, Mark Brown, chief operating officer of the Education Department's Federal Student Aid office, said that loan servicers had "mistakenly" billed about 16,000 students and parents.
"Although these actions were not done with ill intent, students and parents were affected and we take full responsibility for that," Mr. Brown said.
He said the department had taken swift action to respond, including refunding nearly all payments that borrowers should not have had to make, returning tax refunds and wages that were seized, and updating credit reports for affected students and parents. He said the department had also formally reprimanded loan servicers that collected debts, and initiated personnel action against Education Department employees who failed in their oversight roles.
In 2015, Arne Duncan, the education secretary at the time, announced that the department would use a provision known as "borrower defense to repayment" to forgive the federal student debts of Corthinian's students. "You'd have to be made of stone not to feel for these students," he said. "This is our first major action on this but obviously it won't be the last."
But the department moved slowly to establish a formal process for discharging the students' debts, and by the time Mr. Obama left office, only 12,000 Corinthian students had their ledgers wiped clean. Tens of thousands more awaited relief.
Instead of fully eliminating those students' debts, however, Ms. DeVos instituted a new system for borrower defense claims that granted little to no debt forgiveness if those students were found to have earned a livable wage. The Project on Predatory Student Lending filed a lawsuit challenging that system.
Last year, Magistrate Judge Kim found the system illegal, ruling that the Education Department had violated borrowers' privacy by obtaining and misusing their earnings data from the Social Security Administration. She issued an injunction ordering the department to stop using the data and collecting the debts of Corinthian students. The department appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and is waiting for a ruling.
But the department, through the outside student loan servicers that it pays to handle borrowers' accounts, kept pursuing the debts and even garnished some students' tax refunds and wages. The department's loan servicers sent at least 16,000 Corinthian borrowers bills for payments they did not actually owe. The students' lawyers asked the court to halt those collections and punish the department for its actions.
In a response to scathing criticism from Senator Elizabeth Warren over her handling of the debt collection, Ms. DeVos wrote on Twitter this month: "Loan servicers made an error on a small # of loans. We know & we're fixing it."
Magistrate Judge Kim made it clear this month that she believed the department had acted badly. "I'm astounded, really," she said during a fiery hearing. "I feel like there have to be some consequences for the violation of my order 16,000 times."
In her ruling on Thursday, Magistrate Judge Kim wrote that the department had made "only minimal efforts to comply" with her order, and that it had "harmed individual borrowers who were forced to repay loans." She also ordered the Education Department to file monthly status reports detailing its compliance.
The Project on Predatory Lending said that more than 3,000 borrowers made payments that they were not, in fact, required to make. More than 800 students have had their credit reports tarnished, and 1,800 had their wages garnished or tax refunds seized. More than 1,100 remain in limbo because the department has not yet confirmed whether they are in the correct repayment status.
The department has essentially stopped evaluating borrower defense claims -- leaving borrowers in limbo, sometimes for years -- while it waits for the courts to resolve its appeal. The agency had 210,000 pending claims awaiting a decision as of June, up from the 106,000 claims it had sitting in its queue a year earlier.
In August, the Education Department rewrote its rules for the borrower-defense program, making it significantly harder for borrowers to qualify. The new policies will apply to federal student loans made from July 2020 onward.

Texto completo: The No. 2 Pentagon official told Ms. Cooper, the military's Russia-Ukraine expert, not to talk to Congress. She did anyway.
WASHINGTON -- The White House has declared that the executive branch will not cooperate with the House's impeachment inquiry, but some officials have nevertheless provided testimony to Congress about what they know about whether President Trump's attempts to pressure the Ukrainian government into investigating his political rivals were a quid pro quo in return for aid.
One such witness, Laura Cooper, a Pentagon official, received a warning letter that shows how the administration has attempted to persuade officials to keep silent. Ms. Cooper appeared before impeachment investigators on Wednesday during a closed-door session that was delayed by Republican lawmakers who burst into the House Intelligence Committee's secure suite to protest the inquiry.
Below is a copy of the letter Ms. Cooper received, obtained and annotated with context and analysis by The New York Times.

DEPUTY SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
1010 DEFENSE PENTAGON
WASHINGTON, DC 20301-1010
OCT 22 2019
The date stamp shows that the deputy secretary of defense, David L. Norquist, sent this warning letter on Tuesday, the day before Ms. Cooper was scheduled to give voluntary, private testimony. That same day, Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat of California and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, signed a subpoena stating that Ms. Cooper was legally required to appear.
Daniel Levin
White & Case LLP
701 Thirteenth Street, NW
Washington, DC 20005-3807
Daniel Levin, Ms. Cooper's lawyer, is a former federal prosecutor who held senior positions in both Bush administrations. He served as chief of staff to William P. Barr in his first stint as attorney general in the George Bush administration, and in several roles in the George W. Bush administration, including as chief of staff to Robert S. Mueller III, then the director of the F.B.I., and as the acting head of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel.
Dear Mr. Levin:
I understand that you have been retained by Ms. Laura Cooper, the Department's Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia, as her private counsel for a deposition to be conducted jointly by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the Committee on Oversight and Reform, "[p]ursuant to the House of Representatives' impeachment inquiry." The Department's October 15, 2019 letter to the Chairs of the three House Committees [Tab A] expressed its belief that the customary process of oversight and accommodation has historically served the interests of congressional oversight committees and the Department well. The Committees' purported "impeachment inquiry," however, presents at least two issues of great importance.
Ms. Cooper is a senior specialist in Russia-related issues for the Pentagon. A career official, she was one of many who tried to get the Trump administration to release a large package of American military aid to Ukraine, which Congress had appropriated to help the country resist Russian aggression. That aid package is at the heart of the Ukraine affair.
The first issue is the Committees' continued, blanket refusal to allow Department Counsel to be present at depositions of Department employees. Department Counsel's participation protects against the improper release of privileged or classified information, particularly material covered by the executive privilege which is the President's alone to assert and to waive. Excluding Department Counsel places the witness in the untenable position of having to decide whether to answer the Committees' questions or to assert Executive Branch confidentiality interests without an attorney from the Executive Branch present to advise on those interests.
This is part of a recurring separation of powers dispute. The House has said that because the Constitution permits it to set its own rules and gives it broad oversight and impeachment powers, it can lawfully exclude an executive branch lawyer who might otherwise instruct witnesses not to answer questions about matters that might be subject to executive privilege.
It violates settled practice and may jeopardize future accommodation. Furthermore, the Department of Justice has concluded that "congressional subpoenas that purport to require agency employees to appear without agency counsel are legally invalid and are not subject to civil or criminal enforcement." See Attempted Exclusion of Agency Counsel from Congressional Depositions of Agency Employees, 43 Op. O.L.C. (May 23, 2019) [Tab B].
Steven A. Engel, a Trump political appointee who heads the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, produced a memo in May asserting that congressional subpoenas to government officials for testimony without an administration lawyer present are invalid. That theory provides a legal shield for officials who have been subpoenaed but do not want to testify because it means that the Justice Department will not prosecute them for criminal contempt of Congress. Congressional lawyers contest this interpretation of the law. But even if it is accurate, it would not, by itself, stop an official from voluntarily choosing to comply.
The second issue is the absence of authority for the Committees to conduct an impeachment inquiry. In its October 15, 2019 letter, the Department conveyed concerns about the Committees' lack of authority to initiate an impeachment inquiry given the absence of a delegation of such authority by House Rule or Resolution. This correspondence echoed an October 8, 2019 letter from the White House Counsel [Tab C] expressing the President's view that the inquiry was "contrary to the Constitution of the United States and all past bipartisan precedent" and "violates fundamental fairness and constitutionally mandated due process."
The full House chamber has not voted for a resolution authorizing an impeachment inquiry, as it did at the start of the Nixon and Clinton impeachment efforts in 1974 and 1998. Mr. Trump's legal team point to the lack of a vote as a sign that the process is a sham. House Democrats say nothing in the Constitution or House Rules requires such a resolution, and note that impeachments of other federal officials, like judges, have not started with a resolution.
This letter informs you and Ms. Cooper of the Administration-wide direction that Executive Branch personnel "cannot participate in [the impeachment] inquiry under these circumstances" [Tab C]. In the event that the Committees issue a subpoena to compel Ms. Cooper's appearance, you should be aware that the Supreme Court has held, in United States v. Rumely, 345 U.S. 41 (1953), that a person cannot be sanctioned for refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena unauthorized by House Rule or Resolution.
This is the key question. The White House has ordered executive branch officials not to give documents or testimony to Congress "under these circumstances," and Ms. Cooper was pointedly reminded of that fact before she received a subpoena. After receiving one, she went on to testify to the committee anyway -- as have several State Department employees. The letter leaves ambiguous whether such actions would be insubordinate, or whether a subpoena changes the relevant circumstances.
As yet, none of the witnesses who are current federal employees have been fired. Notably, the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, forbids interfering with or denying federal employees a right to furnish information to lawmakers.
To reiterate, the Department respects the oversight role of Congress and stands ready to work with the Committees should there be an appropriate resolution of outstanding legal issues. Any such resolution would have to consider the constitutional prerogatives and confidentiality interests of the co-equal Executive Branch, see Tab D, and ensure fundamental fairness to any Executive Branch employees involved in this process, including Ms. Cooper.
Sincerely,
[signed]
David L. Norquist

Texto completo: The president was not mentioned in the indictment of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman. But then came a federal court hearing.
The criminal case against two associates of President Trump's private lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, became explicitly connected to the president on Wednesday when a defense lawyer made a surprising argument that some of the evidence gathered in the investigation could be subject to executive privilege.
The two men, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were arrested and accused of making illegal political campaign contributions in exchange for influence. The indictment filed by federal prosecutors did not name or identify Mr. Giuliani or Mr. Trump in connection with the charges.
But Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman have been linked to Mr. Giuliani's attempts on behalf of Mr. Trump to gather damaging information in Ukraine about the president's political foes. That campaign is the focus of House Democrats' impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump.
The executive privilege argument given on Wednesday drew renewed attention to the work Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman conducted to benefit Mr. Trump, as well as to the ties between the two men, the president and Mr. Giuliani.
Here is what we know about the relationship between the two men and President Trump:
The two men have met Mr. Trump but never worked directly for him
So far, no evidence has emerged to suggest that Mr. Parnas or Mr. Fruman directly worked for the president, and Mr. Parnas's lawyer denied in court on Wednesday that his client had worked for the United States government in connection to Ukraine.
After Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman were arrested earlier this month, Mr. Trump told reporters that he did not know them and said that he thought they might be Mr. Giuliani's clients. "Now it's possible that I have a picture with them, because I have a picture with everybody," the president said on the White House South Lawn.
Indeed photos exist showing Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman have had at least brief interactions with Mr. Trump.
In March 2018, Mr. Trump took a photo with Mr. Fruman at a fund-raiser at Mar-a-Lago, the president's private club in Florida. In the photo, featured in an article on Forum Daily, the president is giving two thumbs-up to the camera.
Mr. Fruman told Forum Daily, which bills itself as the "voice of Russian-speaking America," that he was invited to the event by the president.
Mr. Parnas also posted a photo on social media in June of himself with Mr. Trump. In the post, he wished the president a happy birthday. "I am honored to call you Mr. President!!!" he said. "And my friend!!"
The same photo was shared in a since-deleted Facebook post a month earlier. In that post, captured by BuzzFeed News, Mr. Parnas said he and Mr. Trump shared an "incredible dinner and even better conversation" at the White House.
The two appear to have met even earlier. According to Politico, a photo from March 2014 shows Mr. Parnas and Mr. Trump together at an outdoor event. (CNN later identified it as a fashion show held at a golf tournament.)
In addition to Mr. Trump, Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman appear to have met with at least one other Trump family member. Another deleted post from May -- also documented by BuzzFeed -- showed Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman meeting with the president's son, Donald Trump Jr.
Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman have donated to Mr. Trump's campaign efforts
In late October 2016, not long before Mr. Trump was elected, Mr. Parnas made a $ 50,000 donation to the Trump Victory PAC and contributed the maximum $ 2,700 to Mr. Trump's campaign, according to public records. He also gave more than $ 33,000 to the Republican National Committee.
Then, in April 2018, Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman incorporated an energy-trading company named Global Energy Producers. Not long after, that company made major donations to political action committees supporting Mr. Trump and his political allies, including a $ 325,000 gift to America First Action, a Trump-affiliated super PAC.
Federal prosecutors have accused Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman of hiding the origin of that donation and have charged them with falsifying records and lying to the Federal Election Commission.
According to the indictment, the two used their company to skirt campaign-finance reporting requirements and make illegal contributions. Prosecutors said in court documents that the company never engaged in energy trading.
The two men were associates of Mr. Giuliani, who was working on Mr. Trump's behalf
Last year, a company co-founded by Mr. Parnas -- Fraud Guarantee -- retained Mr. Giuliani for what Mr. Giuliani told The New York Times was legal and business advice. Mr. Giuliani has acknowledged that he received $ 500,000 related to that work.
But Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman appear to have assisted Mr. Giuliani in other endeavors as well. Over the past year, the two men worked with Ukrainian officials and put Mr. Giuliani in contact with other people in the country as he sought damaging information about political rivals of Mr. Trump and his allies.
In May, The Times reported that Mr. Parnas, who was born in Ukraine, helped plan a trip for Mr. Giuliani to that country. Mr. Giuliani wanted to meet with Ukraine's recently elected president and push him to launch investigations that might benefit Mr. Trump's re-election campaign, including one into the former vice president, Joseph R. Biden Jr., and his son Hunter.
At the time, Mr. Parnas was portraying himself as a representative of Mr. Giuliani on the Trump-related matters. He also advised Mr. Giuliani on energy deals in the region.
Prosecutors have also connected Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman to the effort to recall the United States ambassador to Ukraine, Marie L. Yovanovitch, who had been criticized by many of Mr. Trump's allies.
A lawyer argued the men's work for Mr. Giuliani might be covered by executive privilege
The professional relationship between Mr. Parnas and Mr. Giuliani is at the heart of the suggestion that materials in the case might be protected by executive privilege, which is the president's power to limit access to executive branch information about sensitive or confidential issues.
On Wednesday, Mr. Parnas's lawyer noted Mr. Giuliani had been retained by Mr. Trump and Mr. Parnas at the same time.
That raised the possibility that the White House might invoke executive privilege to protect some of the voluminous evidence in the case, the lawyer, Edward B. MacMahon Jr., said. It also meant, he said, that some of the evidence in the case was subject to attorney-client privilege, which preserves the confidentiality of communications between lawyers and clients.
"These are issues we need to be very sensitive to," Mr. MacMahon told the judge. "I'm not telling you I know how to resolve this."
Earlier John M. Dowd, a lawyer representing Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman in the impeachment investigation, went even further, arguing that the two men had helped Mr. Giuliani on behalf of Mr. Trump, and so their work was covered by executive privilege.
At the time, the House committee directing the impeachment inquiry requested that Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman testify and provide documents about their work in Ukraine for Mr. Giuliani.
They refused. In a letter to Congress, Mr. Dowd, who was once a lawyer for Mr. Trump, argued not only that Mr. Parnas's and Mr. Fruman's work for Mr. Giuliani was confidential under the executive privilege rule, but that, effectively, the two also had attorney-client privilege with Mr. Giuliani and possibly, by extension, with Mr. Trump.

Texto completo: Writers, directors and other creators share recommendations for how to spend the scariest night of the year.
You'd think that Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, would have plenty of advice on how to spend Halloween. After all, she's made a career out of highlighting the spooky and macabre.
But think again. "I haven't done anything but work on Halloween for the last 38 years, except when I had a baby in 1994," she said recently while preparing for appearances this weekend at the Chiller Theater convention in Parsippany, N.J. "When people ask me what I'd like to do, I'm like: anything but work!"
Fortunately, I found some others with horror in their bones to share recommendations on how to spend the scariest night of the year. The responses have been condensed and edited.
Paul Tremblay
Author, 'Growing Things and Other Stories'
Halloween is a time when I dip into short stories. I'd pair two of my favorite modern collections with classic collections.
"Things We Lost in the Fire" by Mariana Enriquez, an Argentine writer, reminds me of Shirley Jackson's "The Lottery and Other Stories." Enriquez's stories are haunting and disturbing and play with ambiguity. But they also mine sociopolitical and gender anxieties like Jackson did. Enriquez's "The Dirty Kid" is one of the most disturbing stories I've read in a while.
Nathan Ballingrud's "Wounds: Six Stories From the Border of Hell" is a perfect match with Clive Barker's "Books of Blood." Both collections really stretch the boundaries of the genre by employing these grand, horrific worlds. Nathan's story "The Butcher's Table" reminds me of the first time I read Barker's "In the Hills, the Cities." It's horrifying, but there's beauty.
Chelsea Stardust
Director, 'Satanic Panic'
Starting Oct. 1, I watch a horror movie every day. On Oct. 31, I close out the season with a small group of friends who are die-hard fans of Halloween. We watch classic Halloween-themed cartoons like "It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown" and "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow." Then we put on John Carpenter's masterpiece, "Halloween," followed by the underrated gem "Halloween III: Season of the Witch."
Travis Stevens
Director, 'Girl on the Third Floor'
I'd check out the Dakota building where parts of "Rosemary's Baby" were filmed. It was a rare horror film that represented New York at its most sophisticated and aesthetically pleasing rather than grimy. Seeing some of those creepy details up close would be a lot of fun.
Caryn Coleman
Director of Programming and Special Projects, Nitehawk Cinema
Even though I'm a die-hard horror film fan, dressing up for Halloween has never been my thing. I've always preferred to spend this sacred holiday in a dark room watching scary movies -- until I had a kid. Now, the best thing to do for Halloween is take my 5-year-old trick-or-treating on the best street in Greenpoint: Milton Street. The houses go all out with their decorations, and it has that old-school feel of actually walking up to get the candy. It's packed, fun and amazing each year.
Frank Sabatella
Director, 'The Shed'
I recommend a trip to the village of Sleepy Hollow in Tarrytown, N.Y. Not only is the village itself beautiful this time of year, but it embraces the spirit of Halloween and Washington Irving's legend.
I like to start my day at the Sleepy Hollow Cemetery and the Old Dutch Church. It's a beautiful and historic cemetery with gorgeous tombs, headstones and mausoleums. With twisted trees and spooky statues everywhere, it looks like something out of a classic horror movie. During the day you can grab a cup of hot apple cider or a cold seasonal beer right inside the cemetery and wander the winding paths and hills. In the evening there's a haunted lantern tour through the cemetery, which I highly recommend.
As the sun sets, it's imperative that you visit the Horseman's Hollow at Philipsburg Manor. It's a walking tour through a 300-year-old Dutch village that's now haunted by the headless horseman. It's the most frightening and artfully done haunted house experience around.
Boulet Brothers
Producers and hosts, 'Dragula'
We're huge fans of hosting classic homemade Halloween house parties. You can make anything look scary with the right string of lights and lit-up jack-o'-lanterns scattered about. Paper decorations and string are easy to make, and they will give your house a vintage 1950s aesthetic. Just hand draw skulls or witch hats out with crayons on brown packing paper, cut them out and glue them to coarse string and hang them around. Orange string lights make great additions to any décor too, not to mention as many candles as you can scare up.
As far as food, a favorite in our house is a beef stew that is slow baked inside a basketball-size pumpkin. Getting some apple cider and heating it up on the stove will make the place smell great, and you can serve it with rum, butter and apple slices.
Alice Waddington
Director, 'Paradise Hills'
For a fun night for us introverts who do not want to go trick-or-treating, I highly recommend bingeing Barbara Steele's Gothic horror filmography. Queen of Italian giallo terrors, she starred in classics such as the witchcraft film "Black Sunday" and the Edgar Allan Poe anthology "Castle of Blood." She mothered iconic unhinged villains, like the green-horned succubus in "Curse of the Crimson Altar."
Adam Egypt Mortimer
Director, 'Daniel Isn't Real'
If you've ever wanted to try your hand at conjuring, Halloween is the night to jump in. When I lived in New York, my friend Pat and I painted a magic circle on our roof on 131st Street, put on black robes and built an altar. Here's what you do: walk around the circle, pausing every few steps to chant the name of an entity (Satan or Cthulhu would work). After about 10-20 minutes of this, make a loud, clear and simple request from the spirit world.
Patrick Lussier
Director, 'Trick'
Halloween is one of the few times I get my wife to watch scary movies. We'll sit and watch three of them while waiting for the doorbell to ring. This year we're going to watch "The Hitcher," the 1986 movie with Rutger Hauer. It was one of his greatest movies. It's this twisted story of a father-son relationship, and about the importance of being able to destroy the older version of yourself in order to become the man you were meant to be. It's also something rare: a scary movie that's shot mostly in sunshine.
Grady Hendrix
Author, 'We Sold Our Souls'
Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn is doing this thing called Nightfall on Oct. 25 and 26, in which all these performers and groups -- Morbid Anatomy, Death of Classical -- are doing performances throughout the cemetery. You walk around and see all these amazing visuals too. I love that Green-Wood is working hard to make cemeteries fun again, a place to hang out. This city forgets its history quickly, so it will be nice to host a performance art séance for the dead and the living.
Jason DeVan
Director, 'Along Came the Devil 2'
In our family we have three boys that are 12, 17 and 19. When I was a kid, we loved watching those half-hour Halloween specials with Garfield and Fat Albert. You can watch a few of them now on YouTube and Amazon Prime. We even love the Halloween episode of "Happy Days," where Richie Cunningham goes to a haunted house.
Paul Smithyman
Production designer, 'I Can't See' (an immersive theatrical experience)
There's a Halloween street every year on 69th Street between Broadway and Central Park West. The 69th Street Block Association does it, and it's pretty amazing. I have a 4-year-old named Georgie, who wants to be a bush for Halloween. That's my new Halloween experience that will take my time in the next few weeks: Turn my daughter into a bush.

'Broad City' Creator Talks About Ending Show

Texto completo: Headnote LOCAL
ABBI AND ILANA are two young Jewish women.
They're best friends, living in New York City and going on wacky adventures. One day, they might take up a sketchy Craigslist ad to make quick cash. Another, they may run into trouble on a free "Birthmark" trip to Israel.
That's the premise of "Broad City," a Comedy Central series that finished its last season earlier this year. And the two women at the heart of it are Abbi Jacobson and liana Glazer, its stars and creators.
Jacobson, who grew up in Wayne (one episode has the two women visit the Philadelphia suburb), was in town for the B. Phi Innovation Fest, which aims to bolster Philadelphia's reputation as an innovative city. Speaking to a sold-out audience on Oct. 15, Jacobson talked about what she's working on now and the show that launched her career.
"The character that she plays in the show has these high lofty goals, well made out plans, and she can never complete them," said Andrea Helfrich, Philadelphia Flyers in-arena host and digital content producer, who interviewed Jacobson. "But if you think that art imitates reality, think again."
No one could describe Jacobson as not accomplishing her goals. Besides her work on "Broad City," she is the author of The New York Times bestseller "I Might Regret This: Essays, Drawings, Vulnerabilities, and Other Stuif," as well as the creator of two coloring books., "Color This Book: New York City" and "Color This Book: San Francisco." She is also the illustrator of "Carry This Book." Jacobson is now working to produce an Amazon series, "A League of Their Own," a modern take on the 1992 film.
After taking a moment to reminisce about Wawa, Jacobson and Helfrich talked about how "Broad City" got its start.
Jacobson met Glazer at an Upright Citizens Brigade improv class. Both were struggling to get the jobs they wanted, so they decided to start a web series, Jacobson said.
Agrande esta imagen.

They called it "Broad City."
Though each episode is much shorter, the web series had a similar style of humor as the television show, with a focus on the two women's back-and-forth conversation and their dayto-day dealings with life in the Big Apple. (Many of the web episodes are no longer online, Jacobson said, because they used copyrighted music and would have been sued.)
They thought the web series might lead them to jobs as writers, but Comedy Central wound up buying the show. Jacobson and Glazer were now writing, starring in and editing their own television series.
"Both of us, when we started, the intention was funny first," Jacobson said. "The things we find about ourselves and our friendship, what we find hilarious, let's heighten it, always. Let's amplify how you feel about interactions with the city, with yourself and push it further for the comedy. That has always been there, but the further we went along, the more we wanted the characters to grow and reflect things that we were going through and comment on stuff we thought was important or bulls- or frustrating."
Between the web series and the Comedy Central series, the women spent about a decade working on "Broad City." So they were glad they were able to end it on their own terms with an episode airing in March.
After years of the characters having fun in New York City, they grow up and move on to the next stages of their lives. Jacobson's character moves to Boulder, Colorado, to pursue an artist's residency program. Glazer's character goes to graduate school to become a therapist. The finale has the two friends saying goodbye to each other, but it was also a meta experience, Jacobson said. It served as a send-off for the show and the cast and crews' time together.
"Would you ever bring it back?" Helfrich asked. "We, like, just ended, so," Jacobson said, trailing off, to audience laughter.
"Is it too soon?" Helfrich said.
"We have a joke about us being old, doing it, which would be so fun," Jacobson said. "The team and acting with liana, that's the thing I'm going to miss the most. I still have liana. We still hang out all the time. We work together, but acting with her, it's so easy, and those characters are so fun, but we need to step away from it. That's the reason we ended it." *

Congress braces for protracted impeachment fight

Texto completo: Democrats and Republicans are preparing for an impeachment battle that could dominate Congress for months and drag on into the new year.
Lawmakers on Capitol Hill have been struggling to determine the timing for the impeachment process and how it will affect critical legislative deadlines, including must-pass federal spending bills.
House Democrats launched proceedings on Sept. 24 with orders from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to move "expeditiously."
But more than a month later, Democrats have yet to produce a timeline for when they plan to conclude the investigation and have not even scheduled public hearings, which are expected to precede a House floor vote on impeachment articles.
An earlier prediction by some Democrats that the inquiry could wrap up by October has now been abandoned. Democratic leaders won't even commit to wrapping up by Thanksgiving, or anytime in 2019.
"There is a desire to do it expeditiously," House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters in the Capitol last week. "Whether that's the end of the year or not, we don't know."
The uncertainty has left both parties nervous about the practical and political implications of a drawn-out impeachment fight.
The most pressing legislative problem is impeachment's potential clash with the November spending deadline.
A temporary spending bill keeping the government funded will expire on Nov. 21, and the two parties are nowhere near reaching a long-term deal on fiscal 2020 spending, in part because of the impeachment battle, which has further aggravated the partisan divide.
Democrats and Republicans now conclude it's more likely Congress will be forced to send President Trump another stopgap measure, which is both wasteful to the taxpayer and harmful to government agencies, particularly the military.
"I think we are going to end up with one," Sen. John Kennedy told the Washington Examiner when asked about the prospect of Congress having to approve another stopgap bill. "Because, given the partisan atmosphere, I don't see how anything is going to pass."
So far, the impeachment proceedings have taken place mostly in closed session in a secure hearing room in the basement of the Capitol.
House Intelligence Committee Democrats who are running the inquiry have over the past month summoned a string of former and current Trump administration officials into a secure hearing room and, along with Republicans, questioned each for nine hours or more.
Lawmakers in both parties from three committees are participating in the questioning.
Democrats are attempting to build a case that shows Trump tried to win Ukraine's help investigating Democrats by withholding critical security aid.
Trump denies any quid pro quo was involved in his request, while Republicans have declared the Democratic impeachment proceedings to be "illegitimate" and unfair to the president.
Democrats told the Washington Examiner they are moving cautiously through the inquiry to ensure they build a solid case the public can trust.
"I hated the impeachment of Bill Clinton," Rep. Donna Shalala, who served as Clinton's secretary of health and human services, said. "I thought it was totally political. But we learned from that. And that is why we are being so careful now."
But public support for impeachment, which had climbed slightly in recent weeks, is showing signs of waning, particularly among those critical to maintaining the Democratic majority in the 2020 election.
A New York Times/Sienna College voter survey conducted Oct. 13 to Oct. 20 found 53% of battleground state voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and Arizona opposed impeachment and removal of Trump, compared to the 43% who supported it.
Democrats may be caught grinding through an investigation the public opposes just as the critical campaign season heats up.
That may ultimately be good news for the GOP and will motivate them not to rush through the process when impeachment articles reach the Senate, which will hold a trial.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell hinted last week he won't take any steps to try to speed up a trial and that the process would be under the control of Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.
The Senate conducted a two-month trial before acquitting Clinton of obstruction of justice and perjury on Feb. 12, 1999.
"I have no idea how long this will go on," McConnell said. "What I can tell you for sure is if the House impeaches, we will be on it. It will displace everything else and will be on it until we finish."

Texto completo: Time to vote for the Worst Trump Cabinet Member.
Not Rudy Giuliani! He’s personal lawyer. And best friend. And, yeah, raving maniac. But we’re going to stick to people who are running the federal government.
At least in theory.
One top contender has to be Attorney General William Barr. When Americans make a list of things they’d like the nation’s foremost law enforcement authority to do, how many do you think would start with, “Travel around the world seeking to discredit the Mueller investigation.”
But wait! What about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo? He’s the one who fired a much-respected ambassador to Ukraine. And was listening in on the fabled Trump-Ukraine phone call. Career State Department officials are reportedly miserable working under him. But then that’s true of so very, very many parts of our current government — “drain the swamp” is Trump code for “torture the people who actually have to do the work.”
Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney is on a mission to destroy the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
He’s also the one who blurted out “We do that all the time” when asked if there was a quid pro quo between aid to Ukraine and getting dirt on Democrats. Then he tried to retreat. (“That’s what people are saying that I said but I didn’t say that.”)
Ineptitude is an important consideration here. There are lots of Cabinet members who would cause immeasurable harm if they weren’t so incompetent. (This is the Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos contingent.) Consider Ben Carson, our secretary of housing and urban development, who was asked at a congressional hearing about REOs — a well-known HUD acronym for foreclosed properties — and appeared to think the questioner was talking about cookies.
Trump Cabinet-watching is much more exciting than it would be in a normal administration, where, say, the secretary of labor did not have to be tossed out of office for a role in the Jeffrey Epstein sex scandal. (Alex Acosta, we hardly knew ye.)
You’d probably be able to name the whole Cabinet now if it wasn’t for the rapid-fire turnover. We’ve been through four different heads of the Department of Homeland Security. And three in charge of the Department of Defense. Beginning, of course, with retired general Jim Mattis, who said recently that while he earned his spurs on the battlefield, “Donald Trump earned his spurs in a letter from a doctor.”
It’s been pretty much downhill since. The current secretary of defense is Mark Esper, a former lobbyist for a defense contractor. Who the president referred to in a recent tweet as “Mark Esperanto.”
I’m sure the president isn’t the only one who doesn’t remember all their names. When the Cabinet meets, there are probably a lot of comments like, “I agree with … that guy over there with the green tie.”
But back to our contenders: Anybody having anything whatsoever to do with the environment is a good worst candidate in this White House. Former winner Environmental Protection Agency Chief Scott Pruitt has slunk away; remember the time he tried to use his influence to get his wife a Chick-fil-A franchise? His deputy, Andrew Wheeler, is now the top guy.
Wheeler used to be a lobbyist for energy companies, and he seems determined to weaken car emissions limits even when the car manufacturers want to keep them. His critics say that if he can’t get rid of environmental protection laws he doesn’t like, he simply stops enforcing them.
Interior Secretary David Bernhardt has replaced the dreaded Ryan Zinke, another former worst contender. Previously Bernhardt was — yes! — Zinke’s top deputy and before that — yes! yes! — a lobbyist for energy companies. One who had so many potential conflicts of interest, he had to carry around a card listing all of them.
So, tough luck, endangered species. Bernhardt hates it when you get in the way of fuel extraction. But you have to admit he’s making history. Bernhardt is the first interior secretary to be under investigation by the department’s inspector general since his first day on the job.
And Wilbur’s back! Last season’s winner, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross Jr., is most definitely looking for a repeat. We are thinking here of his threats to fire officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for reassuring Alabamians that a hurricane was not headed their way no matter what crazy maps a certain chief executive drew with his Sharpie.
Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao doesn’t seem to be doing much on national infrastructure. But she’s been very energetic when it comes to boosting her family’s shipping company and squeezing extra grants for Kentucky, which happens to be the state represented by her husband, Sen. Mitch McConnell.
And what about Energy Secretary Rick Perry? He was one of three Trump officials who seem to have been running the Ukraine policy, which would be bad enough even if the trio had not been calling themselves “the three amigos.” On the other hand, he’s resigning, and Trump does seem to be trying to blame him for everything.
What’s Perry’s bottom line? “Let’s face it — he’s not the brightest light,” said Elaine Kamarck of the Brookings Institution.
Well, he seems to be a better dancer than Sean Spicer …

Texto completo: El Departamento de Justicia (DOJ) ha cambiado la revisión que realiza de la pesquisa sobre posible interferencia rusa en las elecciones de Estados Unidos a una investigación formal penal.
La revisión que el Fiscal General William Barr ordenó sobre los orígenes de la investigación sobre posibles vínculos entre la campaña de Trump de 2016 y Rusia ahora se ha convertido en una investigación criminal, dijo a POLITICO una fuente familiarizada con el asunto.
La investigación, realizada por el fiscal estadounidense de Connecticut, John Durham , se inició como un esfuerzo de Barr por responder preguntas no especificadas que tenía sobre por qué el FBI comenzó la investigación de contrainteligencia que finalmente llevó al nombramiento del asesor especial Robert Mueller.
Sin embargo, la escalada de la investigación de Barr de una revisión administrativa a un asunto penal significa que los actuales y antiguos funcionarios del FBI y del Departamento de Justicia enfrentan la posibilidad de cargos criminales, derivados de algún aspecto de su trabajo en la investigación de Rusia.
La designación de la investigación de Durham como una investigación criminal también aumenta enormemente su poder para recopilar información , abriendo la posibilidad de citaciones del gran jurado para registros y testimonios.
La medida seguramente complacerá al presidente Donald Trump, quien se ha quejado durante mucho tiempo de que fue espiado durante la campaña de 2016, a pesar de la falta de evidencia para respaldar esa afirmación. Trump también acusó a la administración Obama y a los funcionarios del FBI de traición, por sus acciones en la investigación de Rusia.
Los ex funcionarios habían expresado su reiterada preocupación por la investigación de Durham en las últimas semanas, diciendo que había indicios de que se estaba expandiendo más allá de una típica retrospectiva sobre cómo se manejaban los asuntos de alto perfil. La conversión de la investigación a una investigación criminal fue reportada por primera vez el jueves por el New York Times.
Las revisiones administrativas generalmente son realizadas por la Oficina del Inspector General (OIG) del Departamento de Justicia, que ha pasado más de un año investigando el contenido de las solicitudes de la Ley de Vigilancia de Inteligencia Extranjera que el FBI y el Departamento de Justicia presentaron para Carter Page , un especialista de la industria energética que había servido como asesor de campaña de Trump.
La investigación de Durham parece ser más amplia que la investigación de la OIG, aunque el alcance completo de su investigación sigue sin estar claro.

Resumen: Filled with folksy advice, such as extolling the value of taking naps, the book was based in the simple lessons of childhood. According to Kimberly E. Schmidt, director of Judson Theatre and assistant professor of Speech Communication and Performing Arts, the university’s production interpretation might not fit the definition of a musical. The plays sticks to the stories contained in "Everything I Need to Know," as well as Fulghum’s other published books: "It Was on Fire When I Lay Down on It," "Uh-Oh, It’s Almost Christmas," and "Maybe, Maybe Not," with created monologues and scenes for the stage.

Texto completo: "Everything I Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten" is a book made popular in the 1980s, but some are unaware of the play of the same name — or that it contains music. Judson University will present it at 7 p.m. Thursday through Saturday, Oct. 24-26, at Thulin Auditorium in Thompson Hall, on Judson’s Elgin campus, 1151 N. State St. Tickets are $5-$12.
The New York Times bestseller, written in 1986 by Robert Fulghum, has sold 7 million copies. Filled with folksy advice, such as extolling the value of taking naps, the book was based in the simple lessons of childhood.
In 1992, Fulghum worked with David Caldwell, a composer and musical director, to transform the essays into a musical.
According to Kimberly E. Schmidt, director of Judson Theatre and assistant professor of Speech Communication and Performing Arts, the university’s production interpretation might not fit the definition of a musical.
"There are four songs," said Schmidt, an Elgin resident. "One song opens act one and closes act one, and the same with act two. It’s billed as a play with music, not a full on musical."
The plays sticks to the stories contained in "Everything I Need to Know," as well as Fulghum’s other published books: "It Was on Fire When I Lay Down on It," "Uh-Oh, It’s Almost Christmas," and "Maybe, Maybe Not," with created monologues and scenes for the stage.
"It is a storytelling show in that each scene is complete in itself and tells its own story. It’s mostly one person telling the story and then other people come in an add to it," said Schmidt.
One of those bringing the story to the stage is Aneesah Phillips, a freshman at Judson from Bloomingdale.
"In one of the scenes, I play a kindergarten teacher," Phillips said. "In another, I’m a narrator, where I talk about a wedding that went terribly wrong at the last moment."
Phillips thinks people in all stages of life could look at the production as a refresher course in the basic life lessons that develop into road maps as time goes on.
"They seem to be simple lessons at first glance, but during troubles and facts of life we often forget they’re what we need," she said. "I think people of my age to 30 might benefit from this," adding that an older audience might find it insightful as well.
Schmidt said children will be entertained by the fast-moving vignettes.
"It’s totally family friendly," Schmidt said. "A child 8 or 9 (years old) would be able to enjoy it. The scenes are short, so they would be able to follow, pick up things and remember it."
"Everything I Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten" was not Schmidt’s first choice. There was another play set to be produced, but Schmidt decided on another path after the recent violence in El Paso and California.
"I thought, ‘I don’t want to do anything dark. I want something happy and uplifting,’ and came across this," she said.
"It’s a lot of fun. It ranges from stories where people will almost be falling off their chairs to poignant and wiping a tear or two," she added.
"I want to ... feel good that here are good people in the world and the things that really matter in the world (are) our friends, our family and good people."
Other cast members include Amir Scott, Lydia Alpert, Malina Sanchez, Rose Wodeck, Jacob Choate, Spencer Armstrong, David Larsen and Rachel Rosborough.

Farrow's tale of reporting, perseverance

Texto completo: 'Catch and Kill'
By Ronan Farrow, Little, Brown, 464 pages, $30
At first, I wasn't sure I wanted to read Ronan Farrow's book.
I didn't want to spend hours with a revolving cast of powerful men accused of doing unspeakable things to women, with impunity or the next best thing. I know the world can be like this, but I didn't want to know the world can be like this.
Now I know, in painful detail, thanks to Farrow and "Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators." And you should too.
Farrow is the New Yorker magazine contributor who shared the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for public service with Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey of The New York Times. Their reporting is why disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein is headed to trial on rape charges in New York City and could spend the rest of his life in prison if convicted.
Their work fueled the #MeToo movement and gave voice to scores of women who allege Weinstein harassed, groped, raped or otherwise forced himself on them and then brutalized them into silence. Their meticulous reporting allowed these women not just to be heard but to be listened to for the first time. And it brought to account men accused of sexual miscount and the industry that protected them.
But this is where the stories diverge.
Kantor and Twohey's new book, "She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story that Helped Ignite a Movement," details what it's like to be investigative journalists for a newspaper that gave them the time, resources and support to make a difference. Told in the third person, it has the cool, authoritative voice of The New York Times. It focuses on the women who broke their silence and the work that helped them do it; it's a primer on how to do deep-dive journalism.
"Catch and Kill," which was released Tuesday, is a far different work. It's equal parts memoir, spy story and portrait of perseverance -- the women's and the author's -- under terrible circumstances.
Farrow began exploring rumors of Weinstein's sexual misconduct as a reporter for NBC News. In "Catch and Kill," he describes what it's like to work for a media outlet that tried to quash the story. The New Yorker later published Farrow's series of articles on which this book is based.
The NBC that Farrow portrays in "Catch and Kill" is the definition of a hostile workplace. Farrow's more sensational allegations about the company have already made their way into the headlines.
He described MSNBC President Phil Griffin waving around an enlarged image of a television personality's genitalia during a work meeting. And Farrow leveled the bombshell allegation that former "Today" show co-anchor Matt Lauer anally raped a young colleague while they were covering the Sochi Olympics in 2014.
That colleague is Brooke Nevils, and her complaint led to Lauer's firing in 2017, but NBC News did not disclose the accusation at the time. Lauer denies the allegation; he says he and Nevils had a consensual affair. Nevils' allegations are lengthy, graphic and on the record in "Catch and Kill." Her account underscores the pain, damage and, in Farrow's telling, the complexity of sexual assault. After Sochi, Nevils and Lauer had several sexual encounters, at his home and in his office.
"Nevils told friends at the time that she felt trapped," Farrow wrote. "Lauer's position of authority -- over both her and her boyfriend, whose brother worked for Lauer -- made her feel unable to say no."
Lauer is the specter that hangs over much of Farrow's deeply reported book, with its largely on-the-record accusations.
A foundation of "Catch and Kill" is Farrow's contention that Weinstein had collected dirt on Lauer and that NBC killed Farrow's story on the producer's misdeeds to protect the star at the center of one of the network's most important franchises. NBC counters that Farrow's work was neither substantiated nor ready to run.
As the Los Angeles Times has reported, NBC has launched a counterassault against the book at the same time it is trying to quell the uproar Farrow's allegations have caused among its employees.
At the heart of "Catch and Kill" is Farrow's quest to get the story -- and then get it published. All the while, Farrow alleges, NBC worked to shut down his efforts.
Throughout "Catch and Kill," the author maintains that Weinstein tried to bully them into silence, and to threaten, harass and buy off the women Weinstein had harmed. Farrow writes that Weinstein went so far as to have him followed by spies with ties to Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency.
Actress Daryl Hannah, whose sexual harassment allegations against Weinstein are detailed in the book, said she previously had told anyone who would listen, but it didn't matter.
"I think it doesn't matter if you're a well-known actress," she told Farrow. "It doesn't matter if you're twenty or if you're forty. It doesn't matter if you report or if you don't because we are not believed.
"We are more than not believed -- we are berated and criticized and blamed."
Someday, maybe, that will no longer be the case.

Texto completo: The musician also added the author of a tweet that inspired the song's signature "DNA test" line to the track's credits.
Who wrote Lizzo's hit "Truth Hurts"? That question may now be settled in a court of law.
Last week, two songwriting brothers accused Lizzo of denying them credit for the song, one of the biggest hits of the year. The brothers, Justin and Jeremiah Raisen, said they had contributed to an early songwriting session that yielded the track's signature line.
A lawyer for Lizzo denied their claim at the time, but now the singer has sued the Raisens, as well as another writer, Yves Rothman, who made his own claim about "Truth Hurts."
Lizzo's suit, filed in United States District Court in Los Angeles on Wednesday, seeks a declaratory judgment that Rothman and the Raisens had no part in creating "Truth Hurts," and asks for other unspecified damages.
In an interview with The New York Times, and in statements on social media, the Raisens said that the origins of "Truth Hurts" and the signature line that begins "I just took a DNA test" came in a songwriting session in April 2017, in which the brothers worked with Lizzo, Rothman and another writer, Jesse Saint John. As part of that session, the brothers said, they were all inspired by an online meme that was rooted in a recent tweet by a British singer named Mina Lioness.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The "DNA test" lyric has become so central to Lizzo's fame that she has applied for a trademark on the line's final phrase -- "100% that bitch" -- and sells T-shirts using it.
The Raisens argued that their session was collaborative, and so they deserved a share of the credits when Lizzo and her producer, Ricky Reed, took that line and later used it in "Truth Hurts." (The credited songwriters for "Truth Hurts" include Lizzo, whose real name is Melissa Jefferson, along with Reed, Saint John and Tele, another producer.)
Lizzo's lawsuit denies that, saying that neither the Raisen brothers nor Rothman -- who, according to the suit, made his own claim to "Truth Hurts" last week -- had anything to do with creating her hit song. The suit further accuses the Raisens of "engaging in a pattern of harassment" against Lizzo and "threatening to 'go public"' with their claims unless they received a share of the song.
In a tweet on Wednesday, Lizzo said: "There was no one in the room when I wrote Truth Hurts, except me, Ricky Reed, and my tears."
Her suit notes that before the Raisens made their current claim against "Truth Hurts," in September, they first lodged and then withdrew a similar complaint. Lizzo's representatives believe this should have disqualified the Raisens from pursuing their claim a second time.
Lioness, the writer of the tweet, had complained that she also deserved credit, and that Lizzo and her representatives "have been ignoring my whole presence."
But on Wednesday, Lizzo said she would give Lioness credit as a writer of "Truth Hurts" and a share of the song's royalties.
"The creator of the tweet is the person I am sharing my success with," Lizzo wrote in a statement posted on Twitter. "Not these men. Period."
Minutes later, Lioness thanked Lizzo -- and her managers -- and wrote on Twitter: "I just took a DNA Test, turns out I'm a credited writer for the number one song on Billboard."
When asked about the suit, Justin Raisen said, "This makes me not want to make music professionally anymore. This is sad." He praised Lizzo for sharing royalties with Lioness but called that decision "obviously a political tactic."
"Truth Hurts" has been No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart for seven weeks, and may be on the next Grammy ballot for both record and song of the year; Lizzo is also considered a top contender for best new artist.

Texto completo: Actress Rose McGowan on Wednesday filed a lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein and his team of high-powered lawyers and covert investigators, accusing them of carrying out a plot to discredit and silence her.
The 72-page complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, adds to the already extensive legal troubles for the disgraced former film producer, who faces charges of rape and other sex crimes in New York stemming from years of abuse he allegedly carried out as one of Hollywood's most powerful figures.
Along with Weinstein, the lawsuit names attorneys David Boies and Lisa Bloom, who worked for Weinstein, and Black Cube, a private investigation firm allegedly hired to dig up dirt on McGowan.

"Harvey Weinstein was able to perpetrate and cover up decades of violence and control over women because he had a sophisticated team working on his behalf to systematically silence and discredit his victims," McGowan said in a statement. "My life was upended by their actions."
The lawsuit focuses largely on a series of events over several months in 2017 as McGowan prepared to publish a memoir, in which she says Weinstein raped her in 1997. Weinstein has denied the allegation.
Determined to learn what McGowan planned to write and to stop her from publishing the book, Weinstein leaned on Boies and, later, Bloom for help, the lawsuit alleges. Boies' law firm, in turn, hired Black Cube, a secretive firm run by former Israeli intelligence agents, the lawsuit alleges.
Lawyers for Weinstein and Bloom disputed the allegations. Others named in the lawsuit did not respond to requests for comment or could not be reached.
"Once and for all, Rose McGowan will be shown to be what she is: a publicity seeker looking for money," Phyllis Kupferstein, Weinstein's civil attorney, said in a statement. "From the moment she sought a multimillion-dollar payout in return for not making these baseless allegations, which we rejected, we knew that she was waiting for an opportune time to begin this. We will demonstrate that this case has no legal merit."
Along with firsthand encounters McGowan had with alleged Black Cube operatives who posed as allies to earn her trust, much of the lawsuit is based on information reported by New Yorker reporter Ronan Farrow and New York Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey. In a series of articles and books, the journalists detailed the abuse many women say they suffered at the hands of Weinstein and other men, as well as the increasingly desperate efforts by Weinstein to keep his accusers quiet.
The lawsuit alleges McGowan's career as an actress and author, as well as her mental health, "suffered tremendously" because of Weinstein's efforts. It seeks unspecified damages for an array of offenses, including allegations of fraud and conspiracy.

Congressman DeSaulnier Successfully Passes Measure to Better Inform States About Foreign Interference in Elections

Texto completo: On Oct. 23, a measure authored by Congressman DeSaulnier (CA-11) to better inform states about foreign efforts to interfere in an election was included in the final version of the Stopping Harmful Interference in Elections for A Lasting Democracy (SHIELD) Act (H.R. 4617), which passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 227-to-181. The SHIELD Act would strengthen the country's ability to better identify and fight foreign interference in elections. Congressman DeSaulnier's amendment would require the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) to inform states within 30 days of receiving information that a targeted disinformation campaign has occurred in their jurisdiction.
"In 2016, bad actors weaponized social media platforms to spread false information, push misleading ads, and ultimately undermine Americans' faith in democracy," said Congressman DeSaulnier. "We know this disinformation campaign was successful, and that foreign agents, as Special Counsel Robert Mueller warned, are 'doing it as we sit here, and expect to do it again in the next campaign.' It is the responsibility of Congress to ensure that we have a government that is for and by the American people, and not by foreign adversaries."
The Senate Intelligence Committee has reported that all 50 states were targeted by Russia in the months leading up to the 2016 election, and earlier this month the New York Times reported that the Iranians are already following in Russia's footsteps and have begun cyberattacks aimed at disrupting our 2020 election. While these threats faced by foreign agents were substantial in 2016, state officials responsible for managing and securing election systems were unaware.
Congressman DeSaulnier has also authored the Bots Research Act (H.R. 2860), which would establish a task force at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to determine the impact of social media "bots" on public discourse and elections. He has also called for hearings in the House Oversight and Reform Committee on the impact of social media bots on our elections.

Texto completo: Re “Terranea Resort, in Rancho Palos Verdes, introduces new panic buttons in lead up to ballot measure” (Oct. 24):
I’m glad to see that Terranea Resort President Terri Haack has provided panic buttons to the hardworking housekeeping workers at Terranea.
The resort also claims they pay their workers at least $15 an hour. If this is true, why not codify these policies so that workers will be guaranteed this protection against sexual assault and a base pay of $15, no matter who the management is? Measure B would do just that.
Terranea has spent an alarming amount of money and energy trying to defeat this measure that they claim to already live up to. This is money that would be better spent implementing these commonsense protections and paying their workers fairly.
Terranea has been promoting their Saints and Sinners Halloween Party. In my opinion, the saints are the hotel workers who work long hours cleaning up after and waiting on hotel guests and making Terranea the place visitors love so much and are willing to pay top dollar for. The sinners? That’s for you to decide.
Ultimately, Measure B’s fate will be decided by residents of Rancho Palos Verdes. If I lived there, I would vote yes.

We’ve seen this before
The year is 1971. Bumbling burglars break into the Democratic campaign office to get dirt on behalf of a Republican president. The cast: Richard Nixon, H. R. Haldeman, John Ehrlichman, G. Gordon Liddy, Charles Colson, John Dean, Archibald Cox, a whistleblower, and the Washington Post. A Republican administration corrupt to the core. Plan begins to fall apart.
Fast forward to 2019. Bumbling Republican president shakes down the president of Ukraine to get dirt on Democrat opponent.
The cast: Donald Trump, Mike Pence, Rudy Giuliani, Stephen Miller, Mike Pompeo, William Barr, Robert Mueller, a whistleblower and The New York Times. A Republican administration corrupt to the core. Plan begins to fall apart.
We’ve seen this movie before. The latest news is just a preview of a sequel. In the previous movie, many of the characters ended up in prison or ignominy. So should many characters in this sequel. Exception, impeach and convict Trump.

Sen. Warren's debate anecdotes are dishonest

Texto completo: If you want to run for office, political consultants will hammer away at one point: Tell stories. People respond to stories. We've been a storytelling species since our fur-clad ancestors gathered around campfires. Don't cite statistics. No one can remember statistics. Make it human. Make it relatable. Lincoln told stories. FDR told stories. Reagan told stories.
Watching the Democrats' fourth debate Tuesday night, you could see the candidates implementing this advice. They'd mention Joe Blow in their state who said X, or Jane Blow who called their office with Y problem. They commonly use techniques like: "The voters I speak to aren't preoccupied with the elite concerns of Washington or New York. The voters I speak to are concerned about ..." and then the candidate fills in the policy he or she is touting.
That's OK, as far as it goes, but politics by anecdote should have some limits, because, as a wag once said, "The plural of anecdote is not data." Relying on anecdotes alone is how you get the anti-vaccine movement and other dangerous delusions. "I knew a little boy who was totally normal and chatty until he got the MMR shot and then he became autistic." That's tragic, but the data show that across large populations, there is no link between vaccines and autism. On the contrary, vaccines are a key public health benefit.
Politicians owe it to us to ensure that when they use examples, they are using them to illustrate larger truths, not to mislead.
Elizabeth Warren fails this test. For someone who touts herself as a scholar, she resorts to anecdotes in a most disingenuous fashion.
At the last debate, for example, asked to account for the cost of her "plan" to adopt "Medicare for All," which would eliminate the private coverage enjoyed by an estimated 150 million Americans, Warren proffered stories:
"So I have talked with the family, the mom and dad whose daughter's been diagnosed with cancer. I have talked to the young woman whose mother has just been diagnosed with diabetes. I've talked to the young man who has MS.
"And here's the thing about all of them. They all had great health insurance right at the beginning. But then they found out when they really needed it, when the costs went up, that the insurance company pulled the rug out from underneath them and they were left with nothing."
Later, after asserting that only the wealthy and corporations would see their taxes go up under her plan, she cited the same anecdote: "And I will not embrace a plan that says people have great insurance right up until you get the diagnosis and the insurance company says, 'Sorry, we're not covering your expensive cancer treatments; we're not covering your expensive treatments for MS.' "
Is there a widespread practice of insurance companies rescinding coverage when people get serious illnesses? There are only two studies of the problem dating back to the early 2000s. One by the House Oversight and Investigations Committee found that three companies had rescinded 20,000 policies over the course of five years -- sometimes for fraud but in some cases for trivial reasons. All were policies purchased on the individual market, not through employers. Another study, by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, found that between 2004 and 2008, some 27,000 policies were rescinded out of 6.7 million individual plans surveyed. That translates to less than one-half of 1% of policies.
Does that mean it wasn't a problem? Not necessarily. Doubtless there were injustices -- serious ones -- when people found themselves facing a medical crisis and had their insurance canceled. But there's a reason that all of the data on this practice of rescission (which insurance companies claimed was fraud prevention) predate 2010. The Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, explicitly outlawed it. As Healthcare.gov explains: "Under the Affordable Care Act, rescission is illegal except in cases of fraud or intentional misrepresentation of material fact as prohibited by the terms of the plan or coverage."
Warren surely knows this, and thus, her tales of people's insurance being withdrawn when they get sick are not illustrative examples of a serious problem; they are dishonest efforts to build a case for eliminating private health coverage. Elizabeth Warren, like Bernie Sanders, is an ideologue, enamored of government regulation of everything. Most Americans do not share her disdain for private health coverage. Eighty percent rate the quality of their care as excellent or good, and 69% rate their personal coverage the same way.
They deserve leaders who will not attempt to mislead them.

Texto completo: As WeWork, the beleaguered office-sharing startup, prepares to fire 4,000 rank-and-file staff members to cut costs, its board has agreed on severance packages for its co-CEOs if they leave, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
In the past week, WeWork’s board signed off on exit deals for Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham in the multimillion-dollar range, said one of the people, who requested anonymity because the agreements are private. The severance arrangements were negotiated as SoftBank Group bailed out the company and on Tuesday named one of its executives, Marcelo Claure, as WeWork’s executive chairman.
For now, Minson and Gunningham are committed to WeWork, according to one of the people. They were appointed last month when co-founder and former CEO Adam Neumann stepped down following the company’s withdrawal of a planned initial public offering.
“As your co-CEOs, we are committed to working with Marcelo and SoftBank to position our company for long-term success,” Minson and Gunningham wrote in a memo to staff obtained by Bloomberg.
Late Tuesday, WeWork secured a $9.5 billion lifeline, and Neumann gave up his board seat. He is set to walk away with as much as $1.2 billion in WeWork stock, a $500 million credit line from SoftBank and a roughly $185 million consulting fee, people familiar with the matter have said.
WeWork delayed layoffs earlier this month because it couldn’t afford the severance costs, a person familiar with the matter said. The Financial Times reported Wednesday the company would shed 4,000 jobs as a part of the turnaround plan.
Representatives for WeWork and SoftBank didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. SoftBank is set to launch a CEO search, the New York Times and Axios have reported.

Texto completo: It's pure genius!
On the eve of the Iraq war, in 2003, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain addressed a joint session of Congress about America's foreign policy mission: "In some small corner of this vast country, out in Nevada or Idaho or these places I've never been to but always wanted to go," said Blair, "there's a guy getting on with his life, perfectly happy, minding his own business, saying to you, the political leaders of this country, 'Why me, and why us, and why America?' And the only answer is, 'Because destiny put you in this place in history, in this moment in time, and the task is yours to do."'
Blair is still right about the role that destiny has placed on America's shoulders, but years later it is also clear that many Americans are exhausted with that role.
After some four decades of a foreign policy built around "containment" of the Soviet Union, and then two decades of foreign policy built around "enlargement" -- enlarging the sphere of democracy around the world with the huge excess of power America enjoyed after winning the Cold War -- Americans want a break. President Trump is not wrong about that.
The job of the president, though, is to balance the understandable desire of Americans to no longer bear every burden and oppose any foe to ensure the survival of freedom with the fact that U.S. interests and values still require us to remain engaged around the world in a sustainable way.
But sustainable engagement requires us to do at least three things: make fine distinctions, leverage allies and amplify islands of decency. Alas, Trump violated all these principles in Syria.
First, Trump, and the U.S. military, missed the distinction between ISIS in Iraq and in Syria, and that's because Trump and the Pentagon had put the war on terrorism on autopilot.
How so? It was quite logical that after ISIS emerged in Iraq and Syria in 2014 that the U.S. would take on the mission of helping to destroy ISIS in Iraq.
Washington felt guilty having removed all combat troops from Iraq before it was really stabilized and ISIS had brutally murdered American journalists. But rather than do it all ourselves, we partnered with the Iraqi Army and amplified its power and ground forces with our advisers and air power.
That approach led not only to the defeat of ISIS in Iraq, it also produced some unanticipated positive effects in Iraqi politics. The ISIS war became a kind of national war of liberation for Iraqis that brought moderate Iraqi Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds closer together -- and gave them dignity that the U.S. invasion of Iraq had unintentionally stolen. And this paved the way for more stable and sustainable power-sharing among Sunnis, Kurds and Shiites in Iraq.
Iraq today remains a very frail democracy -- with huge challenges in employment, energy, corruption and governing. But "Iraq today is a different country," noted Linda Robinson in a recent essay in Foreign Affairs titled "Winning the Peace in Iraq: Don't Give Up on Baghdad's Fragile Democracy. "Few Americans understand the remarkable success" that has been achieved in bringing Iraq back from the depth of the ISIS war.
This doesn't mean that the original Iraq invasion was worth it or that we would do it again. But it does mean we found the right way to help Iraqis help themselves. It is now up to them to make the most of it.
Unfortunately, we kept the war on ISIS on autopilot. Once Iraq was liberated we tried to produce the same result in Syria using Syrian Kurdish fighters. We failed to make some important distinctions, though. As I argued in a 2017 column, ISIS in Syria was operating in a completely different context than in Iraq.
In Iraq, ISIS was the enemy of multisectarian democracy. In Syria, ISIS was the enemy of multisectarian democracy, and so were Russia, Shiite Iran, Shiite Hezbollah and the Shiite-Alawite Bashar al-Assad regime. And they and ISIS all deserved one another.
"If we defeat territorial ISIS in Syria now," I wrote, "we will only reduce the pressure on Assad, Iran, Russia and Hezbollah and enable them to devote all their resources to crushing the last moderate rebels in Idlib, not sharing power with them." And that's basically what happened.
"ISIS was always two problems -- Syria and Iraq -- not one problem, and we should have treated them differently," explained John Arquilla, a professor of strategy at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey. "In Iraq, ISIS had to be defeated, because once we broke Saddam's regime, Iraq would either emerge as a liberal counterweight to Iran" -- where power was stably shared among Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds -- "or Iraq would become an Iranian puppet."
In Syria, though, Arquilla added, "we could have protected the Kurds" and forced the Russians, Iranians, Hezbollah and al-Assad to have to keep ISIS bottled up there. But we were reflexive in just continuing the fight with ISIS into Syria, and not reflective."
In taking responsibility with the Kurds for defeating ISIS in Syria, we relieved Russia, Iran, Hezbollah and al-Assad of a huge burden, enabling them to crush the regime's domestic rivals. And what's really crazy is that -- we did it for free! We didn't even demand autonomy for our Syrian Kurdish allies or power-sharing with moderate Sunni Syrian rebels.
I feel terrible for the Kurds, but at least America might get the last laugh on Putin. Trump let Putin win Syria -- and the indefinite task of propping up al-Assad's genocidal regime and managing Iran's attempts to use Syria as a platform to attack Israel. What's second prize?
But even if you argue that walking away from the Kurds in Syria was the right coldblooded, strategic thing to do, how a president does things matters. By just pulling out of Syria without advance planning or coordination with our allies -- and dumping the Syrian Kurds after they sacrificed 11,000 men and women in the fight against ISIS -- we sent a message to every U.S. ally: "You'd better start making plans to take care of yourselves, because if Russia, China or Iran decides to come after you or bully you, America does not have your back -- unless you've paid cash in advance."
Watch out. Over time, that will not make for a more stable world or a cheaper U.S. foreign policy.
What makes America unique as a global power is that we have allies who share our interests and values -- and amplify our power at a low cost to us -- while Russia and China have only client states, like Syria, and customers.
"When we suddenly withdraw our support for an ally in one place -- with no warning -- we call into question our credibility everywhere," argued Michael Mandelbaum, author of the book "The Rise and Fall of Peace on Earth."
That is not an argument for sustaining bad wars forever, he added, like Vietnam. But it is an argument for ending them in ways that don't unnerve your allies: "If the Germans and Japanese conclude that America's security guarantees are no longer valid, they will each get nuclear weapons -- which we don't want and they don't want."
Finally, most everyone now understands (I certainly do) that we don't have the time, patience, energy or know-how to create democracy in the Middle East. But what we can do and should do is amplify decency wherever we see it in hopes that the islands of decency there might one day connect up and flower into democracy.
For instance, Iraqi Kurdistan and the Syrian Kurdish regions, while they have plenty of corruption and tribalism, are nevertheless islands of decency where women tend to be more empowered, Islam is practiced in more moderate forms and Western liberal education is promoted in American-style universities. In just walking away from the Syrian Kurds, Trump has weakened their island of decency, rather than amplified it.
America is better than that, even if our current president is not.

Texto completo: The inventive revivals offered new ways to experience cherished classics of the musical theater canon.
Two boldly reimagined revivals of beloved American musicals -- a blood-soaked and bluegrass-tinged "Oklahoma!" and a "Fiddler on the Roof" performed entirely in Yiddish -- will end their acclaimed runs in January.
The "Oklahoma!" production, now at Broadway's Circle in the Square Theater, won this year's Tony Award for best musical revival, and also won a Tony for Ali Stroker, the actress playing Ado Annie, who became the first performer using a wheelchair to take theater's top prize. It will close Jan. 19.
"Fiddler" is an Off Broadway production, now running at Stage 42. It will close Jan. 5.
Both productions were praised by critics for offering new ways to see, hear and feel two of the most cherished works of the musical theater canon. The "Oklahoma!" revival emphasizes the violence and danger of an American frontier community, while the authenticity of the "Fiddler" revival reinforces its poignancy.
The productions were both successful in many ways, with humble beginnings that led to extended runs. Neither has yet become a financial success, but each production said it is hoping to recoup its capitalization costs through touring productions.
"Oklahoma!," directed by the avant-garde innovator Daniel Fish, had a first professional production in 2015 at Bard College's SummerScape festival, and then last year had a successful Off Broadway run at St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn before beginning performances in March on Broadway, where the lead producer is Eva Price.
Its box office grosses have fluctuated, peaking at $ 651,744 during the week ending April 28; the show grossed $ 473,275 during the week that ended Oct. 20. Thus far it has been seen by 151,782 people and has grossed a total of $ 16.5 million, according to the Broadway League.
"There's a long future still ahead for Daniel Fish's groundbreaking production," said Ms. Price, who cited a 45-week tour that is scheduled to begin in Oklahoma City next fall, as well as "other international productions, currently in the planning stages."
The Broadway production and the tour were jointly capitalized for $ 8.5 million, Ms. Price said.
The production has not publicized a closing announcement, but has been advertising Jan. 19 as its final performance, and Ms. Price confirmed her intention to end the Broadway run at that point. The production was initially announced as a limited engagement through Sept. 1 and was then extended.
"Fiddler," directed by the Tony-and-Oscar-winning actor Joel Grey and deploying English and Russian supertitles, is a project of the National Yiddish Theater Folksbiene, and began with a run last year at the Museum of Jewish Heritage before transferring in February to Midtown Manhattan, where the lead producers are Hal Luftig and Jana Robbins. The "Fiddler" production told the cast of plans to close on Tuesday.
"Fiddler" was capitalized for $ 2.6 million, and hopes to recoup those costs with national and international tours, including a production in Australia opening next September.
The first production of "Oklahoma!" opened on Broadway in 1943, and the current production is the fifth Broadway revival. The musical, by Oscar Hammerstein II and Richard Rodgers, depicts a love triangle set on a farm in Indian Territory in 1906, just before Oklahoma became part of the United States.
"Fiddler," featuring music by Jerry Bock, lyrics by Sheldon Harnick, and a book by Joseph Stein, first opened on Broadway in 1964, and has been revived there five times. Set in a Russian village in 1905, it depicts tensions between tradition and assimilation -- personified by the concerns of a dairyman with five daughters -- in a shtetl imperiled by anti-Jewish violence.

Texto completo: El alto funcionario anónimo del gobierno del presidente Donald Trump –que publicó un artículo en The New York Times— tiene una nueva sorpresa para el mandatario. Mejor dicho, le tiene Una advertencia, como se titula el libro que publicará en noviembre.
El misterioso personaje se volvió famoso tras publicar aquella editorial donde habla sobre el movimiento dentro de la Casa Blanca que busca asegurar el éxito del Gobierno estadounidense.
“Para ser claros, la nuestra no es la ‘resistencia’ popular de la izquierda” , dice aquella pieza publicada en septiembre de 2018 . “Queremos que la administración tenga éxito y creemos que muchas de sus políticas ya han hecho que Estados Unidos sea más seguro y más próspero” .
CNN obtuvo la portada del libro, el cual había sido un secreto, pero será lanzado el 19 de noviembre.
“Se han tomado fuertes precauciones para proteger la identidad del autor” , dijeron fuentes a la televisora.
Un borrador de un comunicado de prensa de la editorial Twelve describe el libro como como impactante.
“Retomando de donde se quedaron esas primeras palabras de advertencia, este libro explosivo ofrece una impactante historia de primera mano del presidente Trump” , indica.
Los editores afirman que el autor no publica el libro por dinero y que incluso analiza la intención de donar gran parte de las ganancia a la Asociación de Corresponsales de la Casa Blanca y otras organizaciones que luchan por la libertad de prensa.
También se desconoce si el autor continúa en la Administración Trump, además de que la Casa Blanca declinó hacer comentarios.

Connecting through history Trinity, UConn studies guide two women toward American Girl dolls podcast

Texto completo: For many people, "history" is a topic of middle and high school classes, a thing of the past with no application to daily life.
But 32-year-old Allison Horrocks and 33-year-old Mary Mahoney see history as a way of connecting with others. And they're using American Girl dolls to illustrate that point.
Horrocks and Mahoney - who both earned undergraduate degrees from Hartford's Trinity College and Ph.D.s in history from UConn - launched a podcast called "American Girls," in February.
In the twice-monthly episodes, the two historians unearth the American Girl books that many of us read as children and tweens. The books follow each American Girl as they live in their respective time period - the classic series of characters are set anywhere from the 1760s to the 1970s.
American Girl offers an easy point of access into the study of history, something that many listeners don't usually think about in their adult lives, Horrocks said.
"They haven't really been connected to these kinds of topics since they were kids," Horrocks said. "They're listening, in some ways, more eagerly because they haven't thought about this kind of stuff in 25 years."
After inviting listeners to step into a historical world on each episode, Horrocks and Mahoney launch into debates about the problematic aspects of American Girl, draw links to pop culture and talk about the lessons that the characters learn.
And for many, the podcast hits home.
The two women's easy on-air banter - they're best friends in real life, too - combined with the sometimes-heavy topics that the American Girl books bring up has spurred many listeners to reach out to the show with their own personal stories.
For example, after airing an episode about the character Josefina Montoya who deals with the grief of losing her mother, listeners sent in stories about their own loss, some of them about the loss of a parent when they were a child.
Horrocks said she answers at least 15 messages a day, including emails and direct messages on social media. At least half of those, she said, are lengthy paragraphs of appreciation and personal connection. Mahoney described many of the messages as "intimate."
"We're getting people's stories," Horrocks said. "I feel like the luckiest woman in the world sometimes."
When Horrocks and Mahoney first launched the podcast, they talked about it at the National Council on Public History's annual meeting - which was held in Hartford in March. That gave them an early base of listeners, many of whom were already listening to other history podcasts.
But in August, New York Times television critic Margaret Lyons wrote a column about the podcast, touching on her own childhood memories of American Girl and the experiences that shaped her into the person she is today.
The column is, in short, a wholehearted endorsement of the podcast. Shortly after the column published, the podcast's fan base began to grow. On Instagram, the "American Girls" podcast went from 2,000 to 7,000 followers, Horrocks said.
After Lyons' column, Horrocks and Mahoney saw an influx of listeners they hadn't yet truly tapped into: those who don't have a predefined passion for history.
The podcast is made to be friendly to those listeners, Mahoney said.
"I think sometimes people think history is very inaccessible ... that there's no way it could be of interest to you," Mahoney said. "In reality, it's just a form of storytelling and meaning-making."
As much as the podcast is a story of telling stories, it's also a story of friendship.
Although Horrocks and Mahoney met briefly when they were both undergrads at Trinity, they became actual friends while Ph.D. students at UConn.
And since meeting, they've each labeled the other as their best friend.
Both women said that the idea of a best friend, or even close friendship in general, seems to come more naturally to millennials than to older age groups.
Horrocks said that she once gave a talk, which Mahoney attended. When a man in his 50s asked Mahoney why she was there, she candidly told him it was because Horrocks is her best friend.
The man responded that the idea of a best friend is childish, Horrocks said.
"Maybe in other generations, that's a thing for children," Horrocks said. "I think especially women our age are really open about the importance of friends."
The genuine closeness between Horrocks and Mahoney bleeds into the podcast, smoothing the discussion and keeping listeners engaged.
And when listeners do reach out - whether with a short comment or an involved saga - they enter that intimate space, Mahoney said.
"When we started this show, we thought maybe a couple of friends would listen," Mahoney said. "That's how it started, but the life of the show has really been a surprise for us."

Texto completo: A year ago, The New York Times opinion section published an anonymous op-ed headlined "I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration."
The headline was followed by this subhead: "I work for the president but like-minded colleagues and I have vowed to thwart parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations."
In the piece, the anonymous writer calls out Mr. Trump's amorality with this devastating observation: "Anyone who works with him knows he is not moored to any discernible first principle that guides his decision making."
The writer also described Mr. Trump's leadership style as "impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective" - descriptions that seem relatively tame by the standard of chaotic, bumbling and disastrous leadership on display during the abandonment of the Kurds in Syria last week.
The opinion piece was an immediate sensation and set off a search for the most likely scribe in that writhing den of opportunistic snakes that is the Trump administration. Official Washington has always loved parlor games, so for a week or two, hope shifted from the ongoing, leak-proof Mueller investigation to a cabal within the White House to save American democracy.
The mysterious writer, whose identity is known to only a small circle of editors at The New York Times, is described at the end of the piece only as "a senior official in the Trump administration."
Trump loyalists pointed to the piece as evidence of the existence of a "deep state" dedicated to undermining Mr. Trump's presidency. The generals who still worked in the White House at the time were considered prime suspects because their allegiance to a "higher authority" than politics always made them look shady in comparison to the administration's apparatchiks.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Vice President Mike Pence showed up on the list of suspects, but both denied responsibility for it faster than Peter's denial of Christ after his arrest at the Garden of Gethsemane.
Intrigue about the identity of the op-ed writer soon took a back seat to the chaotic mundanity of living daily in Donald Trump's America. The piece was originally published on Sept. 5, 2018. Much has happened since then.
What we once considered normative in American politics has been shattered too many times to ever be taken for granted again. The chaos at the Trump White House has only gotten wilder.
So what happened to the op-ed writer who assured us that a patriotic remnant was in place at the White House to provide a reliable backstop to Mr. Trump's craziest notions. Is that anonymous writer still with us, or was he/she swept away during the resignations and firings of the past year? Is the so-called Resistance within the White House still intact?
We are now in the early stages of an impeachment inquiry. It is likely that the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives will, indeed, send the result of its investigations to the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate with a recommendation that Mr. Trump be removed from office because of a preponderance of evidence.
The conventional wisdom until last week was that Republicans in the Senate would not seriously entertain removing Mr. Trump from office because he is still popular with their base. The shameful betrayal of the Kurds and the mounting fury of Republicans over the blatant self-dealing of the Doral G-7 debacle has exposed cracks in his once impregnable Maginot Line of conservative Senate support.
On Sunday, Fox News' Chris Wallace told White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney that a well-placed source told him that 20% of Republican senators might consider voting with their Democratic colleagues to remove Mr. Trump from office, a scenario that the embattled Mulvaney dismissed as absurd and unworthy of a response.
Earlier in the week, Mr. Mulvaney conceded in the wildest press briefing ever conducted by a White House official that the Trump administration did try to strong arm Ukraine into investigating a political rival's son in exchange for the delivery of weapons already approved by Congress and that it "happened all the time."
It felt to many as if Mr. Mulvaney was attempting to "normalize" behavior that former State Department employees were pointing out to various House committees last week as gross deviations from the norm.
As bipartisan outrage over the "confession" grew, Mr. Mulvaney backpedalled and claimed that he never said what everyone with a set of properly working ears and eyes saw and heard him say, including Mr. Trump.
When Mr. Mulvaney said that Mr. Trump wasn't interested in fattening his own bottom line by offering the services of his Florida resort as the site of the G-7 next year, he added the odd observation that the president still considered himself in the "hospitality business."
Again, there was another wave of outrage and calls for Mr. Trump to replace Mr. Mulvaney, who doesn't appear capable of opening his mouth without saying the most incriminating things possible about his boss.
Mr. Mulvaney, a man who was a tea party conservative until he joined the even more fiscally-irresponsible Trump administration, bore evidence of the president's unfitness for office every time he opened his mouth. What kind of a moron would have Mick Mulvaney as his chief of staff?
It made me wonder if Mr. Mulvaney is the one playing 3D chess. Is he openly sabotaging the Trump administration by being so breathtakingly incompetent? Is the source for The New York Times anonymous op-ed hiding in plain sight as Mr. Trump's most fierce defender at the White House?
Nah, that's ridiculous! Though Mr. Mulvaney is bright enough to have written The Times' essay, he's never displayed enough moral courage to make a decent traitor. It's hard to grow a conscience overnight.

Bowing To Cartels Isn't Peace

Texto completo: The decision to release El Chapo's son is a reminder that Mexico needs a coherent strategy to fight violence.
MEXICO CITY -- Parents hugged their children behind locked doors of nurseries while gunshots rang out on the streets. Men with Kalashnikovs and burning trucks blocked key roads and access to the airport. Fifty-one inmates including murderers and kidnappers broke out of jail. To avoid more bloodshed, the Mexican government ordered the release of Ovidio Guzmán López -- son of the convicted drug kingpin Joaquin Guzmán, known as El Chapo -- who had been indicted in the United States for drug trafficking and captured by Mexican government forces. Cartel gunmen had taken to the streets in response to Mr. Guzmán's arrest.
As these events unfolded in the city of Culiacán in the state of Sinaloa on Thursday, they were broadcast live on TV and social media, raising fears about a failure in the security strategy of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Some people were relieved the official death toll that night was only eight, although several more corpses were found on Friday. But the Sinaloa cartel won, the government capitulated to its terror, and gangsters continue to have a level of control in swaths of the country.
On Friday, President López Obrador defended the decision to give in to the cartel's demand to release Mr. Guzmán, saying it avoided a massacre. "You can't fight fire with fire ... We don't want deaths. We don't want war," he said. "With justice, we will guarantee peace and tranquillity in the country." The problem is that his government is absolutely not guaranteeing peace and tranquillity, and violence rages daily.
The call to set Mr. Guzmán free in the midst of the fighting was a tough decision. Cartel thugs even attacked a military family unit, putting the lives of officers' children at stake. Other soldiers were reportedly held at gunpoint. There is a valid debate about the proper response to a hostage situation.
But the decision sends a message that cartels will be allowed to use violence to get their way. The Mexican security forces fumbled the operation from the start, arresting a top Sinaloa cartel suspect without enough backup to secure the area. And President López Obrador needs to forge a coherent strategy that provides a basic protection for citizens while tackling the deeper problems behind the violence.
Mr. López Obrador won his election last year thanks in part to his calls to end decades of corruption and uplift the poor. He rightly railed against the bloodshed and poverty that make people flee their homes, saying Mexico yearned for peace. Yet almost a year into office, homicide rates continue at record levels of more than 3,000 a month, while there are horrific incidents like gunmen ambushing and killing 13 police officers in the state of Michoacan last week.
I have been one of many voices criticizing the war on drugs and its catastrophic effects on Mexico. But the answer is not to give in to drug cartels, who can hold a major city and its residents under siege. The idea of drug policy reform, legalizing some drugs and providing better treatment for addicts, is to reduce the resources going to cartels and stop their rule of terror.
The problem in Mexico over the past decade is not only that the government has cracked down on traffickers by burning opium and marijuana fields. It is also that the cartels have used their billions to build paramilitary forces that lay waste to chunks of the country. It is not just a war on drugs but also a war financed by drugs. And that war does not stop even if the government is not attacking them.
Mr. López Obrador rightly points out that he inherited this problem. Reporting here since 2001, I have covered many dark days of this conflict: the massacre of 72 migrants; the disappearance of 43 students; cartel gunmen shooting down a military helicopter; a mass grave with more than 250 skulls. Yet that does not excuse him from the need to confront this humanitarian crisis.
The president appears to be struggling to win support from all his security forces. He created a new National Guard to bolster troops, but many of its members are occupied stopping Central American refugees and migrants from reaching the United States. Federal police officers blockaded streets in protest against being forced to join the National Guard, saying they would lose pay and benefits. And Mexican media outlets reported that elements in the army were unhappy with the outcome of Thursday's debacle in Culiacán.
President López Obrador needs to rally support from his forces and send out a clear message that criminal groups cannot ambush and murder them. He needs these forces to reduce the homicide rate and stop armed criminals from openly taking control of city centers. At the same time, his government could lead a more coherent plan for drug policy reform; there is already a smattering of bills in Mexico's Congress on the issue. And the government can press on with worthy social programs to steer young people from crime.
The United States also bears responsibility for this bloodshed. Between 2007 and 2018, more than 150,000 firearms seized in Mexico were traced to U.S. gun shops and factories. If serious American gun reform happens in the coming years, lawmakers should also listen to the gunshots over the Rio Grande.
Reducing Mexico's body count is a herculean task. But if politics is for anything, it should be to save lives. Just talking about justice does not stop bullets; cartel control is not peace.

THE PULL OF EXTREMISM WHITE NATIONALISM IS GROWING AND DIVIDING

Texto completo: "Screw your optics."
Those were among the last words posted online by Robert Bowers before he attacked the Tree of Life synagogue on Oct. 27, according to the federal indictment against him.
Those words were also a reflection of a debate that has split the white nationalist movement for years but has rarely reached the general public's eye. The reactions to Mr. Bowers' final post reveal much about that movement's direction since then.
The "optics debate" pits those who say they want to achieve a white-only or white-dominated nation through persuasion and politics against others - some calling themselves accelerationists - who want to start a race war as soon as possible.
To some of the former, the Tree of Life massacre was "strategically stupid," as one put it in an audio blog.
For others, though, that last post became a meme. A search for Twitter posts including "screw your optics" reveals 42 of them in August alone - a full nine months after the phrase was coined - including tweets dealing with white nationalism and mass killings, but also some broadly referencing U.S. or European politics, or topics as mundane as gardening and the decision to get contact lenses. A Google search, meanwhile, revealed at least 40 images captioned with some version of "screw your optics."
The Tree of Life massacre didn't end the "optics debate." But it may have shifted the balance as it reverberated through the increasingly networked white nationalist and supremacist movements in the U.S., Europe and the Australian subcontinent.
Some who study the white identity movement say that it continues to gain momentum and stridency, even as the media and many politicians decry violence perpetrated in its name at Tree of Life, Christchurch in New Zealand, El Paso, Texas, and elsewhere.
In the past year, "things have just gotten so much worse," said John Horgan, a psychology professor at Georgia State University who researches terrorism and violent extremism. Ethnic, racial and religious incitement "is insidious. It's pervasive. And it seems to be becoming an attractive counterculture to an increasing number of young people."
From 'amnats' to Atomwaffen
White supremacy today is "on the resurgence," said Kathleen Blee, distinguished professor of sociology and dean of the Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences at the University of Pittsburgh. She traces the growth in the movement to the ease of participation through web forums and social media and in part to the election of President Barack Obama. "What propels white supremacy historically is threat," she said. "The idea that the white race is imperiled by a black presidency. That threat started mobilizing people."
White supremacy today is also distinguished by the prevalence of the "great replacement theory" - the idea that there is a plot, masterminded by Jews, to replace whites with other races. The theory has caught fire among white supremacists in the last decade or so, said Ms. Blee, and was referenced by name by the shooters in Christchurch, El Paso, and at a synagogue in Poway, Calif., near San Diego.
"There's a clear structure to how this works, and what this ideology does is that it focuses attention on certain groups as the enemy and makes the issue seem very, very urgent," she said. "That's the fear part. The race war is going to start right now. The threat is immediate, urgent and that action can be taken. Bowers and many other people buy into that."
What the FBI calls "racially motivated violent extremism" - including anti-Semitism and crime driven by bias related to gender identity - is on the rise nationally and locally, said John Pulcastro, a supervisory intelligence analyst with the bureau's Pittsburgh office. He can't quantify the prevalence of extremism but said that the numbers of acts, tips and preventive interventions have risen, especially since 2017's Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville, Va.
"It's a major focus of our intelligence unit right now and it's a national threat priority for the FBI nationally as a whole," said Mr. Pulcastro, who has spent 20 of his 30 years with the bureau working on extremism cases.
Optics - the way things look - may not have mattered to white nationalists a century ago, when the movement was epitomized by hooded Ku Klux Klan members and burning crosses. In 2017, though, initial images from Charlottesville conveyed a much different impression - clean-cut young men in polos and khakis, holding tiki torches. Advocates for "optics" won that day.
Only the next morning did the Nazi and Confederate flags appear, followed at the end by some very bad optics - video of a car driven by neo-Nazi James Fields plowing through counterprotesters and killing Heather D. Heyer, 32.
"After Charlottesville there was a huge debate about optics," wrote one self-described American Nationalist, who communicated with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in September and October and is profiled in a companion piece on this page. He characterized a divide between "pretenders who want to look tough wearing swastikas, and yell about killing people" and "actual White American Nationalists who disavow violence, promote change through policy, care about America, and refuse to dress up like some costumed freak to gain attention."
His side, he wrote, has "rules such as: If anyone tries to get you to do something illegal or tells you that they're gonna do something illegal, that person gets cut off immediately and forever."
Requests for comment from the other side of the optics debate resulted in long streams of mocking, often vulgar and sometimes threatening social media posts including references to shooting and raping journalists, pictures in which guns are pointed at the viewer and name-calling like "filthy dumb journo scum."
In the days after the Tree of Life massacre, the New York-based Network Contagion Research Institute turned its computer analysis tools to the use of the word "optics" on Gab.com, on which Mr. Bowers posted. "Optics" was closely associated with "infight" and with these extremist terms:
* wn, short for white nationalism, or the desire for a "white homeland."
* amnat, short for American nationalism, an avowedly nonracist reaction to globalism.
* civnat, a far-right term for moderate-to-conservative whites.
* Atomwaffen, a violent neo-Nazi clique.
* blackpill, a term for the act of pushing another person deep into nihilism.
Also associated closely with "optics" was the acronym gtkrwn - extremist code for "gas the kikes, race war now," said Joel Finkelstein, the director of the NCRI, which uses technology to study racism and anti-Semitism.
"When [Mr. Bowers] is talking about optics and passing it off as bravado to the public," said Mr. Finkelstein, "he's telling his own community that, 'we're ready to have a coming out party, and this is it.'"
The FBI, said Mr. Pulcastro, urges the public to be alert to the provocative word "invasion" in reference to immigration, the term "blood and soil," and the 14-word creed of white extremists: "We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children."
According to Mr. Finkelstein, "screw your optics" put Mr. Bowers solidly into the pantheon of far-right accelerationists.
"Bowers is kind of a meme now," he said. "He's not just a guy. He's a thing to do."
'Then we'll have our way'
From the outside, it may seem ridiculous that slaughtering aging Jews at worship in Pittsburgh or Hispanic shoppers in El Paso could advance any cause. Some fringe figures, though, saw it as a win for the far side of the optics debate.
One Gab poster early this year called Mr. Bowers "a good person who snapped, because of all the Anti-White [stuff] going on," according to the Tampa Bay Times. That post is reportedly attributed to Daniel McMahon, a Tampa-area man who frequently went by the name Jack Corbin online. Mr. Bowers repeatedly shared Jack Corbin posts before the Tree of Life massacre, according to the Network Contagion Research Institute.
In September, federal prosecutors in Charlottesville indicted Mr. McMahon, 31, for electronically intimidating an African American man into dropping a bid for a seat on that city's council.
Screwing the optics makes perfect sense to some self-described accelerationists, who believe that provoking society and speeding its decline is the surest path to a white nation, said Peter Simi, an associate professor of sociology at Chapman University in Irvine, Calif., and author of "American Swastika: Inside the White Power Movement's Hidden Spaces of Hate."
The term "accelerationist" originally referred to people who believe that ever-speeding technological and social change can prompt painful - but ultimately desirable - change. In recent years, some on the right fringe have adopted the term.
The rightist accelerationist logic, Mr. Simi said, is that by repeatedly damaging the prevailing system, they "can get to this total collapse, 'and then we'll have our way.'"
Those accelerationists have gained urgency from anti-immigrant rhetoric in politics and the media, experts agreed.
"Their view is, we don't need to just act, we need to act now, rather than later, because if we don't act, our very way of life is at risk," said Mr. Horgan, the Georgia State psychology professor. "We can't wait because we are being invaded."
Since Tree of Life, Poway and the Christchurch mosque massacre in New Zealand - before which the accused echoed "screw your optics" in his online posts - Mr. Simi has seen the emergence of a discussion thread more chilling than the optics conversation.
"I saw discussion that was very, kind of, strategic about how the person got radicalized, how they could have been more effective in terms of killing more people - this kind of after-incident assessment," he said.
International nationalism
The Anti-Defamation League counted 18 known attacks or plots by white supremacists in the U.S. between Oct. 27 and mid-September. Several were anti-Semitic, including Poway, in which a 19-year-old, following a script chillingly reminiscent of Tree of Life, killed one and injured three before his gun jammed.
Bari Weiss, New York Times columnist and author of the recently released book "How to Fight Anti-Semitism," still calls modern American Jews "the luckiest diaspora in Jewish history." Compared with anti-Semitism in Europe, "the cancer here is at stage 1 rather than at stage 4," she said. Ms. Weiss grew up in Squirrel Hill and celebrated her bat mitzvah at Tree of Life.
"In no way did I think that what happened in Pittsburgh would happen in America," she said. "I thought that violent anti-Semitism was something that happened in other places."
But white nationalism has become more overtly international.
"We had European white supremacists marching in Charlottesville, and American white supremacists marching in Poland," said Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO and national director of the ADL. "White supremacy is a global terror threat."
Organizations on both sides of the Atlantic are increasingly networked, according to an ADL report released in September.
Americans have attended far-right events and conferences in Poland and Scandinavia, the ADL and partner organizations reported. A few prominent figures from the movement even took up temporary residence in Hungary, where anti-immigrant Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has emerged as a hero to xenophobes. And U.S.-based groups like Women for Aryan Unity have established chapters in Europe.
On Oct. 9, the suspected gunman in the Yom Kippur synagogue attack in Halle, Germany, livestreamed the attack on the Amazon-owned Twitch platform, narrating his actions in English in an apparent attempt at maximizing exposure. The Halle gunman failed to enter the synagogue, and then killed two and injured two others nearby.
The video was removed quickly by Twitch but had already been downloaded and copied to Telegram, an encrypted messaging app favored by extremists.

Texto completo: The Celtics were big-time underachievers last season. Presumed front-runners to get to the NBA Finals, they feuded and fumbled all season. As they staggered into the spring, toxic Kyrie Irving told us not to worry. He told us we would see the real Kyrie and the real Celtics in the playoffs.
We did. In Round 2 of the playoffs, Kyrie stunk up the gym and the Celtics got pantsed in a feeble five games against the Milwaukee Bucks.
Mud on their face . . . big disgrace . . . dishonoring championship banners all over the place.
And then they got worse. Lyin' Kyrie took his talents and goofiness to Brooklyn. Al Horford, one of the few adults in a room of child prodigies, bolted for Philadelphia where he thinks he can play for a true contender. Marcus Morris went to the Knicks. Terry Rozier and Aron Baynes were traded.
Despite all of the above — despite a 6-foot-8-inch starting center (Daniel Theis) who seems to have been delivered from the NBA of the 1950s — we are hearing the message that everything is awesome in Celtics land. They are the Hakuna Matata Five once again. They may not have as much talent, the ceiling may be lower, but you are going to love these guys. This is the Green Team narrative.
At the Shamrock Foundation Gala on Thursday at the Westin Waterfront, Celtic co-owner Steve Pagliuca told the crowd, “This is the most positive and uplifting team I have seen in my 15 years."
Swell. But is this feel-good vibe grounded in hope or reality? Pags was here in 2007-08 when the Celtics went to Italy for preseason camp with newcomers Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen. That team was built on “Ubuntu" and blitzed to the NBA championship, wiping out the vaunted Lakers, 131-92, in a sixth and deciding game on the Garden parquet. Can this 2019-2020 team really be more “uplifting" than that?
I dove into the Globe clips to recall exactly how bad things were here in mid-May when the Celtics were humiliated by the Bucks. There was a lot going on in Boston sports during those days. Half of the members of the world champion Red Sox visited with President Trump, while almost all Sox players of color boycotted. The Bruins were finishing up with the Colum­bus Blue Jackets en route to the Stanley Cup Final. The Patriots were claiming to have had the best draft since Red Auerbach made off with Bill Russell, Tommy Heinsohn, and K. C. Jones in 1956. There was crazy talk about the Celtics maybe trading for Anthony Davis.
The Celtics never had a chance for Davis, of course. But they did make a deal for 6-foot guard Kemba Walker and Walker is now being asked to drive the Green bus into the new decade.
Everybody loves Walker. He is the anti-Kyrie — also shorter and less accomplished. But he is lovable the way Isaiah Thomas was lovable.
This worries me. Isaiah was a wonderful talent, but the Celtics were never going anywhere with him as their best player. We don't need another little engine that could.
It worries me that Walker teamed with Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and Marcus Smart on the 2019 Team USA squad that finished seventh in the ­FIBA Basketball World Cup. They could not beat France. And now we need them to beat the Sixers, Bucks, Clippers, and Lakers? Walker will have the ball in his hands all the time, but if the Celtics are going to contend they need Tatum and Brown to be their best players and they need Gordon Hayward to return to the form that made him an All-Star in Utah. These guys won't have Kyrie to kick around anymore. Time to step up.
The Celtics are going to have trouble with interior defense. Horford, Baynes, and Morris were their paint defenders. Now we are going to see a steady diet of Theis and Enes Kanter. Look out below. Who is going to guard Joel Embiid when the Celtics open their season Wednesday in Philadelphia?
The Green Team is projected to finished third in the Eastern Conference with about 48 wins. That might be generous. The Sunday New York Times had the Celtics finishing fourth in the Atlantic Division, just ahead of the woeful Knicks.
The 2019-2020 Celtics will be more fun to watch than last year's edition. And easier to coach. They will play team-above-self basketball. They will possibly exceed expectations and the same fans who regularly torch the Red Sox and Bruins will be happy.
Once again, the franchise that's won a single championship in 33 years will operate noise-free in a town that can be brutal toward its teams.
When it comes to the Boston Celtics, optimism always trumps reality. It's a Green Team thing.

Two women who love history bring it to life through a podcast about the American Girl dolls

Texto completo: For many people, “history” is a topic of middle and high school classes, a thing of the past with no application to daily life.
But 32-year-old Allison Horrocks and 33-year-old Mary Mahoney see history as a way of connecting with others. And they’re using American Girl dolls to illustrate that point.
Horrocks and Mahoney – who both earned undergraduate degrees from Hartford’s Trinity College and Ph.D.s in history from UConn – launched a podcast called “American Girls,” in February.
In the twice-monthly episodes, the two historians unearth the American Girl books that many of us read as kids. The books follow each character as they live in their respective time period – the classic series of characters are set anywhere from the 1760s to the 1970s.
American Girl offers an easy point of access into the study of history, something that many listeners don’t usually think about in their adult lives, Horrocks said.
“They haven’t really been connected to these kinds of topics since they were kids,” Horrocks said. “They’re listening, in some ways, more eagerly because they hav-en’t thought about this kind of stuff in 25 years.”
After inviting listeners to step into a historical world on each episode, Horrocks and Mahoney launch into debates about the problematic aspects of American Girl, draw links to pop culture and talk about the lessons that the characters learn.
And for many, the podcast hits home.
The two women’s easy on-air banter – they’re best friends in real life, too – paired with the some- times-heavy topics that the American Girl books bring up has spurred many listeners to reach out to the show with their own personal stories.
For example, after airing an episode about the character Josefina Montoya who deals with the grief of losing her mother, listeners sent in stories about their own loss, some of them about the loss of a parent when they were a child.
When Horrocks and Mahoney first launched the podcast, they talked about it at the National Council on Public History’s annual meeting – which was held in Hart- ford in March. That gave them an early base of listeners, many of whom were already listening to other history podcasts.
But in August, New York Times television critic Margaret Lyons wrote a column about the podcast, touching on her own childhood memories of American Girl and the experiences that shaped her into who she is today.
After Lyons’ column, Horrocks and Mahoney saw an influx of listeners they hadn’t yet truly tapped into: Those who don’t have a predefined passion for history.
The podcast is made to be friendly to those listeners, Mahoney said.
“I think sometimes people think history is very inaccessible … that there’s no way it could be of interest to you,” Mahoney said.
As much as the pod- cast is a story of telling stories, it’s also a story of friendship.
The closeness between Horrocks and Mahoney bleeds into the podcast, smoothing the discussion and keeping listeners engaged.
And when listeners do reach out – whether with a short comment or an involved saga – they enter that intimate space, Mahoney said.
“When we started this show, we thought maybe a couple of friends would listen,” Mahoney said. “That’s how it started, but the life of the show has really been a surprise for us.”

Jazz great Cannonball made Tallahassee proud

Texto completo: In Tallahassee, in the early 1940s, one might have heard Glenn Miller's "In the Mood," or Frank Sinatra crooning a love ballad on the radio. But, if you were in the right place you might have heard Julian Adderley and his brother Nat playing the saxophone and cornet live.
Julian Adderley Jr., or "Cannonball" as he was professionally known, was one of our most famous jazz musicians. He got there by having great parents, a solid education, and checking all the boxes along the way such as a stint in the Army and as a high school teacher.
Early Tallahassee While he was born in Tampa in 1928, Julian's family moved to Tallahassee when he was young. His father, Dr. Julian Adderley Sr., and his mother, Jessie, were educators and had obtained teaching positions at Florida A&M University. As a cornetist himself, Dr. Adderley instilled a love of music in his sons Julian Jr., and Nat.
By the time Julian was 14, he was playing with his own band at local venues in the historic Frenchtown section. By one account, he played with the great Ray Charles here before either were known.
After graduating from FAMU in 1948, Julian became a high school band director at Dillard High School in Fort Lauderdale. Uncle Sam called in 1950 and he was drafted into the U.S. Army where he became the leader of the 36th Army Dance Band.
The Big Apple With his military service over, he moved to New York City in 1955 planning to pursue graduate studies in Manhattan. However, one night his destiny changed after finding his way into the famous Cafe Bohemia in Greenwich Village accompanied by his brother Nat, a cornet player like their father, and was asked to sit in for the band's regular saxophonist.
The Cafe Bohemia was considered the mecca for finger-snapping jazz and progressive music conception. At the end of the evening, the manager called out to Nat "Who is that guy?" Nat shouted back, "Cannibal!" which was a nickname he had been given because of his ferocious appetite. The manager misunderstood and introduced him as "Cannonball" to the jazz patrons. The name stuck.
Shortly thereafter, he began to be referred to as the next Charlie Parker, who died earlier the same year, and was later immortalized in the movie "Bird" directed by Clint Eastwood.
Not unlike most musicians, Cannonball was involved with different bands performing with other fledgling performers such as John Coltrane, Miles Davis, and Sarah Vaughan for the next few years. Along the way, he made his coast-to-coast television debut on NBC's the Tonight Show, hosted by Steve Allen, in July, 1956.
Performing with Nat In September 1959, Cannonball reunited with Nat and formed the Cannonball Adderley Quintet. The quintet recorded live one month later at the San Francisco Jazz Workshop and became an immediate success. For the next 16 years the quintet performed in venues all over the country.
Cannonball's personality also played a role in making the band popular. He loved to interact with the audience with commentary that explained the music. According to the New York Times, he once said, "I prefer nightclubs to concert dates because I dig the sound of laughter, the murmur of the crowds and that cash register – there's something Freudian about the ringing of a cash register. I feel that when people pay to hear music, I owe them something."
One of Cannonball's most famous record albums was "Mercy, Mercy, Mercy! Live at the Club" recorded in 1966 and received the Grammy Award for the best instrumental jazz performance in 1967.
Cannonball recorded 55 hits as the band leader, seven with his brother Nat, and 25 with other greats such as Sarah Vaughan, Dinah Washington, and Miles Davis.
Back home Even after becoming nationally known, he took time to return to Tallahassee to perform at FAMU's Lee Auditorium in February, 1957 at a benefit for a fraternity scholarship fund. Tallahassee was his home. Though widely traveled, he visited his family often. First at their home on West Pensacola Street, where the FSU law school is now, and later on Young Street near FAMU campus.
Sadly, Cannonball passed away after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage while performing in Gary, Indiana on Aug. 8, 1975 at the age of 46. He is buried in Tallahassee at the Southside Cemetery.
At the beginning of my senior year at Leon High School we had a new guidance counselor, Dr. Julian Adderley. I was a saxophone player, albeit a bad one, so he was like a god.
On the few times I interacted with him I was completely in awe and could barely speak. He was an experienced educator, used to dealing with kids, so instead of just staring at me like I had two heads he gently coaxed the responses he needed.
Cannonball, you are remembered and missed. You did us proud!

BIG TECH CENTER STAGE AT PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

Texto completo: I've been covering technology since the early '80s, and for the first 20 years or so of my career, I recall seeing very few negative media stories and even fewer complaints from politicians. For much of that time, tech pretty much got a free ride. Journalists and elected officials were in awe of what Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo and other tech companies had accomplished and were optimistic about what the future might be.
There were some anti-trust hearings and an eventual trial over Microsoft's domination of personal computing and the fear that that would carry over to the internet. But for the most part, politicians were either ignorant or positive when it came to tech. The word "big tech" was not a major part of our vocabulary.
Fast forward to 2019 when politicians from both sides of the aisle seem almost obsessed with potential problems arising from tech companies. The president and his allies claim that Twitter, Google and Facebook are biased against conservatives while Democrats complain about how these platforms were illegitimately used by Russia to tilt the 2016 election in favor of Donald Trump. Both sides complain about privacy, and there are people across the political spectrum who agree that tech needs to be regulated, even if they can't agree on hardly anything else.
Tech was very much on the agenda at Tuesday night's Democratic presidential debate as candidates responded to questions from New York Times national editor Marc Lacey as well as each other.
Lacey began by asking Andrew Yang if he agreed with Sen. Elizabeth Warren's call to break up companies like Facebook, Amazon and Google. Yang agreed that "Sen. Warren is 100% right in diagnosing the problem," but diverged on solutions, pointing out that "We also have to be realistic that competition doesn't solve all the problems. It's not like any of us wants to use the fourth-best navigation app. That would be like cruel and unusual punishment. There is a reason why no one is using Bing today."
He went on to say "It's not like breaking up these big tech companies will revive Main Street businesses around the country" and "Breaking up the tech companies does nothing to make our kids healthier," after claiming that "Studies clearly show that we're seeing record levels of anxiety and depression coincident with smartphone adoption and social media use."
Warren retorted that competition isn't working. "About 8%, 9% of all retail sales happen at bricks and sticks stores, happen at Walmart. About 49% of all sales online happen in one place: That's Amazon," she said. I fact-checked her numbers, and she's not far off. Warren added, "It collects information from every little business, and then Amazon does something else. It runs the platform, gets all the information, and then goes into competition with those little businesses."
Tom Steyer agreed that tech companies "either have to be broken up or regulated," but then turned his attention to why he could beat President Trump a useful pitch for Democratic voters, but not very helpful when it came to the key question.
Corey Booker said, "We have a massive crisis in our democracy with the way these tech companies are being used, not just in terms of anti-competitive practices, but also to undermine our democracy," adding "We need regulation and reform."
I agree with Beto O'Rourke's first comment, "We need to set very tough, very clear, transparent rules of the road," but not with his assertion that tech companies like Facebook are "more akin to a publisher. They curate the content that we see."
While it is true that algorithms used by Facebook and other social media companies help surface what people see, the content itself is generated from users, not from journalists or other professionals who work for and report to the companies.
The problem with O'Rourke's claim is that classifying social media companies as publishers means they are responsible for everything on their platform, which could have a chilling effect on the free speech of their users.
The only way Facebook could vet and verify everything anyone posted would be to hire thousands of editors to read every post and decide whether it was a valid opinion or a fact, just as newspapers do for everything from reporter generated stories to op-eds. Even letters to the editors go through an editing process before they're printed in most newspapers, which holds them to different standards than what people can post on online forums or social media. That's not to say they shouldn't remove posts that violate their terms of service, but making that a requirement could have unintended consequences.
Sen. Kamala Harris used the tech question to take a shot at Warren, asking her to back her demand that "Twitter suspend Donald Trump's account."
Warren, who is taking a lot more incoming now that she's one of the top contenders, wouldn't take the bait, and I don't blame her. While it's very true that Trump has used Twitter to make mean comments and spread false information, it's also true that, whether you like him or not, he's president of the United States and what he says is, for that reason alone, newsworthy. There are lines that even public officials shouldn't cross, but it's right for Twitter to give him and other politicians a platform and to continue to give any other Twitter users the right to comment, respond and express their reaction to what the president posts.
In June, Twitter announced a policy to "place a notice a screen you have to click or tap through before you see the tweet to provide additional context and clarity," whenever a public official posts a tweet that "would otherwise be in violation of our rules."
Although I've expressed my thoughts on what was said Tuesday night, I'm not taking sides in the primary or the election, but, along with many in Silicon Valley and across the country, I will be watching to see how the candidates grapple with the very real issues of how tech is affecting our lives, our economy and our democracy.

Texto completo: Love is in the air
Rom-coms may be an endangered species in theaters, but the genre is alive and kicking in "Modern Love," a new anthology series based on the long-running New York Times column. Watching glamorous stars like Andy Garcia, Tina Fey and Dev Patel flirt and fight to coffeehouse music can get a little precious, but even curmudgeons will be forced to smile when Anne Hathaway leads a musical number in a grocery-store parking lot.
Now streaming on Amazon Prime
Face off
Paul Rudd does double duty in "Living With Yourself," an unpredictable new dramedy about a sad-sack advertising executive who may lose his wife (Aisling Bea) to his peppier 2.0 version, manufactured in a strip mall. Rudd offers a master class in subtle acting, differentiating his competing characters with the teeniest adjustments in posture and turns of the mouth, but the eight-part series works only because Bea is so properly flustered by a bizarre version of the Dating Game.
Now streaming on Netflix
Les miserables
"The Good Place" star Jameela Jamil takes contestants to very bad places in "The Misery Index," a game show in which contestants try to predict how experts rated the impact of groan-inducing situations like a husband leaving his wife after winning the lottery or a bulldog attacking its owner's private parts. "This isn't the 'Price Is Right!' " bellows a member of "Impractical Jokers," whose members chime in as advisers. No, it isn't.

Texto completo: Special to the Star Tribune
For two decades, Gail Collins has brought her tart observations and puncturing wit to the New York Times op-ed page, in which time she has also written three books on the history of American women. The latest installment, "No Stopping Us Now: A History of Older Women in America," concerns the status and condition of a sector of the population which, at different times, has been the most powerful age group among women and, at others, the most disregarded or scorned among the population at large.
Collins traces attitudes toward older women from the colonial period to the present, showing that the age at which a woman was considered too old to be useful or attractive was influenced by economic conditions and increasingly shaped by popular entertainment and mass marketing. In early colonial days, older women, who often held property, were considered a catch. With the increase in female population, the status of women and, perforce, older women declined dramatically until late in the 19th century when certain older, well-heeled ladies began to form cultural clubs and later, a portion of them led the campaign for female suffrage.
Wars and the extraction of men from the workforce offered women, young and old, economic opportunity. But, after World War I came the era of Prohibition and with it the speakeasy and the aggressively young, boyishly contoured flapper, leaving no place for the older woman in the era's self-image. An ad in Ladies' Home Journal in 1922 put it this way: "You've got to make up in cleverness what you've lost in youth. Your corsets are all that stands between you and that vague, shapeless bourn from whence no traveler returns -- age." After World War II, the housing boom and the decline of multigenerational domestic arrangements brought another blow to the older woman. Her widowed presence was no longer desirable in the single-family, all-American home.
Collins, a connoisseur of humbug, leavens her history with examples of highhanded pontifications from every era. In "Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex ... ," Dr. David Reuben wrote that old women "having outlived their ovaries … may have outlived their usefulness as human beings." This grim news came in 1969, right at the end of the decade that installed youth as the highest human achievement and instigated the widespread use of hormone replacement.
Collins covers familiar developments and events in women's history which, important though they are, are not specific to older women and might have been treated more succinctly. Further, she devotes by far the greatest attention to white, middle- and upper-middle-class women. And, once she gets to the 1980s and beyond, she drifts into a form of celebrity news, increasingly drawing upon the doings of TV and movie stars, media figures and politicians to make her points. Still, "No Stopping Us Now" -- a catchphrase that does sum up the more favorable position of older women in our own time -- is an engaging book, featuring throughout Collins' infectious relish for delusion and hucksterism.

This year's Celtics have a feel-good vibe. Is it grounded in hope or reality?

Texto completo: The Celtics were big-time underachievers last season. Presumed front-runners to get to the NBA Finals, they feuded and fumbled all season. As they staggered into the spring, toxic Kyrie Irving told us not to worry. He told us we would see the real Kyrie and the real Celtics in the playoffs.
We did. In round 2 of the playoffs, Kyrie stunk up the gym and the Celtics got pantsed in a feeble five games against the Milwaukee Bucks.
Mud on their face . . . big disgrace . . . dishonoring championship banners all over the place.
And then they got worse. Lyin' Kyrie took his talents and goofiness to Brooklyn. Al Horford, one of the few adults in a room of child prodigies, bolted for Philadelphia where he thinks he can play for a true contender. Marcus Morris went to the Knicks. Terry Rozier and Aron Baynes were traded.
Despite all of the above — despite a 6-foot-8-inch starting center (Daniel Theis) who seems to have been delivered from the NBA of the 1950s — we are hearing the message that everything is awesome in Celtics land. They are the Hakuna Matata Five once again. They may not have as much talent, the ceiling may be lower, but you are going to love these guys. This is the Green Team narrative.
At the Shamrock Foundation Gala Thursday at the Westin Waterfront, Celtic co-owner Steve Pagliuca told the crowd, “This is the most positive and uplifting team I have seen in my 15 years."
Swell. But is this feel-good vibe grounded in hope or reality? Pags was here in 2007-08 when the Celtics went to Italy for preseason camp with newcomers Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen. That team was built on “Ubuntu" and blitzed to the NBA championship, wiping out the vaunted Lakers, 131-92, in a sixth and deciding game on the Garden parquet. Can this 2019-2020 team really be more “uplifting" than that?
I dove into the Globe clips to recall exactly how bad things were here in mid-May when the Celtics were humiliated by the Bucks. There was a lot going on in Boston sports during those days. Half of the members of the world champion Red Sox visited with President Trump, while almost all Sox players of color boycotted. The Bruins were finishing up with the Columbus Blue Jackets en route to a Stanley Cup Final. The Patriots were claiming to have had the best draft day since Red Auerbach made off with Bill Russell, Tommy Heinsohn, and K. C. Jones in 1956. There was crazy talk about the Celtics maybe trading for Anthony Davis.
The Celtics never had a chance for Davis, of course. But they did make a deal for 6-foot guard Kemba Walker and Walker is now being asked to drive the Green bus into the new decade.
Everybody loves Walker. He is the anti-Kyrie — also shorter and less accomplished. But he is lovable the way Isaiah Thomas was lovable.
This worries me. Isaiah was a wonderful talent, but the Celtics were never going anywhere with him as their best player. We don't need another little-engine-that-could.
It worries me that Walker teamed with Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and Marcus Smart on the 2019 Team USA squad that finished seventh in the FIBA Basketball World Cup. They could not beat France. And now we need them to beat the Sixers, Bucks, Clippers and Lakers? Walker will have the ball in his hands all the time, but if the Celtics are going to contend they need Tatum and Brown to be their best players and they need Gordon Hayward to return to the form that made him an All-Star in Utah. These guys won't have Kyrie to kick around anymore. Time to step up.
The Celtics are going to have trouble with interior defense. Horford, Baynes, and Morris were their paint defenders. Now we are going to see a steady diet of Theis and Enes Kanter. Look out below. Who is going to guard Joel Embiid when the Celtics open their season Wednesday in Philadelphia?
The Green Team is projected to finished third in the Eastern Conference with about 48 wins. That might be generous. The Sunday New York Times had the Celtics finishing fourth in the Atlantic Division, just ahead of the woeful Knicks.
The 2019-2020 Celtics will be more fun to watch than last year's edition. And easier to coach. They will play team-above-self basketball. They will possibly exceed expectations and the same fans who regularly torch the Red Sox and Bruins will be happy.
Once again, the franchise that's won a single championship in 33 years will operate noise-free in a town that can be brutal toward its teams.
When it comes to the Boston Celtics, optimism always trumps reality. It's a Green Team thing.

Texto completo: This July, I spent a few weeks in Japan. Knowing that the new Portland outpost of Luke's Lobster was on my list of upcoming reviews, I decided to stop in to one of the five Tokyo-area branches. Yes, you read that correctly. There are nearly half-a-dozen Luke's in metropolitan Tokyo-Yokohama alone (plus another three farther south in Japan).
When I arrived during one of the muggiest days of the year, I encountered a line outside: two dozen stoic-yet-miserable-looking people looking down at their phones as they absentmindedly shuffled toward the carryout window.
I wasn't there to eat, so I bypassed the queue and stepped inside to have a look around. When I told the host where I was from, she brightened and said, "Oh, I understand. You're homesick. Does this remind you of home?" I nodded my head in agreement just to be polite, but the truth is: It didn't really.
More than anything in Maine, the space reminded me of the Luke's Lobster in Times Square or the one upstairs in the outdoor Brickell Center shopping center in Miami. And that's no accident. Thanks to a business model that includes vertical integration of a private steel works and furniture shop in Saco, Luke's is able to reproduce a Starbucksian degree of similarity across its restaurants; no two are exactly alike, but they bear an eerie family resemblance to one another.
In part, that's because all 40-ish Luke's Lobsters around the world share the same conceptual DNA as the original East Village, Manhattan, restaurant that opened almost exactly 10 years ago. No matter how far away, each modernized shack is precision-engineered to present a culinary picture postcard vision of New England lobstering. It's Maine viewed through an Epcot filter.
"The philosophy is the same across the board, but it's never a cookie cutter process," co-founder and chief marketing officer Ben Conniff said. "We build with reclaimed wood, materials from fisheries. You need these elements to make people feel like they're visiting Maine."
The effect is not unpleasant, and by New York or Tokyo standards, a delicately dressed, butter-toasted $20 lobster roll certainly represents an affordable way to get a taste of our state's most famous export. Yet each of the Luke's I've visited outside the state feels like it was designed by someone who had barely skimmed the Wikipedia entry for Maine.
When sited at the end of the expensively renovated Portland Pier, the gigantic 175-seat Luke's Lobster that opened this June doesn't seem out-of-place as much as it feels like a well-designed, Maine-themed placeholder - a weighted average of waterfront seafood restaurants across the state.
It's especially true of the terse menu, a greatest-hits collection of seafood shack classics, some of which (like the lobster roll) are decent. The best of the bunch is probably the crab roll ($16/$20), filled to overflowing with Maine-caught Jonah crab that is steamed, then air-jet "picked" in the company's bespoke seafood processing facility in Saco. Before it is mounded into a mayo-painted Country Kitchen roll, it gets drizzled with lemon butter and dusted with the restaurant's perky, celery-seed-forward "secret seasoning" mixture.
Pre-cooking the crab just to the point of doneness is a smart move - one that produces a roll that is tender and never fishy. A similar method works beautifully for sweet, bantam GaspÃ© Bay shrimp from QuÃ©bec - the same species that, until recently, was fished along the Maine coast. Here though, the shrimp are peeled and cooked in Canada, then shipped out to wherever Luke's shrimp rolls ($12/$15) are in demand.
Fried dishes are a bit more hit-or-miss. McCain-sourced, Maine-potato French fries ($3) come amply portioned and are cooked crisp-tender. My party ordered an extra serving for the 7-year-old dining with us, but the four adults at the table ate the entire basket of chunky-cut fries.
Whole belly clams from Community Shellfish in Bremen ($19/$22) are one of the best versions of this deep-fried dish I have eaten this year. Daintily coated in a crunchy, rice-flour (and therefore gluten-free) batter, the clams are flinty and sweet, with finespun layers of essential flavors that call to mind cucumber and iodine.
On the other hand, Icelandic (not Gulf of Maine-fished) haddock - available in a basket of beer-battered, deep-fried cubes ($11) or on a sandwich as a hefty fillet that extends far beyond the borders of a distributor-sourced brioche bun ($14) - is served overcooked and glistening with grease.
One of my dinner guests took a single bite of the sandwich, shook his head and swapped the plate for a Lighthouse Salad upgraded with picked lobster (in the same portion used for the lobster roll) and drizzled with a runny dressing of buttermilk and Atlantic Sea Farms kelp ($22). It's not an especially memorable salad, but it is a lighter way to sample some of the state's natural nosh.
Perhaps the inclusion of kelp in the dressing also represents the first evidence of a reversal of the tides of Luke's Lobster's influence - a hint of the Japanese affinity for seaweed making its way onto the menu in the U.S. I wonder what might happen if the restaurant began to incorporate foodways from far-flung locations in Chicago, Las Vegas and Taipei. For now, though, Luke's remains resolute in its uncanny-valley depiction of the Maine experience, even when it takes place in Maine itself.
In Tokyo, on my walk back to my hotel from the Shibuya Luke's Lobster store, my niece listened patiently as I described the weird approximations that make Luke's feel like it almost (but not quite) deserves a 207 area code. She challenged me, asking if a sanitized, carefully curated depiction of the state isn't what diners "from away" want. Of course, she's right.
Here in Maine, it's a different story - at least for locals. Portlanders will see your vintage lobster buoys and gooey, flakey Two Fat Cats blueberry pie ($9) and raise you a snowmobile, a shot of Allen's Coffee Flavored Brandy, a bottle of maple syrup and a cuffed pant leg teeming with deer ticks.
A competently produced lobster roll is fine and good, but in this town, is that really enough?

Texto completo: The people who oversee track and field have to give serious thought to how much running-shoe technology is too much.
Last weekend's extraordinary marathon performances -- 1 hour 59 minutes 40 seconds by Eliud Kipchoge in Vienna and 2:14:04 by Brigid Kosgei in Chicago -- have focused attention on an already simmering question: Does the International Association of Athletics Federations need a more stringent rule to define legal running shoes?
It appears that running, the original and most elemental of sports, now faces the same tradition vs. scientific innovation challenge that other sports have encountered. Think: tennis rackets, baseball bats and, perhaps most similar, competition swimwear -- those polyurethane-based suits that were banned starting in 2010. The outcome of the current running-shoe debate could affect everything from stock prices of global footwear companies to who wins the Olympic marathon in Japan next summer.
Kipchoge, who became the first person to run the 26.2-mile distance in under two hours, and Kosgei, who set a women's world record, raced in a revolutionary and bizarrely tall Nike shoe that has taken the marathon world by storm since 2016. In the last 13 months alone, male runners in the Nike shoes have recorded the five fastest marathon times ever. Other running-shoe companies are struggling to catch up, and may face patent hurdles.
The current I.A.A.F. rules state only that shoes may not confer an "unfair advantage" and must be "reasonably available" to all. The rule does not explain how these two values can be measured.
This week, the British Journal of Sports Medicine published a commentary that is likely to guide the debate. In it, Geoffrey Burns, a 2:24 marathoner and University of Michigan doctoral candidate in biomechanics, argued for "a single standard in competition running shoes: regulate the shoe midsole thickness."
With the right material, a thicker sole produces more spring. Without clear restrictions, it is likely only a matter of time before someone comes up with a way to make a shoe with more powerful springs.
Burns called for an upper limit of 31 millimeters -- about 1.2 inches -- of midsole. Nike's current Vaporfly 4% and Vaporfly Next% shoes have a 36-millimeter midsole, or about 1.4 inches. Why 31 millimeters? That's a fairly common midsole height for previous models.
Until 2016, marathon racing shoes were constructed from thin slabs of rubber. In 1960, an Ethiopian runner named Abebe Bikila even managed to win the Olympic Marathon in his bare feet. Everyone understood that less was more; you ran more efficiently when you carried minimal weight on your feet.
In 1968, when shopping for the shoes that carried me to victory in that year's Boston Marathon, I had only two criteria. They had to be light and thin, and they had to be cheap. I was still in college. I paid $ 9.95 for my lucky shoes -- a pair of Onitsuka Tiger TG-4 Marathons.
Little changed in the footwear for elite marathoners in the next five decades, until Nike introduced its Vaporfly 4% shoes in 2016. These shoes contained a new midsole foam, Pebax, so lightweight that it is almost like running barefoot. Pebax also delivers 30 percent more energy return than the foams used in most running shoes since the 1970s. This allows Pebax to function almost like leg muscles, but without the fatigue that can debilitate the legs after 20 miles.
The Nike shoes also include a carbon fiber plate in the midsole. This plate might increase energy return, or it might improve foot function during the running stride. Either way, the plate is prominently mentioned in Nike's patent application.
Nike-supported experts soon published papers in scientific journals showing that the Vaporfly shoes could improve marathon times up to 3 percent. That sounds small until you consider it is often the difference between a gold medal and a quickly forgotten fifth-place finish.
The results were so astounding, in fact, that some considered them as just another example of Nike sports marketing.
"I was skeptical at first, but then came the second and third and fourth report," said Ross Tucker of the Science of Sport website. "I had to change my skepticism. Now I think the effect is real, and large."
A 2018 New York Times data analysis based on public race results uploaded to Strava, the athlete-tracking and networking company, found that runners in Vaporflys ran 3 to 4 percent faster than similar runners wearing other shoes.
To be fair, Kipchoge, 34, is an otherworldly talent who has beaten the best in the world in last-generation shoes. There probably isn't another marathoner who could break two hours in the shoes he wore last weekend.
(When I was with Runner's World, I traveled to Kenya with a group from the magazine in 2005. Our dozen or so runners met with Kipchoge's training group one day high in the Great Rift Valley. My wife wanted to get in a few miles, despite the altitude and a hilly course. I sheepishly asked the Kenyan runners if anyone was willing to run at a 12-minute-per-mile pace with us. Kipchoge stepped forward, an easy smile on his face, and did four miles with us.)
Still, the I.A.A.F. acknowledges that it has a problem, especially with the Tokyo Olympics coming up fast. In a statement, it said, "It is clear that some forms of technology would provide an athlete with assistance that runs contrary to the values of the sport." The group has appointed a technical committee to study the shoe question, and make a report in the next two months.
Not every fast marathoner wears Nike shoes. Jared Ward finished sixth in the 2016 Olympic Marathon, and ran 2:09:25 in April in the Boston Marathon. When Ward lines up at the New York City Marathon in two weeks, he'll be wearing Saucony shoes, as he has for years.
But not ones you can find at your local shoe store. Ward has been working with the biomechanist Spencer White, Saucony's vice president for human performance, to design a shoe that is, well, a bit like the Vaporfly. Ward believes they have succeeded. "My new shoes feel so good that I know I'm ready to compete well in them," he said.
Nike is well known in the patent world for its large and increasingly frequent applications. It also has plenty of lawyers, though no one can say what might happen in any patent infringement case until it is litigated.
White said he would be unhappy if the I.A.A.F. tightened its shoe regulation policies. "We could end up limiting creativity and losing the chance to improve running shoes for the everyday runner," he noted. "I think the 'must be widely available' part of the rule is the best answer."
Tucker's view is more in line with Burns's. "The solution is very simple," Tucker said. "Limit the stack height" -- which is the midsole height -- "and ban the addition of springlike devices in the midsole."
Burns would not even go that far. "I don't want to ban anything," he said. "We can do most of what needs doing with a simple midsole-height limitation. My fear is, if we don't do this, in a few years we might end up with footwear that we don't even recognize as shoes."
Amby Burfoot won the 1968 Boston Marathon and was the executive editor of Runner's World from 1985 to 2003. He has published six books on running, including, most recently, "Run Forever."

Texto completo: It's never the wrong time to do the right thing.
Everyman Theatre is showing Radio Golf, the final play in renowned playwright August Wilson's 10-play opus, 'The American Century Cycle.' Radio Golf brings the "crackle of a comedy with old-fashioned melodrama," according to the New York Times, and highlights the challenges faced by modern-day African Americans straddling the line between monetary success and cultural assimilation.
The play opened Oct. 15 and runs through Nov. 17 at Everyman Theatre, located in the up-and-coming Market Center District of Downtown Baltimore. This is the fourth August Wilson production from Everyman, after Fences (2002 and 2015) and Gem of the Ocean (2008). The Harlem Classical Theatre's Associate Artistic Director Carl Cofield makes his Everyman directorial debut with this play.
Radio Golf tells the story of Harmond Wilks, played by Jamil Mangan, a young African-American real estate developer running for Mayor of Pittsburgh in 1997. He opens a campaign office in the heart of Pittsburgh's Hill District, his childhood neighborhood that's fallen into disrepair.
Together with his business partner Roosevelt, played by Jason B. Mcintosh, and wife Mame, a resident company member Dawn Ursula, Harmond's grand plan to develop a neglected block in order to erect a high-rise apartment complex - complete with a Whole Foods and Starbucks - is challenged by two members of the Hill community, Sterling, played by Anton Floyd, and Elder Joseph Barlow, played by Charles Dumas. Harmond must face his uncovered past and weigh the impact and true costs of his personal progress if he chooses to ignore his heritage and legacy.
"Although Radio Golf is set in 1997, August Wilson saw into the future and started this conversation around life in America for upper-class Black folk," Director Carl Cofield said. "How important is success if you're denying and destroying your family's history and culture in order to get it? It's a modern examination of what the American
Dream means today, and has huge resonance in Baltimore and other urban centers."
Because the themes of neighborhood revitalization and cultural crossover directly affect both the Market Center, Bomo area, and Baltimore at large, Everyman is hosting multiple events that will engage community partners and begin to breach these topics in order to start a dialogue between neighbors and engaged Baltimore supporters. These include a neighborhood cleanup day and community panel discussions.
"We specifically chose to bring Radio Golf to Baltimore because of the mirror it holds up to our neighborhood and how it reflects some of the greatest challenges that Baltimore faces today," says Everyman Founding Artistic Director Vincent M. Lancisi. "August Wilson is one of the most revered playwrights of our age. His legacy of chronicling the American century decade by decade has left us with a treasure trove of great stories. Radio Golf is one that is immediate, relevant, and funny all at the same time."
Radio Golf runs from Oct. 15 - Nov. 17 and you can purchase your tickets online at everymantheatre. org, by phone at (410) 752 -2208, or at the Everyman Theatre Box Office at 315 W. Fayette St., Baltimore, Md.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - For the last year, former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has taken heat for his reluctance to criticize President Donald Trump, especially after he resigned in protest last December.
For one night at least, on Thursday, the retired Marine Corps general dropped that tendency as he saturated a comedic keynote address with direct jabs at Trump, who earlier this week called his former Cabinet official "the world's most overrated general."
"I'm honored to be considered that by Donald Trump because he also called Meryl Streep an overrated actress," Mattis said in his keynote speech at the annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner in New York. "So, I guess I'm the Meryl Streep of generals."
When Mattis stepped down, the former defense secretary, who sparred with Trump over military actions between 2016-18, said the president deserved to have someone "whose views are better aligned." On Sunday, Mattis offered words of caution regarding Trump's decision to pull troops out of Syria on "Meet the Press," warning the Islamic State would "resurge" without military pressure.
The president did not appreciate the general airing those concerns.
"You know why?" Trump told lawmakers Wednesday. "He wasn't tough enough. I captured ISIS. Mattis said it would take two years. I captured them in one month."
On Thursday, Mattis also teased Trump for dodging the draft for the Vietnam War because of the "bone spurs" that the president has said he had in both of his heels.
"I earned my spurs on the battlefield," Mattis said. "Donald Trump earned his spurs in a letter from a doctor."
Several high-profile politicians at the dinner, a charity event known for comedic roasts, saluted Mattis's flippant speech. Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., tweeted a photo of himself chatting with the general after the event.
But for other observers, Mattis' zingers drew attention to the military officer's reticence to substantively criticize the president.
Thomas Nichols, a professor at the U.S. Naval War College, said he did not think the speech was an occasion for laughter.
"I don't think anyone should be chuckling at Mattis' brush-off of Trump's insult," he wrote on Twitter. "It's his facile way of dodging the reality that he knows a lot about what happened in this White House, including what are now obviously impeachable acts directly related to his time as SECDEF."
Critics contrasted Mattis' jokes with a Thursday op-ed penned by retired Navy Adm. William McRaven in the New York Times that rebuked the president. Titled "Our Republic Is Under Attack From the President," the Navy officer's piece slammed Trump for abandoning the Kurdish soldiers who fought in Syria as America's allies. "He is wrong," McRaven wrote.
Mattis has defended his decision to keep his personal beliefs about the Trump administration private.
"If you leave an administration, you owe some silence," he told the Atlantic in August. "When you leave an administration over clear policy differences, you need to give the people who are still there as much opportunity as possible to defend the country. They still have the responsibility of protecting this great big experiment of ours."

Short-season leagues, including the New York-Penn League in which Lowell plays, would be disbanded under the plan, which would eliminate 42 affiliated teams in total. Because MLB views Lowell and the Spinners' home, Edward A. LeLacheur Park, as “good," the franchise would continue to exist in the “Dream League," an MLB concept in line with independent or college leagues.
Also dropping to the Dream League would be the two other New England teams in the NYPL: The Vermont Lake Monsters, affiliated with the Oakland Athletics since 2011 and playing at 113-year-old Centennial Field in Burlington since the franchise formed in 1994, and the (Norwich) Connecticut Tigers.
The overhaul, first reported by Baseball America and the New York Times, has emerged from ongoing and now contentious negotiations between MLB and Minor League Baseball over their Professional Baseball Agreement, which will expire on Sept. 30, 2020.
MLB says the primary motivations for the changes, which emerged from the MLB owners' meetings in June and were presented to MiLB in August, are to ensure its young players play in quality facilities — rather than some of the current dilapidated stadiums, mostly found in the lower leagues — and to create a saner geographic layout for both leagues and MLB franchises.
The cuts would serve to motivate MLB to increase the currently meager salaries it pays minor leaguers, an increasingly plaguing issue.
Minor League Baseball does not accept the premise and the impetus for the proposals.
“We are engaged in negotiations, and while both sides have differing views over what's going on, we hope that there's a resolution available, but we are concerned about saving baseball in as many cities in America as we can, and the proposal that's on the table at this point doesn't give us any comfort that that's even possible," said Pat O'Conner, president and CEO of Minor League Baseball, which oversees the current 16-league, 160-team system. “It's the economics. These ownership groups in these communities are just not going to be able to withstand the additional costs the MLB proposal puts on them."
Through other channels, MiLB castigated MLB for seeking cuts after boasting recently about increased minor-league attendance in the face of decreases in the major leagues. In addition, MiLB intimated that the plan could create a feeling of betrayal among members of the US Congress who, besides holding antitrust authority over MLB, are also invested in maintaining baseball's prosperity at all levels.
Dave Heller, owner of the Lowell Spinners and three other affiliated teams, was not immediately available for comment. The Red Sox referred the matter to MLB for elaboration; MLB declined to comment.
The “120 plan" wants to reduce the total number of teams from 160 to 120 and eliminate short-season leagues. It also addresses geographical gerrymandering in places like the Triple A Pacific Coast League, whose 16 teams are spread out from Nashville and Memphis in Tennessee to Tacoma, Wash., and Sacramento.
Each big-league franchise would be limited to four US based full-season franchises, plus one complex-based Rookie-league team.
No other teams in the Red Sox system — Pawtucket/Worcester (Triple A), Portland, Maine (Double A); Salem, Va. (High A); Greenville, S.C. (Single A); and its Gulf Coast squad (Rookie) in Fort Myers, Fla. — would be eliminated or moved out of their league, although there is a high probability that the Single A Carolina and South Atlantic Leagues will be rejiggered and/or drastically reduced.
The “120 plan" calls for a cap on total players under minor-league contract, between 150–200 per franchise, according to an industry source. (Dominican Summer League teams and roster sizes would not be affected.) Including Lowell, the Red Sox have space for 190 minor-league contracts in their system.
Roster sizes of teams would also be altered. With an emphasis on health and wellness for its players closest to being called up, MLB wants to increase the roster size in Double A and Triple A up from 25, which would allow for more player off days, the ability to carry an additional catcher, reduce workloads on pitchers, and effectively create a more serviceable taxi squad.
Also, the “120 plan" seeks to push back the date of the amateur draft from early June to later in the month, after the conclusion of the College World Series.

The best episode of Amazon's 'Modern Love' makes a celebrity marriage approachable

Resumen: Amazon's "Modern Love" anthology series can be a little too sweet, but a Tina Fey/John Slattery episode inspired by Denis Leary is more relatable.

Texto completo: Amazon wants you to just love a little bit again.
The streaming service's new anthology series, "Modern Love," is based on The New York Times column about the different ways we love in the contemporary world. This can be love in a marriage, sure, but also between a paternal doorman and a tenant, a couple on a second date or any other way we express or acquire the emotion, or lose it. Or almost lose it.
The fourth and best episode of the series, "Rallying to Keep the Game Alive," is about a marriage on the verge of collapse, a husband (John Slattery) and wife (Tina Fey) who aren't sure what they will have in common after their growing children leave the house. They eventually find their way back to each other, through admitting their failures, putting the past in the past and playing a lot of tennis.
The episode is instantly relatable for those who have been in long-term relationships that require care and maintenance, and who go through rough patches that seem to have no end. Its universality makes it even more surprising that the episode is based on a column written by "Rescue Me" actor Denis Leary's wife, Ann.
Slattery's "Dennis" is an actor of at least some fame and wealth (his fabulous New York apartment and a fan encounter make that clear), and his wife, Sarah, is often aggrieved by the lifestyle of partying and affirmation that being an actor has afforded him.
But their problems are deeper than fans coming up to him in restaurants or her being kept at arms' length from the fabulous parties he attends. They're about the resentment built up between them when they didn't notice, a frustration that they can't even discuss openly at marriage counseling sessions. It isn't until they give up on therapy and share a resigned meal that the real problems they confront come to the surface, so they can start addressing them. Eventually, the rhythms of tennis help their relationship rally, quite literally.
Over its eight episodes, "Love" uncynically embraces sentiment, a tone that's welcome in some episodes and distinctly mawkish in others (the final episode's attempt to tie them all together in a saccharine montage is fully on the side of cloying and annoying). "Rallying" finds a space for a small amount of skepticism about the sheer power of love without losing a hopeful mood. It also has a sardonic humor that's distinctly missing in other episodes.
The notion that no amount of money or fame can solve love's limits is reassuring. We all struggle, but some of us overcome and "stay in the game. "

Texto completo: Steven Soderbergh's latest film hits Netflix. And a new series based on a column in The New York Times debuts on Amazon.
What's Streaming
THE LAUNDROMAT (2019) Stream on Netflix. Private jets. White suits. Backyard pools sloshing around the bellies of manicured lawns. These are some of the many accouterments of wealth seen in this latest feature from Steven Soderbergh. Adapted from a Pulitzer Prize-winning book by Jake Bernstein, the film tells a collection of stories related to the Panama Papers. At its center are Antonio Banderas and Gary Oldman, who play seedy partners in a Panama City-based law firm that helps the very rich stay wealthy through many flavors of trickery. The pair's most prominent victim here is Ellen Martin, a Midwestern widow played by Meryl Streep who catches on to the firm's dishonesty when she tries to settle an insurance claim after her husband's death. Also in the cast: Sharon Stone, Jeffrey Wright and Matthias Schoenaerts. "The film's subject matter could hardly be more urgent," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. But, Scott wrote, the movie "conducts its business with brisk, breezy irreverence. It's a didactic comedy, an earnest lesson in political economy dressed up as a farce."
MODERN LOVE Stream on Amazon. A piece of insight from Anne Hathaway (or a character of hers, at least): "If you can find love in a supermarket early in the morning, you know you can trust it." That line is spoken by Hathaway's character in this new series, which is based on stories from the long-running column in The Times that collects personal essays about relationships. Hathaway stars opposite Gary Carr in an episode where a meet cute happens in the produce section of a Fairway Market. Cast members in other episodes include Tina Fey, Dev Patel, John Slattery, Andy Garcia, Catherine Keener and Andrew Scott.
TEEN SPIRIT (2019) Stream on Hulu; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Max Minghella, the English actor known for playing the two-faced Nick Blaine on "The Handmaid's Tale," made his directing debut with this music-infused drama. The film stars Elle Fanning as Violet, a British teenager who quickly goes from singing in a dingy bar to participating in an international competition that could make her a pop star. "Conflicts, naturally, arise (with Rebecca Hall briefly slapping the movie out of its fairy-tale daze as a music-industry vulture with a dubious contract offer)," Jeannette Catsoulis wrote in her review for The Times, "yet Minghella refuses to be distracted from his waiflike star or her internal ache." Catsoulis called the movie "both proudly clichéd and refreshingly different."
What's on TV
SID & JUDY (2019) 8:05 p.m. on Showtime. It has been five decades since the death of Judy Garland, who has been getting renewed attention this fall as the subject of the biopic "Judy." In that movie, Renée Zellweger plays Garland during the final period of her life. For a different kind of look at the singer's career, consider this documentary, which is peppered with voice-overs from Jennifer Jason Leigh (as Garland) and Jon Hamm (as Garland's third husband, Sid Luft), in addition to archival footage.

Texto completo: There’s no excuse not to see some dance this weekend. You might not be able to avoid it. Dance will be everywhere.
Tonight (Thursday, Oct. 16) and tomorrow at the Cedar , the dance duo Hijack (Arwen Wilder and Kristin Van Loon), with other local dancers, will premiere a new work by Mexico City-based Galia Eibenschutz , the 2019 McKnight International Choreographer. Eibenschutz integrates drawing into her performances, so the walls and floor of the Cedar will be covered with paper for drawing by dancers.
Bringing Eibenschutz here for a monthlong residency took “a visa application that weighed five pounds and a classically nail-biting wait from immigration offices,” according to the Cedar. Her piece will be performed to original live music on drums by New York-based Katelyn Farstad, who will open the show as her alter-ego Itch Princess. This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing. Thursday’s show will be followed by a public reception, Friday’s by a conversation with the artists. Doors at 7 p.m., show at 7:30. FMI and tickets ($15).
TU Dance continues to tour “Come Through” with Bon Iver. Commissioned by the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra’s Liquid Music series, the smash hit collaboration that premiered here in 2018 has upcoming dates in Brooklyn, Houston and New Orleans, among other cities. Friday-Sunday at the O’Shaughnessy , the esteemed dance company founded by former Alvin Ailey dancers Uri Sands and Toni Pierce-Sands will perform their 16th season fall concert. The program will feature two works Uri choreographed for other companies, including “Tracks,” set to the music of the O’Jays; the repertory favorite solo piece “Clear as Tear Water”; and a reprise of “Salve,” a dance about healing. FMI and tickets ($24-34).
The Cowles Center will host the 5th annual Twin Cities Tap Festival , a weekend of explosive rhythms and infectious joy that will start Thursday with a student showcase and continue Friday with a concert. The showcase will feature top local tap talent (try saying that five times fast) and youth ensembles including Keane Sense of Rhythm and Elite Tap Feet. 7:30 p.m. FMI and tickets ($15-20). The concert will shine a light on local and national tap artists Sarah Reich, Bril Barrett, Jeannie Hill and members of Dorrance Dance. 7:30 p.m. FMI and tickets ($28-34). Tip: Use promo code 5TAPS19 when ordering showcase and concert tickets, save 20%.
On Saturday , the festival will tap its way to Northrop for the return of Dorrance Dance , the award-winning New York City-based company that made its memorable Northrop debut in 2015. Performing to music by Jelly Roll Morton, Radiohead’s Thom Yorke and a live ensemble, the company will dance “Jungle Blues,” “Three to One” and “Myelination,” named for the change in nerve cells that allows impulses to move more quickly. All were choreographed by Michelle Dorrance, a 2015 MacArthur Fellow. “Myelination” will include improvisation by the dancers. Here’s a preview. 7:30 p.m. FMI and tickets ($21-50).
Are you free tomorrow morning (Friday, Oct. 17) ? Three women of Ragamala Dance – founder and co-artistic director Ranee Ramaswamy, co-artistic director Aparna Ramaswamy and choreographic associate Ashwini Ramaswamy – won’t be dancing, but they will be talking about their artistic process, their intergenerational creative partnership, and more at Paikka in St. Paul. Tickets are free. Coffee and breakfast will be available. 8:30-10 a.m. FMI. P.S. Ashwini will dance in November at the Lab.
The picks
Now at Open Book: Ten Thousand Things: “The Winter’s Tale.” TTT has a long history of presenting Shakespeare as human-scale stories, not sacred literature, and making Shakespearean language sound normal. In her second year as artistic director, Marcela Lorca carries on the tradition with “The Winter’s Tale,” featuring a stellar cast and music by Peter Vitale and J.D. Steele. After touring to prisons and community sites, the show has moved into Open Book (through Oct. 27), after which it will travel to North Garden Theater in St. Paul and the Sheldon Theater in Red Wing. FMI and tickets (prices vary). Closes in Red Wing on Nov. 17. P.S. Earlier this month, Lorca became the first Twin Cities-based director/choreographer to win the prestigious Fichandler Award from the Stage Directors and Choreographers Foundation. Joseph Haj, the Guthrie’s artistic director, also has a Fichandler; he won his in 2014, before coming to the Twin Cities.
Tonight (Thursday, Oct. 17) at the Minnesota Museum of American Art: Curator Tour of “History Is Not Here: Art and the Arab Imaginary.” This exhibit at the M features work by 17 Arab artists – paintings, photographs, video, installations, book art – that challenges stereotypes and opens eyes and minds. Walk in off the street and you might find it daunting. Walk through with Laura Werthem Joseph, the museum’s new curator of exhibitions, and you’ll get an inside perspective on the themes and artists. 6 p.m. Free, but RSVP requested. Also 2 p.m. on Nov. 17.
Tonight through Saturday: 9th Annual 10,000 Laughs Comedy Festival. If it’s comedy you want, you’re in the right place. For this year’s 10,000 Laughs, Mystic Lake has partnered with Acme Comedy Club to bring stand-up into venues across Minneapolis, from the 70-seat Comedy Corner Underground to the 400-seat Parkway. National headliners – people who have appeared on “The Daily Show,” “The Tonight Show,” “Conan,” “Colbert,” Comedy Central, Netfllix and more – will convene to make you laugh, along with unknowns who will try their darnedest. Headliners will include Aparna Nancherla, Josh Johnson, Doug Benson, Brian Posehn, Dan Cummins and Ryan O’Flanagan. Here’s the complete schedule. We love the idea of the “Funny 20,” which will take place at the Uptown VFW on Saturday at 4:30 p.m. Twenty comics will each deliver one joke, maximum length one minute. And “Don’t Tell,” a midnight Friday show of secret comedians at a secret Northeast Minneapolis location, with free drinks. FMI and tickets.
Friday morning through Sunday: Richard Egarr Plays Bach. One of the SPCO’s two new artistic partners, Egarr will debut in that role with an all-Baroque program of music by Bach and Telemann. Egarr, a harpsichordist, also serves as music director of the Academy of Ancient Music and has, ahem, made several recordings with them. Plus he has a large solo discography. He first performed with the SPCO in March 2017. 11 a.m. and 8 p.m. Friday at the Ordway Concert Hall, 8 p.m. Saturday at St. Paul’s United Church of Christ, and 3 p.m. Sunday at St. Andrew’s Lutheran Church in Mahtomedi. FMI and tickets ($11-50; children and students free).
Friday and Saturday: Minnesota Orchestra. Two nights, two concerts, both led by Osmo Vänskä, each featuring northside artists and performers (including North Community High School’s high-voltage dance troupe) and Aaron Dworkin’s “The American Rhapsody” as its centerpiece. Friday’s concert is at North Community High School , Saturday’s at Orchestra Hall. Dworkin’s new work combines spoken word with composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor’s “Symphonic Variations on an African Air.” Both concerts are at 7 p.m. FMI and tickets f0r Friday and Saturday (both choose-your-price starting at $5).
Sunday at LynLake Brewery: “Atlas Obscura” Trivia with Dylan Thuras and Magers & Quinn. Among our favorite nonpolitical e-newsletters (besides New York Times Cooking) comes from Atlas Obscura, with a daily dose of “the world’s hidden wonders.” Just the other day, we learned something about China’s chopstick industry. It can’t hurt, right? Originally founded as a media company, Atlas Obscura has evolved into a travel and experiences company that recently partnered with Airbnb. But it still publishes a best-selling book by the same name (the second edition just came out), and co-author Dylan Thuras will be here to lead us through a night of travel and location-themed trivia. Event starts at 6 p.m., trivia at 7. Buy a copy of the book and get $1 off a beer.

Texto completo: * Correction appended.
Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas, will resign as secretary of energy later this year, President Donald Trump said during a visit to Texas on Thursday.
Perry drew scrutiny after being entangled in the president's efforts to push Ukraine officials to investigate the son of a political rival.
Perry's resignation was anticipated for several weeks, prior to news coming out about his involvement in the Ukraine scandal, in which Trump made efforts to convince the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate a company that formerly worked with Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, according to The New York Times.
At Louis Vuitton's Rochambeau Ranch in Johnson County on Thursday afternoon, Trump told reporters Perry will leave at the end of the year and that he had been aware for months that Perry planned to resign. Trump added that he already has a replacement for Perry and will be announcing that name "very shortly."
"Rick has done a fantastic job. But it was time," Trump said, according to White House pool reports. "He told me at the end of the year he’d like to go, and he’s got some ideas about doing something else. He’s a terrific guy."
Later Thursday, the president called Perry "very successful" during a campaign rally in Dallas.
"He spent three years with us and I want to thank you, Rick," Trump said.
Trump denied that the replacement would be Gov. Greg Abbott or Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy.
Calling Perry a good friend, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz said in a statement Thursday that he wished his fellow Republican well "as he returns to private life" after a long public career.
“He went from being Texas’ longest-serving governor to heading the Department of Energy, where he was a leading advocate for U.S. energy, including liquefied natural gas," Cruz said. "Under his leadership, U.S. oil and gas production has soared — with much of that new production coming from Texas — and the United States has become a net exporter of natural gas, creating good-paying jobs, providing cleaner and more affordable energy, and boosting America’s energy independence."
Emma Platoff contributed reporting.
Correction: A previous version of this misattributed a quote said by Sen. Ted Cruz. It also gave the incorrect name for the location where Trump told reporters that Perry will leave at the end of the year. Trump said that in Johnson County.

Recibe una sentencia de 15 años tras declararse culpable de posesión de cocaína…era leche en polvo

Texto completo: Un hombre sin hogar atravesaba un vecindario industrial en el centro de Oklahoma City el 12 de agosto cuando la policía lo vio. Pasaba de las 10 p.m. y los oficiales observaron que el desaliñado hombre sin camisa y una mochila al hombro no tenía luces traseras en su bicicleta.
Cuando intentaron detenerlo, Cody Gregg aceleró más para luego tirar la bicicleta unas cuadras adelante e intentar huir a pie. Los policías lo alcanzaron e inspeccionaron su mochila. Dentro encontraron un sospechoso polvo blanco en una lata de café, según documentos judiciales consultados por el diario The Oklahoman.
“Dentro del bolso había una gran cantidad de substancia blanca en polvo que basado en mi experiencia y mi entrenamiento creí que se trataba de cocaína”, dijo el oficial que hizo la revisión, según el diario citado. “Más tarde, el polvo blanco dentro del bolso dio resultado positivo para cocaína y era un paquete que pesaba en total 45.91 gramos de cocaína”, añadió.
Gregg fue acusado de posesión de cocaína con intención de distribución y fue enviado a la cárcel del condado de Oklahoma mientras aguardaba su juicio. Él se declaró inocente. Pero la semana pasada, tras dos meses, su arresto fue en agosto, se cansó de esperar y se declaró culpable. Fue sentenciado a 15 años en prisión.
La cárcel del condado de Oklahoma ha estado plagada de problemas durante años, como goteras, moho, sobrepoblación y una tasa de suicidios y muertes mayor a la del promedio nacional, según The Oklahoman.
El jueves pasado, sólo dos días después de recibir su prolongada sentencia, resultados de laboratorio demostraron que el polvo blanco no era cocaína, sino leche en polvo. Gregg le dijo al juez que había conseguido la leche de un dispensario de alimentos, según el diario citado.
Al día siguiente, Gregg solicitó a la corte que le permitieran retirar su declaración de culpabilidad, a la luz de la nueva evidencia. El juez de distrito Timothy R. Henderson concedió su petición y además desechó los cargos en su contra.
Gregg estaba bajo libertad condicional al momento de su arresto. Según documentos de la corte consultados por el diario The Washington Post, había sido arrestado por cargos relacionados con narcóticos al menos unas tres veces desde 2014.
El viernes salió en libertad.
El Washington Post reporta que no es la primera vez que un resultado de laboratorio equivocado termina en la convicción de una persona inocente. Las pruebas químicas que utilizan las policías alrededor de todo el país para determinar si una substancia es ilícita fallan frecuentemente.
En 2016, una investigación del diario The New York Times y la organización de periodistas sin fines de lucro ProPublica, revelaron que hay miles de personas en la cárcel por pruebas que tienen un amplio margen de error.
Una lista de los artículos que han dado un falso positivo a cocaína, recogida por el Washington Post, incluyó cosas como galletas de chocolate, el glaseado de una dona Krispy Cream y tabletas de menta. Algunos estudios citados por este diario indican que un quinto o hasta un tercio de las pruebas están erradas. Sin embargo, las policías las siguen utilizando como una herramienta cotidiana.
La historia de Gregg ilustra otro problema: muchas personas prefieren declararse culpables para no tener que esperar meses o incluso años para tener un juicio. Más de la mitad de las personas acusadas de delitos de drogas con base en una prueba de laboratorio errada se declararon culpables a la primera oportunidad, según el estudio del New York Times y ProPublica.

Texto completo: Three thousand Iowans showed up in downtown Iowa City on Friday, Oct. 4, and cheered wildly as 16-year-old Greta Thunberg, of Sweden, took to the stage. As a member of 100Grannies for a Livable Future, who have been supporting the local School Climate Strikers for months, I was thrilled to share the stage with Greta and the youth that have ignited the school board and city hall. Both have agreed to increase their commitments in order to meet the IPCC goals.
Thank you to Mayor Throgmorton, Senator Joe Bolkom, and other local leaders who showed up to speak. Friday's rally was a huge celebration for the children who are taking the lead because, as Greta pointed out, "Somebody has to be the adults in the room."
A powerful "Town-Gown" challenge was issued to President Harreld of the University of Iowa to "stop making excuses" and close the coal plant in the center of town that is still spewing carbon emissions without converting to long-term use of natural gas. It is time– because we are about out of time– to do the impossible.
These kids know only too well what they are facing: A recent UN report states that over one million living species face extinction in the near future.
The human species cannot be far behind. (www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2019/05/nature-decline-unprecedented-report/)
It's clear we cannot count on our government to work with the nations of the world in order to protect and preserve this planet. Congress is in deadlock and the executive branch is doing everything in its power (and reaching far beyond the constitutional limits of that power) to thwart any progress toward solving this global existential crisis. It is, in fact, denying the science and pushing policies that exacerbate it.
Case in point, the New York Times recently reported that 85 environmental
Rules are on the way out under Mr. Trump. (www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/climate/trump-environment-rollbacks.html)
Our government, which is charged with the protection and wellbeing of its citizens, is instead protecting and benefiting the fossil fuel corporations.
Our Nero is fiddling and feeding the flames, while we literally watch our planet burn.
Our hope lies with the youth and with preserving our democratic right to participate in non-violent civil disobedience that made it possible to achieve women's suffrage, advance civil rights, end the war in Vietnam, and create important regulations for environmental protections.
Following this time-honored path on June 11, the "Climate Defenders Five" were arrested while carrying a banner about the urgency of the climate crisis outside a fundraiser for President Trump in West Des Moines. I vehemently maintain that we were totally justified, under Iowa law, to bring our message to this gathering. We face trial on Oct. 10.
This failure of two branches of our government to protect the common good and preserve our public trust is why I now look to the courts, on every level, to immediately address this crisis with the necessary courage and precedent-setting decisions.
Our Iowa Constitution states: "All political power is inherent in the people. Government is instituted for the protection, security, and benefit of the people, and they have the right, at all times, to alter or reform the same, whenever the public good may require it."
We require it now!

Texto completo: Google and other Big Tech companies are rushing to establish a new protocol, called DNS over HTTPS ("DoH"), that could open the internet floodgates to child pornography, drugs, malware and other illegal activity and enable perpetrators to hide behind new privacy shields.
As a retired child safety and cybercrimes police detective, I have dedicated my career to helping children by pursuing, apprehending and prosecuting child predators. I am urging Google and the other proponents of this plan to slow down, think this through and respond to questions from law enforcement and federal authorities about the dangers of this plan.
Parents do not need dangerous new gateways through which their children can be exposed to predators, pornography, cyberbullies, school violence and drug dealers.
Already, as a recent New York Times investigation found, tech companies have reported 45 million online photos and videos of children being sexually abused this year — more than double what they found the previous year. And the number keeps growing. Now is not the time to make it even easier to spread this filth and hide behind Google’s shield.
Child-safety experts at the internet Watch Foundation (IWF) are warning the so-called privacy changes could have a "catastrophic impact" by exposing child victims to some of the worst practices on the internet.
As the IWF notes, Google’s plan would mean that criminals could soon have countless new ways to bypass safeguards that child safety groups, cybersecurity experts, internet service providers and government agencies have developed. These changes could allow child predators to directly interact with children and then disappear, leaving law enforcement no means to find the offenders.
Antitrust investigators with the House Judiciary Committee have also sent a letter to Google asking the company to address serious concerns about the plan.
Specifically, the plan causing so much concern involves the internet Domain Name System (DNS), which makes the web work by connecting websites to unique addresses on the internet. Thanks to the DNS, which is often called "the phone book of the internet," a user can type in a website name and end up exactly where they want to go.
But the change could hide user requests, strengthen encryption, enable criminals to bypass essential filters like parental controls and make abusive material freely accessible. This would come at the same time that online child-abuse groups are sharing images of ever younger children and more extreme forms of abuse. The groups use encrypted technologies to teach pedophiles how to carry out the crimes and how to record and share images of the abuse worldwide. We cannot afford to give them new tools for hiding out.
Three specific questions need to be addressed: How will law enforcement be able to track online predators who collaborate through private email services and meet at a website to sexually exploit our children?
Will law enforcement still be able to track domestic terrorists such as school shooters who collaborate on certain websites they visit to obtain their information?
With millions of schools using Google Chromebooks, will this new protocol enable bypassing school filters such as Go Guardian and Securely that help keep our children safe?
In the pursuit of greater privacy, we must not jeopardize safety. We must fully evaluate the dangerous impact these changes could introduce. We must ensure that tech companies are implementing well-informed, responsible updates that strengthen, not diminish our children’s interaction with the online world.
Detective Richard Wistocki (Ret.) was a law enforcement officer for 30 years, including over two decades as an internet crimes investigator with the Naperville Police Department. As a cybercrimes detective and child safety proponent, he educates law enforcement, parents and students on responsible digital activity.

Texto completo: Coming soon to Broadway: a new musical, adapted from an Oscar-winning film, about a struggling actor who masquerades as a woman to get what he wants.
No, not that one.
This season, it's "Mrs. Doubtfire," based on the 1993 comedy starring Robin Williams, about an estranged husband posing as a Scottish nanny to spend time with his kids. The show will begin previews at the Stephen Sondheim Theater in March 2020 for an April 5 opening, after an out-of-town run in Seattle later this year.
The producer, Kevin McCollum, is no stranger to bringing films to the stage. He signed a deal in 2013 with 20th Century Fox, the studio behind "Mrs. Doubtfire," to develop nine to a dozen new musicals based on the company's films. "The Devil Wears Prada" and several others are on his docket. (While Disney purchased 20th Century Fox earlier this year and holds the rights to the film, the company's theatrical branch is not a producer, a spokesperson for the musical said.) McCollum is also working on "The Notebook," from Warner Bros.
But film-inspired musicals are still tricky on Broadway, where the appeal of recognizable stories is at odds with audience members' lofty expectations for adaptations that live up to the originals. "Moulin Rouge! The Musical," "Beetlejuice" and "Mean Girls" -- not to mention Disney's catalog -- are still playing to packed houses this season, but other recent adaptations, like "Pretty Woman" and "Groundhog Day," have found less success.
And then, of course, there's "Tootsie," which opened to good reviews but has seen only average ticket sales.
"Mrs. Doubtfire" will walk the same tightrope. The family-focused plot is ideal for a Broadway stint, McCollum told The New York Times in 2013, but there is a risk to playing such a memorable title role in the shadow of someone like Williams.
Stepping into Euphegenia Doubtfire's pumps this time around is Rob McClure, whose previous Broadway appearances include "Beetlejuice" and "Something Rotten!" The creative team behind "Something Rotten!" is at work here as well: Karey Kirkpatrick and John O'Farrell wrote the book, and Wayne Kirkpatrick and Karey Kirkpatrick wrote the score. The director will be Jerry Zaks, whose most recent project was the "Hello, Dolly!" revival.
Alan Menken said in a 2015 interview that he, David Zippel and Harvey Fierstein -- all Disney musical veterans -- were working on writing "Mrs. Doubtfire." Menken later said that the show was on "creative hiatus," citing other projects. A spokesperson for the musical said there had been an earlier but unannounced "exploration of other creatives," but that the Kirkpatricks and O'Farrell had been working on the show since 2016.
"Mrs. Doubtfire" will follow the clown-filled holiday offering "Slava's Snowshow" at the Sondheim after "Beautiful," the Carole King musical, closes at the end of this month.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: In the early 1970s, a police officer named Frank Serpico became New York City's best-known whistle-blower by speaking up against widespread corruption in the Police Department.
A best-selling book and his portrayal by Al Pacino in the 1973 film "Serpico" helped make his name synonymous with facing down wrongdoing.
For decades, Mr. Serpico, 83, has lived in a secluded cabin in the woods north of the city. But when whistle-blowers make the news, he inevitably gets requests for interviews.
So Mr. Serpico chuckled over the phone recently when asked about the whistle-blower who has created a political firestorm by coming forward on White House activity regarding a call to the president of Ukraine.
The scenario in Washington is "so parallel to my situation," he said, adding that it did not surprise him to see disparagement of the whistle-blower by President Trump and some other Republicans.
"This is what happens," he said. "They want to discredit what you are saying, so they try to bring you down and turn you into a criminal. They tried to undermine my credibility, and now the president is doing the same thing."
Mr. Serpico, who was profiled in a 2017 documentary and in another film this year, is a Brooklyn native who joined the Police Department in 1959 and grew increasingly disillusioned by the number of officers "on the pad," or accepting bribes and payoffs from criminals, bookies and the like.
"It wasn't about just taking a freebie," he said. "It was cops doing the same thing that they were locking people up for."
He steadfastly refused to take such money, he said, and in 1967 began complaining to high-ranking officials at Police Headquarters and City Hall.
They took little action, and he became a pariah in the department, he said. He considered quitting and simply walking away from the issue, a familiar decision for many whistle-blowers he has spoken to.
"At some point, you have to decide, 'If I go up against the system, I better be ready to put my life on the line,"' said Mr. Serpico, who wound up taking his story to a reporter at The New York Times, David Burnham.
Mr. Burnham wrote a front-page article that helped prompt the Knapp Commission hearings in 1971 on police corruption, which, with Mr. Serpico's testimony, helped expose pervasive wrongdoing and sparked the biggest shake-up in the department's history.
Speaking up had its price. Mr. Serpico's police career ended in 1971 after he was shot in the face during a drug raid. He has long maintained that he got no backup from his colleagues because of his pariah status.
The shooting left him with permanent injuries, and he is still despised by some of his old colleagues as a snitch.
"To them, I'm no whistle-blower," he said. "They still consider me a traitor."
The whistle-blower label is not easily shaken, he said. Most people he meets still refer to his actions or thank him for his decision to speak out against police corruption.
"Every time there's another whistle-blower in the news, people want to ask me about it," he said.
If asked about politics, Mr. Serpico levels the criticism he once reserved for police corruption at the political division roiling the country.
"Why can't the two parties come together for the good of the country?" he said. "All they care about is the good of themselves. If we can't trust our authorities and we can't stand up for justice, where are we as a country, as a people?"

Texto completo: "Catch and Kill" was pulled from two of Australia's biggest online book retailers amid legal threats from the former National Enquirer editor who features prominently in the book.
SYDNEY, Australia -- Two of Australia's biggest online booksellers have suspended sales of Ronan Farrow's new book after one of the men who is prominent in it threatened legal action.
The book, "Catch and Kill," which details Farrow's investigation of the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, was unavailable on Booktopia, a major Australian online book retailer, and through Amazon in Australia as of Wednesday, a day after the book's publication.
Lawyers for Dylan Howard, an executive with American Media, Inc., sent letters to Australian booksellers last month warning of "false and defamatory allegations" potentially contained within the book.
"We note that if the book is distributed by you in Australia and our client is correct as to the defamatory imputations contained within the book, we are instructed to initiate immediate defamation proceedings against the Publisher, and our client will have no alternative but to join you as a party to those proceedings as a distributor," the letter warned. The lawyers did not respond to a request for comment.
Howard, who is Australian and the former editor of The National Enquirer, features prominently in "Catch and Kill." The book outlines his assistance to Weinstein, including an instance where he forwarded the producer "dirt" on the actor Rose McGowan after she tweeted about "my rapist."
The Daily Beast, which earlier reported Howard's threat, also wrote that Howard was taking similar legal action in Britain, Ireland and the United States, though the book was available for sale in those countries.
In a tweet on Tuesday, Farrow expressed his disappointment after an Australian reader noted her pre-ordered copy had "disappeared" from Amazon's Kindle store, saying the book retailers had "caved and banned it due to frivolous legal threats."
His publisher, Little, Brown, said in a statement that the book "has been meticulously reported, researched, and fact-checked, and we're proud to bring Ronan Farrow's important reporting to the public. That one tabloid editor may seek to suppress women's stories by threatening booksellers only amplifies the powerful message of Mr. Farrow's book."
Tony Nash, the chief executive of Booktopia, said there was no intention to restore the book to the website "unless there is clear direction that there will be no legal action."
Keeping the book on the site with the specter of a potential defamation suit would be an "unnecessary nuisance," he said, adding that this was not the first time Booktopia had complied with threats.
Amazon Australia declined to comment.
The dispute comes at a time when Australia is increasingly being called the defamation capital of the world because of its strict and complex laws that favor complainants.
"Australia is really a plaintiff playground," said Matthew Lewis, a Sydney-based lawyer specializing in media law. "All it takes is a general complaint to have a chilling effect on free speech on important matters."
"Ultimately, it's a question of risk," Lewis added. "If there's a potential risk of defamation, then it is a business decision ultimately of whether or not they want to promote that book, or alternatively err on the side of caution."
Mark Rubbo, the managing director of Readings, an independent book retailer in Melbourne, confirmed that he also received a letter of notice from Howard's lawyers but has continued to sell the book in his stores and online, saying he "acted on the advice on the publisher."
"It smacks a little of censorship, which I hate," he said.
Multinational attempts to suppress book sales are not unprecedented. In 2018, threatening letters were sent to booksellers around the world, including in Australia and the United Kingdom, in an attempt to quash sales of "Billion Dollar Whale," an exposé by two Wall Street Journal reporters about the Malaysian financier Jho Low, who prosecutors say helped steal billions of dollars from a government investment fund.

La crisis militar desatada por Trump en Siria deja 50 bombas atómicas en manos de Turquía

Texto completo: El presidente turco, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan , se ha negado a frenar su ofensiva militar en el norte de Siria pese a la presión de Estados Unidos y otros miembros de la Alianza Atlántica (NATO, en inglés).
El vicepresidente, Mike Pence, viaja este miércoles a Turquía para reunirse con Erdogan, mientras el presidente, Donald Trump, aseguraba desde la Casa Blanca que la ofensiva militar “no es entre Turquía y Estados Unidos”. Sin embargo, el conflicto se inició a consecuencia de una decisión suya, y esta crisis tiene como rehenes a 50 bombas nucleares estadounidenses.
Un reporte periodístico había indicado que Erdogan no se reuniría en persona con la delegación diplomática encabezada por Pence: “No voy a hablar con ellos. Van a hablar con sus homólogos. Cuando Trump venga, hablaré”.
Sin embargo, fuentes oficiales citadas por la prensa local precisaron horas después que el presidente turco sí recibiría a Pence, que viaja junto al secretario de Estado, Mike Pompeo, para convencerle de que frene su ofensiva militar.
El ataque turco es consecuencia directa de la decisión anunciada el 6 de octubre por Trump de retirar las tropas estadounidenses de Siria, un país en guerra civil desde 2011.
Hasta entonces, Estados Unidos había prestado apoyo aéreo a los kurdos en su batalla contra el dictador Bashar Al-Assad, a su vez ayudado por Rusia. La retirada estadounidense permitió a los turcos atacar a los kurdos, un pueblo sin estado que reclama territorios en Turquía y es considerado como terrorista por este país. Los kurdos se aliaron entonces con Al-Assad, Rusia ocupó el puesto estratégico que antes tenía Estados Unidos, y, en los combates, decenas de presos del Ejército Islámico (ISIS), enemigo de todos, quedaron en libertad.
Tras el rechazo internacional provocado por la decisión de Trump, y con la fuerte presión del Congreso en su contra incluso por parte de los republicanos, el presidente anunció un fuerte castigo económico contra Turquía por su ofensiva militar. Sin embargo, este miércoles ha vuelto a insistir en que la confrontación “no es entre Turquía y Estados Unidos”.
Turquía, miembro de la Alianza Atlántica, tiene en su territorio bases militares estadounidenses con armas atómicas, según ha informado el diario The New York Times.
En concreto, 50 bombas termonucleares, almacenadas en la instalación de las Fuerzas Aéreas en Incirlik, a 100 millas de la frontera con Siria.
Preguntado hoy al respecto, Trump ha expresado hoy su “confianza”, sin aclarar en qué, añadiendo que la base aérea es “poderosa”, y Turquía es miembro de la Alianza Atlántica: “Se supone que tenemos que llevarnos bien con ellos, qué quiere la gente, que les disparemos, sería la primera vez”.
Un oficial estadounidense de alto rango ha dicho al citado diario que Erdogan básicamente tiene las armas como “rehenes” . Sacarlas por vía aérea marcaría el final de la alianza de facto entre Turquía y Estados Unidos, pero dejarlas allí sería perpetuar una vulnerabilidad nuclear que debió desaparecer hace años.
La meta de Pence es convencer a Erdogan de un cese al fuego inmediato, pero también reiterará que las sanciones impuestas este lunes en contra de Turquía se mantendrán hasta que se llegue a un acuerdo para evitar el conflicto en la región, ha informado la cadena NBC News.
Erdogan ha afirmado que nadie podrá detener la ofensiva turca en Siria y que esta solo llegará a su fin una vez su Gobierno establezca una “zona segura” que vaya desde Manbij, en territorio sirio, hasta la frontera con Irak.
“Para la solución más rápida al problema en Siria, le proponemos a todos los terroristas que dejen sus armas y equipos , destruyan las trampas que prepararon y salgan de la zona segura esta noche”, le dijo a los periodistas.
Las declaraciones se dan luego de que el ejército de Al-Assad llegará a zonas del norte del país donde previamente operaba Estados Unidos.
Las tropas sirias habían sido expulsadas del norte del país con la ayuda de los milicianos kurdos, que además habían batallado contra el grupo terrorista ISIS, arrinconado en esa área tras ser derrotado por Estados Unidos en Irak.

Will being ignored become new normal for Ohio?

Texto completo: In most of Ohio, most elections bring one party dominance driven primarily by geography. Holding battleground status in the presidential campaigns has been a reminder to us as citizens that we really do matter and hold the ultimate responsibility for leadership. That is normalcy in Ohio. If the new normal allows candidates to ignore us, we will ignore them as both our issues and our support becomes unimportant to the outcome.
The Democrats' presidential debate that CNN and the New York Times are holding in suburban Columbus has sparked a pre-debate debate: Does Ohio still matter? As always in Ohio politics, follow the money and you will find the answer. The political advertising professionals who direct dollars to targeted geography driven by the Electoral College say Ohio voters no longer hold the key to the White House.
Democrats have selected Westerville, a solid Republican suburb turned into a Democratic stronghold by the choice between Donald Trump and Hilary Clinton, as the debate location and the key to their competitive fortunes in Ohio. It's quite a change from 2016 when Sandusky County was singled out as the best representation of Ohio and when Ottawa County was watched for the best track record of siding with the winner. But it doesn't really matter if Ohio is bypassed during the campaign as insignificant to the outcome.
What a comedown that would be from the 1920 presidential election. We Buckeyes were so important 99 years ago that both parties nominated an Ohio officeholder and Senator Warren G. Harding defeated Governor James M. Cox. Like present days, 1920 was a turbulent time, following the "war to end all wars," enactment of income taxes, industrial regulation, labor strife and foreign policy disputes over entry into the United Nations forerunner, the League of Nations. Cox supported the massive change engineered by the Wilson administration while Harding promised a "return to normalcy," and won in a landslide.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, soon to turn 77, wants a rocking chair rather than a boat rocking reform, channeling Harding with a return to normalcy message. The problem with that idea is the widespread understanding that corruption has been normalized in Washington.
Harding died in office, and was held in high regard by his country. Within months the Teapot Dome scandal revealed close associates leasing oil-rich government ground without bids to buddies made instantly rich. Harding's sexual scandals in the White House were also revealed and his reputation plummeted.
The Harding comparison goes beyond message, right to vulnerability for Biden. Donald Trump isn't waiting on Biden to win the nomination to go on the attack. Biden's son Hunter turned proximity to power into huge cash deals with a Ukrainian oil company and a state-owned Chinese bank. Casual corruption is normal in Washington because it's not illegal. If Biden is the nominee, Democrats will say the Trump business interests are also cashing in on political power. Biden is betting routine corruption cancels out any advantage, leaving chaos as the reason to deny Donald Trump four more years.
As always, the outcome in Ohio will come down to how voters feel about the economy. The Democrats dominate the cities in Ohio and the counties in which they reside. Republicans are just as strong in the small towns and rural counties, while a shift to the GOP presidential candidates in manufacturing centers can only be offset by the shift to Democrats in the service-industry-dominated suburbs. Because strong feelings drive high turnout, the economy normally tells us where fear or anger will bring out voters.
In most of Ohio, most elections bring one party dominance driven primarily by geography. Holding battleground status in the presidential campaigns has been a reminder to us as citizens that we really do matter and hold the ultimate responsibility for leadership. That is normalcy in Ohio.
If the new normal allows candidates to ignore us, we will ignore them as both our issues and our support becomes unimportant to the outcome. We're living with that in our state and local elections so we'll survive, but we can't thrive without competition between two good choices.
John Damschroder, a Fremont native who worked in Gov. George Voinovich's administration, writes about business and economic development in Ohio.

Texto completo: In an interview with ABC News, Hunter Biden said his involvement with a Ukraine company while his father was vice president was "poor judgment" but firmly maintained that he did nothing wrong.
"I gave a hook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father. That's where I made the mistake," Hunter Biden told ABC News in an interview that aired Tuesday. "So I take full responsibility for that. Did I do anything improper? No, not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever."
Hunter Biden told ABC News that he never spoke to his father about his business dealings when Joe Biden was vice president. He also admitted in the interview that he was not sure he would have been on the board of Burisma Holdings, a natural gas company, if he wasn't Joe Biden's son.
But he maintains that he was qualified for the job because he had previously served on various boards.
"I don't think that there's a lot of things that would have happened in my life if my last name wasn't Biden," the 49-year-old said. "Because my dad was vice president of the United States. There's literally nothing, as a young man or as a full-grown adult that my father in some way hasn't had influence over."
In 2014, Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma. During his tenure, Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin investigated the company.
The New York Times reported in May that Joe Biden, while in office in 2016, threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless Ukraine reduced its corruption. Part of that demand called for removing the country's top prosecutor, Shokin, who was investigating the oligarch behind an energy company where Hunter Biden served on the board.
Shokin was accused by U.S. officials of ignoring corruption in his own office. The Ukrainian Parliament eventually voted him out. The country's current prosecutor maintains that there is no evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter.
In July, President Donald Trump called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, asking him to investigate Joe Biden. It led to the House of Representatives starting an impeachment inquiry.
When a transcript of the Trump's call was released, Hunter told ABC News that he was "shocked." He said that he immediately called his father — who first asked about Hunter's daughter Maisey.
"For real. And that's not a joke," Hunter said to ABC News. "I mean, and then discussion was literally like, 'Oh my gosh. But other than that, really, I want to make it clear, it's not like anybody has to have any discussion beyond that."
Hunter Biden also spoke about his sobriety and his issues with substance abuse. He said that his father doesn't have to defend him and that he "loves me unequivocally."
The presidential candidate's son said he doesn't worry about being a target of Trump.
"Being the subject of Donald Trump's ire is a feather in my cap," he said. "It's not something that I go to bed nervous about at night at all. The reason I'm able to do that is because I am absolutely enveloped in love of my family."

Housing, human dignity and a ‘state of emergency’

Texto completo: The push by Los Angeles officials to get Governor Newsom to declare a State of Emergency over homelessness is like a warning light flashing.
It draws our attention to a massive problem that people closed their eyes to for too long. But like any flashing light, the “State of Emergency” idea only helps us see part of the problem but not the whole—and ultimately it would deepen the quagmire and probably result in bigger and worse emergencies later.
Where the idea points in the right direction is easy to see: proponents of the State of Emergency rightly say it would streamline red tape on construction, reduce and shorten building approval processes, and block the frivolous use of environmental review to delay housing construction. That’s needed.
But let’s face it, here’s what’s really happening: First California passes laws that generate the crisis, then we declare a state of emergency to bypass those laws. But as a State of Emergency exemption, it’s an ad-hoc fix. It doesn’t address the systemic problem with the laws it sidesteps, and in fact it politicizes the whole situation further by allowing sensible construction only if political support for a formal Emergency can be cultivated.
But it gets worse. Some of the people who favor a State of Emergency also favor a so-called “legal right to shelter” which would create a basis to sue governments if they don’t directly provide housing to the poorest citizens. This would permanently turn the homeless into wards of the state and enrich those who would litigate on their behalf.
The homeless are indeed “victims of the system,” but not the system that most people think of. They are not victims of a free market in housing, because California has built a regulatory system that killed a free market in housing at all but the top price levels. Middle-income Californians are squeezed by this, too, but the most vulnerable Californians are pushed out on to the streets. The bottom rungs of the housing market ladder—where economically marginal citizens could once afford a place to live—have effectively been removed by bad public policy.
Let me give examples from a study soon to be published by the Independent Institute.
Los Angeles currently bans any housing other than detached single-family homes on about 75 percent of its residential land. Whereas in 1960 Los Angeles was zoned for up to 10 million people, by 1990 the city “had downzoned to a capacity of about 3.9 million, a number that is only slightly higher today,” according to the New York Times.
Then there are so-called “prevailing wage” (read: union scale) laws. Prevailing-wage mandates increased average California construction costs for affordable housing projects by between 10 percent and 25 percent, according to a May 2017 report from the California Center for Jobs and the Economy. In areas such as Los Angeles, PLAs could hike market-rate housing prices by as much as 46 percent. Then there are the endless faux-environmental lawsuits against residential construction, which are invited and inadvertently enabled by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). And the list of anti-housing obstacles goes on.
What the homeless really need is a residential construction market that operates by normal rules that induce entrepreneurs to build housing all the way up and down the price spectrum—not just at the top where they can afford to overcome the regulatory and NIMBY hurdles. Don’t give the homeless a “right to shelter” by government; instead, give property owners a “right to build residential housing” on land they own. No, this would not eliminate restrictions on residential building, but it would raise a much higher bar by which to justify them. A ballot initiative amending the California Constitution would be the way to achieve this potent reform.
Less dramatic reforms would make a difference, too.
Allow builders to give homeowners’ associations incentives to accept new construction, so as to counterbalance the disincentives that lead to NIMBYism. Stop suppressing housing through rent controls and so-called “affordable housing” mandates; these are the functional equivalent of taxes on housing development. What you tax you get less of. Another obvious change would be to put an end to the favoritism shown to unions through “prevailing wage” rules that swell construction costs. And why not abolish or at least vastly modify CEQA?
The people who care the most about the homeless are those who want to reintroduce a real housing market—and incentivize nongovernmental programs that treat people like people rather than like dependent clients.
How can we expect the homeless to rebuild their lives when government programs warehouse them like surplus merchandise, and when we kick the bottom rungs out of the housing market ladder so that even if they start getting themselves together, they can’t find a room or apartment they can afford to rent?

Jailing opioid executives is a sickening idea

Texto completo: It is bad enough that the Democratic presidential candidates want to make pharmaceutical companies pay billions of dollars in punishment for the opioid epidemic. It is far worse, both tyrannical and against the spirit of the Constitution, to say the company executives should be criminally tried and imprisoned.
It is the Democratic candidates, not the executives, who are sick.
I’ve explained at length in a prior column why it is absurd to blame the drug manufacturers for the choices of doctors, pharmacists, patients, and black-market dealers and buyers. For all those arguments, please do read it. Pharma executives are not the ones misprescribing or misusing their legally produced drugs.
But to suggest not just that the companies pay damages, but that they should be jailed, is frightening.
Remember, as noted above, these drugs were and are being manufactured legally. They have been approved by the federal government. They have been approved by doctors. And, used correctly, they provide blessed relief to tens, maybe hundreds, of millions of Americans. Serious surgeries of all sorts are bearable because of opioids. Recovery from surgeries is quickened because of these drugs. Cancers and nonsurgically repaired injuries can be excruciating without these medicines.
And, again, these drugs are legally produced. How in tarnation is it right to penalize an executive for making a legal medicine that makes life better for tens of millions, just because others misuse those medicines? Furthermore, in spirit and at least arguably in law as well, how is it not a constitutional violation to criminalize something ex post facto? If it is not criminal to produce and advertise a legal product now, how can the government rightly imprison somebody for having done so?
This proposal, advocated most prominently in the debate by Kamala Harris, is deeply un-American and manifestly unjust. These candidates are addicted to corporation-bashing platitudes, and they need an intervention.

Texto completo: Whatever you think of Elizabeth Warren's technology regulation plan (and I think it is idiotic in moral and economic terms), at least she doesn't share Kamala Harris' absolute focus on purging President Trump from Twitter.
In a rather stunning couple of minutes at the Democratic presidential primary debate in Ohio on Tuesday, Harris upheld her plan to see Trump removed from Twitter as some kind of mantle of true leadership; as if the fate of the country will rise or fall on whether Trump can fire off his usually inane messages.
It's a simple point but one that obviously bears observing: Any candidate who thinks this is a serious issue with which to use their limited speaking time on a debate stage is not serious candidate. The country has too many issues of utmost importance facing it. More than that, however, Harris is obviously aware that the complex issues of content creation and online distribution reach many billions of times further than one Twitter account.
The next president, whether Trump or someone else, will have many challenges to face.
@realDonaldTrump isn't one of them.

Texto completo: Former Vice President Joe Biden has already acknowledged he had reservations about his son's seedy international business deals, and yet at the Democratic presidential primary debate on Tuesday, he felt fully confident pretending he never did that.
CNN's Anderson Cooper, who helped moderate the debate, gave a helpful assist to Biden by asserting — without evidence! — that Hunter Biden had never done anything afoul while working with a Ukrainian gas company as his dad engaged with the country on policy matters.
Biden said that he did nothing wrong and his son did nothing wrong and that the real problem, of course, was President Trump.
Except his own son has already acknowledged that, at the very least, it was "poor judgment" to take a job that paid him tens of thousands of dollars each month while his dad was making policy decisions with the government of the country that was investigating that very company.
Joe Biden himself has admitted that he knew there was something concerning about what his son was doing. “He did say at one point that it came out that he was on the board [of Ukrainian gas company Burisma],” Biden recalled in a recent radio interview, “I said, ‘I sure hope to hell you know what you’re doing.' Period. I said that.”
Asked by the interviewer Jack Heath what exactly it was that concerned Biden about his son and Burisma, the 2020 candidate said, “What his job was.”
Um ... Does this not bother Cooper? Anyone?
Biden is in quicksand, and his answer at the debate won't help it.

Texto completo: The Democratic presidential debate being held tonight — Tuesday, Oct. 15, 2019 — in a suburb near Ohio’s capital will bring back a candidate who has been absent from the stage for a while and introduce one who has never before been seen on the party’s debate lineup.
Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard failed to qualify for the September debate but will be back on stage tonight after meeting the Democratic National Committee’s qualifications:
Earning at least 2% support in four DNC-approved pollsReceiving contributions from at least 130,000 individual donors
Of those donors, at least 400 each must come from 20 different states
Also making that cut will be first-time presidential debater Tom Steyer of California. The billionaire hedge fund founder is known for his large contributions to environmental causes and political campaigns.
Along with those two will be the 10 candidates you would expect to see on the stage at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, listed alphabetically:

Texto completo: The impeachment investigation of President Donald Trump has dramatically changed the campaign landscape for the Democratic presidential candidates who will gather Tuesday in Ohio for their fourth debate.
The uproar over Trump asking the president of Ukraine to investigate his potential 2020 opponent Joe Biden has drawn attention away from every other Democrat in the race. And the candidates’ attempts to stay focused on healthcare, immigration, guns and other issues have been largely drowned out by the impeachment media storm and raging controversy over Trump’s foreign policy.
That could change, at least briefly, at the CNN/New York Times debate Tuesday in Westerville, Ohio.
Here are seven things to watch:
1. Will Biden face pressure on Ukraine?
Trump and his allies have been hurling unsubstantiated allegations that Biden, when he was vice president, pushed Ukraine to fire a top prosecutor in an effort to protect his son Hunter Biden, who was serving on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.
In a July phone call, Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens — shortly after suspending nearly $400 million in U.S. aid to Ukraine for its fight against Russia-backed separatists.
Numerous Ukrainian officials have said there is no evidence to support Trump’s claim. A probe of the gas company had nothing to do with Hunter Biden, they said, and had gone dormant when the Obama administration pushed for the prosecutor’s ouster because of his failure to go after corruption.
Still, Biden has refused to say why he saw no conflict in his son’s paid position on the gas company board when the vice president was the Obama administration’s point man for fighting corruption in Ukraine.
With Democrats nearly united in the drive to impeach Trump, it would be delicate for one of Biden’s rivals to raise the topic of whether his son’s Ukraine work posed at least the appearance of a conflict. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker has suggested that kind of attack would serve as a gift to Trump.
But debate moderators might not let Biden easily deflect questions about his son the way he has so far — by going on the attack against Trump for inviting foreign interference in the 2020 election.
Hunter Biden agreed Sunday not to work for any foreign-owned companies if his father is elected president.
2. How will the candidates stack up on foreign affairs?
The chaos and violence that followed Trump’s abandonment of America’s Kurdish allies in Syria last week, apparently at the bidding of Turkey’s president, have pushed foreign affairs to the top of the campaign agenda.
Trump’s Ukraine scandal and the giant Hong Kong protests against the Chinese government could further test the candidates’ dexterity with complex challenges overseas, an area little explored in previous debates.
For Biden, it’s a chance to show the expertise he developed over eight years as vice president and 36 years as a U.S. senator, including two as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.
The current and former members of Congress onstage have varying degrees of experience in foreign policy. But for those with little or none — South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Housing Secretary Julián Castro, San Francisco billionaire Tom Steyer and New York businessman Andrew Yang — questions about troubles abroad will carry an especially high risk if they’re unprepared to respond.
3. How will those in the back of the pack try to vault ahead?
Most of the 12 candidates onstage are stuck below 3% in the polls, so they’re in danger of not qualifying for the party’s increasingly stringent criteria for inclusion in future debates. That gives them an incentive to go on the attack.
California Sen. Kamala Harris, Castro and Booker have all gone after Biden in previous debates, with varying success. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii assailed Harris with scathing criticism of her record as a prosecutor.
With time running out, will Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar target Biden in a bid for moderate voters?
Will Steyer, a first-time candidate for public office who will be onstage for the first time at a Democratic debate, try to advance himself by tearing down one of his opponents?
4. Are the leading contenders ready to rumble?
For months, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has honored a peace pact with Warren, his leading rival for the support of progressives.
But Sanders’ poll numbers have been sliding as Warren’s have been rising, and he’s signaled he’s ready to point out their differences.
“Elizabeth, I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I’m not,” he told ABC News on Sunday.
Biden too has started to point out contrasts with Warren. At a recent fundraiser, he described himself as someone with “a proven ability to get things done,” then took an apparent swipe at Warren’s penchant for releasing a wide array of lengthy plans for her presidency. “We’re not electing a planner,” he said.
5. What’s the impact of Sanders’ recent heart attack?
The 78-year-old had to suspend his public events after suffering a heart attack early this month in Las Vegas. Many debate viewers will be watching Sanders’ energy level on Tuesday to assess his fitness to be commander in chief.
The senator’s health-related detour from the campaign trail could also draw new scrutiny to the other septuagenarians in the race: Biden and Warren, as well as Trump.
In a September debate, Castro appeared to question the mental acuity of Biden, who will turn 77 in November, by falsely accusing him of forgetting a comment on healthcare that he’d made a few minutes before. The attack backfired, earning Castro a heap of criticism.
The next oldest Democratic candidate, Warren, who at 70 is three years younger than Trump, frequently puts her vigor on display by jogging into rallies.
Still, the presence on the debate stage of several younger candidates — Buttigieg is 37; Gabbard is 38; Castro, 45; and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas, 47 — will inevitably highlight the age of their older rivals.
6. Can Harris and Buttigieg escape the mid-tier doldrums?
Harris has been one of the most uneven performers in the debates so far. She surged upward in the polls after confronting Biden in the first debate over his opposition to busing to desegregate schools in the 1970s.
But she had trouble explaining her healthcare plan in the next debate, and Warren has overtaken her as the top woman in the race. Harris tried to contrast herself with Trump in the September debate, but still failed to gain traction.
Buttigieg, one of the top fundraisers in the field, impressed many Democrats early on as a young, erudite, gay war veteran.
He is relatively popular in Iowa, which holds the party’s first presidential nominating contest on Feb. 3, but he has had trouble building support among African Americans, a crucial Democratic constituency. Like the lower-tier candidates, both Buttigieg and Harris face intense pressure to find a breakaway moment. Buttigieg has taken shots, albeit mild ones, at Warren and O’Rourke in recent days.
7. Will Warren be forced to say how she would pay for “Medicare for all”?
Warren was asked directly in the September debate whether middle-class taxes would rise if she’s able to fulfill her promise to offer Medicare to all Americans. America’s richest individuals and biggest corporations will pay more, she responded, and middle-class families will pay less.
Asked once again if middle-class taxes would rise, Warren sidestepped the question again, saying “total cost” would drop for “hard-working families.”
Republicans see a Democratic nominee who backs higher taxes for the middle class as a gift to Trump. So Warren’s response, if the question arises again, could matter a lot.

Texto completo: Fiona Hill, antigua asesora del gobierno de Donald Trump en Rusia, declaró este lunes que vio “irregularidades” en las relaciones diplomáticas de Estados Unidos con Ucrania . En el marco del proceso de investigación previo a un posible impeachment del presidente, Hill desveló la información a los legisladores demócratas y aseguró que ella se opuso enérgicamente y en varias ocasiones a la expulsión a principios de este 2019 a la embajadora en Ucrania Marie Yovanovitch .
Tal y como adelantó el diario The New York Times, un fuente anónima familiarizada con la investigación de los demócratas dijo que, durante las 10 horas que duró su testimonio, la exasesora afirmó haber notificado en su momento las “irregularidades” que vio . Por su parte, la embajadora Yovanovitch había declarado previamente que Trump presionó al Departamento de Estado para que la despidiera.
El testimonio de Hill forma parte de los intentos de la Cámara de Representantes por descubrir si Trump presionó a funcionarios ucranianos para que investigaran al hijo de su rival político Joe Biden y la supuesta injerencia de este país en las elecciones presidenciales 2016. Para esta semana hay otras cinco entrevistas previstas, la mayoría de ellas con funcionarios del Departamento de Estado. Sin embargo, no está claro quienes se presentarán después de que Trump se negara a cooperar la investigación.
Según la agencia Associated Press, la investigación podría extenderse hasta la semana que viene para tratar de determinar si la retención de la ayuda militar a Ucrania era una manera de presionar a este país para que iniciara las investigaciones contra Hunter Biden.

Texto completo: Twelve Democratic presidential candidates sparred Tuesday over healthcare, guns and other issues at a debate in Westerville, Ohio. Here's a play-by-play of the event:
11 p. m. EDT
Warren emerges as top target in feisty debate
Welcome to the lead, Elizabeth Warren.
Throughout a feisty three-hour Democratic debate in Ohio on Tuesday, the Massachusetts senator, who has risen to frontrunner status in recent polls, drew sharp and repeated attacks from other candidates on how to pay for health care, whether to tax the wealthy and what has caused the erosion of American middle class jobs.
“Your idea is not the only idea,” Amy Klobuchar said at one point as she turned to Warren during an exchange over taxing billionaires.
The sixth debate night of the 2020 presidential election cycle came during an inflection point in the race, as Joe Biden’s longstanding status as the frontrunner has been battered by Warren’s momentum. A common and telling refrain from the moderators throughout the debate: “I want to give Senator Warren a chance to respond. ”
The piling on began almost immediately, on the issue of health care. After five debates in which health care has been a top issue, the candidates drew sharper battle lines over how they would pay a Medicare-for-All system that has divided the field. Warren once again declined to say explicitly whether more government involvement in health care under Medicare for All would require Americans to pay more in taxes.
“So let me be clear on this,” Warren said. “Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. ”
Pete Buttigieg jumped, noting the lack of concrete response.
“Well, we heard it tonight, a yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer,” he said in response to Warren. “Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. ”
Bernie Sanders acknowledged that taxes would go up but said that families would save more than enough money in their health insurance plans to make up for it.
“At least Bernie’s being honest here,” Klobuchar said at one point. “I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice. ”
It was a frontrunner’s debate, with Warren and Biden getting far more airtime than the other candidates on stage. The two had one of their first extended scuffles over a fundamental rift in the field: Whether the nominee should pursue a more ambitious agenda, catering to a progressive wing that wants major change, versus the more pragmatic approach favored by Biden and others on stage.
President Donald Trump remained a central theme throughout the debate. Democrats were unified in their support of the impeachment inquiry launched this month by House Democrats. On the other hand, the flap over Joe Biden’s son – Hunter Biden – and his business ties to Ukraine was addressed quickly in the debate and then dispensed with.
Biden said his son “did nothing wrong” and that his interview on ABC earlier Tuesday “speaks for itself. ”
Other Democrats on stage did not seek to attack Biden over the issue. Quite the contrary, in fact.
“That was so offensive," Cory Booker said of Biden having to answer a question on his son’s foreign business.
Another theme in the debate was criticism of Trump's abrupt withdrawal of U. S. troops from northern Syria, which cleared the way for Turkey to invade and battle with U. S. -allied Kurds.
The Democratic candidates largely agreed that Trump’s decision was a betrayal of the Kurds, but they disagreed on what to do next. Biden indicated that he would maintain a troop presence in the region.
“I would want those thousand troops to be protected by air cover, those thousand troops that are being – having to withdraw under fire, make it clear that they're not going anywhere, and have them protected, and work my way back toward what, in fact, needs to be done, protecting those Kurds,” Biden said.
The debate about what to do in Syria drew in others into a clash on stage.
“So really what you’re saying, Mayor Pete, is that you would continue to support having U. S. troops in Syria for an extended period of time,” Tulsi Gabbard told Buttigieg.
“You can put an end to endless war without embracing Donald Trump’s policy,” Buttigieg responded. “What we were doing in Syria was keeping our word. ”
Eight of the candidates on stage Tuesday had already qualified for the next debate – to be held Nov. 20 near Atlanta. That meant fewer of the lesser-known candidates this time around needed a breakout moment to stay alive. But the Iowa caucuses are fast approaching, and the window for moving from “staying alive” to potentially clinching the nomination is narrowing.
Four candidates who were on stage Tuesday aren’t yet a lock for November: Klobuchar, Tulsi Gabbard, Julian Castro and Beto O’Rourke.

10:47 p. m. EDT
Biden to Warren: ‘You did a hell of a job’
In one of the more tense moments in the debate, Joe Biden sparred with Elizabeth Warren over how to get things done in Washington.
The back-and-forth came during a debate over whether Democrats should pursue a more ambitious agenda, catering liberal elements of the party that want major structure change, versus Biden’s more pragmatic approach and argument that the party should not overreach.
To underscore her argument that Democrats should pursue bold ideas, Warren touted her role in setting up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2010 after the Great Recession and 2007-2009 financial crisis. The effort required a big fight. Republicans bitterly opposed the idea, viewing it as government overreach.
“I went on the floor and got you votes,” a visibly upset Biden told Warren. “I got you votes. ”
Warren looked past Biden’s remarks and instead thanked his former boss, President Barack Obama.
“I am deeply grateful to President Obama for fighting so hard,” Warren said.
“You did a hell of job in your job,” Biden acknowledged.
“Thank you,” Warren said.

10:40 p. m. EDT
Democrats name check . . . Robert Bork?
The most unusual name check of Democratic debate night: The late conservative jurist Robert Bork.
Cory Booker first invoked his name in mocking proposals to enforce antitrust law, saying that "Robert Bork is just laughing in his sleep. "
Numerous commentators pointed out an inconvenient fact.
"Bork has been dead for six years. He’s more than asleep," tweeted political writer Walter Shapiro. (Bork actually died in December of 2012, almost seven years ago. )
Political scientist Jack Pitney invoked the words of writer Raymond Chandler: “You were dead, you were sleeping the big sleep, you were not bothered by things like that, oil and water were the same as wind and air to you. ”
Later in the debate, Joe Biden also jumped on the Bork bandwagon.
Biden noted that, in 1987, he led the Senate effort to reject Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court, a pivotal event in the hyper-partisanship that has marked so many judicial nominations.

10:29 p. m. EDT
Cory Booker, a vegan, calls Trump 'most unhealthy' candidate
In the middle of his criticism of big corporations, Cory Booker playfully chided the moderators for asking older candidates – Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren – about their health.
“I feel qualified to say this as the vegan on the stage,” the New Jersey senator said. “It’s rich to me that we asked three people about their health when, looking at this stage, we know that the most unhealthy person running for the presidency in 2020 is Donald Trump. ”
In February, after Trump took his annual physical exam, then White House press secrer Sarah Sanders said Trump is “in very good health and I anticipate he will remain so for the duration of his Presidency, and beyond. ”
A Huffpo/YouGov poll released Monday found that voters age 65 and older are more likely (61%) than voters age 18 to 29 (51%) to question a candidate’ physical health.
– Ledyard King
10:15 p. m. EDT
Sanders: 'I'm feeling great'
When pressed about whether he’s “up to the stress” of the presidency after suffering a heart attack earlier this month, Sen. Bernie Sanders responded, “I’m healthy. I’m feeling great. ” The 78-year-old canceled several campaign events after undergoing surgery, releasing a video in which he said lying in a Las Vegas hospital “made me feel even more strongly the need for us to continue our efforts to end this dysfunctional and cruel health care system. ”
But as the Vermont senator seeks to turn his heart attack into a conversation about Medicare for All, the scare has renewed questions about whether his age will affect his stamina in the race and in the White House should he win in 2020.
A Huffpo/YouGov poll released Monday found that voters age 65 and older are more likely (61%) than voters age 18 to 29 (51%) to question a candidate’ physical health.
Sanders said he’s reassuring Americans about his fitness by “mounting a vigorous campaign” across the country and he plugged a rally in Queens he is planning on Saturday. The Vermont senator also drew cheers after he thanked his supporters and those who sent prayers and well wishes for his recovery.
The same question was put to another septuagenarian – Joe Biden, who would be 78 if elected to office.
“One of the reasons I’m running is because of my age and my experience – with it comes wisdom,” Biden said.
9:55 p. m. EDT
Buttigieg takes on O'Rourke over gun buybacks
Beto O’Rourke and Pete Buttigieg got into an extended personal debate in a continuation of an argument they’ve been having over O’Rourke’s proposal to require people to give up assault-style weapons.
Asked how he would enforce a mandatory buyback program, O’Rourke said he expects “my fellow Americans to follow the law. ”
Buttigieg, who has called O’Rourke’s proposal a “shiny object” that distracts from taking gun control steps for which there is widespread support, said O’Rourke’s response makes clear that he doesn’t know how the plan would work.
“We cannot wait for purity tests,” Buttigieg said. “We have to just get something done. ”
O’Rourke countered that Democrats should decide what they’re going to believe in and not be limited by polls, consultants and focus groups.
Buttigieg said the problem isn’t the polls; the problem is the policy.
“I don’t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal,” Buttigieg added. “Everyone on this stage is determined to get something done. ”
O’Rourke then said Buttigieg’s “shiny object” description of the buyback plan was a slap in the face to every survivor of a mass shooting.
Buttigieg responded that the best response for gun shooting survivors is to “actually deliver a solution. ”
Amy Klobuchar echoed Buttigieg’s criticism when asked what’s wrong with a mandatory buyback program.
“I just keep thinking of how close we are to finally getting something done on this,” she said. “Let’s not mess this up with this fight. ”
Kamala Harris, when asked why she supports a mandatory buyback program, replied by saying there are 5 million assault weapons are on the streets.
“I have personally hugged more mothers of homicide victims that I care to tell you,” the former prosecutor said. “I’m done and we need action. ”
– Maureen Groppe
9:46 p. m. EDT
O'Rourke, Gabbard, Steyer getting less air time
It’s hard to make the argument on why voters should support you when you don’t get much of a chance to talk.
While Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden, and Pete Buttigieg got most of the air time, Andrew Yang, Julian Castro, Cory Booker and new-to-the-stage Tom Steyer are having a harder time making their case.
According to a word count of the first hour of the debate, candidates at the top of the poll led the scramble for air time
Warren dominated speaking times for the first parts of the debate, based on a USA TODAY analysis of preliminary transcripts.
She spoke about 1,251 words during the first two parts of the debate, followed by Biden, who spoke 668 words. Buttigieg had the third-most speaking time, at 658 words.
On the other end, Beto O’Rourke (190 words) Tulsi Gabbard (157 words), and businessman Tom Steyer had the least speaking time so far, with about 140 words.
– Ledyard King and Nicholas Wu
9:42 p. m. EDT
Democrats debate troop presence in Middle East
Elizabeth Warren used the debate to make a statement about the Middle East that is sure to get some attention in coming days as the Democrats clashed on stage over how to respond to the ongoing conflict in Syria.
"I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East," Warren said during a discussion of Turkey's invasion of northern Syria. "I don't think we should have troops in the Middle East. But we have to do it the right way, the smart way. "
Commentators on social media clamored for Warren to be more specific.
"Warren is making big news when she says we should have no troops in the Middle East," tweeted Joe Lockhart, a press secretary for President Bill Clinton. "We have important bases all over the region that are important to our national security. ”
Warren’s comments came during an extended debate how to proceed in the region. Democrats largely agree that President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw troops from Syria was an abandonment of U. S. -allied Kurds, but they disagreed somewhat on what to do next.
“So really what you’re saying, Mayor Pete, is that you would continue to support having U. S. troops in Syria for an extended period of time,” Tulsi Gabbard told Buttigieg.
“You can put an end to endless war without embracing Donald Trump’s policy,” Buttigieg responded. “What we were doing in Syria was keeping our word. ”
Gabbard and Buttigieg are the only two Democrats on stage who served in uniform.

Steyer: Trump’s America First ‘worst idea I’ve ever heard’
Tom Steyer, who has spent millions trying to combat climate change, made it clear how little he thinks of President Trump’s “Make America Great Again” platform that champions the massive development and expansion of carbon-causing fossil fuels to power the U. S. economy.
“We can’t solve the climate crisis by ourselves,” the one-time California hedge fund billionaire said. “We have to work with our allies and our frenemies around the word. ”
“We’re going to have to lead the world morally,” he continued. “We’re going to have to lead it technologically, financially and commercially. This is the proof that this kind of America first, go-it-alone, trust nobody and be untrustworthy is the worst idea I’ve ever heard, and I would change it one day one in every single way. ”

'Dude gotta go'
Kamala Harris got in one of her signature lines on Donald Trump while criticizing his foreign policy. Harris said Trump has given 10,000 ISIS fighters a get-out-of-jail-free card, calling what’s happening in Syria a crisis of Trump’s own making. And he has a long list of those, she added.
“That’s why Dude gotta go,” Harris said.

Biden on Syria: ‘Most shameful thing’
Joe Biden came out swinging on Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw U. S. troops from Syria but declined to answer a direct question: Would he, as president, place special forces troops back in the region?
Biden called Trump’s decision the “most shameful thing any president has done in modern history in terms of foreign policy,” as he excoriated the president for clearing the way for Turkey to attack U. S. allied Kurds in Syria.
Biden said he believed the U. S. should be involved in air support, but declined to say whether he would order troops back.
The issue is a complicated one for Democrats, many of whom have criticized Trump’s move in Syria but who have also called for the U. S. to withdraw from entanglements in the Middle East. Trump has defended the move by saying he wants to extract American soldiers from overseas commitment.
“What we were doing in Syria was keeping our word,” said Pete Buttigieg.

Warren emerges as biggest target
In the first debates, Joe Biden who led the polls was the target of rivals’ slings and arrows.
On Tuesday, riding polls that show her now on top, Elizabeth Warren discovered that she’s wearing the bullseye.
On health care, Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg and Joe Biden took turns hitting Warren on her Medicare For All plan that they said was costly and unrealistic.
On wealth distribution, Klobuchar took umbrage at how she thought Warren was painting her ”ultra-millionaire tax” as the best plan.
“We just have different approaches,” Klobuchar told Warren. “Your idea is not the only idea. ”
Beto O’Rourke piled on: “I think it’s part of the solution but I think we need to be focused on lifting people up and sometimes I think Sen. Warren is focused on being punitive or pitting one side of the country against the other. ”

Billionaires under fire, even from the billionaire
Democrats on stage largely agreed on at least one thing: Tax the rich.
Even the rich agreed.
Bernie Sanders took a question directly in his wheelhouse: Does he believe the billionaires should be taxed out of existence? Sanders didn’t go that far, but he did say that the country could not “afford to continue this level of income and wealth inequality. ”
Tom Steyer, a philanthropist and longtime Democratic donor making his first appearance on the presidential debate stage, said he largely agreed with Sanders’ assessment.
“Sanders is right,” Steyer said during an extended debate about whether the candidates supported a wealth tax. “There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government. ”
Amy Klobuchar captured the sense of the debate a minute later: “Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires. ”

Andrew Yang likes 'spirit' of Green New Deal, not job guarantee
Bernie Sanders' support of the Green New deal and its guarantee of federal work for millions of Americans didn’t sit well with businessman Andrew Yang, whose signature campaign proposal would give Americans a $1,000 monthly “dividend. ”
Yang said he likes the “spirit” of a federal jobs guarantee, which Sanders said is needed with the onset of automation.
But “the fact is most Americans don’t want to work for the federal government,” Yang said. “And saying that is the vision of the economy of the 21st century to me is not a vision that most American would embrace. ”
Yang said he’s rather put money directly in American’s pocket than rely on government to address the problem because “it will result in failed retraining programs and jobs that no one wants. ”

Harris draws applause for raising abortion amid healthcare fray
Senator Kamala Harris was asked to weigh in on the back-and-forth over Medicare for All and instead turned the conversation to abortion rights.
“There are states that have passed laws that will virtually prevent women from having access to reproductive healthcare,” she said.
She said it was not an exaggeration to say poor women and women of color “will die” because of the restrictive state laws. Harris lambasted Republican lawmakers for being “out of touch” with American women and called on them to let women make their own decisions about their reproductive rights.

Klobuchar: Where will we 'send the invoice' for health plan?
Elizabeth Warren, the candidate who boasts that she has a plan for everything, was pushed on why she hasn’t said how she would pay for expanding health are to all Americans.
Bernie Sanders, who like Warren supports Medicare for All, has acknowledged that taxes would need to go up to pay for it, but has said premiums would go down.
Asked whether her plan would require higher taxes on the middle class, Warren said costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations but down for middle class families.
"I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle class families. ” Warren said.
Buttigieg, who has criticized Warren on the issue, said she dodged the question – what he called an example of why people are “so frustrated with Washington. ”
“I don’t understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage for everyone is by obliterating private plans,” Buttigieg said.
Warren said Buttigieg’s “Medicare for All Who Want It” proposal is really “Medicare for All Who Can Afford It. ”
“That’s the problem we’ve got,” she said. “Medicare for All is the gold standard. ”
Amy Klobuchar, another contender trying to distinguish herself by warning that the more liberal candidates are going too far, said Warren was handing Republicans a gift by offering up a plan they can attack as too expensive. ​
“I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we’re going to send the invoice," Klobuchar said.
"The difference between a plan and a pipe dream, is something that you can actually get done," she said.
Joe Biden argued that taxes increases for some would exceed what they would save on health care costs.
"The issues is whether the Democratic Party has the guts to stand up to the health care industry,” Sanders shot back.

Biden demurs on Hunter Biden question
Everyone knew the question was coming: Why was it okay for Hunter Biden to have a business interest in Ukraine when, as vice president, Joe Biden was the Obama administration’s lead on that country?
Biden largely demurred on the question.
“Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong,” Biden said.
“My son’s statement speaks for itself,” Biden said, before pivoting back to Trump. “What we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. I’m proud of the judgment (Hunter) he made. ”
The question had been guaranteed to come up early in this debate, the first since House Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry and the Trump campaign began firing back with television ads highlighting Hunter Biden’s former business dealings in the Ukraine and China.
Hunter Biden hours earlier acknowledged he made a "mistake" and showed “poor judgement” in not calculating the political ramifications of joining the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company while his father had official business in the country as vice president. Speaking to ABC News, Hunter Biden denied doing anything "improper" in the Ukraine.
Some Democrats saw the flap as a chance for Joe Biden to hit back at Trump, including by noting that Trump’s children also have overseas business tied to Donald Trump’s real estate empire. The former vice president didn't raise the issue.

Steyer pushes his signature issue: impeachment
Billionaire Tom Steyer, who launched his campaign in July, has long pushed for President Donald Trump’s impeachment before the formal inquiry began and made that his first point in his debut on the Democratic debate stage tonight.
Before calling every candidate on the stage more patriotic than the president, Steyer pointed out he launched the Need to Impeach, an online campaign focused on Trump’s impeachment in October 2017, two years before House Democrats opened a formal impeachment inquiry into the president’s interactions with Ukraine.
“Impeaching and removing the president is something the American people are demanding,” he said.

Klobuchar makes first Syria reference
President Donald Trump has faced considerable blowback for his decision to pull U. S. troops out of Syria this month, a move that all but paved the way for Turkey to begin airstrikes against U. S. -allied Kurds.
It didn’t take long for that issue to pop up at the Democratic debate. Amy Klobuchar raised it in the answer to her first question, tying it to a question about whether the president should be impeached and removed from office.
Klobuchar asked how "leaving the Kurds for slaughter, our allies for slaughter" would make "Make America Great Again. "
Look for this issue to come up a lot more over the next three hours.
– John Fritze
8:11 p. m. EDT
First question is about impeachment
The debate launched with a question about House Democrat’s impeachment inquiry, which all the Democratic presidential candidates support. But with a presidential election year coming up, why shouldn’t voters determine whether Trump stays in office, Elizabeth Warren was asked.
“Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics,” she said.
Up next, Bernie Sanders called Trump the most corrupt president in history.
“I agree with Bernie,” Joe Biden echoed.
Because the White House has refused to cooperate with Democrats’ investigation, Biden added, Congress has no choice but to act.
Kamala Harris said she doubts the impeachment inquiry will last long.
“As a former prosecutor,” Harris said. “I know a confession when I see it. ”

Trump, RNC announce $125. 7 million fundraising haul
7:50 p. m. EDT
Democrats will be on the debate stage Tuesday, but President Donald Trump's campaign is still looming large.
The Trump campaign, campaign committees, and the Republican National Committee announced a $125. 7 million fundraising haul for the third Federal Elections Commission filing quarter as Democrats prepared to take the stage for the fourth Democratic presidential debate.
In a release, the campaign said all of the groups would have $158 million cash on hand.
“President Trump’s campaign is a juggernaut on an unstoppable path to victory in November 2020,” Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said.
According to the Trump campaign, it received 1,056,126 individual donations last quarter, with an average donation of $44. 50.
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. , raised about $25 million last quarter, the most out of any of the Democratic contenders.

Battle of the young guys: Beto v. Buttigieg
7:40 p. m. EDT
Expect sharper elbows from South Bend, Ind. , Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has already called out Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders this week while trading barbs with former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke.
The Indiana mayor launched a digital ad Monday explicitly attacking Sanders and Warren for their support for “Medicare for All” and instead touting his “Medicare for All Who Want It” plan.
Earlier this week, Buttigieg faced off with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke over a mandatory buyback program for assault rifles, a policy O’Rourke made headlines over in the last debate.
Earlier this month O’Rourke slammed Buttigieg for his hesitancy over support for the program. The mayor responded to the criticism earlier this week in an interview with Snapchat’s “Good Luck America. ”
“I get it. He needs to pick a fight in order to stay relevant,” Buttigieg said Monday.
O’Rourke responded in a tweet: “Pete can belittle the grassroots; he can call buybacks a ‘shiny object. ’ He can say whatever he wants, but guns kill 40,000 people year. ”

Pelosi delivers debate question to stage
7:15 p. m. EDT
The dozen Democrats on the debate stage in Ohio will have to answer a boatload of uncomfortable questions Tuesday about health issues, the age of the field's frontrunners and foreign entanglements in the Ukraine – to name a few.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi just threw another touchy issue into the queue: Should the House hold a vote to formalize the impeachment Democrats announced at a press conference three weeks ago? Less than two hours before the debate got underway, Pelosi announced that he House would hold off on that vote for now.
Republicans have noted that every previous impeachment inquiry was preceded with a vote in the House to set up a special committee to conduct the investigation. Democrats say they don’t need to do that – and the Constitution doesn’t explicitly require it – but Republicans have raised process questions to hammer away at the inquiry and the White House has said it won’t provide documents absent a vote.

Dems send signal by debating in Ohio
7:05 p. m. EDT
President Donald Trump won Ohio in 2016 by 8 points, rebranding a state long seen a presidential battleground into one that is older, whiter and more Republican.
When Trump won the state it raised questions about Ohio's ability to mirror the national mood, according to Kyle Kondik, author of "The Bellwether. "
By holding their debate Otterbein University outside of Columbus, Democrats are signaling they’re not conceding the state.
"I am absolutely confident that battleground Ohio will once again be in Democratic hands," Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez told reporters from state and national news organizations.
Democrats see hope in the suburbs, which have swung their way. That’s why Tuesday night’s debate will take place in an Ohio suburb that voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 but switched to Hillary Clinton in 2016.
The reason Ohio has become much more Republican relative to the nation? It's significantly whiter with a smaller share of college graduates than average. That’s not the case in Westerville, however, the town where the debate is being held.
So unless Democrats can improve their standing with white voters without four-year college degrees, they'll have a hard time carrying Ohio in 2020, Kondik concludes in an analysis for the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics.

Bloomberg: Are we hiring a legislator in chief?
7 p. m. EDT
Is former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg still considering a run for president? Based on an op-ed published hours before the debate Tuesday in the Washington Post, it sure looks like he’s eager to remain in the mix.
Bloomberg – who initially announced he wouldn’t run but who more recently has reportedly told allies he’d consider it if Biden falters – writes that the current field of candidates is talking about the wrong things.
“Rarely are the candidates asked, and more rarely still do they talk about, how they would go about achieving their goals,” said Bloomberg, who is known for overseeing a technocratic administration that came on the heels of another former New York leader who’s been in the news a lot lately: Rudy Giuliani.
“The job’s essential skills primarily involve leadership and management, not policy analysis,” Bloomberg writes. “The country elects a commander in chief, and yet based on the campaign so far, one might think we are electing a legislator in chief. ”
Bloomberg also uses the piece to take a swipe at Trump. Bloomberg says he spoke with the president shortly after the 2016 election and advised him to hire people “who are smarter than you. ”
So how did Trump do? A few good hires, Bloomberg opines, otherwise not very well.
“Mostly he hired cronies, ideologues and sycophants,” Bloomberg wrote, “while also leaving hundreds of important senior level positions unfilled and paying less attention to many agencies than he does to cable TV news. ”

Are you smarter than a bookie?
6:50 p. m. EDT
Betting sites are taking all kinds of wagers on tonight’s debate, including on whether Bernie Sanders will withdraw from the race, whether anyone will curse on stage, who will be tweeted about most, and how many times certain words will be said.
Can you rank these words by the frequency in which SportsBetting. ag thinks they will be uttered? Billionaire. Impeach. China. Obama (as mentioned by Biden).
If you guessed China, impeach, billionaire and then Biden references to Obama, you’re thinking like a bookie. (The over/under on the China mentions is 40. 5 and the over/under on Biden references to Obama is 3. 5. )

AOC's barb at Mayor Pete
6:45 p. m. EDT
A growing battle between Pete Buttigieg and the party’s progressive wing escalated in the lead-up to the debate.
Buttigieg released a new digital ad drawing a distinction between his “Medicare for all who want it” health care plan and the proposal backed by Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. The ad says Sanders and Warren “believe that we have to force ourselves into `Medicare for all,’ where private insurance is abolished. ”
The ad is running in Iowa where a new poll from Firehouse Strategies has Buttigieg in third place, having moved ahead of Sanders.
Buttigieg’s increased attempts to go after the frontrunners include this comment he made Monday about Warren’s eschewing small donor strategy: “We're not going to beat Trump with pocket change. ”
In a tweeted response, Progressive icon Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said the grassroots campaigning that Buttigieg “insults” has outraised him.
And the Progressive Change Campaign Committee boasted that “numerous progressive voices sent warning flares to Mayor Pete before Tuesday's debate. ”
“Mayor Pete has been a rising star. But he needs to stop this,” the political action committee wrote in a fundraising email to supporters Tuesday.
Trump's one-word attack
6:40 p. m. EDT
The Trump campaign’s response to the Democratic debate can be summed up in one word: socialism.
In a full-page ad in today’s Columbus Dispatch the campaign argues that Democrats’ “big government socialism will wreck Ohio’s economy. ”
Banners scheduled to fly above the city of Westerville during the afternoon shouted “SOCIALISM DESTROYS OHIO JOBS. ”
The campaign says Democrats would raise taxes, eliminate private health insurance and increasing electrical bills by “ending fossil fuels. ”

What to expect
5:50 p. m. EDT
The Westerville debate is the first since House Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump last month over the Ukraine scandal. Joe Biden will have a chance to push back forcefully on the president's efforts to get officials in Ukraine to investigate him and his son, Hunter. But Biden also may face questions about the appropriateness of his son's having served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company when Biden was vice president.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders will take the stage two weeks after having a heart attack.
And Elizabeth Warren has been making a strong case – through fundraising, organizing and poll numbers – for why she should be considered the frontrunner.
Still, Biden will stand in the center of the stage, flanked by Warren and Sanders, based on the average of the 10 most recent qualifying polls as of Oct. 2.

The nine other candidates on stage will make the debate the largest presidential primary debate in the nation's recorded history, according to the New York Times.
They will have three hours, in snippets of 75 seconds or less, to make their case to the voters.

Tom Steyer enters the fray
On stage for the first time will be billionaire Tom Steyer who has pumped millions of dollars into a campaign to impeach Trump.
A half dozen Democrats still in the race didn't make tonight's cut, including Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, the only remaining governor running, and self-help author Marianne Williamson.
The polling numbers and fundraising support required to participate will ratchet up further for the November debate.

A more aggressive Biden?
Joe Biden told supporters at a California fundraiser last week that he's had a target on his back at the debates because he began the race as a frontrunner. He's facing competition for his frontrunner status, though. Elizabeth Warren has been climbing in the polls. In some surveys, she polls slightly higher than him while in others Biden maintains an edge.
Biden also enters the debate facing questions about how well he's handled the Ukrainian controversy and having just been outraised by three of his opponents in the last quarter.
Plus, in an interview that aired Tuesday morning, Hunter Biden repeatedly admitted he made a "mistake" in not calculating the political ramifications of joining the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company while his father had official business in the country as vice president.
So should we expect a different Biden from the last three rounds?
“One of the problems I’m finding, I’ve got to be more aggressive,” Biden said at the fundraiser. “Which is good, I’m not complaining, I’m a big boy,” he said, while explaining that the debates' time restraints don’t allow time for full answers.
– Maureen Groppe
Likable enough?
While debates offer a chance for contenders to stand out by attacking an opponent, that can be difficult to do while remaining likable. And a poll out Tuesday underscores why Democrats need to stay in good graces with voters.
The latest findings from the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service Battleground Poll show Trump isn’t the only one who has a higher unfavorability than favorability rating. For six of the seven Democratic hopefuls tested, more voters had a negative opinion than a positive one. The exception was Pete Buttigieg, but 39% of respondents had no opinion of him or had never heard of him.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Former national security adviser John Bolton wanted no part of what he derided as the White House's "drug deal" to pressure Ukraine into investigating Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, a former White House official told congressional investigators on Monday, according to reports of her testimony from The New York Times and NBC News.
Fiona Hill, who served as the National Security Council's senior director for Europe and Russia, spent more than 10 hours fielding questions from three House panels behind closed doors.
Her testimony was part of an impeachment inquiry into allegations President Donald Trump used military aid as leverage to get the Ukrainians to dig into an energy company that included the former vice president's son Hunter on its board. Ukrainian officials have said they uncovered no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the Bidens.
Hill testified that Bolton told her to inform National Security Council lawyer John Eisenberg of the push for a fresh investigation by acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and Gordon Sondland, the U. S. ambassador to the European Union, the reports said.
Mulvaney, Giuliani and Sondland also wanted Ukrainian officials to explore the possibility of a Ukrainian role in 2016 election interference.
This week in the impeachment inquiry: A deadline for Rudy Giuliani, more Capitol Hill meetings
Hill said Bolton advised her to contact Eisenberg after a July 10 meeting with senior Ukrainian officials in which Sondland brought up the issue of investigations, The Wall Street Journal reported.
Bolton told her he wasn't part of "whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up," unnamed sources who witnessed Hill's testimony told the Times. He also reportedly referred to Giuliani as "a hand grenade who’s going to blow everybody up. "
"I always liked and respected John," Giuliani said of Bolton in response to Hill's testimony, according to NBC News. "I’m very disappointed that his bitterness drives him to attack a friend falsely and in a very personal way. It’s really ironic that John Bolton is calling anyone else a hand grenade. When John is described by many as an atomic bomb. "
Fiona Hill: Former Trump Russia adviser Fiona Hill testifies for 10 hours in impeachment probe
Hill told lawmakers that Giuliani's role circumvented the normal national security processes and procedures for forming foreign policy.
The Times reported that she confronted Sondland about what she considered the rogue foreign policy he was instituting in Ukraine, which is not part of the EU and therefore not normally under the ambassador to the EU's purview.
Sondland told her that he was in charge of Ukraine. When she asked who had given him that authority, he replied that the president had, according to the Times.
Sondland is expected to testify Thursday.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The White House says President Donald Trump has yet to watch a graphically violent parody video that depicts a likeness of him shooting and stabbing opponents and members of the news media, but based on what he's heard, he "strongly condemns" it.
The parody was shown at a meeting of Trump supporters at his Miami resort.
The video portrays Trump's critics and media members as parishioners in a church fleeing his gruesome rampage. The fake Trump strikes the late Sen. John McCain in the neck, hits and stabs TV personality Rosie O'Donnell in the face, lights Sen. Bernie Sanders' head on fire and shoots or otherwise assaults people whose faces are replaced with news organization logos.
Trump's face is superimposed on a killer's body. Among the targets: former President Barack Obama, Black Lives Matter, Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters, Bill and Hillary Clinton and Rep. Adam Schiff, who is leading the impeachment inquiry of Trump.
White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham says in a tweet that Trump will see the video shortly and that, "based upon everything he has heard, he strongly condemns this video."
The video and its screening were first reported by The New York Times.
The "unauthorized video" was shown last week "in a side room" at an American Priority conference at Trump's Doral Miami resort, the event's organizer, Alex Phillips, said in a statement.
"This video was not approved, seen, or sanctioned" by the event's organizers, Phillips said.

Russia's Putin visits
Saudi Arabia on Mideast trip
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates - Russian President Vladimir Putin traveled to Saudi Arabia on Monday, meeting with the oil-rich nation's king and crown prince as he seeks to cement Moscow's political and energy ties across the Mideast.
Putin received all the trappings of a state visit, with a mounted guard escorting his limousine to King Salman's Al-Yamamah palace in Riyadh on his first visit to the kingdom since 2007.
In the intervening years, the Arab Spring roiled the wider Mideast as Putin would partner with Iran in backing Syrian President Bashar Assad in that country's still-raging war. Saudi Arabia unsuccessfully backed those trying to oust Assad.
But more recently, Russia joined OPEC in lowering their production beginning in 2017, the first such cut for the cartel in a decade.

Officer who shot naked man found not guilty of murder
DECATUR, Ga. - A former police officer who fatally shot an unarmed, naked man was found not guilty of murder Monday but was convicted of aggravated assault and other charges that could send him to prison for more than 30 years.
Robert "Chip" Olsen's face turned red and he squeezed his eyes shut tightly as the verdict was read. His wife, Kathy Olsen, began sobbing and had to be led from the courtroom.
Olsen, now 57, was a DeKalb County police officer in March 2015 when he responded to a call of a naked man behaving erratically outside an Atlanta-area apartment complex. Shortly after arriving, he fatally shot 26-year-old Anthony Hill, an Air Force veteran who had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.

Texas prison guard acquitted in death of inmate he threw down
ANGLETON, Texas - A jury has acquitted a former Texas prison guard who slammed a handcuffed inmate to the ground so hard that the man's liver ruptured and he died.
The Houston Chronicle reports that Lou Joffrion was acquitted last month on aggravated assault charges in the 2017 death of David Witt, who had mental health issues.
Authorities say Joffrion, who was a sergeant at the Darrington Unit in Brazoria County south of Houston, picked up the 128-pound Witt and slammed him to the ground after Witt refused orders to return to his cell.
Joffrion's lawyer defended the use of force, saying whether it was excessive is "subjective."
Jennifer Erschabek of the Texas Inmate Families Association called the verdict "legalized brutality."

Protests erupt as Spain
convicts separatists
BARCELONA, Spain - Riot police engaged in a running battle with protesters outside Barcelona's airport Monday after Spain's Supreme Court convicted 12 separatist leaders of illegally promoting the wealthy Catalonia region's independence and sentenced nine of them to prison.
Police fired foam bullets and used batons against the thousands of protesters who converged on Josep Tarradellas Barcelona-El Prat Airport after a pro-independence grassroots group put out the call. Protesters fought back by throwing objects, spraying dark clouds with fire extinguishers, and breaking windows.
Regional emergency service SEM said 53 people were treated for injuries at the airport.
Police also clashed with angry crowds late Monday night in downtown Barcelona.

Hong Kong police say
bomb targeted its officers
HONG KONG - A homemade, remote-controlled bomb intended to "kill or to harm" riot control officers was detonated as they deployed against renewed violence in Hong Kong over the weekend, police said Monday, in a further escalation of destructive street battles gripping the business hub.
The "loud thud" Sunday night close to riot officers who had been clearing away a protester-built roadblock marked the first known use of an explosive during protests that started in June.
But despite spiraling violence, widespread vandalism and gasoline-bomb attacks by black-clad, hard-core protesters - and repeated government appeals for people not to take their side - the protest movement is still rousing determined support from more moderate demonstrators.

Texto completo: COLUMBUS – It's debate week in Ohio. And national Democrats want you to know they're not going to abandon the state when it's over.
On Tuesday, 12 Democratic presidential hopefuls will debate in the Columbus suburb Westerville. The location is said to represent Democrats' inroads in the suburbs and its commitment to campaign in the state that Donald Trump won in 2016 by 8 points.
Issues such as Medicare for all and the Green New Deal have dominated the national narrative around the Democratic primary. But they were near absent during the Ohio Democratic Party's state dinner Sunday.
Instead, party officials and a handful of 2020 presidential candidates addressing the crowd spent much of their time attacking Trump, pledging to address climate change and urging action on gun control and the opiate addiction crisis.
The five candidates – who have polled in single digits in recent weeks – delivered messages tailored to Ohio.
Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar stressed her ability to win Republican-leaning areas. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg likened the Trump presidency to a TV show, and in a few short months, "You get to pick up the remote and change the channel to something better."
Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan said Democrats shouldn't be afraid to voice support for labor unions. Businessman Tom Steyer noted a recent spate of overdose deaths in the county. Businessman Andrew Yang started his speech with a stat about manufacturing automation correlating with support for Trump.
"It's been an interesting campaign to be a candidate from Ohio because it seems like it's all happening here," said Ryan, the only candidate of the five who won't be on the debate stage Tuesday.
More than 25,000 people requested free tickets to the debate from the party; only a few hundred were available.
The state and national party organized events across the state before and after the debate. Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez will meet General Motors workers on strike in West Chester, farmers in central Ohio and gun violence survivors in Dayton. Candidates extended their stay by a few days to campaign here.
Republicans have painted the Democratic field as too far left and out-of-touch with most voters, especially Ohioans who elected Trump in 2016.
"From supporting a bogus impeachment witch hunt, to advocating for failed socialist policies, the Democrats' radical agenda is taking center stage in Ohio," Republican National Committee spokeswoman Mandi Merritt said in a statement. "But no matter the candidate, not one 2020 wannabe will stack up to President Trump's record of success in the Buckeye State."
Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper refuted that idea, saying Democrats are with the mainstream on big issues such as health care, guns and climate change. Republicans, Pepper said, are in the minority.
"They want to keep the Affordable Care Act, expand it, do better – others want to go further. It's a debate between how do we broaden access," Pepper told reporters before the dinner. "Donald Trump and the Republicans want to get rid of the Affordable Care Act entirely."
Perez said the party will invest in Ohio because he thinks Democrats can win here. The message, he said, is simple: "We have your back on the issues that matter most."
CNN, which hosted the July debate, will host the Oct. 15 debate with The New York Times.

Texto completo: The White House says President Donald Trump hasn't seen the violent video edited to depict him carrying out a massacre of news organizations and political opponents, but he does condemn the contents being reported.
The statement comes as questions about the video and its use continue to swirl and as the people "killed" in the video continue to react.
The fake video was played at a conference hosted by a pro-Trump group at his Miami resort last week, according to a report in The New York Times. It includes the logo for Trump's 2020 reelection campaign.
In the edited scene from the film "Kingsman: The Secret Service," Trump as the face of Colin Firth's character enters a "Church of Fake News" and opens fire on members of the congregation.
The churchgoers have various news organizations' logos or the faces of Democratic lawmakers and other critics superimposed onto their bodies.
White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said Monday morning that the president has not yet viewed the video, but condemns its contents based on reports. She said he will see it shortly. Trump has not directly responded.
Trump's character shoots, stabs and sets fire to the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.; 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif.; and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama, among others.
The video also shows House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who is currently involved in pursuing the impeachment inquiry into Trump.
Several news outlets are depicted being killed in the rampage, including Politico, NPR, HuffPost, The Washington Post, Slate and CNN.
The White House Correspondents' Association and CNN called on Trump to denounce the video.
"We have previously told the President his rhetoric would incite violence. Now we call on him and everybody associated with this conference to denounce this video and affirm that violence has no place in our society," Jonathan Karl, the president of WHCA, said in a statement.
"The President and his family, the White House, and the Trump campaign need to denounce it immediately in the strongest possible terms. Anything less equates to a tacit endorsement of violence and should not be tolerated by anyone," a CNN statement reads.
Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke said Sunday evening, "Last year, a Trump supporter sent bombs to CNN – and a shooter entered a church yesterday. This video isn't funny. It will get people killed.
An organizer for the conference confirmed that the video was shown but denounced its showing as part of a "meme exhibit" with content submitted by third parties, according to The New York Times. "This matter is under review," said the organizer Alex Phillips.
Phillips also said on the conference's website it was "shocking" that the Times did not report on other portions of the conference, "Including our panel conversation LITERALLY condemning political violence while claiming to be upset over a meme that was not sanctioned, shown on stage, or approved."

Texto completo: MISS JUNE
At ONCE Ballroom, Somerville,
Oct. 15. at 8 p.m. Tickets $12, www.oncesomerville.com
On the day I'm scheduled to interview New Zealand pop-punk band Miss June, Instagram targets me with a personality quiz that says it can tell me which member of the formidable foursome I am. The quiz declares me a “Chris."
When I reach Miss June singer/guitarist Annabel Liddell on the phone while she's on the road in the United Kingdom and ask what that says about me, she breaks into giggles. It means the quiz is broken, she says. Everybody so far has been a Chris.
It's not a bad thing to be Chris Marshall, the band's bassist, she assures me. “Nice guy, good hair!" she says.
People ask Liddell “all the time" if she's Miss June, but the band is named after the Brian Jonestown Massacre song “Miss June '75," and the name was picked in a rush. The band consists of Liddell, Marshall, guitarist Jun Park, and drummer Tom Leggett, and it formed “about four years ago." Liddell had a solo gig, realized she didn't want to do it alone, sprinted into the jazz school, found three guys who were willing to learn her songs quickly — and the lineup hasn't changed since then.
2019 has been a banner year. The fuzzed-out Kiwi band signed to New York's indie-playground label Frenchkiss Records, their debut LP's sizzling lead single “Best Girl" landed on The New York Times's exclusive Playlist, and the album, “Bad Luck Party," drew raves from all around the music blogosphere. On top of that, Liddell is set to graduate from medical school in New Zealand next month, right after the band comes home from its two-month tour across Europe and the United States.
The band will be playing tunes from “Bad Luck Party," and some unreleased new material too, when it brings the noise to ONCE in Somerville on Tuesday.
Q. How did you balance being a med student and a musician?
A. I've balanced it the best that I can. At the end of last year, I had really worked myself into the ground. Honestly, working all day, every single day, without fail. I was doing the best I could, and I have a great support network. My family and the boys in the band are really supportive.
Q. When you were in the depths of medical school, when did you find time to write?
A. So first of all, I had a two-year break from writing. That was during the time that I was doing all the academia. For med school, you have three years which are pretty much theory before you get in the hospital. I was working so hard, and I stopped writing, but then once I got into the hospital work, I found a lot of inspiration. My mind was more active. And so I used to keep my writing guitar in the same room as my study. I'd cram for a couple hours and then take a break, make coffee, and pick up the guitar as a break from studying.

Q. Is there a story behind your Twitter and Instagram handles, “@ihatemissjune?"
A. We were playing a gig, and a bunch of Jun's friends came to the show. They all made these T-shirts, and on the back of the T-shirts they wrote “[Expletive] Miss June," just as a joke. And they were moshing in the front, getting so into it with these “[Expletive] Miss June" T-shirts on! We thought it was really funny. Obviously, we couldn't make our Instagram handle “[Expletive] Miss June," so we went with “I Hate Miss June."
Q. Tell me about the way that the band writes songs. Are they mostly yours, is it a collaborative process?
A. In the early days of Miss June, I was very much doing the lion's share of the songwriting. I remember we had a conversation about it, where the boys were like, “We want to contribute more." And I'm like, “Cool. Let's try to do this more collaboratively." That's the newest sort of song for us. Some of those heavier songs like “Enemies" and “Aquarium" were riffs that Jun wrote on guitar and brought in, and then I put vocals on.
Q. What inspired “Best Girl?"
A. I am from a tiny island on the bottom of the Earth, and it has a very small population. Because of that constant close proximity with other people, it's really important to be supportive of each other. That's something New Zealand can struggle with a little bit.
I wrote “Best Girl" from the perspective of being a young female musician growing up in a small town. And basically just feeling the weight of expectation, and the patriarchal construct that says there's only room for one woman on the lineup, or there's only room for one girl in the band. And it's this mentality that forces us to compete with other women, and it's just not necessary or true. In my mind it's another form of oppression.
What I've been seeing recently is a lot of marginalized people, a lot of women, rising up and saying, “[Expletive] your old system, we're actually going to do our own thing." The song is about this pursuit of this goal that doesn't exist . . . “If I'm the best girl, I'll be happy, no one can win but me, I have to be the one." Which actually isn't true. There's enough room for everybody to succeed in their own right.

God Is Now Trump's Co-Conspirator

Texto completo: Bigotry, both racial and religious, is the last refuge of a scoundrel.
Listening to the speech William Barr, the attorney general, gave last week at the University of Notre Dame Law School, I found myself thinking of the title of an old movie: "God Is My Co-Pilot." What I realized is that Donald Trump's minions have now gone that title one better: If Barr's speech is any indication, their strategy is to make God their boss's co-conspirator.
Given where we are right now, you might have expected Barr to respond in some way to the events of the past few weeks -- the revelation that the president has been calling on foreign regimes to produce dirt on his domestic opponents, the airport arrest of associates of the president's lawyer as they tried to leave the country on one-way tickets, credible reports that Rudy Giuliani himself is under criminal investigation.
Alternatively, Barr could have delivered himself of some innocuous pablum, which is something government officials often do in difficult times.
But no. Barr gave a fiery speech denouncing the threat to America posed by "militant secularists," whom he accused of conspiring to destroy the "traditional moral order," blaming them for rising mental illness, drug dependency and violence.
Consider for a moment how inappropriate it is for Barr, of all people, to have given such a speech. The Constitution guarantees freedom of religion; the nation's chief law enforcement officer has no business denouncing those who exercise that freedom by choosing not to endorse any religion.
And we're not talking about a tiny group, either. These days, around a fifth of Americans say that they don't consider themselves affiliated with any religion, roughly the same number who consider themselves Catholic. How would we react if the attorney general denounced Catholicism as a force undermining American society?
And he didn't just declare that secularism is bad; he declared that the damage it does is intentional: "This is not decay. It is organized destruction." If that kind of talk doesn't scare you, it should; it's the language of witch hunts and pogroms.
It seems almost beside the point to note that Barr's claim that secularism is responsible for violence happens to be empirically verifiable nonsense. America has certainly become less religious over the past quarter century, with a large rise in the number of religiously unaffiliated and growing social liberalism on issues like same-sex marriage; it has also seen a dramatic decline in violent crime. European nations are far less religious than we are; they also have much lower homicide rates, and rarely experience the mass shootings that have become almost routine here.
[For an even deeper look at what's on Paul Krugman's mind, sign up for his weekly newsletter.]
Nonetheless, William Barr -- again, the nation's chief law enforcement officer, responsible for defending the Constitution -- is sounding remarkably like America's most unhinged religious zealots, the kind of people who insist that we keep experiencing mass murder because schools teach the theory of evolution. Guns don't kill people -- Darwin kills people!
So what's going on here? Pardon my cynicism, but I seriously doubt that Barr, whose boss must be the least godly man ever to occupy the White House, has suddenly realized to his horror that America is becoming more secular. No, this outburst of God-talk is surely a response to the way the walls are closing in on Trump, the high likelihood that he will be impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors.
Trump's response to his predicament has been to ramp up the ugliness in an effort to rally his base. The racism has gotten even more explicit, the paranoia about the deep state more extreme. But who makes up Trump's base? The usual answer is working-class whites, but a deeper dive into the data suggests that it's more specific: It's really evangelical working-class whites who are staying with Trump despite growing evidence of his malfeasance and unsuitability for high office.
And at a more elite level, while a vast majority of Republican politicians have meekly fallen in line behind Trump, his truly enthusiastic support comes from religious leaders like Jerry Falwell Jr., who have their own ethical issues, but have called on their followers to "render to God and Trump."
Patriotism, Samuel Johnson famously declared, is the last refuge of scoundrels. But for all his talk of America first, that's not a refuge that works very well for Trump, with his subservience to foreign autocrats and, most recently, his shameful betrayal of the Kurds.
So Trump is instead taking shelter behind bigotry -- racial, of course, but now religious as well.
Will it work? There is a substantial minority of Americans with whom warnings about sinister secularists resonate. But they are a minority. Over all, we're clearly becoming a more tolerant nation, one in which people have increasingly positive views of others' religious beliefs, including atheism.
So the efforts of Trump's henchmen to use the specter of secularism to distract people from their boss's sins probably won't work. But I could be wrong. And if I am wrong, if religious bigotry turns out to be a winning strategy, all I can say is, God help us.

Texto completo: The 2020 Democratic hopefuls will debate in a state that has voted for the winning presidential candidate every time since 1944, with one exception.
As the 2020 Democratic candidates descend Tuesday on Westerville, Ohio, a northern suburb of Columbus, for the fourth presidential debate, here are 12 fast facts about politics and the economy in the Buckeye State that could help shape the upcoming election.
Ohio is a historically accurate presidential predictor
The state is typically a reliable weather vane on election night: It has voted for the eventual presidential winner every time since 1944 except once, in 1960, when Ohioans chose Richard Nixon over John F. Kennedy. In 2004, Ohio provided the Electoral College votes that put President George W. Bush over the top.
Many strategists no longer consider it a battleground state
In 2016, Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton by a blowout eight points in Ohio -- more than in Arizona, North Carolina and Georgia -- leading many strategists to remove the state from the map of presidential battlegrounds. Ohio Democrats, however, are not yet willing to admit they live in a red state, pointing to last year's midterm elections, where...
Sherrod Brown easily won re-election as a progressive
Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, won 53.4 percent of the vote in 2018, running a campaign that emphasized working-class economic issues.
And Democrats flipped six seats in the statehouse last year
Democrats in 2018 flipped six seats in the statehouse from red to blue, including three in the Columbus suburbs, reflecting a national pendulum swing away from Mr. Trump by white college-educated independents and Republican women.
Republicans have a lot of power statewide
On the other hand, Republicans won every state constitutional office in 2018 from governor on down, in a year when Democrats captured top offices in other northern industrial states including Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.
Trump's approval rating in Ohio is no better than the national average
Mr. Trump's approval rating in the state, now at 43 percent, is not much better than the national average of 42 percent and worse than in "safe" red states. A recent survey by Emerson Polling found that 54 percent of women in the state disapprove of Mr. Trump. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders all outpolled Mr. Trump in head-to-head matchups. Forty-seven percent of Ohio voters support impeachment, the survey found.
Trump promised to reverse the decline in manufacturing jobs, but he hasn't
The long-term decline of manufacturing, which fueled Mr. Trump's victory in Ohio, has continued, but the state's transition to a service economy has salved some wounds. General Motors, once Ohio's largest employer, today ranks 72nd, while the Cleveland Clinic is No. 1, with Walmart close behind.
The closing of a General Motors plant had major repercussions
The idling of a G.M. factory near Youngstown, Ohio, this year cost thousands of jobs, years after Mr. Trump visited, promising that the jobs were "all coming back." But the closure may not sour all the rank-and-file union autoworkers who voted for him. Some white working-class voters are determined "to go down with the ship with him," a union official told The Times recently.
Democrats are losing blue-collar voters
Although black voter turnout in Ohio declined by 7.5 points from 2012 to 2016, according to one analysis of voting data, that does not come close to accounting for Mrs. Clinton's loss there. Instead, Mr. Trump won white voters in Ohio by a much larger margin than the 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney.
The political bottom line: Democrats in Ohio, as elsewhere, are winning over suburbanites while losing white blue-collar voters in places like northeast Ohio. Many strategists consider it a long-term trade-off that will outlast the Trump era.
The site of the debate is turning blue
Westerville, with above average family income, education levels and home prices, is the home of former Gov. John Kasich, a Republican who ran in the 2016 presidential primary, but the community is trending blue. It voted for Mr. Romney in 2012 but Mrs. Clinton in 2016. There was a 29-point swing toward the Democrats between 2016 and 2018 in Senate and House races, according to an analysis by Cleveland.com.
Columbus is on the rise
Columbus, with an economy anchored by banking, insurance and higher education, fits the profile of a Sun Belt city plopped down in the Midwest: It is one of the 15 fastest growing metropolises in the country, and the only one on the list in the Midwest.
And one more thing...
Columbus is home to The Ohio State University. Do not omit the article. And on Big Ten football game days, Michigan is pronounced "the state up north."

Billionaires are good

Texto completo: Bernie Sanders' last stand for his fading presidential dreams rests on a final attack on emerging front-runner Elizabeth Warren from the Left. Despite them endorsing the same multitrillion-dollar programs to nationalize vast swaths of the economy, Sanders has lambasted Warren as a "capitalist," which the Massachusetts senator herself has conceded. Sanders says that he is not.
"I mean, Elizabeth considers herself, if I got the quote correctly, to be a capitalist to her bones. I don’t," Sanders told ABC on Sunday. "And the reason I am not is because I will not tolerate for one second the kind of greed and corruption and income and wealth inequality and so much suffering that is going on in this country today, which is unnecessary."
Although the media has rallied behind Warren, luxuriating in her many bad plans and running interference for her history of lying about her background, they've taken to Bernie's various calls to arms. The pattern is simple.
First, Bernie writes up a new bumper sticker:TweetThen some willing sheep in the media turns it into a think piece:TweetRepeat as necessary until desired effects are seen.
This works just as well with his policy proposals, which are all contingent on demanding a punitive system of taxation.
On Oct. 9:TweetThen 48 hours later:TweetAnd scene.
But now that the media's begun taking the socialist ramblings of a septuagenarian Soviet-wannabe seriously, it's worth asking these two inextricably linked questions in earnest: Are billionaires really failing to pay their fair share, and do they even have the right to exist?
The first question is far more straightforward, and the falsehood purveyed by Sanders' lackeys is even easier to debunk.
The New York Times piece, written by two economists at the University of California, Berkeley, determines the tax burden of income percentile intervals using six forms of taxation: consumption, payroll, residential property, corporate and business property, estate, and income taxes.
Predictably, for all but the top tenth of earners, consumption and payroll taxes comprise the overwhelming majority of taxation. Consumption, payroll, and mostly insignificant residential property taxes are regressive. Income taxes take fewer than 5% of the earnings of the bottom 50%. Regressive taxes still outpace income taxation for the middle class, with income taxation only taking over for the top 10%.
By the article's own admission, its total calculated tax rates per income percentile increase in a progressive manner. But even the calculation itself ignores economic realities to paint a dishonest narrative.
For starters, payroll taxes are not supposed to be explicitly redistributive, even if their output manifests itself in means-tested benefits as well as straightforward entitlements, meaning that they're regressive by design. Social Security's most vocal supporters defend it by claiming that it simply pays you back your money, even though in practice we know it's an effective generational wealth transfer.
It logically follows that if lower-income earners often pay zero in their effective income tax rates while the wealthy pay double digit percentage points, the payroll tax burden will be greater in relation to total income for lower-income earners. The same goes for consumption taxes, not by design in terms of a specific program, but by virtue of lower-income earners spending a greater percentage of their income on consumer goods than higher-income earners.
Transactional taxes such as standard consumption taxes and VAT taxes are good for the economy because they encourage wealthier Americans to invest and save more rather than spend irresponsibly. Furthermore, no serious economist is looking at taxes not even reported to the IRS as evidence of a markedly increased tax burden.Screen Shot 2019-10-14 at 11.20.44 AM.pngNow, look at the graph published by the New York Times, mentally erase the red bars, and consider whether the central thesis still applies. In fact, don't take my word for it. Just listen to Jason Furman, former chairman of President Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers.TweetMoreover, as Michael Strain notes at Bloomberg, tax burden estimates by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that the U.S. tax code is highly progressive. Whereas the much-hated "1%" pays 33% of their total annual earnings as federal taxes, the lowest one-fifth of income earners pay a measly 2% in federal taxes. If anything, the state and local tax deduction cap in the 2017 tax reform law made the combined state and federal tax burdens even more progressive.
Clearly millionaires (including Sanders) and billionaires are paying their fair share. But should they even exist?
Let's ignore the moral case that the state ought not steal from its own citizens with neither the consent of the governed nor any intention other than income redistribution guided by government greed. Does the existence of billionaires improve the bottom line of American prosperity?
Yes, individual greed is good, and yes, billionaires are good.
Thomas Piketty laid the groundwork for the rallying cry of the pseudo-intellectual left in his assertion that returns on capital tend to outpace returns on labor. Even though this concept is taught in the first few weeks of most high school economics classes, the Piketty cry to eat the rich for the crime of having a more efficient factor of production comes at the detriment of all earning classes.
The only real factors that grow economies, other than legal or political shifts to ease trade or relax burdensome regulations, are investment, entrepreneurship, technological and scientific advances, and increasing the labor force. (This last factor is a large reason why nations that oppress women from joining the workforce hinder their own economic growth.)
If you're into Rawlsian liberalism with the end goal of increasing the bottom line, it makes sense to encourage a VAT tax, as Andrew Yang wants to use to fund a universal basic income. VAT taxes discourage the wealthy from wasting their money through consumption (which doesn't really grow the economy) and instead invest (which absolutely helps grow the economy). It's why we want a capital gains tax that's lower than other forms of income taxes, and the same Wall Street investors that supported Hillary Clinton in droves balk in fear of an Elizabeth Warren presidency threatening to punish investment and thus, crash the economy as a whole.
When we let billionaires become billionaires, they employ hundreds of thousands of people and create trillions of dollars of wealth for the economy overall. When we let billionaires stay billionaires, even the most undeserving of them keep gobs of cash in investments, growing the economy for everyone as they sleep.
Billionaires are paying their fair share, and billionaires are good. Don't be bitter that you aren't one. Be thankful you benefit from the returns on their wealth.

Texto completo: John McCain's widow and daughter condemned a fake video aired by President Trump's supporters, which depicts him killing media outlets and political adversaries including the late senator.
"Reports describing a violent video played at a Trump Campaign event in which images of reporters & @JohnMcCain are being slain by Pres Trump violate every norm our society expects from its leaders& the institutions that bare their names. I stand w/ @whca in registering my outrage," Cindy McCain said Monday on Twitter.
Tweet
Meghan McCain retweeted her mother's statement and sent out a couple of her own comments on the video on Twitter.
"No it isn’t - the joker is a fictional character from a comic book. One of the people in this video is my Dad, sitting senators and congresspeople. Please don’t insult me or them by insinuating this is anything like heavy metal. This could inspire violence towards REAL people," McCain told journalist Stephen Miller, who compared the video to the Joker movie and called it a meme.
Tweet
The co-host of The View, 34, added that people defending the video would be outraged if Democrats had made their own version of it.
"Also you’d be screaming bloody murder if something like this was shown at an Adam Schiff or Obama event. So please for God’s sake just stop. This video is disgusting and disturbing and any human with any moral clarity sees that," she said.
Tweet
A fake video of Trump killing his political enemies surfaced Sunday night after the New York Times reported it was played at a pro-Trump conference at his Trump National Doral Miami resort last week. The Trump campaign condemned the video saying they "do not condone violence." His press secretary also said he "strongly condemns" it but has not seen it yet.
Tweet
Members of the media widely criticized the video as disturbing.

White House Condemns Anti-Media Video Shown at Pro-Trump Conference; Video shows fake version of President Trump shooting characters meant to represent media organizations

Texto completo: The White House said Monday that President Trump strongly condemns a graphic video that shows a fake version of the president shooting and attacking members of the news media and political rivals, but that he hadn't yet seen it.
The New York Times reported Sunday that the video was shown at a recent three-day conference put on by the pro-Trump group American Priority at Trump National Doral Miami. As described by the Times, the most violent piece of the video appears to be a doctored version of a scene from the 2014 film "Kingsman: The Secret Service." It shows Mr. Trump's head superimposed on the body of a man who shoots and attacks a series of people with the heads of his critics or with news logos over their faces.
Event organizer Alex Philips said in a statement that "an unauthorized video was shown in a side room at #AMPFest19. This video was not approved, seen, or sanctioned by the #AMPFest19 organizers."
Mr. Philips added that organizers weren't aware of the video until they were contacted by the New York Times and said the group "always has and always will condemn political violence," adding that there was a panel conversation condemning political violence during the event. Mr. Trump didn't attend the conference.
White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham tweeted Monday that the president hadn't seen the video and would see it shortly , "but based upon everything he has heard, he strongly condemns this video."
Jonathan Karl, president of the White House Correspondents' Association, said in a statement that the group was "horrified" by the video.
"All Americans should condemn this depiction of violence directed toward journalists and the President's political opponents," Mr. Karl said. "We have previously told the President his rhetoric could incite violence. Now we call on him and everybody associated with this conference to denounce this video and affirm that violence has no place in our society."
Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the president's campaign, said in a statement that the "video was not produced by the campaign and we do not condone violence."
In the video, Mr. Trump's targets include Sen. Mitt Romney, the late Sen. John McCain, Sen. Bernie Sanders, former President Barack Obama and others.
Cindy McCain, Mr. McCain's widow, said on Twitter that reports of the video "violate every norm our society expects from its leaders & the institutions that bare their names. I stand w/ @whca in registering my outrage."
Mr. Trump has branded the media as the "enemy of the people" and regularly assails "fake news" on his Twitter feed and at his rallies. Two years ago he tweeted a doctored video that showed him assaulting a man whose face was covered by the CNN logo.
The president's son Donald Trump Jr. appeared at the conference. A spokesman said that he hadn't seen the video and didn't know about it's existence before the media reports, but he "strongly condemns the type of disgusting and graphic violence purported to be depicted in the video against members of the media."

Texto completo: APPLETON – While attending Appleton West High School, Brad Smith never imagined he'd work for a big company. He thought he'd be a lawyer, a politician or a diplomat.
"I sometimes joke that, in fact, my job involves all three," Smith told the USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin in a phone interview to promote an upcoming book-release event at Lawrence University.
Now 60, Smith is president of a little outfit — you might have heard of it — called Microsoft.
He's been described by The New York Times as the tech giant's "elder statesman" and "a de facto ambassador for the technology industry at large." He oversees more than 1,400 executive staff in 56 countries, and has testified before Congress.
But it all started, he said, with the lessons and experiences he collected as an idealistic Appleton teenager.
"I've always felt that way," said Smith, a student body president, newspaper editor and school-play pig wrangler at Appleton West who moved from Racine in eighth grade.
"I always thought of Appleton as my hometown."
Agitating and advocating The teenage Smith took a keen interest in the issues facing Appleton, Wisconsin and the wider world, and he debated everything — who should be president or what state policy should be on the ballot — with his mom, Barbara.
"My younger brother in particular ... would always say, 'Stop arguing with mom!'" he said. "And mother would say, 'We're not arguing. We're debating.'"
He brought that love for policy with him to school at Appleton West, where he was co-editor-in-chief of the newspaper, The Talisman, and student body president in his junior and senior years.
As a sophomore running to become student body president as a junior, Smith's chances seemed slim. His parents were "very, very supportive of everything I did," he said, but they "were really downplaying the whole election," because they didn't want to get his hopes up.
The evening the votes were counted, in spring 1975, Smith stayed out at the YMCA until 8 p.m. When he got home and told his parents he won — "I still remember, I got 61 percent of the vote," he said — they asked why he hadn't called them earlier with the good news.
"And I said, 'Gee I didn't think that you were that interested in the election,'" he said.
Smith was also part of a student-faculty council that included five faculty members and an administrator, working to improve school policies like the way the National Honor Society selected students or who had access to the hallway.
"I was always agitating or advocating for some kind of change in the local high school," he said.
Smith worked three evenings a week at Shopko his junior year, and later at Fleet Farm in the summer after his senior year. There, "I managed to drive a forklift into a ditch," he said, "but happily survived."
During his junior year, he made what he jokes was his "great theatrical debut" as the props director for the play "Li'l Abner."
"My job was to — among other things — drive to a farm near Hortonville and pick up a little piglet and bring it to the high school theater every evening, so it could appear in the play."
'Values that I grew up with' Part of growing up in Appleton, Smith said, was that you could hop on your bike and get anywhere in town.
"Your parents never worried about you," he said. "That was sort of the slice of middle America that Appleton embodied in the 1970s."
He remembers, as an eighth-grader, a summer of pedaling off to catch Appleton Foxes baseball games. In high school, the social scene was the Friday night basketball game and the dance afterward in the Appleton West gym.
If it was warm, you'd end up at Dairy Queen. If it was cold, Burger King.
"Maybe McDonald's, if you wanted diversity and you wanted to go to a third place," he joked. "But that was pretty much the range of places that we would go."
Smith said he's delighted by how much Appleton has grown, with restaurants and retail by the riverfront — which was "not ... a place where people went for anything." And he's happily noticed how much more ethnically and racially diverse it's become.
His parents moved away the summer after he graduated high school, he said, but he gets back about once a year for Microsoft's TechSpark program, which includes job skills training and computer science education in Brown and Outagamie County schools. Microsoft also partnered with the Green Bay Packers for TitletownTech, a startup and tech innovation lab.
And Smith has donated money to the Appleton Education Foundation and a fund for special projects at Appleton West. Part of his donations were used last year to enable the witch to fly in the "Wizard of Oz" musical production by Appleton West and Wilson Middle School.
"There's little things like that that I like to get back and see," he said.
He still keeps in touch, 42 years after graduating, with two of his former teachers at Appleton West: English teacher Vira Stoner and history teacher Thomas Fanning.
He credits Stoner's contemporary composition class for helping him place among the 10 percent of incoming freshmen at Princeton who tested out of the English requirement. And Fanning, who taught Smith constitutional and diplomatic history and was co-executive secretary of the student-faculty council Smith's senior year, "really encouraged all of us to think very broadly about what was going on around the world and learn from history," Smith said.
Stoner recalled to USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin that Smith was a force within the student body, "immediately very successful" in student government and debate club.
Fanning described Smith as intellectually curious and "very much student-minded, as far as the rights of students," he said.
"I taught for 32 years. Over a lifetime of teaching, you're blessed when you have students that just stand out," he said.
Smith's ongoing support of Appleton is "a small repayment on such a large debt," Smith said, to the place where he was exposed to the idea that you could accomplish anything if you were ethically grounded and worked hard enough.
"When I think of Midwestern values the way I was exposed to them in Appleton, I think of being friendly and outgoing. I think about being honest above all else. I think about showing respect for other people. I think of being plainspoken. And I think you find those values in other places too, but they are all values — those were the values that I grew up with."
'Tools and Weapons' Although Smith might have never imagined himself working for one of the most valuable companies in the world by stock market value, his life at Microsoft isn't too far from what he dreamed of as a kid: lawyer, politician or diplomat.
He quite literally is a lawyer, serving as Microsoft's chief legal officer, in addition to being president, since his appointment by CEO Satya Nadella in September 2015.
And Smith also travels around the world as a kind of politician or diplomat for Microsoft on the world stage, like attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, or meeting with government leaders to advocate for changes or defend Microsoft.
Smith recounts those experiences as a lawyer, politician and diplomat in the book he co-authored with Carol Ann Browne, Microsoft director of executive communications, "Tools and Weapons."
It's about the tech industry's responsibility to make sure technology like social media and AI is regulated and fostered to benefit people, instead of just pursuing growth at all costs.
Each chapter is rooted in a story — not just stories from Smith and Browne's advocacy around the world, but from history, as well.
"I think I learned at a relatively young age that people don't necessarily like to listen to a lecture but they love to listen to a story," Smith said. "I think this is something I learned in school. I think it's something that I learned going to church as a teenager. You could just watch the reactions of people around you, and you could see when people would sit up straight, perk up, and actually follow what you're saying."
You can see Smith speak about "Tools and Weapons" at the Lawrence University Music-Drama Center, 420 E. College Ave., from 9-10 a.m. Friday. Admission is free.

Biden divides Black voters by generation

Texto completo: While polls suggest Joe Biden leads among Black voters, please read the fine print. Although Barack Obama's vice president touts his African-American support by saying "I think they know me," in reality that support is conditional, more specifically generational, and therefore flimsy and tenuous.
Biden enjoys widespread support among older Black adults, leaving some younger Black voters to try to persuade their parents and grandparents to change their ways and shift their vote for the 2020 election.
Black millennials and Gen Z-ers are proactively attempting to sway their elder family members away from Biden and toward progressive candidates, as the New York Times reported in September. While it's unclear if the attempt to specifically sway older Black voters is working, according to an October Quinnipiac poll, Biden's support among Black registered Democrats and Democratic-leaning independent voters has dropped 17 points since their July poll.
Biden has downplayed this Black generational gap, suggesting the votes of older and moderate Blacks are all he may need to get him over the top. However, it should come as no surprise that Biden has a young Black people problem.
While his age, 76, has been mentioned as an issue, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are also in his age group - and yet their age, until Sanders' recent heart attack, has not emerged as a factor.
But what has proven a roadblock for Biden's support among young people of color is the shelf life of his mindset, his decades-old sentiments on race, society and politics that seem to lock him into the 1960s and 1970s. Add to that Biden's perceived persona of white moderation that tells Black people we should move in baby steps rather than seek aggressive and immediate change.
During the third Democratic debate, when asked about slavery and reparations, Biden responded with references to Black parents unable to raise their children, and by telling them to "make sure you have the record player on at night." At that moment, Biden sounded out of touch - more like a white man blaming Black people for their oppression.
While Obama sometimes lectured young Black people, as he did during his 2013 commencement address to Morehouse College, he was able to get away with it because he was the Black president, familiar with the hardships that Black Americans face. And although Biden enjoys touting his proximity to Obama, it comes off as condescending when the former vice president addresses the Black community about inequalities that plague it.
When Biden recently spoke at an LGBTQ presidential forum, he appeared out of touch with present-day criminal justice realities by insisting yet again that his 1994 crime bill did not increase mass incarceration.
"That act was overwhelmingly supported by the African-American community, overwhelmingly supported by the community at large. Everyone from Ted Kennedy on voted for it. It did not have mandatory life sentences in it. That wasn't what it was about," Biden argued.
Yes, the bill was supported by many Black leaders at the time. And yes, studies have shown that incarceration rates were on a steady incline prior to the bill. But to repeatedly dismiss arguments that the bill had a role in increasing the mass incarceration rates, and how it continues to impact communities of color, is shortsighted.
For young Black voters the denial of the crime bill's effects may bring to mind how it had a part in creating a flawed criminal justice system that allowed for the killers of Tray von Martin, Eric Garner and Philando Castile to walk free while many people of color are serving lengthy prison sentences for doing far less.
A tone-deaf Biden once said that young people - not specifically Black - who think these days are as hard as the 1960s have no right to complain.
"The younger generation now tells me how tough things are - give me a break," he told the Los Angeles Times last year. "No, no, I have no empathy for it, give me a break."
Perhaps Biden would have more credibility had he not been one of the most ardent supporters of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, which makes it exceedingly difficult for people to discharge their student loan debt when they file for bankruptcy unless they can prove undue hardship.
America is suffering from a $1.65 trillion student-debt crisis amid soaring tuition rates. Blacks are hit particularly hard, with 85% of Black college students holding debt compared with 69% of white students. Black people owe an average of $34,000, which is $4,000 more than their white counterparts.
And, according to the Brookings Institution, Black students have three times the default rate. The racial wealth gap means Black people have less accumulated wealth and borrow more than whites, and, as victims of institutional discrimination, are targeted by for-profit institutions.
A new generation of Black voters does not need lectures on parenting skills or how to win the contest for Black respectability. Young Black adults are spending their time supporting their families and raising their children.
They are struggling against the impact of climate change that will hit their own communities hardest, while also fighting racial injustice and mass incarceration exacerbated by the 1994 crime bill Biden championed with pride. Not to mention, Black voters are suffering from a historic loss of wealth since the Great Recession - a subprime mortgage crisis from which homeowners, unlike Wall Street, never received a bailout.
When Biden speaks virtuously, as he did in June, of his history of compromising with white segregationist lawmakers, he harkens back to a time when Black people were excluded and invisible. After some backlash, Biden first said that his comments on that were taken out of context, then he said he regretted the remarks.
But for young Black voters watching the recent rise of white nationalism, Biden's history of being "civil" with segregationists (his word) is alarming.
As the 2020 election heats up, Biden may be feeling confident about securing the Black vote, but it would be a mistake for him not to think about younger Black voters, an influential part of this crucial voting bloc. For them, "President Biden" is not a solution to the social, economic and environmental issues that they face. - (CNN)

Texto completo: Como miles de neoyorquinos que supieron del asesinato de cuatro hombres desamparados en Chinatown, el empresario Hakki Akdeniz expresó su tristeza y recordó que él mismo vivió en las calles.
En una entrevista con The New York Times y PIX11, Akdeniz , de 39 años, dueño de la cadena local de pizzerías, Champion Pizza, contó que fue al lugar donde encontraron los cuerpo.
“Estaba sorprendido” , dijo Akdeniz. Ha vuelto en varias ocasiones para dejar flores y velar en memoria de los hombres muertos.
Además, deja una pila de pizzas frescas para otros desamparados en el vecindario.
Hakki Akdeniz wept as he left candles, flowers, & pizza at the crimes scenes. He own a pizza shop & feeds the #homeless every wk. He used to be homeless himself & never turns away the hungry. 4 homeless men were savagely beaten to death as they slept in Chinatown. @abc7ny pic.twitter.com/Xi1A84ei4v
— Lucy Yang (@LucyYang7) October 7, 2019
Akdeniz dejó una carta expresando simpatía por la comunidad y tristeza por no haber estado allí para proteger a los hombres que fueron asesinados.
Además de ser conocido por sus habilidades al preparar la pasta para la pizza, a Akdeniz se le reconoce su dedicación para ayudar a la comunidad de personas sin hogar.
“A menudo entrega rebanadas gratis en sus restaurantes y reparte comida y ropa todos los lunes y miércoles”, reportó PIX11. “Hace varios años, comenzó a pagar una tarifa mensual en un gimnasio local para permitir que varias personas al día se duchen, y regularmente lleva a los grupos a una barbería para que le hagan un corte”.
Akdeniz, originario de Turquía, ayuda a la comunidad de personas sin hogar, debido a su propia experiencia de no tener hogar cuando se mudó a los Estados Unidos en 2001.
Llegó a Nueva York con $240 dólares en su bolsillo , durmió en un motel de $30 dólares por noche , pero cuando se le acabó el dinero, dormía en las estaciones de metro.
“Tenía grandes esperanzas, un gran sueño. Tenía un objetivo” , dijo Akdeniz. “Pero a veces la esperanza no es suficiente para alcanzar su objetivo”.
Después de trabajar en pizzerías y ahorrar dinero durante varios años, a finales de 2009, Akdeniz abrió su primera sucursal en el Bajo Manhattan. Las cosas no fueron fáciles y a menudo dormía debajo de su horno para ahorrar dinero.
Ahora tiene siete sursales, cinco en Manhattan, una en Brooklyn y otra en Queens.

Hunter Biden to leave Chinese company board, his lawyer says

Texto completo: Hunter Biden, son of Joe Biden, the former vice president and a Democratic presidential candidate, intends to step down from the board of a Chinese company by the end of the month, according to a statement from his lawyer.
Hunter Biden's lawyer, George Mesires, said in a statement Sunday that Biden would resign from the company, BHR, an equity investment fund manager.
The statement added that if Joe Biden were to be elected president, his son would “agree not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign-owned companies."
The role of the younger Biden in foreign companies has been a source of political grist for President Trump, who this month publicly urged Ukraine and China to investigate the Bidens' role in companies there.
In the statement, Mesires explained the role of Hunter Biden as an independent board member of Burisma, the largest independent natural gas producer in Ukraine. He earned $50,000 a month on the board of the company.
As vice president, the elder Biden pressured Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who US representatives warned was soft on corruption and whose office oversaw investigations into the gas company's owner. No evidence has surfaced that the vice president, who was carrying out policies of the Obama administration, was motivated by his son's business interests.
Still, Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani have used the connection to attack the elder Biden, a political opponent who is running for president as a Democrat.
“China should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine," Trump said in a recent interview with reporters.
Trump has his own troubles related to Ukraine. In July, he urged the Ukrainian president in a phone call to investigate the Bidens. The House has started an impeachment inquiry into that call and whether Trump used his role as president to influence the 2020 election.

Pompeo accuses reporter of working for the DNC
Nancy Amons, a longtime investigative reporter at Nashville's WSMV, had just seven minutes to interview Secretary of State Mike Pompeo while he was in town Friday to speak to a group about religious freedom. So Amons didn't waste any time, telling the secretary she was going to "start right away with the tough stuff."
Then, in an exchange that has been described as "gutsy," "relentless," and "a master class in journalism," Amons pressed Pompeo on the latest news in the Trump-Ukraine scandal. She questioned him about the resignation of one of his senior advisers and the ouster of a former US ambassador to Ukraine. She asked three times whether he met with Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani while in Warsaw, and he refused to say.
Undeterred, Amons inquired about text messages showing that US diplomats believed a relationship between Trump and Ukraine's president was contingent upon the country investigating his political rivals. That's when Pompeo lost his cool.
"You've got your facts wrong," he told Amons, shaking his head. "It sounds like you're working, at least in part, for the Democratic National Committee."
Pompeo was in Nashville to speak at a conference held by the American Association of Christian Counselors. As former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch testified before Congress that she was ousted as a result of pressure from Trump, the secretary of state joked to the group that it was "a heck of a day not to be in Washington."
While in Tennessee, Pompeo sat for interviews with local reporters, including Amons, who has worked for WSMV for more than three decades and produced investigations that have led to federal indictments and state probes. Some speculated that Pompeo was expecting easy questions when he sat down with her.

Louisiana governor forced into runoff with Republican
In a bid to recapture the governor's mansion, Republicans in Louisiana mounted an aggressive challenge to Governor John Bel Edwards, and on Saturday, the party succeeded in forcing the incumbent Democrat into a runoff election against a businessman who has never held political office.
Edwards had hoped to emerge with more than 50 percent of the vote in Saturday's jungle primary, where candidates from across the political spectrum compete against one another. But Edwards, a conservative Democrat, narrowly missed an outright victory.
Instead, Edwards, who took 46 percent of the vote Saturday, will face the businessman, Eddie Rispone, a conservative Republican who has aligned himself with President Trump and who cast himself as an outsider to politics, in a general election Nov. 16. Rispone received 27 percent of the vote.
Edwards has appeared especially vulnerable in a state that Trump won by 20 points in 2016 and where the president made a last-minute push for the Republican challengers at a rally Friday night. The Republican Governors Association had classified Louisiana as a potential “top pick-up."
Still, Edwards, a West Point graduate and the son of a sheriff, has managed to remain palatable among a conservative electorate by underscoring his distance on many issues from the rest of his party. He has pointed to his antiabortion stance and has been vocal in defending his record on protecting gun rights.
During the campaign, he also boasted of his role in closing a $2 billion deficit he inherited from his Republican predecessor, Bobby Jindal.
In televised debates and on the campaign trail, Edwards faced off with a pair of Republicans who competed against each other as much as they did the incumbent; Rispone challenged Representative Ralph Abraham, whose congressional district covers sections of the northeastern and central parts of the state.
Abraham received just shy of 24 percent of the vote.
Rispone, who with his brother founded an industrial engineering, construction and maintenance company in Baton Rouge, aligned himself with Trump's policies, particularly on immigration, and attacked Abraham for being, in his view, inconsistent in his support for the president.

Texto completo: Facebook wants to pivot to privacy, but there's a new obstacle in its path: Attorney General William Barr.
Barr and other law enforcement officials in the United States, Britain and Australia are asking the technology company to scrap its much-touted plan to make all of its messaging services end-to-end encrypted by default. The move is likely the first salvo in a broader fight against programs that put users' communications out of government's reach -- a trend that Barr this summer called "unacceptable" and "exceptionally dangerous."
But leaving consumers' information unprotected is dangerous, too. The officials say in their letter that they support a "means for lawful access," otherwise known as a "backdoor" for authorities to enter with a warrant. The problem is that a door for U.S. authorities could be a door for everyone else. And everyone else wants in.
Services such as WhatsApp operate with a universal code, which means the moment the United States is offered a security workaround, the leaders of countries far less free will start asking for similar treatment. Egypt, The New York Times recently reported, has been conducting sophisticated cyberattacks on its opposition politicians and civil society. Microsoft has revealed that the Iranian government attempted to breach email accounts belonging to a U.S. presidential campaign. Create a "golden key" for the good guys here, and hackers might find ways to unlock whatever they wish.
Barr's concerns are legitimate. Criminals take advantage of these systems to conduct their business in the dark, and some of that business, such as child exploitation imagery, is repugnant. There is a tradeoff between security and safety. But the tradeoff need not be absolute. Even with encryption, there are ways to gather evidence, and there could be areas for compromise beyond the debate over a backdoor.
Solutions might vary depending on the abuse being targeted, and each possibility comes with narrower tradeoffs of its own. Forwarding limits could stop disinformation from going viral; filtering tools could conceivably allow users to reject flagged material from being sent to them or prevent some material from being sent altogether. Some believe the way forward for criminal investigations is to permit court-compelled device unlocking for suspects in custody; others believe lawful hacking is the answer. But preventing end-to-end encryption entirely would be a mistake.

Salesianum star O'Neill faces Eagles

Texto completo: PHILADELPHIA – When the Eagles played the Vikings last Oct. 7, Brian O'Neill was still a reserve, in his rookie season as a second-round draft pick.
That changed for O'Neill, the Salesianum and University of Pittsburgh star, later in the season when injuries proceeded to decimate the Vikings' offensive line.
Now, O'Neill is an anchor at right tackle on an offensive line with the third best rushing offense in the NFL, with a running back in Dalvin Cook who's second in the NFL in rushing with 542 yards.
Cook is also a threat as a receiver, with 200 yards, including 86 last week against the Giants.
To O'Neill, as he told the Vikings' website, it's all part of the process.
"If I went back now and looked at the first couple games I played in, I'd be like, 'Oh my gosh. Who's that?'" O'Neill said. "And honestly, I hope I feel the same way next year, looking back on the first couple games from this season and saying, 'Man, I can't believe I was doing some of that stuff.' Because I think I'm so far away from what I can be and who I want to be as a player."
O'Neill has yet to allow a sack this season. Vikings coach Mike Zimmer said he wanted to rebuild his offensive line with young athletic players like rookie center Garrett Bradbury and O'Neill, a former state basketball player of the year at Salesianum on a team with the Milwaukee Bucks' Donte DiVincenzo.
"He started coming on quite a bit towards the end of last year," Zimmer said. "When he first got here, he needed to gain some strength and bulk. I thought as the season wore on, he became more aggressive when he started understanding the program a little bit more. He's done a really, really nice job with our run game, and in our pass game. I feel like he's a guy that has a bright future for us."
'Singing like a canary' Eagles safety Andrew Sendejo spent the last eight seasons with the Vikings and knows their defense as well as anybody on the current Vikings team.
No wonder Zimmer said about Sendejo during a conference call this week: "I'm sure he's singing like a canary."
Sendejo wasn't going for that narrative. He played for the Vikings in their 38-7 loss to the Eagles in the 2017-18 NFC Championship game and was run over on a TD run by LeGarrette Blount.
"I have my own job," he said. "I'm not just here to help the offense. I have my own special teams and defense team stuff that I have to focus on and study."
Sendejo didn't have much luck against the Eagles last season, either. He suffered a season-ending groin injury in the fifth game last year at Philadelphia, a 23-21 Vikings win. The Vikings didn't pick up Sendejo's $5.5 million option for 2019. He signed a one-year, $1.3 million deal with the Eagles.
Prediction There are many reasons to pick against the Eagles in this one. Vikings QB Kirk Cousins typically picks apart their defense, as the Minneapolis Star-Tribune points out. Cousins has a career passer rating of 101.2 against the Eagles, with 17 TDs and only 5 INTs. He has averaged 303 yards passing per game against the Eagles.
He also got a call from the president after last week's win over the Giants, as Pro Football Talk details.
The Vikings have a stout defense, led by defensive ends Danielle Hunter and Everson Griffen, giving up just 14.6 points per game.
But I like the Eagles. They have the best run defense in the NFL, and Fletcher Cox seems to be playing better at defensive tackle, despite not getting any of the 10 sacks last week against the Jets. So if they can slow Cook, the Eagles will have a good chance.
Score: Eagles 26, Vikings 24
Around the NFC East Washington
Running back Adrian Peterson is one player who seems energized by Washington's coaching change when Bill Callahan was promoted to replace the fired Jay Gruden, as the Washington Post reports.
That's because Callahan said his team will run the ball more.
Washington has averaged 17.6 carries per game this season, down eight carries per game from last season.
Of course, the strategy for the 0-5 Redskins might work against the Miami Dolphins, who are 0-4 and could be one of the worst teams of all-time, as USA Today posits.
"I'm hyped about it," Peterson said. "You look at the first four weeks ... totally opposite from what we did last year when we were able to be more successful as a team."
Wilmington native Wendell Smallwood could also benefit.
He had six carries for 27 yards last week against New England, most coming long after the game was decided.
Giants
Giants quarterback Daniel Jones, who's 22 years old, got quite an education from Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who's 42 years old, in New England's 35-14 win Thursday, as the New York Times describes.
Jones threw three interceptions, and his six in the last three games after not throwing any in his first two.
Of course, not having Saquon Barkley, or three of their top receivers, didn't help.
"I don't think it was overwhelming, I think it was just bad plays, bad decisions," Jones said.
Cowboys
For some reason, the Dallas Morning News writes that Dak Prescott's six interceptions aren't necessarily a bad thing.
He's not leaning as much on Ezekiel Elliott, and Prescott is on pace to surpass 5,000 yards passing this season. He has also surpassed 400 yards passing twice this season (he had only done so once in three previous seasons).
Then again, Eagles QB Carson Wentz has only surpassed 300 yards once this season, but he has thrown just 2 INTs.

Texto completo: I should start by disclosing that Halloween is my favorite holiday on earth. I love the blatantly transactional nature of it, the fact that it jettisons religious tradition in favor of uncut sugar lust.
But to me, Halloween has always represented something even more profound: the chance to upend the prevailing moral order.
After all, kids are duly instructed in school, at home, and on television to never take candy from strangers. Yet, on this one blessed night, kids are basically exhorted to venture out, garishly dressed, to accept sweets from any rando who happens to open the door.
Back when I was a kid, in the latchkey '70s, there was a communal understanding that certain acts of low-level vandalism and bullying were going to transpire on Halloween. Eggs were going to be chucked. Pumpkins were going to be smashed. Doorbells were going to be rung then ditched. While I'm technically not advocating for any of these activities, I do remember the sheer thrill of Halloween as being drenched with this sense of anarchic peril.
You kind of never knew what was going to happen, what you might see (some neighborhood mom in her slip!), or who you might encounter (a roving band of marauding teens intent on snatching your hard-won treasure). Would you be the kid who dared to bite into the caramel apple booby-trapped by some maniac with a razor blade, and if so, what would it feel like to have your tongue sheared in half?
OK, that looks horrifying on paper. But Halloween used to represent the closest a kid could get to a world free from parental oversight.
Which is precisely why I find today's kid-safe version so lame.
Back in my day — a phrase I am mortified to be uttering — the idea that a parent would chaperone Halloween was unthinkable.
But in my neighborhood now, it's considered de rigueur for parents to trick or treat with their kids — sometimes whole families dress up together. The adults wind up chatting with one another. The themed costumes are praised. Photos are taken. It becomes a coffee klatch.
Some families festoon their homes with elaborate decorations and camp out in their front yards, as if the point of Halloween is for the parents to gather compliments like so many UNICEF pennies.
As any lawyer would tell you, this kind of fraternizing violates both the spirit and intent of Halloween, which is for children to gather as much candy as possible in the limited window allotted. You don't hang on Halloween. You hustle.
Thanks to shrewd planning and an obsessive awareness of my childhood neighborhood, I used to routinely rack up 10 pounds of candy every year. I would then haul the booty back home, where I dumped it on the rug and engaged in an interminable trading session with my brothers. A full-size Snickers bar for two Laffy Taffys and a fistful of candy corn? Nice try.
These sessions were made all the more intriguing by the sheer diversity of candies doled out back then: dozens of different candy bars, hard candies, cream chews, taffies, toffees, jelly beans. National brands, regional brands — like my beloved Big Hunk bar — even homemade concoctions, like the candied apples that Gary Lahr's mom saw fit to give out (and, hey, no razor blades).
Not today. Parents are so paranoid about kids being poisoned, that most stick with the same mass-market bars. When my kids return home, 90 percent of their take consists of the staid six: Snickers, Reese's, Milky Way, Kit Kat, Twix, and M&M's. And they're invariably “fun size," a term I put in quotation marks because I do not consider receiving a fraction of a candy bar to be fun.
But honestly, none of that would be so bad except for the most galling aspect of today's Halloween protocol: the fact that most parents don't allow their children to keep their haul. No, there's an elaborate system of candy buybacks — sometimes dentists get involved — in which kids are basically forced to trade their sweets for cash or toys or, I don't know, karma.
If my parents had suggested such a scheme to me and my brothers, we would have sought legal remedy, arguing (quite correctly) that the candy in question was work product, and, as such, not subject to illegal seizure.
Alas, now comes the ugly part, the part where I confess to having gone over to the dark side.
Because as the father of three young children — two of them registered candy addicts — I must reluctantly admit to having participated in these desecrations. I have chaperoned my children, have limited their trick-or-treating time, and, most shamefully, have requisitioned their Halloween loot — setting aside a few Kit Kat Darks for myself, obviously.
I can offer no excuses for these betrayals, aside from the fact that I had cavities in every single one of my back teeth by the time I was 12.
I'm not proud. I can only plead that nobody reading this will tell my children how I really feel.

Texto completo: These past few weeks we’ve been discussing “omissions” (you can decide whether these are errors or sins). As an estate planning attorney, I instantly think of “omitted heirs.” And you may think, “huh?”
An omitted heir is a person who would have inherited by law but was not mentioned in a will or trust. A related concept is “pretermitted heir”– someone who was born to, adopted by, or married to the deceased after the date of the will. Both situations have legal consequences, which may or may not have been intended.
Occasionally, I meet with a client who intends to disinherit a child. We always state that clearly and upfront in the will with a statement such as “I have intentionally not provided for my child Badly Behaving Bob and for all purposes hereunder he is to be treated as having predeceased me,” and sometimes we add “leaving no issue” if the client also wishes to disinherit any of Bob’s children (and let’s face it, if the behavior was bad enough those grandchildren could be sprinkled across the globe). This can make clients uncomfortable. But there is a reason for it.
California law
California provides that in the case of an omitted or pretermitted heir the heir will inherit an intestate share (what they would have received had there been no will at all) except in some specific circumstances. In other words, the law assumes you mean to provide for your children, with only a few exceptions, which are:
* The decedent’s failure to provide for the child was intentional and that intention appears from the testamentary instruments.
* The decedent had one or more children and devised or otherwise directed the disposition of substantially all the estate to the other parent of the omitted child.
* The decedent provided for the child by transfer outside of the estate, and the intention that the transfer be in lieu of a provision in said instruments is shown by statements of the decedent or by other evidence.
California law also provides that if at the time the decedent executed the estate plan they failed to provide for a child solely because they were unaware of the child or believed the child was deceased, the child will be entitled to take a share of the decedent’s estate.
Thus, documenting your wishes and intentions becomes important in these situations. And disclosing to your attorney any children, stepchildren, adopted children, or possible children you may have is also extremely important.
Celebrity omissions
Remember when actor Heath Ledger died, leaving behind 2-year-old Matilda, his daughter with Michelle Williams? Ledger’s will pre-dated Matilda’s birth by several years and left everything to his sisters and parents.
His will was signed when his assets were estimated at just above $100,000. When he died, his net worth was said to be more than $16 million. Luckily for Matilda, Ledger’s family agreed to give it all to her and no court battle ensued. Ledger was an Australian citizen; in California, the pretermitted heir law would have given the estate to Matilda anyway, but with a greedier family, a long court battle would have likely ensued.
The family of Michael Crichton, creator of Jurassic Park and ER, was not so lucky. At the time of his death in 2008, he was 66 years old and left behind four ex-wives, a 20-year-old daughter, and a new wife who was six months pregnant.
Crichton executed a will and trust in 2007 and specifically stated, “I have intentionally made no provision in this will for any of my heirs or relatives who are not herein mentioned or designated, and I hereby generally and specifically disinherit every person claiming to be or who may be determined to be my heir-at-law, except as otherwise mentioned in this will.”
If Crichton had updated his estate plan when he learned his wife was expecting, a protracted battle between his daughter (who thought that provision should apply to disinherit her half-brother) and the mother of his son (who had a prenup but fought on behalf of her son) could have been avoided. The court eventually ruled that Crichton’s son was entitled to one-third of his estate as a pretermitted heir since his son was not conceived or known of at the time the will was executed.
Crichton’s $100 million art collection soon went to auction at Christie’s to begin making distributions (and paying legal fees, no doubt).
When is a child not a child?
It is equally important to name those who may not be considered “children” by law. It’s not uncommon for a child to take the last name of a stepfather so that mom, stepdad and child all had the same name and to the world at large they were a family. This is particularly true if biological dad is not part of the child’s life.
But if stepdad did not legally adopt the child, the child will not be a legal heir. The stepdad would need to specifically state that he intended to treat the child as his own.
You forgot you were married?
The laws are similar for omitted spouses. When a testamentary document is executed before a marriage and does not mention the spouse, the surviving spouse will be considered a pretermitted heir entitled to all the community property and a share of separate property.
No contest
If you do intend to disinherit a child or a spouse, you will need to carefully state as much in clear language in your will or trust.
In some circumstances, however, you may want to consider a gift to that person instead. I know that sounds nuts, but hear me out. Most folks are aware of the “no-contest” provisions in testamentary documents — that’s the clause that says “if anyone contests this document, they inherit nothing.”
If you’ve completely disinherited someone, they have nothing to lose by contesting your plan. Instead, if you’ve given them a gift at least they have the loss of that gift to consider.
Let me not omit the best advice of all — implement and regularly review your estate plan.

Texto completo: When will I finally decide "enough" and cancel my newspaper subscriptions?
Will it be one more snarky headline about Devin Nunes?
Or perhaps another disgusting editorial drawing of President Trump backed up by law enforcement officers depicted as jackbooted thugs carrying clubs?
Or another New York Times accusation against Justice Kavanaugh?
Or will it be another hysterical fact-free column endorsing gun confiscation?
The attacks on President Trump and Congressman Nunes have now escalated to insulting the intelligence those of us who support them.
Hillary Clinton called us "deplorables."
President Barack Obama mocked us for "clinging to our guns and religion."
Former Fresno State adjunct history instructor Lars Maischak Tweeted: "Justice meant that two Republicans should be executed every time an immigrant is deported."
Hillary Clinton is still complaining that she won the 2016 popular election by 2.9 million votes.
But just five California counties — Los Angeles (Hollywood), Alameda (Oakland), Santa Clara (Silicon Valley), San Francisco and San Diego — produced a three million vote margin for her.
Excluding California, Mr. Trump beat Clinton by 1.4 million votes in the rest of America.
Some Central Valley newspapers seem to assume conservatives have already canceled their subscriptions so they are free to publish biased news and opinion pieces that only appeal to the political left.
A 2016 Gallup Poll already revealed only 20% of Americans have "a great deal or lot of confidence in newspapers."
Pew Research shows nearly half of all newspaper newsroom jobs have already been eliminated since 2008 — from 71,000 employees to just 38,000 in 2018.
How about some real facts about guns? The 2017 FBI Uniform Crime Report shows rifles of all types were determined to be responsible for 403 of the 11,000 firearms homicides nationwide. Handguns killed 7,000. Shotguns and unidentified firearms were used for another 3,500 murders and over 2,700 people were beaten or stabbed to death.
For risk comparison, CDC data shows 24,000 people tragically used a firearm to commit suicide while drunk drivers killed nearly 11,000 and distracted — texting — drivers killed 3,200. Over 70,000 people died from drug overdoses — including opioids.
I respect the good intentions of those who wish to reduce gun homicides — but they will save far more lives by focusing on controlling inner-city violence than they will by restricting the rights of law-abiding citizens.
Returning to the need for a neutral press, Thomas Jefferson — the author of our 1776 Declaration of Independence — made it clear that he expected newspapers to act as vigilant watchdogs over government if our new Republic was to survive.
The 63 million Trump voters and 117,000 Nunes voters deserve a semi-neutral press —or there will be no further need for a press at all — at least in our home.

JOE BIDEN IS A HYPOCRITE ON UKRAINE

Texto completo: Former vice president Joe Biden has said that in holding up vital military assistance to Ukraine, President Donald Trump "used the power and resources of the United States to pressure a sovereign nation, a partner that is still under direct assault from Russia ... to subvert the rule of law in the express hope of extracting a political favor."
That's rich. The aid in question is lethal military assistance that the Obama-Biden administration refused to give Ukraine.
In 2014, after Russia annexed Crimea and began arming separatists in eastern Ukraine with tanks, armored vehicles and rocket launchers, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko came to Washington to plead for weapons to defend his country. In an impassioned address to a joint session of Congress - with Mr. Biden sitting directly behind him - Mr. Poroshenko said his country appreciated the nonlethal assistance he was getting, but declared "one cannot win a war with blankets."
The Obama-Biden administration was unmoved. The Wall Street Journal reported at the time that "President Barack Obama stuck to his refusal to provide weapons or other lethal military gear to Ukraine, despite a passionate appeal Thursday for help in fighting pro-Russian rebels by Ukraine's president." Why? The administration feared that lethal aid would provoke Moscow.
So what did the administration give him? Instead of RPGs (rocket-propelled grenades), we provided MREs (meals ready to eat) - food rations. As one frustrated former Pentagon official put it at the time, "What kind of message does that send anyway? We are sending MREs while they are being invaded by an aggressor."
Answer: a message of weakness.
When Mr. Trump took office, he delivered a message of strength. In December 2017, the new administration announced that the United States would send the lethal aid to Ukraine that Mr. Poroshenko requested and Messrs. Obama and Biden refused - the sale of $47 million worth of Javelin anti-tank missiles. In May 2018, after Ukraine tested its new Javelin missiles, Mr. Poroshenko exulted on Twitter, "Finally this day has come!" and personally thanked Mr. Trump "for supporting Ukraine and adopting a decision to provide Javelin anti-tank missile systems."
For Mr. Biden to now attack Mr. Trump for a temporary delay in a new round of lethal military aid reeks of hypocrisy. It was on Mr. Biden's watch that the United States refused to deliver military aid at all.
And because Mr. Biden raised the Russian threat, let's recall that the Obama-Biden administration bears much responsibility for the annexation of Crimea that necessitated the delivery of lethal aid to Ukraine in the first place. Russia's military intervention in Ukraine came in the aftermath of the Obama-Biden administration's failure to enforce its red line against Bashar al-Assad's use of chemical weapons by Syria.
Assad used chemical weapons on innocent civilians not once, but 16 times. And yet Messrs. Obama and Biden did nothing, failing to carry out even "unbelievably small" military strikes - a decision Mr. Biden publicly defended. "We can easily say we should have bombed and gone in and taken out their air defense system," Mr. Biden said. "Well, you know, big nations can't bluff."
Bluff is what Messrs. Obama and Biden did - and Assad called their bluff. Not only that, they turned to Russia for a face-saving way out, letting Russian President Vladimir Putin broker a phony deal to have Syria disarm. So it should come as no surprise that, when Mr. Obama threatened to impose costs on Mr. Putin if he invaded Ukraine, the Kremlin called his bluff, too. Mr. Putin knew Messrs. Obama and Biden did not have the will to stand up to him in Ukraine. And he was proved right when they refused to give Ukraine lethal aid for fear of further provoking him.
None of this excuses Mr. Trump's delaying a new round of lethal military aid to Ukraine. But if this military assistance was as vital to countering the Russian threat as Mr. Biden says, then it's fair to ask: Why didn't the United States provide it when Mr. Biden was the Obama administration's point man on Ukraine?

Texto completo: But the department did not agree with President Trump's lawyers that a sitting president is immune from criminal investigation.
The Justice Department asked a federal appeals court on Friday to stop the release of President Trump's tax returns to the Manhattan district attorney's office, arguing that local prosecutors should have to meet a very high legal bar before investigating a sitting president.
The filing meant Mr. Trump's own Justice Department was lending support to his attempt to block a subpoena demanding eight years of his personal and corporate tax returns. The district attorney's office issued the subpoena to Mr. Trump's accounting firm in late August as part of an investigation into hush-money payments made before the 2016 presidential election.
But in its filing, the Justice Department, which is led by Attorney General William P. Barr, stopped short of endorsing Mr. Trump's most sweeping argument: that sitting presidents are totally immune from all criminal investigations.
Mr. Trump's lawyers had made the argument in a lawsuit attempting to shield his tax returns from the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr.
The lawsuit argued that the Constitution prevented a sitting president from being "investigated, indicted or otherwise subjected to criminal process," especially from a local prosecutor, such as Mr. Vance.
On Monday, Judge Victor Marrero of United States District Court in Manhattan dismissed the lawsuit and rejected that position, which he called "repugnant to the nation's governmental structure and constitutional values."
The Justice Department had not previously weighed in with its view of the merits of Mr. Trump's lawsuit, which made an argument that has not been tested in the courts.
But after Mr. Trump appealed Judge Marrero's ruling, the department wrote to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, saying it wanted to provide its views in a case that raised "a number of significant constitutional issues that potentially implicate the interests of the United States."
Even though the United States is not a party to the lawsuit, it has the right to give its views. In the brief filed on Friday, the department asked the appeals court to reverse Judge Marrero's decision and order him to stop enforcement of the subpoena.
The department reiterated its longstanding position that a sitting president may not be charged or prosecuted, citing Justice Department memos dating to the Nixon and Clinton administrations.
But in essence, the department declined to adopt Mr. Trump's absolutist argument for immunity from criminal investigation, and instead urged the appellate court to have Judge Marrero take a closer look at the burdens a subpoena from a local prosecutor would impose on the president.
Mr. Vance should not be able to obtain the president's personal records "unless and until -- at a minimum -- the District Attorney is able to make the required showing of particularized need," the brief read.
The department said Mr. Vance's office had to show that the records it was seeking from Mr. Trump were central to the grand jury's investigation and were needed immediately, as opposed to after the president leaves office.
The district attorney also should have to show that the records were not available elsewhere, the department wrote.
Presidential materials "should not be treated as just another source of information," the department said. "A subpoena directed at a president's records should be permitted only as a last resort."
Mr. Trump's lawyers, in a separate appeal brief filed on Friday, said "the president's claim of absolute immunity is meritorious."
They argued that the framers of the Constitution had recognized the need for a strong chief executive and created a process for investigating and removing him in a manner that would "embody the will of the people" -- a clear reference to impeachment.
"A lone county prosecutor cannot circumvent this arrangement," Mr. Trump's lawyers said. "That the Constitution empowers thousands of state and local prosecutors to embroil the president in criminal proceedings is unimaginable."
Mr. Vance's office has been examining whether any New York State laws were broken when Mr. Trump and his company, the Trump Organization, reimbursed the president's former lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen, for payments he made to the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels, who had said she had an affair with Mr. Trump. He has denied the relationship.
The current dispute began after Mr. Vance's office subpoenaed Mr. Trump's accounting firm, Mazars USA, seeking his personal and corporate tax returns dating to 2011.
Mr. Trump sued in Federal District Court in Manhattan, seeking to block the subpoena. His lawyers argued that enforcement of the subpoena was a politically motivated action by Mr. Vance's office and that its enforcement would cause the president irreparable harm.
"Criminal investigations impose severe burdens on the president and distract him from his constitutional duties," the president's lawyers wrote at the time.
Mr. Vance's office, rejecting the president's arguments, claimed that Mr. Trump was trying to "invent and enforce a new presidential 'tax return privilege."'
The district attorney's office declined to comment on Friday. Its response to the briefs filed by the president and the Justice Department is due Tuesday. The appeals court, which typically decides cases with three-judge panels, is to hear oral arguments on the matter on Oct. 23.
Mr. Trump has challenged attempts by Congress to obtain his tax returns. On Friday, a separate federal appeals court panel in Washington ruled that the House Oversight Committee can subpoena Mazars for eight years of the president's financial records.

Texto completo: The Russian cosmonaut's thrilling feat in 1965 nearly cost him his life, but raised Soviet prestige during the Cold War space race against the United States. Aleksei Leonov, the Russian cosmonaut who became the first person to walk in space, a thrilling feat that nearly cost him his life but raised Soviet prestige during the Cold War space race against the United States died on Friday in Moscow. He was 85.
His death was announced by Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, on its website.
The milestone achievement by Mr. Leonov, a major in the Soviet Air Force at the time, showed that men could survive in space outside the confines of their craft and presumably walk on the moon one day.
His spacewalk, in March 1965, was seen by television viewers in the Soviet Union and Europe on videotape. Later in the mission, a live telecast showed Mr. Leonov and a fellow cosmonaut strapped in their seats in the cabin.
The spacewalk enabled the Russians once again to upstage the United States in space; they had launched the first satellite, Sputnik, in October 1957 and the first manned spaceflight into orbit, with Yuri Gagarin, in April 1961.
Edward H. White II of the United States Air Force carried out America's first spacewalk some two and half months later, leaving his two-man Gemini 4 capsule for 20 minutes.
NASA said in a statement that Mr. Leonov's "venture into the vacuum of space began the history of extravehicular activity that makes today's Space Station maintenance possible."
Mr. Leonov would have likely been the first Russian to walk on the moon had the Soviet Union not given up on its lunar ambitions. In 1975, he took part in a pioneering linkup in orbit of Soviet and American spaceships that ultimately led to creation of the International Space Station.
He emerged from his two-man Voskhod 2 for his spacewalk on March 18, 1965, while the spacecraft was orbiting above Earth at some 18,000 miles an hour. He spent about 10 minutes maneuvering, tethered to it with a cord.
"As far as I can remember, I was concentrating fully, cold blooded and relatively unexcited," Mr. Leonov wrote in a first-person account in Life magazine two months later. "The sight was spectacular! The stars do not blink. The sun seems welded into the black velvet of the sky. The earth alone speeds along."
What Mr. Leonov did not reveal until many years later was that he and his fellow cosmonaut, Pavel I. Belyayev, who was also an Air Force pilot, were fortunate to have survived.
Mr. Leonov's specially designed suit had unexpectedly inflated during his walk, and its bulk was preventing him from getting back inside the Voskhod.
"I knew I could not afford to panic, but time was running out," he recalled in the book "Two Sides of the Moon" (2004), written with the astronaut David Scott, about their experiences in space.
Mr. Leonov slowly deflated the suit by releasing oxygen from it, a procedure that threatened to leave him without life support. But with the reduced bulk, he finally made it inside.
"I was drenched with sweat, my heart racing," he remembered.
But that, he added, "was just the start of dire emergencies which almost cost us our lives."
The oxygen pressure in the spacecraft rose to a dangerous level, introducing the prospect that a spark in the electrical system could set off a disastrous explosion or fire.
It returned to a tolerable level, but the cosmonauts never figured out the reason for the surge.
When it came time for the return to Earth, the spacecraft's automatic rocket-firing system did not work, forcing the cosmonauts to conduct imprecise manual maneuvers during the descent that left them in deep snow and freezing temperatures in a remote Russian forest, far from their intended landing point.
It took several hours for a search party to find them and drop supplies from a helicopter, and they spent two nights in the forest, the first one inside their spacecraft and the second one in a small log cabin built by a ground rescue crew, until rescuers arrived on skis. They then took a 12-mile ski trek to a clearing, where a helicopter evacuated them.
Nearly four years after his spacewalk, Mr. Leonov had another brush with death.
In January 1969, a car in which he was riding with three other former cosmonauts -- part of a motorcade that included the Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev -- was entering the Kremlin for a celebration marking the docking of two Russian spaceships when a man wielding a pistol in each hand opened fire. The car carrying Mr. Leonov was hit by 14 bullets, which shattered the windows and killed the driver.
"I looked down and saw two bullet holes on each side of my coat where the bullets passed through," Mr. Leonov told The New York Times Magazine in 1994. "A fifth bullet passed so close to my face, I could feel it going by. When it was over, Brezhnev took me inside and told me, 'Those bullets were not meant for you, Aleksei, they were meant for me, and for that, I apologize."'
The gunman had apparently fired on Mr. Leonov's car thinking Brezhnev was inside, but his car had already peeled off from the motorcade. He was quickly captured, declared insane and sentenced to a mental institution.
In July 1975, Mr. Leonov, flying with Valery N. Kubasov, took part in the good-will mission in which his Soyuz 19 spacecraft docked in orbit with an American Apollo spaceship carrying three astronauts. The cosmonauts and the astronauts exchanged gifts and spent nearly 50 hours together, conducting scientific experiments.
Mr. Leonov, an accomplished amateur artist, presented the astronauts -- Thomas P. Stafford, Vance D. Brand and Deke Slayton -- with sketches he had drawn of them during joint training.
The cosmonauts were later greeted by President Gerald R. Ford on a visit to the White House and the American spacemen toured the Soviet Union as guests of the cosmonauts.
Aleksei Arkhipovich Leonov was born on May 30, 1934, in the Siberian village of Listvyanka, one of 12 children. His father, Arkhip, a former coal miner who had become a farmer, was sent to a Soviet prison when Aleksei was 3, having been falsely denounced as an enemy of the state, but was released after several years.
When Aleksei was 6, he met a Soviet pilot and became enthralled by aviation. He was admitted to flight-training school, joined the Air Force, flew jet fighters and served as a test pilot. He was among the first group selected for cosmonaut training, in 1960.
He later became director of the cosmonaut corps and retired from the Soviet space program in 1992 as a major general.
Mr. Leonov lived near Moscow, had business interests and spoke around the world on space travel.
Mr. Leonov is survived by his wife, Svetlana, who edited publications issued by Russia's Cosmonaut Training Center; their daughter, Oksana; and two grandchildren. His daughter Viktoria died before him.
In 1969, Mr. Leonov was sitting in front of a television when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first moonwalkers as part of the Apollo 11 flight. Though he knew he would never fulfill his dream of walking on the moon, he saw a larger picture that day.
"Everyone forgot, for a few moments, that we were all citizens of different countries on Earth," he wrote in "Two Sides of the Moon." "That moment really united the human race."

Texto completo: Headnote Silicon Valley shifts focus to profit, not growth
SAN FRANCISCO - Fred Wilson, a venture capitalist at Union Square Ventures, recently published a blog post titled "The Great Public Market Reckoning." In it, he argued that the narrative that had driven startup hype and valuations for the past decade was now falling apart.
His post quickly ricocheted across Silicon Valley. Other venture capitalists, including Bill Gurley of Benchmark and Brad Feld of Foundry Group, soon weighed in with their own warnings about fiscal responsibility.
At some startups, entrepreneurs began behaving more cautiously. Travis Vander-Zanden, chief executive of the scooter startup Bird, declared at a tech conference in San Francisco last week that his company was now focused on profit and not growth. "The challenge is to try to stay disciplined," he said.
The moves all point to a new gospel that is starting to spread in startup land.
For the last decade, young tech companies were fueled by a wave of venture capital-funded excess, which encouraged fast growth above all else. But now some investors and startups are beginning to rethink that mantra and instead invoke turning a profit and generating "positive unit economics" as their new priorities.
The change is being driven by the stumbles of some high-profile "unicorns" - startups that were valued at $1 billion and above in the private markets - just as they reached the stock market.
The most visible of those was the office rental startup WeWork, which dramatically ousted its chief executive and withdrew its initial public offering last month.
At the same time, shares of Peloton, a fitness startup, and SmileDirectClub, an online orthodontics company, immediately cratered after the companies went public. And Uber, Lyft and Slack - which also listed their stocks this year - have similarly dealt with falling stock prices for months.
The lackluster performances have raised questions about Silicon Valley's startup formula of spending lots of money to grow at the expense of profits. (All of those companies lose money.) Public market investors, it seemed, just weren't having it.
"A lot of these highly valued companies have run into the buzz saw of Wall Street, where they're questioning or reminding us that profitability matters," said Patricia Nakache, a partner at Trinity Ventures, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm.
She added that she anticipated a "ripple effect" on private startup valuations that would start with the largest, most valuable companies and trickle down to the smaller, younger ones.
For startups and investors that were used to heady times and big spending, that means it may be time for a reset.
Aileen Lee, an investor at Cowboy Ventures, a venture capital firm in Palo Alto, California, said she considered dusting off a four-year-old "winter is coming" email she had sent to startups in 2015, telling them to prepare for a downturn. She hasn't revived the warning yet, she said, because "I worry about becoming the boy who cried wolf."
Other venture capitalists are being more forward. At Eniac Ventures, a venture firm in New York and San Francisco, the partners recently combed through their companies and identified the "gross margins" - a measure of profitability - for each one, said Nihal Mehta, general partner of the firm. This was not something the firm regularly looked at, he said, but they were inspired by Wilson's cautionary blog post.
They ultimately decided that in future meetings with entrepreneurs, they would push for more detailed financial models, even though the companies are very young, Mehta said. - (The New York Times)

If the Ukraine whistleblower worked with former Vice President Joe Biden, Democrats have some explaining to do

Texto completo: When officials revealed last week that the anonymous Ukraine whistleblower had alleged ties to a 2020 Democratic candidate, two important questions were raised: Who was the candidate? And what was the nature of their relationship? We now can answer the first: The candidate was likely former Vice President Joe Biden.

The connection makes sense when you connect the report to what we already know about the whistleblower: He or she likely had a position in the White House, given the proximity of his allegations. And as the New York Times reported in September, the whistleblower was likely an intelligence officer of some sort, given his familiarity with protocol. He or she might have even been detailed to the National Security Council at some point.

“From everything we know about the whistleblower and his work in the executive branch, then there is absolutely no doubt he would have been working with Biden when he was vice president,” a retired CIA officer told the Washington Examiner yesterday.

The nature of this relationship is still up in the air. But given the whistleblower’s knowledge of Ukraine — as demonstrated in the complaint — it’s probable this person accompanied Biden on at least one of his six visits to Ukraine, as the Washington Examiner noted.

A close, past connection to Biden could have been a motivating factor in the whistleblower’s decision to come forward. And though this relationship doesn’t discredit the content of the whistleblower’s complaint, it does reveal that perhaps the whistleblower had a stake in this game after all.

Or perhaps the relationship was innocuous, as Glenn Carle, a former CIA officer who blew the whistle on former President George W. Bush’s administration, told the Washington Examiner.

“The truth is that the whistleblower would have worked with Biden not in some partisan political sense but as a member of the government,” he said.

It could be that the whistleblower’s complaint was purely professional and not personal. But if the House is going to base its entire impeachment inquiry on this complaint, it had better be airtight. A blatant conflict of interest could disrupt the entire process, and Democrats owe it to the American people to make sure the person whose testimony they have relied on is free of bias.

Congress has the right and the responsibility to look into the nature of Biden’s past ties to the whistleblower. As it’s suggested before, the House could hold a closed-door hearing, off-site, and away from the public eye to protect the whistleblower’s anonymity. But it should at least do something to address these concerns before it moves to remove the sitting president. These are serious allegations against both the president and the whistleblower, and they should be treated as such.

But if the Democrats ignore these allegations and move forward anyway, Biden won’t be the only one with some explaining to do.

Texto completo: Washington • Marie Yovanovitch, who was recalled as the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine in May, testified to impeachment investigators Friday that a top State Department official told her that President Donald Trump had pushed for her removal for months even though the department believed she had “done nothing wrong.”
In a closed-door deposition that could further fuel calls for Trump’s impeachment, Yovanovitch delivered a scathing indictment of how his administration conducts foreign policy. She warned that private influence and personal gain have usurped diplomats’ judgment, threatening to undermine the nation’s interests and drive talented professionals out of public service. And she said that diplomats no longer have confidence that their government “will have our backs and protect us if we come under attack from foreign interests.”
According to a copy of her opening statement obtained by The New York Times, Yovanovitch said she was “incredulous” that she was removed as ambassador “based, as far as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.”
Yovanovitch, a 33-year veteran of the foreign service and three-time ambassador, spoke to investigators on Capitol Hill even though the State Department had directed her not to late Thursday and in defiance of the White House’s declaration that administration officials would not cooperate with the House impeachment inquiry. Democrats leading the inquiry said that order amounted to obstruction of their inquiry and quietly issued a subpoena Thursday morning with the understanding that Yovanovitch would then cooperate.
Not long after, she arrived at the Capitol with a lawyer and entered the secure basement rooms of the House Intelligence Committee, where she was expected to take questions from congressional staff and lawmakers for much of the day.
Her searing account, delivered at the risk of losing her job, could lend new momentum to the impeachment inquiry that imperils Trump. The inquiry centers on the president’s attempts to use his power and the foreign policy apparatus to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, an endeavor in which Rudy Giuliani, his personal lawyer, was a central player. The shadowy effort by Giuliani grew to drive U.S. policy toward Ukraine, at times appearing to sideline the State Department in the process.
Yovanovitch said in her deposition that the undermining of loyal diplomats at the State Department would embolden “bad actors” who would “see how easy it is to use fiction and innuendo to manipulate our system” and serve the interests of adversaries of the United States, including Russia.
“Today we see the State Department attacked and hollowed out from within,” she said. She called upon the department’s leaders, as well as Congress, to defend it, saying “I fear that not doing so will harm our nation’s interest, perhaps irreparably.”
And she spoke of her “deep disappointment and dismay” about the events that led to her removal, describing a sense of betrayal of the “sacred trust” she and other diplomats once had with their government.
Yovanovitch dismissed as “fictitious” the allegations that she had been disloyal to Trump, which were circulated by allies of Giuliani.
“I do not know Mr. Giuliani’s motives for attacking me,” she said, adding that people associated with him “may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine.”
Yovanovitch’s opening statement revealed no new details about Trump’s effort to pressure President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden, the son of Joe Biden. It also offered no details about Lev Parnas or Igor Fruman, two businessmen who helped Giuliani mount a campaign for her removal. Both were arrested late Wednesday on charges of campaign finance violations.
The indictment charged that they were working for one or more unnamed Ukrainian officials who wanted her out of Kyiv.
But she provided new details about her abrupt ouster just as Ukraine had elected a new president, when continuity in U.S. policy was critical, she argued.
Less than two months after the State Department asked her to extend her tour as ambassador until 2020, she said, she was abruptly told in late April to return to Washington “on the next plane.”
She said that John Sullivan, the deputy secretary of state, told her later that she had “done nothing wrong and that this was not like other situations where he had recalled ambassadors for cause.” Other foreign diplomats said they know of no parallel to her case.
Sullivan told her that Trump had “lost confidence in me and no longer wished me to serve as his ambassador,” she said. “He added that there had been a concerted campaign against me, and the department had been under pressure from the president to remove me since the summer of 2018.”
That account contradicts what the State Department told reporters at the time, that Yovanovitch was merely completing her assignment “as planned.”
Even as she was being questioned behind closed doors Friday, Trump nominated Sullivan to be the next ambassador to Russia. The timing appeared to be coincidental.
Yovanovitch said that she had never inhibited any legitimate efforts by Ukraine to combat corruption; instead, she tried to bolster them to help Ukraine combat Russia’s influence.
She was not involved in discussions about the suspension of $391 million in U.S. security aid to Ukraine this summer; those took place only after she left Ukraine in May, she said.
She said she feared that the administration’s failure to back its diplomats would harm U.S. interests, including Ukraine’s attempts to reform its government and defend against a hostile Russia.
“That harm will come not just through the inevitable and continuing resignation and loss of many of this nation’s most loyal and talented public servants,” she said, according to the prepared remarks.
“It also will come when those diplomats who soldier on and do their best to represent our nation face partners abroad who question whether the ambassador truly speaks for the president and can be counted upon as a reliable partner. The harm will come when private interests circumvent professional diplomats for their own gain, not the public good,” she said.
Yovanovitch said she had met Giuliani only a few times, and at least in her prepared remarks, offered no details about his efforts to freelance foreign policy in Ukraine and to press Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Giuliani’s role is now at the center of the House’s impeachment inquiry into whether the president withheld military aid and a White House meeting in an effort to gin up a foreign investigation that would damage the elder Biden, one of Trump’s foremost political rivals.
That Yovanovitch appeared at all was remarkable and raised the possibility that other government officials would follow suit in defiance of the administration’s orders.
Three House committees conducting the investigation hope to tick through a roster of additional witness depositions next week, when lawmakers return to Washington from a two-week recess. Among them are Fiona Hill, who until this summer served as senior director for Europe at the National Security Council and is scheduled to appear Monday; George Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state and Ukraine expert, whose appearance is set for next Tuesday; and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, whose scheduled appearance Tuesday was blocked by the State Department hours before he was to arrive on Capitol Hill.
Sondland has now agreed to comply with a House subpoena and testify Thursday, despite the State Department’s instruction that he not appear, although he would not hand over documents unless the department did, his lawyer said Friday.
The White House or State Department could try to block those depositions, but like Yovanovitch and Sondland, witnesses may make their own choices. Democrats leading the inquiry warned the Trump administration that attempts to stonewall their work could itself be impeachable conduct.
“Any efforts by Trump administration officials to prevent witness cooperation with the committees will be deemed obstruction of a coequal branch of government and an adverse inference may be drawn against the president on the underlying allegations of corruption and cover-up,” wrote the chairmen of the House Intelligence, Oversight and Reform and Foreign Affairs committees.

Texto completo: It's not our brains and it's not our bodies.
Around New Year's 2017, a community organizer named Chris Lambert leased a soon-to-be-empty school building for $ 1 in one of Detroit's poorer African-American neighborhoods. The plan was to pour $ 5 million into remodeling the building, take on the $ 1-million-a-year operating expenses and turn the place into a vibrant hub for the surrounding community, with nonprofits, culinary training programs, after-school programs and artists.
Lambert did not communicate this well to the people who actually lived in the community.
When neighbors learned Lambert had acquired the building for a dollar, many wondered why a white outsider, not somebody from within the community, had gotten such a deal. They assumed that he was the cutting edge of gentrification, that he was going to pour money in and push the current folks out. This kind of outsider exploitation is the lived history for many Detroiters.
That month, Lambert hosted some community meetings to mollify fears. They did not go well. People called him a colonizer. They called his black colleagues Oreos. "This white guy is going to subject us to more slavery," somebody declared.
Lambert wanted to argue back. But his black partner, Dwan Dandridge, advised him to just listen. It's a hazing process, Dandridge told Lambert. You feel voiceless tonight. These people have felt voiceless their whole lives. Just listen.
This fullest account of the episode can be found in Bittersweet Monthly in an article written by Anne Snyder, my wife. I visited Lambert and Dandridge in Detroit a few weeks ago, a year and a half after the grand opening.
The building, now called the Durfee Innovation Society, has children teeming the halls, a pizzeria, training programs, yoga classes. Lambert is humbled by the mistakes he made, but his center is fantastic. Some of his angriest critics have now taken part in neighborhood festivities held in the building. There is still distrust, suspicion, rage at injustice coursing through the neighborhood. But there is also life together, happening every day.
I see these messy clash-ups across the country, wherever people are trying to do racial reconciliation. You realize that coming together across race is not a neat two-step process: truth and reconciliation. It's an emotionally complex, thousand-step process, with moments of miscommunication, resentment and embrace. This is the hard process of trying to see each other across centuries of wrong.
The somewhat comforting truth is that it's always been like this. When you read David Blight's brilliant biography of Frederick Douglass, for example, you see that Douglass passed through exactly these many moods in dealing with his countrymen of another race -- moments of fury and harmony, despair and hope.
Sometimes he was disgusted with America. "I have no love for America, as such," he once said. Other times he was enraptured: "I am an American citizen. In birth, in sentiment, in ideas, in hopes, in aspirations and responsibilities."
Douglass's genius was his ability to balance his indignation at oppression with his underlying faith in the American project. In his speeches he would praise his white audiences in one movement and thunder condemnation in the next. In an 1876 speech about Abraham Lincoln, he both condemned and complimented the man who inspired and infuriated him: "Viewed from the genuine abolition ground, Mr. Lincoln seemed tardy, cold, dull and indifferent; but measuring him from the sentiment of his country ... he was swift, zealous, radical and determined."
Douglass could withstand all the ups and downs, all the ambivalences, because of an unchanging underlying belief: in the natural rights of all humankind.
He constantly returned to the core belief of America's founding in 1776, that we are endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights. Slavery and racism were not just wrong -- they betrayed the divine natural order of the universe. Douglass had an underlying faith in the providence. Justice would eventually triumph. The "laws which govern the moral universe," he said, would make it so.
And here we get to the nub of what sustained Douglass and what sustains people today as they do this work. It is the belief that all humans have souls. It is the belief that all people of all races have a piece of themselves that has no size, weight, color or shape, but which gives them infinite value and dignity.
It is the belief that our souls make us all radically equal. Our brains and bodies are not equal, but our souls are. It is the belief that the person who is infuriating you most right now still has a soul and so is still, deep down, beautiful and redeemable. It is the belief that when all is said and done all souls have a common home together, a final resting place as pieces of a larger unity.
When people hold fast to their awareness of souls, then they have a fixed center among the messiness of racial reconciliation and they give each other grace. If they lose the concept of the soul, they've lost everything.

Rhiannon Giddens' New Album Traces African, Arabic Roots

Texto completo: When MacArthur "Genius" Grant recipient and Nashville star Rhiannon Giddens picks up her banjo to play, she is not just preparing to make beautiful music. She is simultaneously teaching people about the African origins of the quintessentially American instrument, bringing back songs that have long been sidelined and defending minstrelsy.
Yes, this proudly African American woman from North Carolina, who was a co-founder of the Grammy-winning Carolina Chocolate Drops, avidly defends the music that fueled minstrel shows, which were usually performed by whites donning blackface.
Giddens sings and plays minstrel banjo, octave violin, and viola. Her latest album, "There Is No Other" with Italian multi-instrumentalist Francesco Turrisi, on which he plays piano, accordion, frame drum, tamburello, lute, cello banjo, daf and colascione, reflects the common origins of global music, whether American, Irish or Italian.
The recording, which they also released on vinyl, was produced by Joe Henry and recorded and tracked during "an intensely productive five-day period in Dublin, Ireland. It primarily features only Giddens and Turrisi playing one or two instruments together."
The resulting recording "is at once a condemnation of 'othering' and a celebration of the spread of ideas, connectivity, and shared experience. The array of instruments reveals the sonic ties that bind between African, Arabic, European and American cultures."
The album is an alluring and emotive mix of original songs penned by Giddens, such as the haunting introductory tune "Ten Thousand Voices" and her personal spiritual, "He Will See You Through," and a soulful set of diverse interpretations from Ola Belle Reed's "I'm Gonna Write Me a Letter" and Oscar Brown Jr.'s "Brown Baby" to the Italian traditional Tarantella tune "Pizzica di San Vito."
On the album, the musicians trace the "overlooked movement of sounds from Africa and the Arabic world and their influence on European and American music, and illuminates the universality of music and the commonality of the human experience."
Giddens recently told the Irish Times: "It's all about movement, for both of us ... movements of human beings and how we affect each other. If you just look at our range of instruments, where they've come from and how they've traveled across the world, it's pretty amazing. The way that both of us approach music is very similar because we're both educated about where the music is coming from. But when it comes to playing, we're both just playing what we feel."
Her latest venture, which included a stop at the Kennedy Center on her tour, falls within Giddens' mission as an artist known to excavate music from the past to "reveal bold and candid truths about our present."
She has performed for the Obamas at the White House and acted in two seasons of the hit television series Nashville, in addition to being profiled by "CBS Sunday Morning," the New York Times and NPR's "Fresh Air," among others.
Her acclaimed solo albums, "Tomorrow is My Turn" (along with the EP "Factory Girl," produced by T Bone Burnett) and "Freedom Highway," received three Grammy Award nominations. Her legendary work with the Carolina Chocolate Drops received a Grammy in 2010.
Giddens is also featured in Ken Burns' "Country Music" series on PBS this fall and will perform at concerts tied to the series in Nashville and New York City.
Another collaborative project, "Songs of Our Native Daughters," features Giddens and tells the stories of historic Black womanhood and survival.

Attack the press: Biden borrows from Trump 2016 anti-media strategy

Texto completo: Joe Biden's media tough talk is drawing parallels to another presidential candidate: the man he's running to replace, President Trump.
Biden reamed out Trump in New Hampshire this week for running an administration defined by an abuse of power. But Biden's campaign followed his appearance in the early-voting state by sending a letter to New York Times editor Dean Baquet.
In the note, Biden's team accused the New York Times of distorting reality through its coverage of claims the former vice president abused his own position as Barack Obama's No. 2 to protect his son Hunter Biden's business interests in Ukraine. Joe Biden's dealings with Ukraine are under scrutiny as part of Trump's impeachment inquiry into whether the sitting president encouraged foreign governments to dig up political dirt on the White House hopeful.
Biden's confrontational posture, while falling short of Trump's "enemy of the people" attacks on a free press, still echoes the antagonistic rhetoric Trump deployed toward members of the media during the 2016 cycle, and continues to do so in the White House.
It's also a fairly unusual tactic for a Democratic presidential politician, who Republicans have said for years receive more favorable treatment from a sympathetic press corp.
Republican strategist Brad Todd ripped that approach, advising Biden to develop thicker skin.
"Biden spent eight years in the warm media cocoon of the Obama administration, and he doesn't know how to handle the slightest bit of pressure from a millennial-dominated press entourage that is attitudinally on a far different wavelength from him and unwilling to hide it," Todd said.
In the Wednesday letter, Biden spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield blasted a New York Times story from May as having "an outsized hand in the spread" of the "baseless conspiracy theory" that Biden acted inappropriately in Ukraine to shield his son from an investigation. Hunter Biden had a $50,000-a-month gig in Ukraine, sitting on the board of an oligarch-connected natural gas company.
Trump allies, such as Rudy Giuliani, assert Joe Biden may have created a potential conflict of interest by threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees while he was part of the Obama administration unless Ukraine fired its top prosecutor, who had probed the younger Biden's company, Burisma Holdings. There's no evidence of any wrongdoing by the Bidens.
The letter additionally reacted to a New York Times opinion piece by author Peter Schweizer. He elevated debunked ties between Hillary Clinton and the Russia-Uranium One controversy and argued that although Hunter Biden's role with Burisma Holdings wasn't illegal, it should've been.
"Are you truly blind to what you got wrong in 2016, or are you deliberately continuing policies that distort reality for the sake of controversy and the clicks that accompany it?" Bedingfield asked the New York Times.
The Biden camp also wrote to Facebook and Twitter on Wednesday urging the social media giants not to run a Trump reelection ad targeting the former vice president.
The reaction from Bidenworld follows a similar letter it sent last month to ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, and Fox News imploring the TV networks to quit booking Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer, for their shows because he “will knowingly and willingly lie in order to advance his own narrative.” Trump enlisted Giuliani in his efforts to obtain damaging information on Biden.
Giuliani told the Washington Examiner in September that Biden attacked him since he and other Democrats couldn't cope with somebody "standing up" to them.
"All they're trying to do is kill the messenger and silence the messenger. But they're not answering the message," he said.
Dale Weiss, a senior vice president at the CommCore Consulting Group public relations firm, downplayed connections between Biden and Trump's media strategies because "this administration did not invent open hostility towards the press." He cited a letter President Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1807 dismissing a newspaper as "a polluted vehicle."
Yet Weiss added tensions between candidates and news outlets are "now amplified in the age of 24/7 information overload."
"It’s like driving with your car radio at full blast and not being able to turn it down. The tremendous volume of what is seen, heard, and written feeds on each other with fewer and fewer filters," he told the Washington Examiner.

Texto completo: Chinese basketball fans said they might no longer support the NBA if the feud between the basketball league and their homeland continues.
"It’s O.K. to chase the star players," Yezi Zhang, a basketball fan at the Thursday exhibition game between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Brooklyn Nets in Shanghai, told the New York Times. "But we shouldn’t do it at the cost of the dignity of the motherland." Zhang, 24, said she might stop going to NBA games if the league does not apologize.
The NBA came under the spotlight of the Chinese Communist Party after the Houston Rockets general manager tweeted support for Hong Kong freedom protests. China cut ties with the Rockets and have threatened their business with the NBA. State-run Chinese media said the differences between the two might be irreconcilable.
Despite suspending broadcast of NBA preseason games, the game between the Lakers and the Nets was allowed to continue.
Lin Wenwen, a 21-year-old Lakers fan in China, said the situation between the NBA and his homeland was "a shame." He said he blamed, "The young losers in Hong Kong." Chinese propaganda has caused many in the communist country to believe the Hong Kong freedom protests are an attack on China.
Mao Runkai, a fan of Lebron James, said supporting the freedom protesters was equal to racism. He also said he believed patriotism came above being a fan. "The issue of sovereignty is as serious as the issue of racism," he said.
"Everyone is feeling very patriotic," said Rong Qiang, a 40-year-old fan, adding he was willing to end his fandom of the NBA.
Both Daryl Morey and NBA commissioner Adam Silver apologized to China, but China is still furious about Silver saying he supports Morey's freedom of speech.
The NBA has also drawn heat from U.S. fans after a series of controversial moves including kicking two fans out of a Philadelphia 76ers game in Philadelphia for bringing "Free Hong Kong" posters and shutting down a CNN reporter from asking a question about China at a press conference.

Texto completo: Washington • President Donald Trump on Wednesday called a Turkish military operation along the border with Syria “a bad idea” but reiterated his opposition to “endless, senseless wars,” striking a far milder tone than outraged members of Congress, foreign allies and officials in his own administration, who said the incursion must be stopped.
And later in the day, after issuing that statement, Trump seemed dismissive of the plight of the Syrian Kurdish fighters who are in Turkey’s cross hairs.
Speaking to reporters, the president said that while the stateless Kurds had fought alongside American troops against the Islamic State, or ISIS, they had done so out of self-interest, “for their land,” and noted that “they didn’t help us in the Second World War. They didn’t help us in Normandy.”
“With all that being said, we like the Kurds,” he added.
In his earlier statement, Trump said he was holding Turkey responsible for preventing the release of Islamic State fighters who were being held captive in the area and for ensuring “that ISIS does not reconstitute in any way, shape or form.”
Even so, Trump limited his criticism of Turkey, making no mention of taking punitive action, while Republicans on Capitol Hill were sharply critical of Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, for following through with a plan he disclosed to Trump in a phone call on Sunday. And Pentagon officials privately expressed their anger over Trump’s sudden and unplanned shift in what had been U.S. policy for years to oppose Turkey’s longtime desire to seize territory across its border with Syria.
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a close ally of Trump’s who often golfs with the president, said in an interview that he had reached an agreement with Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., to offer “severe” sanctions legislation against Turkey, which Graham predicted would have “widespread bipartisan support.”
“What you’ll be seeing in the coming days is Congress filling in the vacuum,” Graham said, likening Trump’s posture to President Barack Obama’s deep-seated aversion to engagement in Syria. “Obama basically took a pass on Syria and the rest is history. We can’t afford to make that same mistake twice.”
In a joint statement, Graham and Van Hollen said their bill would punish senior Turkish government officials and ban U.S. military transactions with Turkey. The measure would also impose sanctions on Turkey for its purchase of a sophisticated Russian-made missile defense system. Trump has avoided enforcing those sanctions, which members of Congress insist are mandatory under a 2017 law meant to penalize countries for doing business with Russia’s military.
“This invasion will ensure the resurgence of ISIS in Syria, embolden America’s enemies including al-Qaida, Iran and Russia, and launch yet another endless conflict in what had been, until today, one of the most safe and stable areas of Syria and a region experimenting with the best model of local governance currently available in that war-torn country,” the senators said in their statement.
Trump’s step-back posture toward the Turkish incursion is also alienating some of the evangelical leaders who are his core supporters but who fear that Christian minorities in northeastern Syria — some of whom have been under protection from the Kurds — would face danger from attack by Muslim-majority Turkey.
The evangelical leader Franklin Graham appealed to his followers on Twitter to pray that Trump might “reconsider his decision,” adding: “The Turks have a dismal record on human rights & they can’t be trusted. Pray for the Kurds, Christians, & other minorities in this region.”
But Trump was not without his defenders in Congress. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a Republican who often speaks with the president and has repeatedly pushed him to avoid foreign conflicts, wrote on Twitter that Trump “is stopping the endless wars and we will be stronger as a result. The Cheney/Graham Neocon War Caucus has cost us too much fighting endless wars.”
But prominent Democrats also denounced the Turkish move, and criticized Trump for failing to coordinate his decision to pull back American troops from the area — in effect clearing the way for Turkey to attack — with U.S. generals and allies.
At the Pentagon, where more than five years of fighting alongside Kurdish troops in Iraq and Syria has now given way to standing aside as those same allies are attacked, some officials said there was more anger than they had seen at any point in Trump’s presidency.
As recently as last week, Defense Department officials had been assured by Turkish military officials that they were not seeking to launch an invasion of Syria. Nor were officials expecting Trump, in his Sunday call with Erdogan, to open the door for a Turkish offensive by deciding to remove the 50 to 100 U.S. troops in the northeastern portion of Syria, where Erdogan wants to create a “safe zone.”
A person briefed about the call said the discussion between Trump and Erdogan was wide-ranging, until Erdogan, in the second half of the call, complained that the United States was not fully complying with an agreement struck with Turkey in September to jointly create such a safe zone. Erdogan said he intended to unilaterally establish one immediately.
Trump demurred, evidently believing that Erdogan would not be willing to risk the president’s ire. But Erdogan effectively “called the president’s bluff,” the person said. What followed was a scramble to move U.S. personnel from harm’s way in northern Syria.
In the days since, Trump has made repeated references to his desire to withdraw from Syria and avoid the “stupid endless wars” against which he campaigned in 2016. But that has furthered the impression — both in the United States but, perhaps more important, in Turkey — that Trump had blessed Erdogan’s proposed incursion.
Erdogan sees Syria’s Kurdish fighters as an enemy, and wants to flush them out of a safe zone along his country’s southern border with Syria, which has been devastated by a civil war of more than eight years. The conflict has produced an exodus of roughly 1 million Syrian refugees into Turkey whom Ankara wants to relocate into a secured zone across the border.
On Monday, Trump warned that if Turkey did anything that he considered “off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey.” But he has not clearly defined those limits.
That supports the view of analysts who say the real red line for Trump and many members of Congress is not a matter of territory but rather the killing of Kurdish fighters.
Soner Cagaptay, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said he believed that Erdogan would calibrate any offensive to limit casualties that would prompt a major response from Congress and potentially humiliate Trump.
“I would say this is a war that is not a war,” Cagaptay said. “We’re not going to see fighting of epic proportions. It’s coordinated and pre-orchestrated.”
In his remarks to reporters Wednesday afternoon, Trump said that he was watching to see how Erdogan’s offensive unfolds.
“We’ll see how he does it,” Trump said. “He could do it in a soft manner; he could do it in a very tough manner. And if he does it unfairly, he’s going to pay a very big economic price.”
But national security officials are especially worried about how a Turkish offensive could affect the continuing fight against the Islamic State group, which — thanks in large measure to the Kurdish-led forces now under attack — has lost its territorial holdings in Syria but which officials say has been gaining new momentum in both Syria and Iraq.
“We know that terrorism in Syria does not stay in Syria,” said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, D-N.H. in a statement. “President Erdogan, despite his claims, does not have the support of the international community for this operation and he refuses to assure the U.S. that he will guard ISIS detention facilities in the area and prevent ISIS from once again gaining a foothold in the region. I’m afraid we are dangerously close to the point of no return.”

NBCU Refuses to Air Trump Campaign Ad Aimed at Joe Biden; Commercial, rejected by CNN last week, alleges Democratic candidate promised Ukraine $1 billion to fire prosecutor

Texto completo: Comcast Corp.'s NBCUniversal won't air a Trump re-election campaign ad on any of its cable networks unless changes are made to the spot, according to a person familiar with NBCU.
The 30-second commercial contains an unsubstantiated claim about former Vice President Joe Biden's role in the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor. The ad, which CNN rejected last week, alleges Mr. Biden, who is vying for the Democratic nomination, promised Ukraine $1 billion to fire a prosecutor looking into a Ukraine gas company with ties to his son Hunter Biden.
The ad also accuses "media lap dogs" of aiding the Democrats with their impeachment efforts and features a montage of cable-news personalities and correspondents, such as CNN's Don Lemon, Chris Cuomo and Jim Acosta and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow.
It couldn't be learned what changes NBCU requested. The Trump campaign didn't make the changes, the person said. Instead, it submitted another re-election campaign ad called "Changing Things," which has subsequently aired on NBCU properties.
"Our ads are 100 percent accurate," said Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman. "The discussions with NBC had nothing to do with the facts as presented in the ad. We have no further comment on those conversations."
President Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry that stems in part from his dealings with Ukraine and reports that he withheld aid to Ukraine while he was pressing the country to investigate candidate Joe Biden.
NBCU's decision was made after the company aired the spot one time on its cable-news network MSNBC and on its entertainment network Bravo, the person familiar with the matter said.
CNN declined to air the spot because it didn't meet the network's ad standards. "In addition to disparaging CNN and its journalists, the ad makes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets, including CNN," the company said.
The moves by NBCU and CNN highlight the different standards that exist between media companies and tech platforms such as Facebook Inc.
Facebook denied a request from Mr. Biden's campaign to take down a nearly identical re-election campaign ad , a move that reignited the scrutiny the social-media giant has come under for its role in spreading misinformation during the 2016 presidential election.
A Facebook spokeswoman said the ad wasn't eligible for fact checking because Mr. Trump is a candidate, a position that the company said is longstanding.
"In mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is," Katie Harbath, Facebook's elections policy director, wrote to the Biden campaign in response to a complaint about the ad. "However politicians, like everyone else on Facebook, must continue to comply with our terms, including our advertising policies."
The New York Times earlier reported Facebook's denial of Mr. Biden's request.
Not all media companies have declined to air the spot. It has aired on broadcast networks such as CBS and Fox, according to iSpot.tv, an ad-tracking firm.
Unlike Facebook and national cable-TV companies, broadcast networks have little wiggle room when it comes to political advertising because they are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission. The FCC prohibits broadcasters from censoring or refusing to air ads that come from legally qualified political candidates, according to the FCC. Even if a candidate's political ad has false claims, broadcast networks aren't allowed to refuse to air the spot, according to the rules, which also apply to local broadcast stations.
"Effectively, candidates can say whatever they want and broadcast networks must air it," said David Oxenford, a partner at Wilkinson Barker Knauer LLP. Mr. Oxenford points out that the requirement is written into the Communications Act. Because Congress prohibits broadcasters from censoring such ads, broadcasters have immunity from liability arising from the content of such ads, he added.
Although national cable networks don't have to follow FCC regulations, several networks—such as Discovery Inc.'s Investigation Discovery and Fox Corp.'s Fox News—have also aired the contentious spot, iSpot data shows.
"We are not in the business of censoring ads from candidates on either side of the aisle," Fox News said.
Fox Corp. and Wall Street Journal parent News Corp share common ownership. Meanwhile, Discovery's internal guidelines state the company accepts candidate ads from all political parties, according to a person familiar with Discovery.

NO-WIN SCENARIO SENATE GOP IS CAUGHT IN POLITICAL HELL

Texto completo: In response to news reports over the weekend that at least one additional administration whistleblower has come forward to say what he or she knows about President Donald Trump's Ukrainian schemes, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham tweeted, "I've seen this movie before - with Brett Kavanaugh. More and more doesn't mean better or reliable."
Mr. Graham's raw political spinning has a fatal flaw.
Mr. Graham wants to tar the whistleblowers as part of a partisan campaign. But their motivation is largely irrelevant now because the bulk of the allegations have already been corroborated by the rough phone call transcript released by the White House and by the statements of the president and his aides.
So while it's still possible that the whistleblowers are part of some elaborate Democratic or "deep state" plot to take down the president, the plotters are using truthful information to do the deed. Mr. Graham surely knows this but is opting to pretend that there's no there there.
The most charitable view of Mr. Graham's sycophancy is that the president has put him and GOP senators in general in a no-win predicament.
The political hell most Senate Republicans have found themselves in since 2016 can be described as the chasm between how Mr. Trump wants them to behave and how they believe they should govern. Virtually none of these senators can get re-elected without the third of Republicans who adore Mr. Trump, but the vulnerable ones need more than just the Trumpers to get across the finish line. This means they have to attract less single-minded voters who are often more Trump-skeptical - mostly suburban, college-educated Republicans and Republican-leaning independents.
But because the president and his most ardent fans will not brook any criticism of the president, the senators have been left trying to thread a very narrow needle: Differentiate yourself from Donald Trump while not actually criticizing Donald Trump.
The impeachment drama is shrinking the needle's eye even more, and from both sides.
On one side is the president. Virtually no GOP senator agrees with the president that his July 25 phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was, as Mr. Trump likes to say, "perfect." Beyond that, opinions differ, but it's a safe bet that most Senate Republicans think the conversation could have gone better and would dearly love for the president to say so.
Past presidents in the crosshairs of scandal have resorted to apologizing. Ronald Reagan admitted that "mistakes were made" after he stumbled on the facts during the Iran-Contra scandal. Bill Clinton initially denied everything, then told the nation, "I have sinned" and asked for forgiveness for the conduct that led to his impeachment.
Mr. Trump is determined to go another way and to punish those who disagree. That's why Mr. Graham, Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio find it necessary to hide behind various parsing rationalizations. Mr. Rubio's response to Mr. Trump's calling on the Chinese to investigate Joe Biden is now the official safe harbor for Republicans: He didn't really mean it, he's just trolling the press. Ms. Ernst says, in effect, that criticizing the president won't change his behavior, so why bother?
Meanwhile, the Democrats have bungled the impeachment issue. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, in particular, has never missed an opportunity to burn any credibility he might have as a sober and honest investigator. Democratic partisans may like his red-meat rhetoric, but they lose sight of the fact that trolling Mr. Trump just makes the president's job easier. Mr. Schiff's entirely fictional account of Mr. Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian president, read into the congressional record, may have infuriated the president, but it also gave Mr. Trump a talking point and an excuse for Republicans to hide behind the unfairness of the process.
If impeachment is going to be anything other than a partisan protest immediately swatted down by the GOP-controlled Senate, Democrats need to carefully and methodically make their case through serious fact-finding - an investigation that not only persuades at least 20 Republican senators but also a sufficient number of the voters those senators need to stay in office.
Short of that, the safer path will be for Republicans to continue to pretend everything is "perfect."

Texto completo: KABUL, Afghanistan -- At least 30 civilians were killed by American airstrikes that targeted drug labs in western Afghanistan this spring, according to a United Nations report released on Wednesday, a figure that the United States-led mission in the country quickly disputed.
The strikes, on May 5, targeted more than 60 sites in Farah Province and neighboring Nimruz Province, the United Nations report said. As of last month, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan had verified that 39 civilians were either wounded or killed in the strikes. Seventeen of those were working in the drug labs, which were primarily producing methamphetamine.
A statement from the American-led mission in Afghanistan disagreed with nearly all of the report, citing its "reliance on sources with conflicted motives" and the decision to call those killed in the bombings civilians instead of insurgents.
The dispute sheds light on America's current war methods -- relying heavily on overhead surveillance, air support and local forces to select and attack targets -- and the sometimes contentious definitions by which the United States military identifies combatants on an increasingly murky battlefield.
In the case of the May 5 strikes, the United States military said in its statement that its own "exhaustive and comprehensive review" had determined that the labs were producing revenue for the Taliban, and that the people working in them were Taliban fighters and "lawful military targets."
It said the timing of the strikes was chosen to avoid civilian casualties, but the United Nations report disputed this. Its report said that one of the targeted sets of facilities, in the Bakwa district of Farah Province, "were not controlled and operated exclusively by the Taliban, but rather they were owned and operated by criminal groups with connections to international drug trafficking networks."
These differing assessments are at the core of the dueling findings. While the American military sees economic engines that contribute to the Taliban's war effort as legally legitimate targets, the United Nations considered the sites hit on May 5 to be outside that categorization.
The people inside the labs were not "performing combat functions," the United Nations report said, and "while some of the sites may have been associated with illicit activity, they did not meet the definition of legitimate military objectives under international law."
A United States defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, said revenue from the targeted drug labs was directly funding Taliban Red Units, a well-trained branch of the insurgent group that is responsible for some of its more deadly attacks.
After the strikes, the United States military, primarily using overhead surveillance, determined that no civilians were injured or killed. In June, the United Nations sent a fact-finding mission to several of the sites and conducted interviews with 21 local people, according to its report.
With decreasing numbers of American troops deployed in combat zones, a lack of people on the ground to assess the damage caused by airstrikes has become a staple of United States combat operations in recent years. In April, the military command in Africa determined that civilians had been killed in an airstrike in Somalia only after a rights group and pressure from lawmakers prompted a review.
And the fight against the Islamic State has been rife with civilian casualty allegations after extensive American bombing campaigns in cities such as Mosul, Iraq, and Raqqa, Syria.
The United States military has not targeted any other methamphetamine labs after the May strikes, the defense official said. A United Nations report released in June said that 717 civilians were killed by American and Afghan government forces in the first six months of this year.
The United States has spent more than $ 8 billion on anti-narcotics operations in Afghanistan, according to the United States special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction. Officials have shifted antidrug strategies several times over the course of the long war. The latest iteration, which began in 2017 and primarily targeted opium-producing facilities, was called off late last year.
And while opium poppy growth has long been a financial foundation for the Taliban, methamphetamines have quietly appeared across Afghanistan in increasing quantities. In September last year, the Afghan counternarcotics police seized more than nine metric tons of chemicals that could be used to make the drug.

Texto completo: Over three weeks, the man impersonated Nikolas Cruz, the confessed gunman, on social media to threaten and taunt.
A California man was convicted on Tuesday of cyberstalking and threatening to kidnap relatives of those killed in the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., federal prosecutors said.
The man, Brandon Michael Fleury, was found guilty of three counts of cyberstalking and one count of transmitting a kidnapping threat, according to Ariana Fajardo Orshan, the United States attorney for the Southern District of Florida. Mr. Fleury, 22, will face a maximum possible sentence of 20 years in prison when he is sentenced on Dec. 2, prosecutors said.
Over the course of three weeks, from late December 2018 into early January 2019, Mr. Fleury used 13 different Instagram accounts to target survivors and victims' loved ones, prosecutors said. He operated under various aliases, including Nikolas Cruz, the man who has confessed to killing 17 people at Stoneman Douglas, and Ted Bundy, the notorious serial killer, according to prosecutors.
From his home in Santa Ana, Calif., Mr. Fleury sent dozens of messages using Instagram handles that included "the.douglas.shooter," "nikolas.killed.your.sister" and "nikolas.the.murderer," and images of Mr. Cruz as the accounts' profile pictures, according to court documents.
"I'm your abductor I'm kidnapping you fool," Mr. Fleury said in one message sent to multiple people, prosecutors said.
Other messages taunted the recipients about the deaths of loved ones and mentioned the assault weapon used in the attack.
"I killed your loved ones hahaha," "Did you like my Valentines gift? I killed your friends" and "With the power of my AR-15, I take your loved ones away from you PERMANENTLY," some of the messages read, according to prosecutors.
Several siblings, friends and parents of victims filed a harassment report with the Broward County Sheriff's Office in December 2018.
Law enforcement officers traced many of the Instagram accounts to Mr. Fleury's home address, according to a criminal complaint.
In searching Mr. Fleury's home, where he lives with his father and brother, investigators found thousands of images of Mr. Bundy, targeted victims and saved screenshots of his messages on Mr. Fleury's tablet, court records show.
Mr. Fleury admitted to targeting family members who were "activists" and had a large social media presence, according to the complaint. He told law enforcement officers that he was trying to gain popularity, and that he had found a "fascination" with mass shooters and serial killers.
Daryl Wilcox, Mr. Fleury's lawyer, argued during the six-day jury trial that Mr. Fleury's autism affected his capacity to understand the emotional impact of his statements, The South Florida Sun Sentinel reported.
During the trial, his father took the stand and described his son as an isolated and deeply autistic young man who played with stuffed animals all day, according to The Sun Sentinel.

Texto completo: Kombucha changed Maddy Eagle's life, and now she's bringing her brew to Southwest Florida.
When Eagle, 30, was living in Germany a few years ago, she developed a sensitivity to gluten that resulted in occasional surges of inflammation. Sometimes her joints hurt with an almost arthritic pain.
"These flare-ups were out of the blue, and I didn't always react to gluten or bread," Eagle said, "so it was hard to cut back when I didn't always have an issue."
She started researching homeopathic remedies for her symptoms and stumbled on kombucha, a fermented beverage made from sweetened black or green tea that contains probiotics — gut-friendly bacteria believed to help with a variety of issues. Eagle found that as soon as she started to have joint pain, if she drank kombucha, the pain disappeared.
"To have something that you can drink for those issues, like kombucha, which is for most people a damned good drink — it's great," Eagle said.
When Eagle and her husband, Thomas Zeltner, 26, moved to Fort Myers, Eagle started brewing her own kombucha at home. And when Zeltner began selling his handcrafted wood products at the Alliance for the Art's Saturday GreenMarket, Eagle decided to sell a few growlers of her kombucha from his stand.
"I bottled up five bottles of kombucha, kept it on ice and waited to see if the yogis would buy it after yoga," she said.
The result? The yogis loved it.
"People were saying it had such a fresh taste, and it's a milder kombucha than others they'd tried," Eagle said.
"I was like, 'Wow, I really have something here.'"
After a few months of selling her craft kombucha in small batches, Eagle reached out to the Commercial Kitchen on Metro Parkway in Fort Myers to become a member. The kitchen helped her with the licensing requirements from the Department of Agriculture and gave her information on insurance procedures. She also connected with the Small Business Development Center at Florida Gulf Coast University for resources with her startup. Then she invested in a mini fridge with two small taps, and a few kegs. In September 2018, her kombucha business, Flying Eagle, was ready to take off.
Until recently, Eagle worked at Gartner as a senior marketing program manager. As her kombucha business grew, she made the decision to leave. "I really wanted to focus on my business and my brand," she said.
Eagle has four flavors in her standard lineup — strawberry-lemongrass, mixed berries with Cuban oregano (a blend of strawberry, raspberry, blueberry, tart cherry and pomegranate), lemon-lavender and mango-cayenne. As much as she can, she sources produce and herbs from local vendors. Her favorite local farms are Southern Fresh Farms off Daniels Parkway in south Fort Myers and Fruitscapes in Bokeelia.
In addition to her regular four flavors, she also carries limited addition and seasonal kombuchas. At the moment, she's running an apple-spice made with apple, ginger, cinnamon and cloves. Her crowd-favorite specialty flavor is elderflower-mint.
"I've always been really good with flavors," Eagle said. "I can just smell something and know what would do really well together."
Flying Eagle Kombucha is available in bottles locally at Coastal Dayz Brewery, Crazy Dingo Brewery, El Pollo Rico, House of Ride Nature, Nice Guys, Point Ybel Brewing and Uhmazebowls.
Starting this month, Eagle and Zeltner will be making the tour of local farmers markets throughout the week. They're easy to spot. Zeltner hand-built a special kombucha cart with three taps for Flying Eagle's brew, where he also sells his woodwork.
"All of our products are very well-crafted and natural," Eagle said.
"It's really good stuff."

Meharry 'unapologetic' for Juul-funded research

Texto completo: Meharry Medical College this week staunchly defended its decision accept $7.5 million from an e-cigarette company to study vaping, pointing to a mysterious outbreak of vaping-related lung injuries and deaths as the strongest evidence yet that research was long overdue.
Meharry announced in June — before the outbreak became a national concern — it would launch a new health research center with a landmark study on the impact of vaping. As envisioned, the plan would put Nashville's historically black medical school on the forefront of vaping research.
But controversy built swiftly because Meharry's research would be mostly funded by a grant from Juul, the nation's largest e-cigarette company, a third of which is owned by Altria, a tobacco giant.
Patrick H. Johnson, a Meharry executive who sought funding from Juul, said Wednesday the lung injury outbreak shows criticism of the vaping research is misplaced and "uninformed." If this research had begun a few years ago, Johnson said, both scientists and the general public would now have a clearer understanding of the risks of vaping.
"We are unapologetic about this. It is the right thing to do," Johnson said. "We feel strongly that we should be here representing the communities that we serve, that trust us to serve them."
He added later: "It would be malpractice for us to not to wade into this right now when we can see it coming. We just can't stand on the sidelines and not do anything about it."
E-cigarettes have existed as a smoking alternative for nearly two decades but remain largely unresearched and unregulated. Vaping became vastly more popular in recent years, especially among teenagers and younger adults, and has further expanded as legal marijuana spread to most states. Concerns arose this summer due to a surge of severe lung injuries that are believed to be caused by vaping.
As of Wednesday, the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention tallied 805 cases of lung injury and 12 deaths. Thirty-six cases have been reported in Tennessee, but no deaths. No single vaping product or ingredient has been identified as the cause of the illnesses, but the CDC says most cases appear to be linked to vaping of THC products, which remain illegal in Tennessee. Some health experts believe the outbreak may be related to vape cartridges that have been sold or modified on the black market.
Concern about the outbreak has seized the nation, prompting President Donald Trump to announce last month he planned to ban the sale of most flavored e-cigarette products. Juul later announced it removed its CEO and would halt most advertising and lobbying efforts related to its e-cigarette products.
But, at Meharry, the Juul-funded work is just beginning.
Johnson said the college is narrowing its search for a "world-class investigator" to lead the Center for the Study of Social Determinants of Health that will conduct the vaping research. Currently, the center is mostly funded with Juul's dollars, Johnson said, but Meharry is pursuing more money that should eventually outsize the grant from Juul.
The vaping outbreak also prompted Meharry to consider expanding its research, Johnson said. Initially, the Juul-funded study was envisioned to focus exclusively on nicotine vaping, but Johnson said the college is interested in researching THC and CBD vaping and the health impacts of counterfeit and black-market vape products.
Meharry, Juul, backlash and trust Juul's research grant drew criticism long before vaping illness worried the nation.
After the initial announcement in June, the New York Times reported vehement backlash from African American health experts and activists. Meharry President James Hildreth responded to criticism with a guest column in The Tennessean, insisting that the college knew "who we are dealing with" and "what we are getting into."
"As the president of Meharry," Hildreth wrote, "I am determined that, this time, we will be engaged on the forefront as our nation grapples with the emerging e-cigarette industry and its implications, including its allure for youth."
A few Meharry students and anti-tobacco activists opposed the Juul grant money during a town hall meeting held on campus in August. By accepting money from Juul, critics said, the college was participating in the tobacco industry's longstanding strategy of marketing specifically to black people.
"It essentially carries on the same playbook for the tobacco industry for the black community," said Phil Gardiner, an official from the University of California's Tobacco Related Disease Research Program. "It's really the people who are doing the main killing of black folk, essentially, buying a lot of evil science."
Johnson defended the grant at the forum, insisting Meharry could still produce independent research on vaping even if it took money from Juul. Historically, black people are among the last to benefit from health research, Johnson said, but this grant would allow Meharry — and by extension, black communities — to lead the way.
"My community is not going to be the last to know if its good or bad," Johnson told a crowd at the forum. "If it is devastating, I want to tell everybody to run from day one."
During his interview with The Tennessean last week, Johnson said the criticism of Meharry's decision was outsized in an academic world where industry-funded research is common.
Johnson said universities that are larger and predominately white often take donations or research funding from tobacco companies and opioid manufacturers, but aren't met with the same distrust.
Johnson, who is black, said he believes at least part of the difference is race.
"I've received more calls for interviews and we've received countless numbers of emails that questioned whether Meharry has the ability to do the same as our counterparts around this country," Johnson said. "The outlier of that is, which institution primarily employs and trains people who look like me?"

When Trump gets his alligator

Texto completo: If Watergate became, for Richard Nixon, a cancer on his presidency, then Donald Trump's Ukraine scandal is shaping up as something different: It's an alligator in his White House.
The alligator, for readers who missed its recent moment in the news cycle, is the predatory beast that the president reportedly wanted to swim hungrily in a moat along our southern border, sharing the waters with poisonous snakes, shadowed by spiked-tipped walls above.
But alligator mississippiensis is also a useful condensed symbol of how the Trump administration has survived Trump's own deeply unpresidential conduct: Because most of the time, when the president asks for an alligator, the people around him figure out a way to make sure the sharp-toothed reptile doesn't actually show up.
Their strategies have been various. Sometimes the president says "alligator!" and you just ignore him, which is how you get the spectacle of the man notionally in charge of the executive branch shouting "treason!" at his enemies with no discernible result.
The other day my colleague James Poniewozik wondered at the way that some of the president's defenders "seem to feel he should be treated like any person who watches TV news, gets worked up and blows off steam, not like a president making statements backed by the power of the U.S. government." But this isn't just how his apologists regard him; it's how his subordinates often manage him, signaling through their actions that his statements really are just rage-tweets, that the power of the government is not in fact behind them.
Of course that approach doesn't always work; sometimes the president asks you something directly instead of just yelling into the social-media void. Then you need delaying strategies, a promise to look into it, an "alligator cost estimate" proposal that will unfortunately never make its way through the bureaucracy.
Or you can give him some other lizard - ideally a gecko or a bearded dragon, but a Cuvier's dwarf caiman if you must - and tell him, Here's the alligator you wanted, sir!
If the president thinks that voter fraud cost him the popular vote, you create a voter fraud commission that will subsequently dissolve. If the president wants a "Muslim ban," you settle on a dumb but modest travel ban that leaves most of the world's Muslim countries untouched. If the president wants a bargain with North Korea no matter the strategic cost, let him have a handshake in the DMZ. If the president wants to leave NAFTA, you come up with a way to keep the deal but tweak it and rename it.
And if all else fails - well, sometimes you'll write up the alligator requisition orders and steal them off his desk.
The two biggest disasters in Trump's presidency have both been cases where these guardrails collapsed, and the president actually got his way in full. He actually fired James Comey, setting in motion the probe whose workings dominated his first term, and his Homeland Security apparatus actually separated thousands of migrant children from their families, creating the biggest moral scandal of his presidency.
But in other cases, he has been protected by the "don't-give-him-the-alligator" operations all around him. Indeed, the ultimate fizzle of the Mueller report was possible because that report ended up documenting a president whose staff let him rant about obstructing justice, but then - in Mueller's own words - mostly "declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests."
With the Ukraine scandal, though, this protection has broken down again. (Not least because in Rudy Giuliani, Trump found an adviser even more enthusiastic about alligators than his boss.) The quest to get Ukraine's government to reopen an investigation that would touch the Biden family wasn't just a wish that Trump expressed; it was a policy objective that, however reluctantly and haphazardly, the U.S. government seems to have pursued. Trump's now-publicized conversation with the Ukrainian prime minister was itself an act of foreign policy, not just a spitballing conversation, and, whatever its intentions, so was the delay of military aid. We can't see the full body of the alligator, but you can see it moving in the water; it's right there.
Now clearly people around Trump still believed that they weren't going all the way to Alligatortown with Rudy, and maybe when we see the full shape of things, it will be clear that the president's men did actually prevent the most explicitly Biden-focused quid pro quo from taking shape. In which case there will be defenses of Trump that say, in effect: Look, he wanted an alligator, and we let one thrash around in the water for a while, but we always kept it on a leash.
I expect that will be the defense offered, eventually, by pained Republican senators voting to acquit - that this was bad behavior but happily the president's diplomats kept things from reaching the level of an impeachable offense.
The only difficulty will be that Trumpland will probably spend the next few months making a different argument: Actually, alligators are great.

Texto completo: Inquiries were being made in 1919 in this and adjourning counties as to the whereabouts of Tim Bennett, who was last seen sitting in front of the grocery store of his brother Frank Bennett at Masonville. No reason is given for the strange disappearance of Mr. Bennett, who was a man of good habits and has been working at this brother's store. After the store had closed Saturday night, Bennett and several neighbors sat on the steps until midnight. Clarence Burdette was the last man to leave and was the last man to see and talk to the missing man. Mr. Bennett said nothing about going away. Several years ago, Mr. Bennett was badly wounded by being shot in the head by a man in Arizona. It is thought that his injury may be the cause of this strange conduct.
• Oct. 7, 1919, delegates of the Daviess County post of the American Legion have returned from the state convention held in Louisville. They report that the convention went on record as approving proposed legislation to provide extra compensation for all soldiers, sailors and Marines who served during the world war. Also, a resolution was passed asking the state legislature to provide free tuition in the state university and normal schools for all ex-servicemen.
• Oct. 8, one of the offenders who will be tried in Judge Well's court this morning will be May Hayden. Her trial was set for last Saturday but she failed to appear before the court. On Friday, she was taken to the Mary Kendall Home by the probation officer, being deemed a delinquent, dependent and neglected child. Her mother works at a hamburger stand and the girl has been left to do her own bidding.
• Oct. 9, for some time the former pupils of the late Dr. Wayland Alexander have been discussing plans for a drive for a memorial fund. They are contemplating holding a meeting in Owensboro in the near future for the purpose of perfecting and beginning active work. Dr. Alexander was one of the most noted educators of Western Kentucky and perhaps instructed more girls and boys than any other teacher in this section of the state. He taught for more than 50 years.
• Oct. 10, prior to the annual memorial service with nearly 8,000 persons assembled, the resolutions committee of the Confederate Veterans presented in its report a memorial to the United States Senate, urging speedy ratification of the peace treaty without amendment of textual reservations. Another resolution proposed to change the name of the war of 1861-1865 from the "Civil War" to the "Confederate War " on the grounds that the Confederate states had separated from the nation.
• Oct. 11, a new company to handle automobiles and operate a garage will be formed here in the near future it was announced after Andrew Bresler closed the deal for the purchase of the livery stable on Allen Street, occupied by J. W. Ellis. The building will be remodeled and made into an up-to-date garage. A new front will be constructed on the right side of the building. The name of the new company or the line of cars it will handle has not been decided upon.
50 Years Ago
• Oct. 7, 1969, Barry Altman found that an act of kindness toward a stray dog can be dangerous. He was bitten after he placed a dish of water out for the stray dog as he tried to separate his dog and the stray after the two hounds became entangled in a fight over the water dish. Altman said he was not sure he was bitten by the stray or his own dog.
see history/page b3
• Oct. 8, General Electric Tube Department employees went on strike for the first time in a quarter of a century with a grievance on re-employment of persons on sick leave listed as the question at issue. The strike came after production was virtually shut down by a wildcat strike over a seniority question in the grid section, which announced a layoff of 200 persons effective Monday.
• Oct. 9, Jessie Hopwood Hughes, the Lewisport native who spent most of her life evaluating and recommending other people's books, will be in Owensboro with a book of her own. Titled "My Son Francis," the 179-page fictionalized biography of the "real" Francis Newberry of 18th century England has received critical acclaim. The New York Times called it fabulous reading for youths and adults. Mrs. Hughes will be the guest of honor at an autograph tea in the auditorium of the Owensboro Public Library.
• Oct. 10, for the first time, the Kentucky Ornithological Society, a branch of zoology dealing with birds, will hold its annual meeting in Owensboro. About 100 members are expected to register at Gabe's Inn. The 46th annual meeting of KOS will meet at the Owensboro Area Museum. This evening, four papers will be presented by members. These will include an illustrated talk on nighthawks, nesting practices of Western Kentucky cliff swallows and birds of the Eastern Kentucky mountains.

Nevius: A’s ready for a ballpark, but Oakland isn’t

Texto completo: I am concerned about baseball in Oakland. I am not sure the city can keep its team.
Oh come on, you say, just because the A’s lost (another) do-or-die playoff game? And what do you mean, no support? Did you see that crowd? Over 54,000. A wild-card playoff record.
All true. There’s a lot to like, beginning with the team.
The A’s are young, fresh and personable. If you wanted to pick an up-and-coming group on whose bandwagon to jump, this would be the call.
And they win. This year they went 97-65. That would have won the National League Central and tied for first in the NL East. And this is the second straight year they’ve won 97 games.
As for seeing the crowd. Yes, I was there. It was loud, proud and they were still chanting, “Let’s go . . . Oak-land!” in the bottom of the ninth. In a gut-punch of a game, one that seemed over after the fifth pitch, that was impressive.
I just have one question.
Where have you been?
In his postgame interview, manager Bob Melvin made a conscious effort to praise the turnout. He added that they draw large crowds at other times.
“We see it in fireworks nights and big series,” he said. “They come out for us.”
OK, so they like fireworks. And seeing the Yankees. Opening Day.
How about baseball? Do they like baseball? Because on a typical Wednesday afternoon game, the ballpark looks empty and Candlestick-ian. There are plenty of seats available and feel free to choose one closer to the action.
Before the wild-card game I was talking to a savvy baseball insider who said something that gave me a little chill.
“I question the market,” he said.
Meaning that all those years of low attendance may be telling us something. This isn’t baseball territory. Worse yet, he had facts to back it up.
This year the A’s introduced an innovative ticket plan called A’s Access. You could buy an entire season at rock bottom prices. In a recent New York Times story, the reporter said he paid $384 for the season, which also includes $10 parking and half off concessions. For an 81-game home season, that’s roughly $5 a game.
“They are,” my baseball savant said, “essentially giving tickets away.”
The result? Attendance was up some 88,000 for the season, Fine, but it works out to an average increase of about 1,100 fans a game. Which in the cavernous 46,867-seat Coliseum, doesn’t really move the needle.
Granted, the plan helped the A’s draw nearly 1.7 million. But that’s still 24th in baseball. The Giants attracted a million more fans and they are fretting about declining attendance.
Now loyal A’s fans are already writing angry emails. They support their team passionately, they’ll say.
OK then, you know what you should do? Go to Oakland City Council meetings. Turn out in numbers and make it clear to the council that their constituents support the new ballpark.
Because you know the ideologically pure and reality-challenged Oakland City Council. On the eve of the playoff game, they filed a lawsuit to block the sale of half of the Coliseum property to the A’s. It was the height of cluelessness.
Before the game, A’s President Dave Kaval was pacing the third-base line, exasperated. At the time no one, including Kaval, knew what was going to happen with the legal challenge.
They were “blindsided” by the suit, he fulminated. And to do it now, “just as we are in into the playoffs? Unbelievable.”
He’s not wrong. The city council seems to think the A’s are some sketchy group trying to pull a fast one during construction of a sports structure.
No, that was the Raiders. And that little trip to the cleaners cost the city millions.
This is different. A chance to build a legacy project in downtown Oakland. If anything can revitalize the fan base, it is a new stadium.
And by the way, take a stroll through Jack London Square. There’s an example of urban renewal that went nowhere. You know what it needs? An anchor tenant that would attract thousands of people. Like a ballpark.
The lawsuit traces a complicated path that eventually leads to the lack of affordable housing.
But make no mistake. The effect is to once again stop the Howard Street ballpark project. The A’s developing part of the Coliseum site is the financial linchpin for the new downtown facility. Without that land, the deal is dead.
Major League Baseball moves in slow and ponderous ways, but it seems to have finally roused itself to life. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred told Chronicle reporter Susan Slusser that he’d met with City Council President Rebecca Kaplan and told her “It’s time for the city of Oakland to show concrete progress” on a stadium.
Will that be enough to get things going? Who knows? So far the council has set records for inaction and posturing. They need to hear from loud, loyal A’s fans.
Otherwise, we refer you to another stat from the New York Times story. In a 30-year period, 24 of the 30 MLB teams have moved to new ballparks.
Eventually, one way or another, the A’s will be one of them.
Will it be in Oakland? I am having doubts.

Leigh Bardugo makes adult debut in dark fantasy 'Ninth House'

Resumen: "Shadow and Bone" author Leigh Bardugo makes the leap from YA in her first adult novel, "Ninth House," a dark fantasy that explores class and magic.

Texto completo: Fans of Leigh Bardugo's young adult work will recognize her artistic prose, cutting and witty characters and dark fantasy world building in her first adult novel, "Ninth House" (Flatiron, 480 pp. , ★★★½ out of four stars).
Bardugo is an acclaimed fantasy novelist, whose YA work "Shadow and Bone" is being adapted into a highly anticipated Netflix series. Those not familiar with Bardugo, or even YA literature, will still be delighted by this dark novel.
Set on the campus of Yale, "Ninth House" imagines that the school's secret societies are no longer just boys clubs but groups that create dark magic to manipulate stock markets and The New York Times bestseller list, see into the future and more. Alex Stern is a freshman when she enters Yale’s dangerous Lethe House, one of nine secret societies that practice magic; it polices the other houses on campus.
Alex is not another privileged student from a wealthy or even middle-class family. In fact, Alex would have never entered Lethe House or even stepped into the Ivy League world if not for the fact that she can see ghosts, or “Greys,” as they are called. If anything, Alex would have been another victim of the opioid epidemic if the members of Lethe had never found her in the hospital and invited her to Yale.
She is mentored by Darlington, a upperclassman who trains Alex in the dark arts until he mysteriously disappears at the end of her first semester. If that wasn’t bad enough, just as the spring semester starts, a young lower-income woman from New Haven, Connecticut, is discovered dead on campus. As part of Lethe House, Alex must investigate whether the murder and disappearance of Darlington have anything to do with the magic that lurks on campus.
More: 'The Giver of Stars' is Jojo Moyes' stellar celebration of the power of reading
"Ninth House" is as much a fantasy murder-mystery as it is an exploration of white privilege, corruption, misogyny and trauma. Bardugo highlights the vast gap between the lower-income neighborhoods that surround the campus and the toxic wealth hoarding of the school's most privileged students. New Haven itself is a character in the novel, one that never willingly bends to magic or wealth even as it drastically changes through gentrification.
The novel alternates between Alex's and Darlington's perspectives from the first semester to the second in Alex’s first year. As Alex sees the opportunity of a safe, more stable life for herself, she might have to trade it all for the truth.
"Ninth House" sometimes loses its characters' voices in the dense plot. The theme of privilege is so interwoven throughout the story that the book challenges readers to examine their own environment without being overtly on the nose. It helps that Alex is a straight-shooting, instinct-driven character who understands the game she is in more than the gamemakers themselves.

Did President Trump commit treason?

Texto completo: Let's say we had a president who did the following: Redistributed wealth by taxing the rich and giving to the poor. Boosted entitlements. Signed a law to strengthen workplace safety. Poured money into cleaning up the environment. Even helped finance National Public Radio. Liberals would be pleased, right?
We did have such a president. His name was Richard Nixon.
Of course, all this is largely forgotten today, overshadowed by Nixon's involvement in Watergate – the scandal that drove him from the Oval Office in 1974, as House impeachment and possibly even Senate conviction were nipping at his heels.
Because of this mixed legacy, Nixon ranks as the 28th best president in a 2017 C-SPAN survey of historians. In 10 categories, he scores near the middle for most, though 10th for "International Relations." But in terms of "Moral Authority" he's near the bottom, ranked 42nd.
President Donald Trump will be included in the next survey, which is taken every time we have a new president. Where do you think he'll rank? For starters, let's compare his actions with all the Nixon accomplishments mentioned above.
Trump is the anti-Nixon. After lying through his teeth in 2017 about how "the rich will not be gaining at all with this plan," he gave them (and himself) a huge tax break.
Entitlements? He has reportedly told Senate Republicans that cutting Social Security and Medicare could be a second-term project. We got a preview of his plans to do just that in his 2020 budget blueprint.
Strengthen workplace safety? "We want to protect our workers," Trump said in 2017. But that was another lie. His administration has rolled back worker protections, making already dangerous jobs like coal mining, working on oil rigs and in meat processing plants even more so.
And cleaning up the environment? Nixon proposed a new Environmental Protection Agency in July 1970, and it began operations five months later. Trump has gutted it, and when he brags about all the regulations he has cut – to the wild applause of his base – what he's not telling them is that he is endangering the air they breathe and the water they drink.
There's more, but you get the point: Trump is worse than Nixon. And I haven't even gotten to the scandals. What Trump has done is far more damaging to our country. To me, it can be summed up from just one event: his infamous meeting in the Oval Office in May 2017 with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.
It was bad enough that Trump revealed highly classified information that, according to two unnamed officials cited in The New York Times, exposed an intelligence source in the Middle East. But we've since learned – based on three sources obtained by The Washington Post – that Trump told his Kremlin guests he didn't care that the Russians had interfered in our 2016 election.
An enemy attacks us and our commander in chief doesn't care? If this is true then I will use, for the first time, a word that distresses me deeply: treason. This isn't just my view. Article 3, Section 3 of our beloved Constitution says: "Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort."
The Russians attacked us. If the commander in chief who swore to defend us said it didn't bother him, this is "giving them aid and comfort." The Russians are surely gearing up for more mayhem in 2020, and what does Trump care? Treason.
Now we learn that Trump has leaned on foreign governments like Ukraine and Australia to dig up dirt that would help him politically. For all his dirty tricks, Richard Nixon never would have dreamed of doing that.
Trump is a man with no ethical compass or shred of decency. Worse than Nixon? Worse in every way. And worse than all the rest.

Texto completo: Readers offer Joe Biden a succinct response to accusations against him, discuss the significance of "though" and suggest the term "Trumpwashing" to describe the president's strategy.
To the Editor:
Re "Under Attack, Biden Wrestles With Response" (front page, Oct. 6):
Your article states that Joe Biden has been uncertain about how to respond to President Trump's repeated accusations of corruption. Mr. Trump himself has famously responded to accusations by forcefully repeating slogans such as "no collusion, no obstruction" over and over again, regardless of their veracity.
Mr. Biden's response to Mr. Trump's baseless accusations could be equally succinct and forceful, with the additional merit of being correct: "He's lying." In fact, this simple, clear response could prove useful to Democrats in connection with any number of issues related to Mr. Trump. With repetition, it might sink in with the voting public.
For that matter, perhaps some energetic writer at The Times could draw on the paper's extensive coverage and analysis to put a book together with these same two words as the title: "He's Lying."

To the Editor:
There is no substantive proof of corrupt acts by Joe Biden or his son Hunter in their dealings with Ukraine. At the same time, the optics are ugly and disturbing. At the very least this is a prime example of influence peddling.
A Ukrainian oil and gas company put Hunter Biden on its board at a seemingly highly inflated level of compensation (reported to be $ 50,000 per month). Hunter seems to have had no skills or wisdom worth near that sum, just his familial ties. It is clear that Joe Biden did not counsel his son well about the wisdom of accepting such a post.
Still, President Trump is wrong to be calling out the Bidens for corruption, particularly when his own corrupt behavior is out there for all to see.
Ken Derow
Swarthmore, Pa.
To the Editor:
It appears that some of President Trump's most ardent supporters (for example, Tucker Carlson) are now suggesting that Republicans stop their fruitless efforts to label Mr. Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian president as appropriate but instead urge that such conduct does not merit impeachment and that his fate should be determined by the 2020 election. And, of course, Democrats agonized for months over impeachment versus a fair and free election by the people in 2020.
How can we wait for and rely upon an election when it is now absolutely established that Mr. Trump has done, is doing and without question will continue to do everything he can to make sure the 2020 election is neither fair nor free? There is no choice but to impeach.
Lawrence B. Lame

To the Editor:
In your coverage of the "do us a favor" conversation between President Trump and the Ukrainian president, there's one word that is consistently overlooked: "though." In the president's statement "I would like you to do us a favor though," "though" is qualifying (in a grammatical sense) the previous sentence, in which President Volodymyr Zelensky states his desire for more American military aid.
By using the word "though," the president establishes a conditional relationship between the military aid for Ukraine and the president's request for an investigation of Joe Biden and his son. If that isn't a quid pro quo, I don't know what is.

To the Editor:
Re "Mr. Trump, Self-Impeaching President" (editorial, Oct. 4):
You've nailed it. The president's strategy is not to conceal his wrongdoing, but to repeat it, more and more blatantly, in order to make us think, "Well, if he is so open about it, I guess it can't be a big deal." A term for this clever and destructive tactic comes to mind: "Trumpwashing."

Schiff not correct on whistleblower claim

Texto completo: Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said in September that the House Intelligence Committee had not communicated with the whistleblower before the complaint about President Donald Trump’s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was filed.
But recent reporting from the New York Times revealed that Schiff, the committee chairman, had indeed learned about the outlines of the whistleblower’s concerns days in advance.
Seeking guidance, the whistleblower turned to a House Intelligence Committee aide, who advised the whistleblower to get a lawyer and file a complaint with the intelligence community inspector general, per committee procedures. The aide shared some of that information with Schiff.
As the Washington Post’s Fact Checker first noted, this revelation flies in the face of Schiff’s public comments during the month of September, when he dodged questions about whether he or his committee had talked to the whistleblower and, in one case, denied that they had.
On Sept. 17, more than a week before the whistleblower’s complaint was made public, MSNBC’s Sam Stein asked Schiff if he had heard from the whistleblower and if he wanted to.
“We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower,” Schiff said. “We would like to. But I’m sure the whistleblower has concerns that he has not been advised, as the law requires, by the inspector general or the director of national Intelligence just as to how he is to communicate with Congress, and so the risk for the whistleblower is retaliation.”
The New York Times report, which quoted Schiff spokesman Patrick Boland acknowledging that “the whistle-blower contacted the committee for guidance,” shows that this statement was inaccurate.
While it was not publicly known that Schiff’s committee had communicated with the whistleblower ahead of the complaint’s filing, Schiff knew the truth. When given the chance to say that the whistleblower had reached out to a committee aide, he did not.
Schiff’s comments
The New York Times reported that the committee aide received only a vague outline of the whistleblower’s concerns. Without revealing the whistleblower’s identity, the aide then told Schiff “some of what the officer conveyed,” the report said. Other outlets reported similar details.
Previously, Schiff had given the impression that his committee never spoke to the whistleblower.
Before Schiff’s MSNBC interview — in which he flatly stated, “We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower” — Schiff also evaded a question from CNN’s Anderson Cooper about whether he’d been contacted by the whistleblower or the whistleblower’s legal representation.
“I don’t want to get into any particulars,” Schiff said during the Sept. 16 interview. “I want to make sure that there’s nothing that I do that jeopardizes the whistleblower in any way.”
Schiff has since clarified his remarks. He told the Daily Beast that until recently, he did not know for certain whether the complaint detailing the Trump-Zelensky call was submitted by the same whistleblower who contacted his staff.
He also said he thought the questions asking if the committee had heard from the whistleblower were focused on whether the whistleblower had testified privately in Congress.
“I was really thinking along the lines of wanting to get him to come in to testify,” Schiff told the Daily Beast. “I regret that I wasn't much more clear.”
In a statement to PolitiFact, a spokesperson for the House Intelligence Committee said Schiff’s comments on MSNBC were “intended to answer the question of whether the committee had heard testimony from the whistleblower, which they had not.”
“Nonetheless, he acknowledges that his statement should have been more carefully phrased to make that distinction clear,” the spokesperson said.
Mark Zaid, the whistleblower’s counsel, declined to comment on the whistleblower’s outreach to committee staff but stressed that the whistleblower wrote the complaint “entirely on their own.” We addressed the false claim that Schiff helped write the complaint in a separate fact-check.
Our ruling
Schiff said, “We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower.”
The New York Times and other news organizations later reported that the whistleblower sought guidance from a House Intelligence Committee staffer before formally lodging the complaint.
We rate this statement False.

Texto completo: The NBA is facing widespread condemnation Monday, a day after the league apologized following Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey's tweet supporting the ongoing protests in Hong Kong.
On Friday, Morey, in a now-deleted tweet, posted an image that also said, "Fight for Freedom. Stand for Hong Kong," amid increasing tension between Hong Kong and Beijing, which controls the territory. Morey later apologized for the tweet.
The NBA distanced themselves from the comment in a statement Sunday by NBA Chief Communications Officer Mike Bass, who said that the NBA has "great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together."
The NBA found themselves in a precarious position considering their overseas partnership with China. In the aftermath of Morey's tweet, the Chinese Basketball Association announced they were suspending their cooperation with the team. Further, Tencent Holdings, a Chinese tech conglomerate, reported that nearly 500 million people viewed NBA programming on the platform last year with more people tuning in to watch the final game of the NBA Finals than the number of Americans who watched it, according to The New York Times.
A number of people, including politicians on both sides of the political spectrum, have voiced their outrage that the NBA would issue an apology for supporting what many consider pro-Democratic protests.

A number of people also pointed out that the NBA has a track record on both supporting liberal issues as well as allowing players to speak on controversial matters. Back in 2014, a number of NBA players, including superstar LeBron James, wore pregame warm up shirts that read, "I can't breathe," which was a reference to Eric Garner, a black man who was killed by police officers through a banned move used to subdue suspects.
Further, the NBA moved the location of the 2017 All-Star Game from Charlotte as a result of North Carolina's House Bill 2, which limited anti-discrimination laws.

Nicholas Kristof: World leaders can again make miracles

Texto completo: We need a little uplift, a reminder that although world leaders today from Washington to London to Beijing may be dishonest vandals, it doesn’t have to be that way.
Even flawed presidents and prime ministers can act in noble ways, and we saw that in the 2000s when George W. Bush, Tony Blair and others made a heroic effort to tackle AIDS and malaria and save children’s lives around the world.
European and American leaders backed the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which since 2002 has saved 32 million lives. That’s not a misprint. And some 17 million of those lives are from PEPFAR, an AIDS program that Bush founded.
Then there’s Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, created in 2000 with public and private backing: It has saved 13 million lives. We live in an age of miracles when a group of public health nerds, backed by world leaders and front-line health workers, can save lives by the million.
These may be the greatest successes in the history of human governance. Only half as many children now die worldwide as did in 2000. That’s 5 million children’s lives saved each year.
Yet today the kind of global leadership we saw in the early 2000s is gone. Bravo to French President Emmanuel Macron for remaining a supporter of multilateral aid, but he’s the exception. President Donald Trump has tried to slash aid, although in Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike have resisted, and Trump used his speech last month to the United Nations to preach nationalism.
I don’t want to wax too nostalgic: Bush and Blair also collaborated in the catastrophic Iraq War. Still, at their best, they aimed to use their powers for a cause larger than themselves — while Trump, Boris Johnson and Xi Jinping worship only at their own altars.
In the heady days of the early 2000s, leaders pledged to donate at least 0.7% of national income in assistance to poor countries. The only countries that now do so are Sweden, Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark and Britain. The U.S. donates 0.17%, and the average in the rich world is 0.31%.
So that’s the conundrum: We have proved that we have the capacity to save lives, improve education and health, create opportunities for women and girls — yet we also seem to have lost interest.
Nations around the world have adopted 17 Global Goals — quality education, zero hunger, gender equity and so on — to achieve by 2030. We have a historic opportunity to end extreme poverty on our watch, but that will require more commitment in countries like the United States and Britain, and also in countries like South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
One ray of sunshine: Leaders at the United Nations last month committed themselves to achieving universal health coverage by 2030. Here in America, we’re still feuding about access to medical care, but countries like Chile, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Ghana, Thailand and Kyrgyzstan are showing that moving toward universal coverage is possible even with limited resources.
If these countries can manage it, why is the most powerful country in the history of the world stymied?
Universal coverage is championed by Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus of Ethiopia, the director general of the World Health Organization. He knows as well as anybody the importance of access to medical services, for his younger brother, Yemane, died at the age of 4, apparently of measles.
“That was always haunting me,” Tedros told me.
Universal coverage not only saves the lives of children from measles, but it also serves as a global bulwark against epidemics.
“People ask what keeps me up at night,” Tedros said. “My nightmare is a pandemic flu.” One way to protect against such a pandemic — and against Ebola and other viruses — is to build up health care systems in the most vulnerable countries.
Ebola has been spreading in eastern Congo for more than a year. If it suddenly bounces to Europe or Asia, we’ll belatedly realize that our safety in America depends on improving health systems in Congo.
By some reckoning, half the world’s people can’t get simple medical care, especially surgery. I’ll never get over watching a mother of three, Prudence Lemokouno, die needlessly in a Cameroon hospital because she couldn’t get a C-section.
Likewise, more than 800 women die wretchedly and painfully each day from cervical cancer, which in poor countries is sometimes diagnosed partly by the smell of rotting flesh. Cervical cancer is also overwhelmingly preventable with cheap HPV vaccinations, just $4.50 a dose, yet only about 15% of girls get the shot.
I worry that in the coming year, Trump and impeachment will suck all the oxygen out of the room, making it impossible for us to think of anything other than him. Trump is critically important — but so are the 5 million children who will die this year, mostly for preventable reasons.

Universal coverage is championed by Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus of Ethiopia, the director general of the World Health Organization. He knows as well as anybody the importance of access to medical services, for his younger brother, Yemane, died at the age of 4, apparently of measles.
"That was always haunting me," Tedros told me.
Universal coverage not only saves the lives of children from measles, but it also serves as a global bulwark against epidemics.
"People ask what keeps me up at night," Tedros said. "My nightmare is a pandemic flu." One way to protect against such a pandemic - and against Ebola and other viruses - is to build up health care systems in the most vulnerable countries.
Ebola has been spreading in eastern Congo for more than a year. If it suddenly bounces to Europe or Asia, we'll belatedly realize that our safety in America depends on improving health systems in Congo.
By some reckoning, half the world's people can't get simple medical care, especially surgery. I'll never get over watching a mother of three, Prudence Lemokouno, die needlessly in a Cameroon hospital because she couldn't get a C-section.
Likewise, more than 800 women die wretchedly and painfully each day from cervical cancer, which in poor countries is sometimes diagnosed partly by the smell of rotting flesh. Cervical cancer is also overwhelmingly preventable with cheap HPV vaccinations, just $4.50 a dose, yet only about 15% of girls get the shot.
I worry that in the coming year, Trump and impeachment will suck all the oxygen out of the room, making it impossible for us to think of anything other than him. Trump is critically important - but so are the 5 million children who will die this year, mostly for preventable reasons.

Texto completo: PENOBSCOT -- I wish Mark Twain were still alive. Perhaps he is. Our times demand his observational clarity and wit, while at the same time exuding the American outlandishness of a Twain story. He was an arch commentator on American foibles, as well as creator of uniquely American plots and characters, confections of American archetypes.
Today's pundits and talking heads universally refer to our being in "uncharted territory." I feel it's not uncharted at all. We have simply stepped into the realm of our national fiction. Our writers forewarned us and previewed these swamp waters. It does, however, take an altered reality to trump fiction. Perhaps that is a working redefinition of "uncharted."
Who else but Twain, the inventor of American humor, could have imagined a comic-tragic plot like the Trump presidency? Only a Twain novel rivals the irony, hypocrisy, wicked reversals, manipulations, huckster rhetoric, bogus maxims and nefarious sub-textual dog whistles we are experiencing. A Twain villain gives piercing insight into American values and character; his heroes access our better, not baser, angels. His best-known observer, Huck Finn, elucidated our potential while being clear sighted about our flaws on his journey down the Big River in the heart of the nation.
Twain might sympathize with the president formerly known as The Donald. His own business ventures and catastrophes were legend. Had he backed the typewriter only a few years later than he did, he might have made a killing. He was ahead of his time. Twain would have ribbed Trump's failed ventures - steak, vodka, airline, casino, even a graduate school. A perfect, chaotic storm of ego-inflated greed. But he would not have brooked the criminal escapades of the family business. He would not have wailed, "Where's my Roy Cohn?" Cohn was Trump's dark Merlin from "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court," an acrid later work about the human condition.
Humor, as we know, is only a shade lighter than some of our darkest, tragic ideations. Humor thwarts self-destruction. But when humor is overattenuated with tragedy, it's toxic. The knives turn inward. Real people bleed real blood.
Twain would have the words and phrases to fetch us back across the line from our acrimonious fratricidal tribalism. Fake news? The enemy of the people? Twain presided over a permissible application of such terms: literary sleight of hand.
I can laugh imagining Twain writing the March Oval Office scene reported by The New York Times in which President Trump pushes his Cabinet-level advisers to fill a border moat with snakes and alligators, shoot migrants in the legs, top the border wall with flesh-piercing spikes. It is unhinged whingeing right out of "A Connecticut Yankee." I cannot laugh at the scene as written in the nation's newspaper of record.
I offer a more sinister Twain correlative. In "Huckleberry Finn," Twain defines the soul of mob action. Colonel Sherburn shoots a man dead for slander - Trump's proverbial Fifth Avenue homicide-go-free - and the question becomes, what will the townspeople do about it?
The mob surges toward Sherburn, who stands his ground: "Why, a man's safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind - as long as it's daytime and you're not behind him."
He continues his excoriation: "The pitifulest thing out is a mob; that's what an army is - a mob; they don't fight with courage that's born in them, but with courage that's borrowed from their mass, and from their officers. But a mob without any man at the head of it is beneath pitifulness. Now the thing for you to do is to droop your tails and go home and crawl in a hole."
And that's just what they do. And what will we do with our Sherburn? Huck, through whose eyes we witness the scene, has seen enough. "I could 'a' stayed if I wanted to," he says," but I didn't want to."
Ultimately, Twain delivers us from ourselves by delivering us to ourselves. And we hardly know that's what he's about. Is our president doing the same thing? Sherburn-like, he shoots a man and dares us to do something about it.
We gotta light out for the territory, as Huck finally does, where freedom awaits. We just gotta.

Texto completo: If Watergate became, for Richard Nixon, a cancer on his presidency, then Donald Trump’s Ukraine scandal is shaping up as something different: It’s an alligator in his White House.
The alligator, for readers who missed its recent moment in the news cycle, is the predatory beast that the president reportedly wanted to swim hungrily in a moat along our southern border, sharing the waters with poisonous snakes, shadowed by spiked-tipped walls above.
But alligator mississippiensis is also a useful condensed symbol of how the Trump administration has survived Trump’s own deeply unpresidential conduct: Because most of the time, when the president asks for an alligator, the people around him figure out a way to make sure the sharp-toothed reptile doesn’t actually show up.
Their strategies have been various. Sometimes the president says “alligator!” and you just ignore him, which is how you get the spectacle of the man notionally in charge of the executive branch shouting “treason!” at his enemies with no discernible result.
The other day my colleague James Poniewozik wondered at the way that some of the president’s defenders “seem to feel he should be treated like any person who watches TV news, gets worked up & blows off steam, not like a president making statements backed by the power of the U.S. government.” But this isn’t just how his apologists regard him; it’s how his subordinates often manage him, signaling through their actions that his statements really are just rage-tweets, that the power of the government is not in fact behind them.
Of course that approach doesn’t always work; sometimes the president asks you something directly instead of just yelling into the social-media void. Then you need delaying strategies, a promise to look into it, an “alligator cost estimate” proposal that will unfortunately never make its way through the bureaucracy.
Or you can give him some other lizard — ideally a gecko or a bearded dragon, but a Cuvier’s dwarf caiman if you must — and tell him, Here’s the alligator you wanted, sir!
If the president thinks that voter fraud cost him the popular vote, you create a voter fraud commission that will subsequently dissolve. If the president wants a “Muslim ban,” you settle on a dumb but modest travel ban that leaves most of the world’s Muslim countries untouched. If the president wants a bargain with North Korea no matter the strategic cost, let him have a handshake in the DMZ. If the president wants to leave NAFTA, you come up with a way to keep the deal but tweak it and rename it.
And if all else fails — well, sometimes you’ll write up the alligator requisition orders and steal them off his desk.
The two biggest disasters in Trump’s presidency have both been cases where these guardrails collapsed, and the president actually got his way in full. He actually fired James Comey, setting in motion the probe whose workings dominated his first term, and his Homeland Security apparatus actually separated thousands of migrant children from their families, creating the biggest moral scandal of his presidency.
But in other cases, he has been protected by the “don’t-give-him-the-alligator” operations all around him. Indeed, the ultimate fizzle of the Mueller report was possible because that report ended up documenting a president whose staff let him rant about obstructing justice, but then — in Mueller’s own words — mostly “declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests.”
With the Ukraine scandal, though, this protection has broken down again. (Not least because in Rudy Giuliani, Trump found an adviser even more enthusiastic about alligators than his boss.) The quest to get Ukraine’s government to reopen an investigation that would touch the Biden family wasn’t just a wish that Trump expressed; it was a policy objective that, however reluctantly and haphazardly, the U.S. government seems to have pursued. Trump’s now-publicized conversation with the Ukrainian prime minister was itself an act of foreign policy, not just a spitballing conversation, and, whatever its intentions, so was the delay of military aid. We can’t see the full body of the alligator, but you can see it moving in the water; it’s right there.
Now clearly people around Trump still believed that they weren’t going all the way to Alligatortown with Rudy, and maybe when we see the full shape of things, it will be clear that the president’s men did actually prevent the most explicitly Biden-focused quid pro quo from taking shape. In which case there will be defenses of Trump that say, in effect: Look, he wanted an alligator, and we let one thrash around in the water for a while, but we always kept it on a leash.
I expect that will be the defense offered, eventually, by pained Republican senators voting to acquit — that this was bad behavior but happily the president’s diplomats kept things from reaching the level of an impeachable offense.
The only difficulty will be that Trumpland will probably spend the next few months making a different argument: Actually, alligators are great.

Tokyo ticket packages 'running scarce'

Texto completo: The Tokyo 2020 Olympics are almost here – and if you're going to the games next summer, or simply want to soak up the Olympics-tinged atmosphere, you should start planning your journey.
You probably have a lot of questions. But no need to fret, dear travelers: We're here to answer everything we can.
Here's a guide to all your Tokyo-related travel questions ahead of the 2020 Olympics:
When are the Olympics? July 24 to Aug. 9. U.S. travelers can still get a ticket, but only as part of a package. CoSport, the U.S. Olympics tickets retailer, is sold out of individual tickets but is waiting to see if it will receive more. You can sign up for their email list.Packages are available on its website that include tickets and hotel accommodation. One cheaper price, for a doubles trip, is $4,471.50 per person (for a three-night, four-event package from July 27-30).
But you might want to hurry up: "Packages are still available but are running scarce," Patricia Sweeney, a CoSport customer care associate told USA TODAY in an email.
When should I book flights for the Tokyo Olympics? There are always deals to be had, according to Darci Valiente, a U.S. flight searcher for Scott's Cheap Flights. Valiente recommends booking at least six months in advance. "Because it's for the Olympics, prices will be even more expensive than they already are for peak travel season," Valiente told USA TODAY.
Catherine Heald, CEO and co-founder of Asia tour operator Remote Lands, recommends flying into Haneda Airport as it's closest to the city center. Tokyo's other airport is Narita International Airport.
How much should people expect to pay? Valiente recommends looking for flights under $800, depending on where they are in the U.S.
And don't necessarily set your sights on flying directly into Tokyo. "We saw flights to Osaka for peak summer more (numerous) than Toyko – so be flexible about where you fly into and consider taking the train," Valiente says.
Marian Goldberg, The New York Times Travel Show Japan travel expert, recommends booking through a Japanese or Chinese travel agency if you're connecting from Beijing or Shanghai.
Right now, flight prices are more expensive if you want to be in Tokyo for the first few days of the games and the opening ceremony, according to Valiente. The prices drop in the middle to the end of the games. Travelers looking to make a 10- to 14-day excursion may want to stagger their journey so they arrive early and leave in the middle of the games, or arrive in the middle of the games and depart post-Olympics.
Where should I stay? Travelers have a number of options, including opting for a nearby city like Yokohama, which Amy Tadehara, a senior travel consultant at Inside Japan Tours, refers to as "Tokyo's cosmopolitan younger sibling." Hop on a train between the two in less than 40 minutes.
Edward Granville, chief operating officer at luxury travel company Red Savannah recommends booking with one of the event's official travel partners and says that the best hotels usually give up their inventory to these groups.
"Despite a construction book in preparation to the Olympics, Tokyo is looking at a massive accommodation shortfall," Japan event travel expert Alan Omlin and long-time Tokyo resident says. The Mizuho Research Institute points to a 14,000-room shortfall for the city.
Airbnb has a reduced presence in the city thanks to a law restricting Airbnb rentals. Michael Matsuo, a spokesperson for Airbnb, said some hosts haven't made their calendars open to book yet – though a search during the Olympics period for one guest warranted more than 300 places to stay, varying wildly in price.
If you decide to book a hotel, know that most Japanese hotels don't let more than three (or even two) people in one room. Rooms are also more expensive, according to Goldberg. "In fact, all Japanese-style accommodations charge per person and not per room," Goldberg says.
Chef Hiroki Odo, owner and chef of o.d.o by ODO, the speakeasy kaiseki restaurant in New York's Flatiron neighborhood, recommends a ryokan (traditional Japanese inn).
Besides the Olympics, what should I do in Tokyo? Shibuya Crossing Who knew a crosswalk could double as a tourist attraction? But Shibuya Crossing could be the world's busiest, according to Lonely Planet, noting that at peak times upwards of 3,000 people cross at a time. It's a scramble intersection, which means all vehicle traffic is stopped to allow pedestrians to cross in every direction, including diagonally, at the same time.
Mount Fuji Although Mount Fuji technically isn't in Tokyo, it's just a short car, bus or train ride to the active volcano, which is also Japan's tallest mountain. Visitors can explore trails from early July to early September.
Animal cafes Tokyo has developed a worldwide reputation for its animal cafes. In addition to getting food and drink, visitors to the cafe are treated to interaction with cute, tame animals, such as hedgehogs, meerkats and ferrets. It's a dream come true for animal lovers.
Other notable sights Takao Nishina, travel agency GetYourGuide's regional manager for Japan, recommends the Tokyo Skytree, the tallest broadcast tower in the world, as well as the Ghibli Museum for animation fanatics and the Samurai Museum.
What else should I do? Hakone: "Tucked up in the mountains, it's a beautiful hideaway with a gondola that goes up into the mountains and a boat ride tour that sails the gorgeous Ashino Lake," Jay Allen, the publisher of website Unseen Japan, told USA TODAY. Tadehara from Inside Japan Tours says that Hakone's elevation is a pleasant break from Tokyo's summer heat.
Kyoto: Travelers can take a bullet train to "the cultural heart of Japan," Tadehara says. Nearly 2,000 temples and shrines are in the city.
Osaka or Hiroshima: Tadehara adds that you can take a day trip to see foodie haven Osaka or even Hiroshima, where the first atomic bomb dropped.
Yokohama: Check out Minato Mirai, a portside area that has "spectacular fireworks" in the summer, according to Allen.
Kamakura: Go here to see Komachi-dori, "a rich shopping section filled with small shops and restaurants; the Great Buddha of Kamakura at the Kotoku Temple, which has been preserved from the 13th century until today; and the oceanside shoreline of Kamakura which offers spectacular sunsets," Allen says.
Getting around The city is easy to get around via public transportation, though taxis are an affordable option. "Taxis are easy to get, most take credit cards, and they can be used affordably for short distances," Goldberg says. "It's just really expensive to take a taxi between distant regions."

Texto completo: Anqwenique Kinsel is a new mom, which is a challenge enough for any woman but even more so for black women.
Pregnancy and motherhood can be more difficult for mothers facing racism or race-related trauma, according to a report in The New York Times. Black mothers are three to four times more likely to die from pregnancy-related issues than white women.
But Kinsel wants black mothers and aunties to find self-care and healing amid a major societal health crisis.
Kinsel, an artist and the educational director at the Pittsburgh Festival Opera, reflected on the phrase "There Are Black People in the Future" and found it to be an intersection of her motherhood and her practice. Her goal with "Just Sing!" - a workshop she held in June made possible by the residency - was to give black women control over stress and trauma through singing and vocal exercises. Her husband, D.S. Kinsel, co-founder of BOOM Concepts, also is a recipient of one of the art residency grants.
Her workshop - more will be planned in the future - is about "reminding people that your voice is an instrument and a gift," she said.
Participants begin by relaxing in a space with prompts about their lives, such as their favorite songs to sing in the shower. People mix and mingle, enjoy nourishment and discuss the prompts before getting together for a guided discussion. The women of the workshop share resources, and then she leads exercises in breathing, singing and group singing. She ends the session with additional exercises on singing to your child.
She describes the place as relaxed and free, an important night of oral tradition where women share resources and learn self-care.
The workshop is focused on and centered around black women, specifically mothers and aunts, although the general public won't be turned away. Her last edition of the workshop was a small gathering at BOOM Concepts, 5139 Penn Ave., Garfield, with many of the women from the Pittsburgh Black Breastfeeding Circle.
Kinsel will announce future workshops on BOOM Concepts' Facebook page: facebook.com/boomconcepts.
"It doesn't feel complete," she said. "It's a work in progress."

Texto completo: Larisa Martinez and Joshua Bell were married Oct. 5 at their home in Mount Kisco, N.Y. David Brooks, a friend of the couple and a New York Times columnist based in Washington who is a Universal Life minister, officiated.
The bride, 32, a soprano, is a frequent recital partner of the Italian opera singer Andrea Bocelli. She has performed at the Hollywood Bowl, the Kennedy Center and Madison Square Garden. On Oct. 10, she is to make her Carnegie Hall solo debut in Mahler's "Symphony No. 2" with the Athens Philharmonic and the New York Choral Society. She studied vocal performance at the Music Conservatory of Puerto Rico, graduated with high honors from the University of Puerto Rico and received a master's degree in voice performance from Mannes the New School for Music.
She is the daughter of Luisa Torres of Toa Baja, P.R., and Dr. Daniel Martinez of Miami; and the stepdaughter of José J. Avilés.
The groom, 51, is the concert violinist and a Grammy Award-winning recording artist who has made more than 40 recordings. He is the music director of the Academy of St Martin-in-the-Fields, the London chamber ensemble. He graduated from Indiana University.
He is the son of Shirley Bell of Bloomington, Ind., and the late Alan P. Bell.
The couple are advocates for classical music education and are among musicians affiliated with Turnaround Arts at the Kennedy Center in Washington and Education Through Music in New York.
Ms. Martinez met Mr. Bell on Dec. 30, 2011, backstage at the Blue Note jazz club in New York after Chris Botti, the trumpet player, and their mutual friend, performed that evening as part of his annual holiday residency.
"I happened to pick the right night," Mr. Bell said. "I walked into the room and Larisa was sitting on the couch."
Ms. Martinez was in New York on vacation from Puerto Rico with her best friend, and even made time for a few voice lessons with a teacher at Mannes. She walked right up to Mr. Bell.
"I went to say hello because I knew who he was," Ms. Martinez said, and told him she had heard him play in San Juan. "He was down-to-earth and engaging," she said, and when asked, she told him she was a classical singer.
Mr. Bell found her engaging too, but reserved judgment on her singing. "Yeah, yeah O.K., everyone's a singer," he recalled thinking.
On New Year's Day they met for dinner at SushiSamba, a restaurant that was in the Gramercy Park area.
"We were nerding out," said Ms. Martinez, who had studied environmental science in college, and was in the middle of reading "The Fabric of the Cosmos" by the physicist Brian Greene. Mr. Greene is a friend of Mr. Bell (and to impress her, he later introduced her to him). "We talked about music. We talked about Brian Greene."
"We laughed a lot," she added. "He likes puns and jokes and wordplays. I was impressed with how his brain works."
Mr. Bell took note of the fact that the conversation never flagged. Her living in Puerto Rico was also never an issue.
"I felt like we started something," Mr. Bell said. "I travel so much, distance doesn't mean anything."
When she got back to Puerto Rico they spoke between his concerts, at least once a week. "It was a party every time he would call," she said. "We would laugh," and a month later when he played a concert in Florida, she flew out to meet him.
She also had some idea of what a relationship with him could be like. "I understood his lifestyle and art," she said, and six months later when she started studying at Mannes they were boyfriend and girlfriend.
But one thing still weighed on him. "Music is my life," he recalled thinking. "I worried about waiting to hear her sing. What if she's tone deaf?"
He soon got his answer when she sang a Mozart aria, a cappella, to him alone. "It was so beautiful," he said. "I was relieved, and way beyond. She sang like an angel."
"She's really got it all," he said. "We never run out of things to say. Sometimes when I suggest we watch 'Homeland,' she says 'How about we read some poetry and decipher it. We enjoy 'Homeland' too."
On their seven-year anniversary, Mr. Bell proposed to Ms. Martinez in Chris Botti's dressing room at the Blue Note.

Texto completo: What's on TV
MR. ROBOT 10 p.m. on USA. After tanking the world's economy, and then attempting to undo that hack with a bit of code, Elliot Alderson (Rami Malek) has set his sights on taking down Whiterose, the shadowy leader of the Dark Army who has been manipulating him and his gang of vigilantes for her own gain. At the end of Season 3, "characters who thought they were smashing capitalism, winning back their family, bringing back their dead parent or fighting the good fight against cyberterrorism, learned that they were essentially pawns being pushed around a chessboard," Jeremy Egner wrote in his finale recap for The New York Times. Armed with that information, and a hunger for retribution, the hooded hacker will reunite with his other half, Mr. Robot, working in tandem to destroy "the top one percent of the top one percent."
THE WALKING DEAD 9 p.m. on AMC. Ten seasons into this survivalist thriller and there are still, somehow, more zombies to kill. Along with the undead, the show's remaining survivors will also have to look out for the Whisperers, a territorial tribe of humans led by a woman named Alpha. As if their whisper-only method of communication wasn't creepy enough, they also wear zombie skins over their bodies as a sort of camouflage.
WITCHES OF SALEM 10 p.m. on Travel. Through re-enactments and interviews with historians and authors, this four-part historical mini-series explores a particularly hysterical chapter of our nation's history -- the Salem witch trials. The docudrama follows transcripts from witnesses of the trials to re-examine the extreme beliefs that sparked a mass panic that gripped the Massachusetts village over an eight-month period in 1692. In each hourlong episode, actors play out the reports of demonic possession, mass arrests and public hangings that contributed to the death of 20 innocent men, women and children accused of witchcraft.
What's Streaming
PEAKY BLINDERS Stream on Netflix. Tommy Shelby (Cillian Murphy) and his smartly dressed, criminally enterprising family are back for a fifth season. This gangster crime drama picks up with Shelby, the crime lord-turned-member of British Parliament, reeling from the aftermath of the 1929 Wall Street crash, attempting to fend off his many enemies and acclimating to his newfound political influence. This season opens with the British Labour MP and fascist Oswald Mosely (Sam Claflin) eager to start a hate-fueled political party and looking to Shelby for help.
IN THE TALL GRASS Stream on Netflix. Stephen King has created an impressive roster of terrifying villains over his decades-long writing career. But the sinister force at the center of this Netflix film (an adaptation of a novella King co-wrote with his son Joe Hill) is much more mundane -- some very tall and mysteriously inescapable grass. The story follows two siblings as they venture into a field in rural Kansas after hearing the cries of a young boy who seems trapped inside. But it's not long before the siblings realize they too have been trapped inside the bizarre herbaceous prison.

Texto completo: Donald Trump drags us down to Chinatown.
WASHINGTON -- Forget it, America. It's Chinatown.
Washington, once the guarantor of American values, is a crime scene. This capital of white marble is now encircled by yellow tape, rife with mendacity, cowardice and corruption. It's Chinatown on the Potomac.
Robert Towne, the screenwriter of the 1974 classic "Chinatown," wrote the movie as a eulogy to great things that were lost. He said that he was not conjuring a place on a map but a state of mind: the futility of good intentions.
Or, as Raymond Chandler, the premier chronicler of Los Angeles noir, once wrote: "We still have dreams, but we know now that most of them will come to nothing. And we also most fortunately know that it really doesn't matter."
"Chinatown" was set in 1937, right before the war. Like Jack Nicholson's Jake Gittes, America was naïve about the forces of real corruption, real evil.
Towne wrote the movie in the early '70s, in the dark years of Vietnam, Watergate and Richard Nixon's doomed second term. Roman Polanski directed it a few years after his pregnant wife, Sharon Tate, was butchered by the Manson family.
In his latest fascinating dive into Hollywood, "The Big Goodbye," Sam Wasson dissects "Chinatown." "What makes Chinatown so uniquely disturbing as an American metaphor is that it is so unlike the whiteness of Ahab's whale or the greenness of Gatsby's light," he writes in the forthcoming book. "However illusory, these are totems of aspiration, of possibility."
He says that "Chinatown," by contrast, is black: It's about terrible truths you can't undo, about a cynical world where you can't beat the house and money wins, where you think you've got it figured out and then you realize you're dead.
Sound familiar?
The movie is a good metaphor for the Trump era, when you hope that this grotesquerie is an aberration but you worry that the bad guys have already won.
Even if Donald Trump is impeached, we know now that the Russians have figured out how to rig our elections -- and our dictator-loving president doesn't seem too disturbed about that.
What makes the metaphor so powerful is its unAmericanness. In democracy, we supposedly have the power. But in Chinatown, there's nothing you can do. Forget it, Jake. It's an oligarchy.
Is the impeachment inquiry the false hope, the cocky detective?
This was the week that made it glaringly clear that the president put his fragile ego, idiotic conspiracy theories and political prospects ahead of American national security interests. But watching Mike Pence and Marco Rubio and the red firewall of Republican lawmakers pervert principles to protect Donald Trump elicits dread that there will be more lawlessness.
As John Huston's Noah Cross says when Jake confronts him over his turpitude: "Most people never have to face the fact that at the right time and the right place they are capable of ... anything."
In this desolate scenario, is Nancy Pelosi Jake?
Not really. The speaker is anything but naïve. She is well aware that Mitch McConnell -- an icy film noir villain if there ever was one -- will snuff out any threat that Trump will be ousted. (And don't forget, as the House demands documents from the vice president in the impeachment inquiry, if Trump and Pence have to go, we'll have our first Madam President.)
Trump biographer Michael D'Antonio predicted that being in the White House would distill Trump to his essence. And his essence, D'Antonio says, is a dark swirl of cruelty, violence and fear. That is on disturbing display in "Border Wars: Inside Trump's Assault on Immigration," the new book by Times reporters Michael D. Shear and Julie Hirschfeld Davis.
"Privately," they wrote in an adaptation of the book in The Times, "the president had often talked about fortifying a border wall with a water-filled trench, stocked with snakes or alligators, prompting aides to seek a cost estimate. He wanted the wall electrified, with spikes on top that could pierce human flesh. After publicly suggesting that soldiers shoot migrants if they threw rocks, the president backed off when his staff told him that was illegal. But later in a meeting, aides recalled, he suggested that they shoot migrants in the legs to slow them down. That's not allowed either, they told him."
The sordid moment where we find ourselves is at once stunning and ineluctable: the House move to impeachment, Trump's lunatic denials about his blatant transgressions, and his even more lunatic bouts of self-incrimination.
Nothing good was going to happen when the spoiled attention addict was put in a position to demand the attention -- and favors -- of the whole world, or else.
As The Times's Maggie Haberman pointed out: "He has led a consequence-free life despite enormously self-destructive behaviors over time. The divorces were marriages he wanted out of. The bankruptcies impacted his lenders most, not him. All of his behavior in 2016 ended with him winning the presidency. And the Mueller obstruction inquiry ended with no definitive answer."
D'Antonio says Trump is "a man making his own nightmare come to pass. His performance with the Finnish president was a florid demonstration of his inner self. Enraged and irrational, he was incapable of hiding his contempt, which is ever-present, and heedless of his effect on others.
"Trump doesn't know that people who don't confront their demons are destined to be confronted by them."
And what is a better description of a film noir spiral than that?

Texto completo: Patrick Soren Roberts and Jose A. Del Real were married Sept. 30 in Leidig Meadow at Yosemite National Park in California. Autrey Nassar, a Universal Life minister, officiated on the banks of the Merced River in Yosemite Valley.
Mr. Roberts (left), 44, is a political scientist at the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit research organization in Santa Monica, Calif. He is an associate professor at Virginia Tech's School of Public and International Affairs in Arlington, and the author of "Disasters and the American State: How Politicians, Bureaucrats, and the Public Prepare for the Unexpected." (Cambridge University Press, 2016). He graduated cum laude from the University of Dallas, received a master's degree in political philosophy from Claremont Graduate University in California and a doctoral degree in government from the University of Virginia.
He is the son of Sharon A. Roberts of Austin, Texas, and John M. Roberts of Victoria, Texas, and the stepson of Donna A. Roberts. His mother retired as a computer scientist at the University of Texas. His father retired as the publisher of The Victoria Advocate, a newspaper in Victoria.
Mr. Del Real, 29, is based in Los Angeles as a domestic correspondent for the national desk of The New York Times. He graduated cum laude from Harvard.
He is a son of Josefina Perez and Jose M. Del Real-Soto of Monte Escobedo, Zacatecas, in Mexico. His mother retired as a housekeeper at the Hotel Captain Cook in Anchorage. His father raises cattle on a family ranch in Zacatecas.
The couple met in 2015 at a mutual friend's party in Washington, but did not start dating until a year later, after they ran into each other and then met for a drink at a Washington bar. Mr. Roberts and Mr. Del Real said they decided to elope to Yosemite, partly to find some tranquillity, easier to achieve in a place with limited cellphone service.

Texto completo: BY TAMI ABDOLLAH
The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - Microsoft said Friday that hackers linked to the Iranian government targeted a U.S. presidential campaign, as well as government officials, media targets and prominent expatriate Iranians.
Overall, the hackers attempted to penetrate 241 accounts - four successfully - though none of those penetrated was associated with presidential campaigns or current or past U.S. officials, Microsoft said. A company spokeswoman declined to identify those targeted, citing customer privacy.
Reuters and The New York Times reported that the attack targeted President Donald Trump's reelection campaign, but this could not be independently confirmed. But a review of publicly available internet records by AP showed that the Trump campaign's official website is linked to Microsoft's email service.
Tim Murtaugh, spokesman for Trump's 2020 reelection campaign, said there was "no indication that any of our campaign infrastructure was targeted."
Microsoft's announcement is the latest sign that foreign governments are looking for ways to potentially disrupt the 2020 presidential election. U.S. intelligence officials have sounded the alarm about the risks for months.
Russia's hacking of the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign, as well as the subsequent leaks of emails during the 2016 election roiled the DNC, hurt the Clinton campaign and was a focal point in special counsel Robert Mueller's probe.
Foreign hackers have long targeted U.S. government and politicians, generally with little notice. But the disruption caused by Russia's attack has heightened awareness and prompted fears that other nations will try to follow Russia's example. Iran in particular could have a stake in the outcome of the U.S. election after Trump withdrew the U.S. from a nuclear agreement up sanctions against the country.
"The Russians came after us and our election system in 2016 and they paid virtually no price for that activity," said Jamil N. Jaffer, director of the national security law and policy program at George Mason University, and former chief counsel of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. "It's not surprising that China now more aggressively and maybe the Iranians are getting in that game. Why not?"
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said it was working with Microsoft to "assess and mitigate impacts." Chris Krebs, director of the department's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said much of the activity is likely "run-of-the-mill" foreign intelligence service work.
But, "Microsoft's claims that a presidential campaign was targeted is yet more evidence that our adversaries are looking to undermine our democratic institutions," Krebs said.
In a blogpost released Friday, Microsoft's Tom Burt, corporate vice president for customer security and trust, said that owners of four accounts that were compromised by the hackers have been notified. The company would not identify those accounts.
The attacks by a group Microsoft calls Phosphorous occurred during a 30-day period between August and September.
Burt said the Iranian hackers used password reset and account recovery features to try to take over accounts. For example, they gathered phone numbers belonging to targets to help with a password reset. In other cases, they tried to get into secondary email accounts that might be linked to the Microsoft account to gain access via a verification email.
The hackers researched their targets, making more than 2,700 attempts to identify emails belonging to a specific Microsoft customer. A spokeswoman declined to provide more details.
The company has previously taken legal steps to combat Iran-linked hackers, suing them in federal court in Washington D.C., so Microsoft could take control of websites Phosphorous used to conduct hacking operations and to stop attacks.
The campaigns of Sen. Kamala Harris, Michael Bennet, Pete Buttigieg, and Montana Gov. Steve Bullock also said they had not been targeted. A campaign aide for Sen. Bernie Sanders said the campaign doesn't comment on matters of technical security.
Republican National Committee spokeswoman Blair Ellis said the RNC is "constantly working to stay ahead of emerging threats."
Meanwhile, the DNC sent an alert out to campaigns Friday, warning them about the Iran-linked hacking group's targeting of Microsoft accounts belonging to "journalists, politicians and at least one presidential campaign."
The DNC has taken several steps to improve the party's cybersecurity since 2016. The most public move was the hiring of Bob Lord, a veteran of Silicon Valley cybersecurity with stints at Yahoo, Twitter, AOL and Netscape, to serve as its cybersecurity chief.
Lord on Friday declined to provide details on the hacking efforts, deferring to Microsoft. He has worked to improve security protocols for DNC staff, state parties and campaigns with access to the central voter file that DNC maintains.
In July, Microsoft announced that it had detected more than 740 infiltration attempts by nation-state actors in the past year targeting U.S.-based political parties, campaigns and other democracy-focused organizations including think tanks and other nonprofits.
The company declined to name or further characterize the targets or the actors. It said at the time that such targeting had similarly occurred in the early stages of the 2016 and 2018 elections.
A memo prepared by DHS and the FBI was sent to state election officials this week outlining possible ways Russia could seek to interfere in the 2020 elections by discouraging voters or utilizing voter suppression tactics.
The document, which was dated Thursday and reviewed by The Associated Press, outlines a few possible scenarios for state and local election officials to be aware of. Those include the use of social media to exacerbate divisions within political parties during state primaries and the hacking of election websites to spread misinformation on voting processes or to alter voter registration data.

Texto completo: The state of California is home to some of the most infamous serial killers in U.S. history — from the Manson Family, to the Freeway Killers, all the way to the Grim Sleeper.
Well, another accused killer is now awaiting trial in California. This time it’s prolific Democratic donor and West Hollywood resident Ed Buck.
Buck was finally arrested by Los Angeles County Sheriff’s deputies and charged with operating a drug house, as well as providing methamphetamine to a 37 year-old man who suffered an overdose at Buck’s apartment.
This incident was the third known time a man suffered a meth overdose at Buck’s home. The previous two alleged victims, Gemmel Moore and Timothy Dean, did not survive.
Days later, the feds announced that they too would be prosecuting Buck — this time on one count of distribution of methamphetamine resulting in death.
At a press conference, U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna said investigators found 10 more victims, nine of whom said Buck, “administered drugs to them or strongly encouraged them to ingest narcotics as part of agreements to be compensated for sexual services.”
The case is now generating national and international headlines; and I’m noticing that three false storylines seem to be emerging, and they need to be corrected.
First, The New York Times tried to minimize Buck’s power and influence by referring to him as “a small-time Democratic donor and political activist.”
That’s like calling Harvey Weinstein a “love-sick teenager.”
According to federal records, Buck has contributed more than $500,000 to Democratic candidates and groups, and was classified by the California Secretary of State’s office as being a “major donor.”
Before he was nicknamed ‘Dr. Kevorkian’ by his West Hollywood neighbors, Buck could have easily gone by Ed ‘Big Bucks’ with all of the campaign cash he was throwing around.
Second, it has been reported in multiple publications that the politicians and political action committees who took contributions from Buck acted quickly to distance themselves from him.
Some politicians, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former President Obama, still won’t say what they’re doing with Buck’s donations, even after his arrest.
In her defense, Hillary may not even know that Buck has been arrested. If she did, she might have fainted again.
Other candidates, including Congressman Adam Schiff, D-Burbank, and Ted Lieu, D-Torrance, agreed to give their Buck contributions of $2,700 and $19,400 respectively, to charity, only after the second man, Timothy Dean, died in Buck’s apartment in January.
The families of the victims, asked for the contributions to help pay for funeral expenses, but both congressmen declined.
What profiles in courage.
To date, only two elected officials donated the money they received from Buck to the victims’ families. Congresswoman Karen Bass, D-Los Angeles, sent the entire $250 she received from Buck to help pay for Gemmel Moore’s funeral expenses, and West Hollywood Councilman John D’Amico made a $25 contribution toward the funeral.
Finally, Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey claimed that her office worked diligently and carefully to find and speak with witnesses over the course of the last two years so they could build a case against Ed Buck.
But the Moore family attorneys say the opposite is true. Nana Gyamfi and Hussain Turk wrote in a statement that, “Our team of activists had to personally escort witnesses to the LASD’s office and pressure them into recording our witnesses’ statements. We later discovered, in May of 2019, that Lacey was not even aware that these reports existed.”
Maybe prosecutors were too busy busting people for possession of plastic drinking straws to go after Ed Buck.
The reality is that Ed Buck abused vulnerable gay black men because powerful people looked the other way and enabled him.
Now that he’s finally been arrested, we shouldn’t try to minimize his power and influence, or rewrite history to make law enforcement and politicians seem as if they cared about the suffering of Ed Buck’s victims more than they actually did.
John Phillips can be heard weekdays from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. on “The Morning Drive with John Phillips and Jillian Barberie” on KABC/AM 790.

Trump and His Henchmen in the Flames

Texto completo: Is this Trump's public suicide or his genius for survival?
We all know President Trump couldn't find Ukraine on a map, let alone find Finland, that happy country (the world's happiest, according to a United Nations agency) whose happiness Trump this week attributed to the following: "You got rid of Pelosi, and you got rid of shifty Schiff."
The Finnish president, Sauli Niinisto, was staggered. He is not alone. We have hit uncharted political territory. An unstable president has lurched under the pressure of an impeachment inquiry into a form of madness that is either a very public suicide or some weird genius for survival. Trump is Robert De Niro, armed with a gun, in "Taxi Driver" gazing into the mirror repeating: "You talkin' to me?"
We are. Nixon wanted his profanities deleted from transcripts. Trump has no such qualms. He trumpets his view of the Democrats' impeachment inquiry on Twitter: "BULLSHIT." He will not be a one-term president! That's weak, like Carter, like Bush One! He cannot be WEAK like them! He cannot lose! It's all an attempted "coup"!
The White House, I hear, now operates like the 26th floor of Trump Tower during the campaign. There's no structure or plan. There's no war room or communications cell. People wander in and wander out, except they're all lawyered up now, no doubt. They're not even in crisis mode. Trump just goes out and shoots his mouth, as he has from Day 1. Like a good Mafia boss, he now has everyone complicit. They're all in this together -- Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, and the rest. Since John Kelly escaped in January, Trump's henchmen are all that's left.
Thanks to a whistle-blower, Trump's attempts to get the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, a comedian-turned-politician, to investigate a rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, is now public knowledge. The United States gets this. Does it ever. This is not the double negatives and assorted convolutions of the Mueller report. This is President Pressures Foreign Leader to Find Dirt on His Political Opponent.
Houston, we have a problem! Polls show a plurality of Americans now supporting impeachment and Trump's approval rating sinking as low as 41 percent. He is vulnerable in several states he won in 2016, including Ohio. If he shrinks to his core unshakable support, he probably has no more than a third of the vote.
So what does he do? Double down! If there's any guiding principle it seems to be: If Trump says often enough in broad daylight that he tried to get foreign powers to interfere in our election to his benefit, how can it be wrong? "China should start an investigation into the Bidens," says Trump, as he leaves the White House to go to Florida.
The remark is met with justified outrage. This is abuse of power. This is abuse of foreign affairs authority. These are impeachable acts. But, guess what, everyone starts reporting and writing on what Biden and his son Hunter did or did not do in China. Trump is a mass-media magician. He got McLuhan -- "the medium is the message" -- without reading McLuhan.
The term self-impeachment is now doing the rounds. As with a self-immolation, it can be hard to watch Trump's blathering at its current crazed pitch. Can this be anything but the long-awaited and very public self-destruction of a man unfit for office? It may well be, but I am not entirely convinced.
As always with Trump, the rational and the Cartesian bump up against his fiendish antennae for the mass hypnosis of our age. He has his finger on the pulse of the technological character of evolution -- even though he knows nothing about it. Repeat something often enough, brazenly enough and aggressively enough to people dazed enough by the cacophony around them, and they will lose their bearings enough to believe anything, even that his conversation with Zelensky was "perfect."
There is no down range for this president. He's too disorganized. There is only the next minute. Let's talk Trump and golf for a minute. He likes to say, "I'm a feel player." He's not a believer in going to the driving range. Drop it and hit it. Fire and forget. Just hit the effing thing! Well, fire-and-forget got him to the White House, so why would he stop believing in it, even now?
Because, if Trump could manage a glimpse over the towering heights of his ego, he might see that Speaker Nancy Pelosi has him in her sights. She knows he will grow madder and madder under the pressure of the impeachment inquiry. As that happens, those working-class white women and suburban housewives who voted for Trump in large numbers in 2016 may well desert him: Derangement is not really their thing. Can the 53 Republicans of the Senate be far behind?
They are stubborn, those Republican senators. But watch one of them, Joni Ernst, being grilled at an Iowa town hall meeting recently and you start to believe that enough might defect for conviction of Trump in the Senate to be just possible. "Where is the line?" asks Amy Haskins of Manning, Iowa. "You still stand there, silent, and your silence is supporting him."
To which Ernst offers only evasions. The line, through all the madness, may be right here.

Texto completo: Readers react to the president's overture to China to investigate the Bidens and a so-called perfect phone call with Ukraine's leader.
To the Editor:
Re "In a Brash Public Move, Trump Asks the Chinese to Examine the Bidens" (front page, Oct. 4):
Even if the Trumped-up allegations about the Bidens turned out to be accurate -- and there hasn't been the least bit of evidence to support the claim -- the fact remains that, as president, Donald Trump violated the law by asking a foreign power (Ukraine) to dig up dirt on a political rival for his own personal gain, while he held back vital military aid to Ukraine, which had been appropriated by Congress.
And now he's compounding his lawlessness by publicly making a similar request of China.
Something new and ugly every day.
Joel H. Cohen
Staten Island
To the Editor:
Donald Trump once proclaimed that he could "stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters." He is now testing this with his open admission of influence-peddling in Ukraine.
This might be the final test of what democracy means to the American people if the president of the United States can do whatever he pleases despite the Constitution.
Kenneth Satir
Longboat Key, Fla.
To the Editor:
Many articles cite President Trump's description of his phone call with Ukraine's leader as being "perfect." Does anyone even know what that means?
I know what a "perfect" math exam paper looks like. A gymnastics judge can tell me the elements a routine must have to rate a "perfect" 10. Phone calls are different and are typically classified as pleasant, usual, productive, depressing and so on.
What must be accomplished for one of the people on the phone call to deem it "perfect"? It would take more than simply not committing treason.
For example, I might call a conversation "perfect" if I could persuade my children to behave in a way I would like without their realizing that it was my idea. Perhaps Mr. Trump felt that he was able to convey something nefarious without using specific words that would incriminate him.
If he had actually been able to accomplish that feat, we might agree that an argument for "perfection" could be made.
Harold Sackrowitz
Highland Park, N.J.
To the Editor:
Re "Facts vs. Baseless Claims About a Biden and China" (news article, Oct. 4):
What we do know about Hunter Biden's business in China is that without the name Biden he would be "a beggar at the door" in international financial circles, and so would various Trump family members who profit from the Trump presidency.
That "everybody does it" does not excuse such political profiteering or make it less unseemly. To avoid the appearance of quid pro quo, there should be strict laws enforcing the emoluments clause against politicians and their relatives while they hold office.

A better kind of pay to play

Texto completo: The National Collegiate Athletic Association has had many chances over many years to reform its exploitative rules. It has instead remained content to funnel millions of dollars a year to universities, coaches, athletic directors, broadcasters, sports-apparel companies and, naturally, NCAA executives -- while leaving student athletes out in the cold.
It's commendable, then, that California has taken matters into its own hands in an effort to get fairer treatment for students. We worry that its solution doesn't address the root of the problem -- that college should be more about learning than making money -- but it's a good start toward change.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, this week signed into law a measure to allow college athletes to earn money from endorsements. "Every single student in the university can market their name, image and likeness," he said. "The only group that can't are athletes. Why is that?"
The Fair Pay to Play Act, the first of its kind in the country, challenges long-standing rules that bar students on athletic scholarships from being paid beyond the value of their scholarship -- and the NCAA is apoplectic. In a letter to Newsom, NCAA's Board of Governors threatened to ban California athletes from its competitions, and it has suggested it might sue.
The law takes effect in 2023, so the NCAA has time to devise its own solution. Hoping to stave off California's legislation, it had convened a committee, but California officials were rightly skeptical.
"People said, 'You know what, we've got to force their hands,'" Newsom told the New York Times. "They only do the right thing when they're sued or they're forced to do the right thing." That the measure passed unanimously and has led other states to consider similar action should prod the NCAA to confront its hypocrisy.
Allowing student athletes to make money through endorsement deals, however, will help only a small number of college athletes in certain sports at certain schools in certain markets. Attention needs to be paid to the students recruited on sports scholarships who won't get endorsement deals, who won't go on to play professional sports and who find out the hard way that their four years on the field or in the gym have left them poorly prepared for life.

Texto completo: The latest book on Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a critical biography from two New York Times reporters that made new sexual assault charges that were immediately undermined, has suffered an epic sales crash, according to publishing insiders.
Expected to sell at least 10,000-12,000 in the first two weeks and propel The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation onto the newspaper’s bestseller hardcover list, it has sold about a third of that in the first two weeks.
A publishing source provided the latest BookScan numbers, which can account for about 80% of sales. That number is 3,120. “If you add in ebooks — they may have sold a total of 4,000. That's one of the most epic bombs in political publishing over the past decade,” said the source.
By comparison, another Kavanaugh book, Justice on Trial: The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court, which details the Democratic war on the Trump nominee, has sold 60,000 books and a total of 100,000 copies since its July 9 debut. It was written by Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino and published by Regnery.
The book from Times staffers Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly was immediately panned by critics when a story excerpted in the paper failed to give all the details about another alleged sexual assault by the judge of a college student. Once provided, they undermined the charge.
For example, in the book but not in the initial Times coverage, friends of the alleged victim said she did not recall the attack.
The pushback by conservatives and supporters of President Trump and Kavanaugh was harsh and hurt sales, said another publishing source who has handled several Washington-related nonfiction works.
Amazon on Friday ranked The Education of Brett Kavanaugh #6,795.

Texto completo: The thought occurred to Otto Wheeler. So he did just that.
Five years later, he finished it.
Because, after all, who doesn’t have a best-selling book in ’em? Isn’t it everyone’s dying wish to write the Great American novel?
There’s a freedom and an exhilaration in writing a book, and Otto Wheeler, 71, felt the same liberation and joy with a wonderful project endorsed by his wife, Suzy. What began as a fanciful whim turned into a full-fledged, 125-page manuscript called “The Greatest Game Ever Played (Maybe).”
For the half-dozen or so who have read the manuscript, it’s an entertaining read for the most part. Some might recommend he not quit his day job, had he already not abandoned his lifelong work as an Austin tax accountant two years ago, but that’s OK with him.
Wheeler doesn’t care. He can take criticism. He just had as much fun as the White Deer native in the Texas Panhandle has ever had.
This tall, silver-haired gentleman with the gold-rimmed glasses first conceived the idea years ago when the notion was borne of a chance meeting he had with former American-Statesman features writer Pam LeBlanc as they shared their love of bike-riding.
Wheeler told her he was considering writing a book.
“What’s keeping you?” LeBlanc asked.
“She kind of threw down the gauntlet,” Wheeler said.
So he began typing. Weekends. Evenings. Spare moments.
Occasionally, the project sat idle for a few months. But he always returned to it. One page led to another. By the time he was finished, he’d put 50,000 words on his Word document.
His fictitious story chronicles a current-day season pitting two junior college football powers in Mobile, Ala., and Houma, La., competing for the mythical Southern Athletic Conference championship.
Wheeler drew on his own experiences as a safety for his high school football team that reached the Class A quarterfinals his senior year, his torn knee ligaments suffered in August practice notwithstanding. Seven of his teammates went on to play college football for teams as diverse as Oklahoma and Abilene Christian.
But he went on the road for research, too.
He traveled to Memphis to check out the Liberty Bowl, the site of his title game. He spoke to broadcasting legend Bill Mercer, who has covered everything from wrestling to the Ice Bowl, about the ins and outs of announcing a game. He interviewed Ed Hochuli, the muscle-ripped referee who happened to be speaking to a convention of straight-laced CPAs and was more than happy to share insights on 17 years of NFL officiating. He spoke to former Longhorns quarterback Case McCoy, the hero in wins over Oklahoma and Texas A&M, for a lot of football terminology.
He traveled to Copperas Cove to check out an East Mississippi Community College game, the focus of the ESPN series “Last Chance U.” He scoured college rosters to come up with intriguing, real first names, long a fascination of his. Like Houma running back D’Quell Thibodeaux and defensive tackle Le’Veon Elmore, who spells his name “with the comma on top.”
Oddly enough, Wheeler considers himself one of the most unlikely people to take on the adventure of writing a book. Writing wasn’t the strong suit of this 1971 Texas Tech grad.
“I nearly flunked out of college because I couldn’t write,” he joked. “My first paper in English, I got a big red F. The next one was a D-minus. I eventually made a C, and that was the happiest C I ever made in my life.”
He later ran down that former English professor at San Angelo State to personally thank him.
“This has been one of the most fun things I’ve ever done in my life,” he said. “It was a hoot.”
The manuscript could use some editing here, some tightening there. Parts are way too formal, like boring descriptions of the duties of each official, and come off a bit stilted and dry. He can overdo some cornball phrasing. A little too much “like a fat boy on a see-saw.”
But there’s some really colorful writing and vivid phrasing and terrific character development. He goes overboard in his descriptions at times, but he brings his characters to life. He’s got an easy, readable style, but at times it reads more like a thesis than captivating fiction.
My absolute favorite was his chapter on side judge Trent Zurn, a Hochuli wannabe who meets a Southern belle wearing a LSU jersey in a Memphis honkytonk. It’s easily his best work, a free-wheeling style he should seek to copy in the rest of the book.
Some readers might be put off by his decision to write about every single play in his mythical game because, well, let’s admit, every play just isn’t that compelling. But there’s enough flavor with a streaker and trick plays and love interests to keep you turning the pages. Dan Jenkins would be proud of his effort.
We won’t spoil the ending here in case he eventually lands a publisher and winds up on The New York Times best-seller list. Who knows. He followed his dream, and he’s sent off for a copyright.
There’s even a second book he’s working out in his mind.
“Yeah, one about two lawyers at a firm who get divorced and ...”
Look out, John Grisham.

Sanders's Campaign Says He Will Be Ready for Democrats' Next Debate

Texto completo: The Vermont senator's wife said he is in good spirits and should be able to return home by the end of this coming weekend.
Senator Bernie Sanders, recovering in a Las Vegas hospital from a procedure to treat a clogged artery, should be able to return home by the end of this weekend and will participate in the next Democratic debate, his wife, Jane Sanders, said Thursday.
"Bernie is up and about," Ms. Sanders said in a statement on Thursday. "We expect Bernie will be discharged and on a plane back to Burlington before the end of the weekend."
Mr. Sanders's campaign has declined to say whether he had suffered a heart attack, and his wife's statement did not address that.
On Wednesday, Mr. Sanders's campaign said he experienced "some chest discomfort" during an event on Tuesday evening; a medical evaluation found blockage in one artery, and two stents were inserted. He has canceled a two-day college tour this week in California, and his aides have not said when he would return to the campaign trail.
Placing stents in arteries is a common procedure, and patients generally return home within a day or two. Ms. Sanders did not specify whether Mr. Sanders, 78, would be discharged sooner than the weekend and would remain in Las Vegas before returning home.
Dr. Brahmajee Nallamothu, an interventional cardiologist at the University of Michigan, said it is hard to read too much into Mr. Sanders's apparently prolonged hospital stay. If a blood vessel's anatomy is complex, he said, cardiologists might keep a patient for an extra day. But a stay of several days, he said, "is not typical unless there is an additional issue."
Dr. Nallamothu said he had watched a video of Mr. Sanders's event at a Las Vegas restaurant Tuesday night when the senator, looking distressed, removed his jacket and asked for a chair so he could sit down. The symptoms, Dr. Nallamothu said, suggest that Mr. Sanders might have had a small heart attack -- defined as a blockage that results in some damage to the heart muscle -- or almost had a small heart attack. But he does not seem to have had a major one.
With a smaller heart attack, a blood vessel is mostly blocked but a trickle of blood can still get through. If the person is sitting still, that can be enough blood to relieve symptoms. But if the person is standing and moving around -- as Mr. Sanders was originally-- the paucity of blood can cause chest pain and discomfort.
In her statement, Ms. Sanders, who traveled on Wednesday to Las Vegas and is now with Mr. Sanders as he recovers, said her husband was in a buoyant mood, that doctors were "pleased" with Mr. Sanders's progress and that he had not needed any additional procedures.
Former Senator Harry Reid of Nevada visited Mr. Sanders on Thursday at Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center. In a brief phone interview, Mr. Reid said Mr. Sanders "looked really good."
He said Mr. Sanders had been sitting in a big chair but "jumped right up" when he arrived and that the two spoke for about a half-hour, on topics including health care and his grandson, who works for Mr. Sanders's campaign as a videographer. With Mr. Sanders were his wife; Faiz Shakir, his campaign manager; and Ari Rabin-Havt, a deputy campaign manager, he said.
"Bernie is not a backslapping joke teller; he's a very serious man always," Mr. Reid said. "He feels good, he smiled."
Internally, the campaign is trying to keep its staff motivated. Two advisers, Nina Turner and Jeff Weaver, led an all-staff conference call on Thursday, a campaign aide said, that appeared aimed at energizing the staff. "We are not taking our foot off the gas," Ms. Turner said.
Still, the incident is likely to intensify the focus on Mr. Sanders's age, but also on age generally in the Democratic race, where the three top candidates -- Mr. Sanders, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Elizabeth Warren -- are all in their 70s.
But if allies are projecting optimism about his ability to return to the race in full form, the medical episode has cast a shadow over his candidacy just as he was trying to reinvigorate his campaign and prepare for the next debate on Oct. 15.
In recent weeks, he has tried to improve his standing in the race by overtly stressing his electability -- an attempt to draw a contrast to Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren, who has continued to surge. On Tuesday, the Sanders campaign trumpeted its $ 25.3 million third-quarter fund-raising haul as it looked to put its summer woes behind it.
Mr. Sanders's heart trouble, however, could complicate his argument that he is the best positioned to defeat President Trump in the general election. On Wednesday, his campaign said he was postponing a highly-touted $ 1.3 million television ad buy in Iowa.
In an update on Thursday, the campaign said that it would begin airing the ad on Tuesday, and that it would run for two weeks as it had planned.
The Sanders campaign's reluctance to provide much information about his health has also not helped to quell concern.
Rebecca Katz, a progressive strategist who is not aligned with any candidate this cycle, said the Sanders campaign should be in "rapid response mode and giving out as many answers about Sanders's health as possible before more questions pile up."
"If everything is fine," she said, "The campaign should be operating as normal."
Since Wednesday, campaign aides have been trying to put the episode in a positive light, with some tweeting and retweeting well-wishes and encouragement. Surrogates and supporters have also expressed their solidarity. Some supporters have leveraged the episode into a rallying cry for fund-raising.
Mr. Sanders himself sent out a tweet on Wednesday thanking his well-wishers and using the opportunity to plug "Medicare for all." The tweet prompted some allies to praise him for being so devoted to his message.
The campaign said several surrogates would visit Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina this weekend.
Gina Kolata contributed reporting.

Texto completo: AMSTERDAM -- In 1998, Sirak Asfaw, a Dutch civil servant who was born in Ethiopia, noticed something shiny in the suitcase of a guest who was staying at his house. Curious, he opened the case to find a glittering gilded crown inside.
"I couldn't believe my eyes," Mr. Sirak, who moved to the Netherlands a political refugee in the 1970s, said in a recent interview in Amsterdam. "I felt betrayed. Using my house to smuggle cultural heritage from Ethiopia? I knew it had something to do with Ethiopian history, the Ethiopian kingdom. I knew this is not good."
Mr. Sirak said that he felt he couldn't return the crown to the Ethiopian authorities, because he suspected that the government might have been complicit in the theft, and he feared that it would be stolen again.
He also didn't want to hand it over to the Dutch authorities, because he worried that a museum would keep the crown forever rather than returning it when a new Ethiopian government was in place.
So Mr. Sirak locked the visitor out of his house, he said, and removed the crown from the suitcase. He did not identify the smuggler to The New York Times for fear of his safety, and said he didn't know how his guest had acquired it.
For 21 years, he hid it in his home. "When I saw it, I always felt very emotional," he said. "I knew it shouldn't be here, not in my house, not in the Netherlands."
Last year, after Ethiopia installed a new prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, Mr. Sirak decided that it was time to try to return the crown, confident that the new government would handle the return properly, he said.
He contacted an independent Dutch art crimes investigator, Arthur Brand, who placed the crown in a high-security art facility in the Netherlands and alerted the Dutch police.
Toon van Wijk, a spokesman for the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in an email exchange with The Times that officials were investigating. "Authenticity must be determined in cooperation with the Ethiopian authorities," he said. "Once the investigation has been completed, we must look at the next steps."
The Ethiopian ambassador to the Netherlands, Million Samuel Gebre, said in a telephone interview that discussions were underway with Ethiopia's Ministry of Tourism and Culture to return the work either to the church from which it was stolen or to a museum in Ethiopia.
"It's up to Ethiopian stakeholders to decide where it should go," he said.
Jacopo Gnisci, a research associate at Oxford University who specializes in Ethiopian artifacts, examined the crown in Amsterdam a few weeks ago and said he thought it was authentic.
He believes it was probably a liturgical crown used in Orthodox Christian ceremonies. Mr. Gnisci also tracked down a photograph in which a priest is wearing the crown in 1993, a few years before it disappeared.
The crown was probably stolen in the 1990s from a church in the village of Cheleqot, 75 miles from the border with Eritrea, Mr. Gnisci said.
The researcher said it was a rare object, one of only about 20 such liturgical crowns in existence.
"If I had to put a price tag on it, I'd say 40,000 to 50,000 euros" -- about $ 44,000 to $ 55,000 -- Mr. Gnisci said in a telephone interview. That figure, he said, "is at the highest possible end of the market for Ethiopian artifacts, just under the price you'd fetch for an illuminated manuscript."
The object has surfaced at a time of increased international debate about the return of African art and artifacts to their places of origin.
President Emmanuel Macron of France made a pledge in 2017 that he would prioritize the "temporary or permanent restitution" of African artifacts to their countries of origin within the next five years. A report, commissioned by Mr. Macron and released in 2018, recommended the return of some objects from French museums.
But "not much further has happened" since then, said Dr. Barbara Plankensteiner, a former curator of African art at Yale University Art Gallery.
Nevertheless, she added, "the whole environment in public opinion and among political decision makers is much more open to restitution now than it was five years ago."
Ethiopian officials have been working with the Victoria and Albert Museum in London to seek the return of 19th-century Ethiopian objects, including a crown, a chalice, a wedding dress and jewelry, that were looted by British troops. This year the museum's director, Tristram Hunt, said he was discussing a plan to loan the works to Addis Ababa for a temporary exhibition.
In April, the National Army Museum in London returned two locks of hair from the head of a 19th-century Ethiopian emperor, which had been a part of its collection, after a request from the country.
Mr. Gnisci said he thought the Ethiopian crown found by Mr. Sirak would be a test of Ethiopia's ability to care for such objects.
"There are a number of really important medieval ecclesiastical sites and ecclesiastical treasures that are every day at risk of destruction because of neglect and a lack of conservation measures," Mr. Gnisci said. "There's a lot more work that needs to be done in the country, so hopefully this will encourage the government to work more closely and more carefully on its heritage."
Mr. Sirak said he would like for the crown to be given to the National Museum of Ethiopia in Addis Ababa.
"That's the safest place for it, but I trust that the Ethiopian government will take care of it," he said. "Now it is in safe hands, and I'm a bit relieved."

Multi-award winning songstress/ actress Brandy is celebrating the 25th anniversary of her self-titled debut album with the release of a new song "Freedom Rings." The new track was released on Brand New Entertainment/Entertainment One and is available now. Last season, Brandy appeared on the Fox show "Star" alongside Queen Latifah and Patti Labelle. Brandy's self-titled debut album, "Brandy," was released on Sept. 27, 1994. My, how time flies.

Trump's wrongs don't make a right for Bidens

Texto completo: Let's be clear: President Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was not "beautiful" or "perfect." Far from it. Trump should not have asked Zelenskiy to investigate Hunter Biden or to cooperate with his private attorney Rudolph Giuliani's investigation of the former vice president's son. Since Trump made no promises or threats in the call, it is a stretch to claim his conduct rises to the level of "high crimes and misdemeanors." But it was highly inappropriate.
However, it does not follow that Trump's malfeasance absolves Joe Biden and his son of their malfeasance. Two things can be true at the same time: that Trump did something wrong, and that Joe and Hunter Biden did something wrong as well. This seems to be lost on many in the media, who are bending over backward to absolve the Bidens of wrongdoing.
For example, many in the media state as fact that Biden's actions in encouraging the firing of Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin had nothing to do with his investigation of the natural gas company, Burisma, which employed Hunter Biden as a board member. His firing was justified, they say, because the U.S. government, the International Monetary Fund and other U.S. allies were demanding he be fired as well. Furthermore, as CNN's Jake Tapper insisted this weekend, "according to the Ukrainians that investigation (into Burisma) was dormant at the time."
First, the phrase "dormant" means, by definition, that an investigation into Burisma existed and was not closed. Second, we don't know for certain that the Burisma investigation was, in fact, "dormant." Shokin has sworn in an affidavit it was not. His successor says it was. Who is lying? Nobody knows for sure. Journalists don't get to choose which version they prefer and report it as fact.
But here is what is incontestably true: Joe Biden had a conflict of interest. His son took a position with a Ukrainian natural gas company, despite having no experience in Ukraine or natural gas, the very same month the elder Biden visited Kiev and urged Ukraine to increase its natural gas production. As Yoshiko Herrera, an expert in Russia and Eurasia policy at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, put it, "conflict-of-interest rules should have applied."
The latest spin is that there is nothing to see here because, as Reuters reports, the investigation of Burisma "focused solely on activity that took place before Hunter Biden, son of former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, was hired to sit on its board." Did it occur to anyone that maybe that is precisely why Burisma hired the American vice president's son? According to The New York Times, Biden's hiring "allowed Burisma to create the perception that it was backed by powerful Americans." As Robert Weissman, president of the progressive watchdog Public Citizen, has said, "It's hard to avoid the conclusion that Hunter's foreign employers and partners were seeking to leverage Hunter's relationship with Joe, either by seeking improper influence or to project access to him." The revelation that Hunter Biden accepted a job with a Ukrainian company that was under investigation while his father was taking the lead in fighting corruption in Ukraine is damning, not exculpatory.
Biden knew about his son's involvement with Burisma, because the New Yorker has reported that in December 2015 Obama energy czar Amos Hochstein "raised the matter with Biden." We also know, via The New York Times, that "some State Department officials had expressed concern that Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine could complicate his father's diplomacy there." No doubt, there is a paper trail at the State Department to that effect.
The Code of Federal Regulations clearly states that when a federal official takes action he knows will affect "a relative with whom the employee has a close personal relationship" and "the circumstances would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question his impartiality in the matter, the employee should not participate in the matter." In other words, Joe Biden should not have taken the lead on Ukraine policy while Hunter Biden was working for Burisma. And even if Shokin deserved to be fired, Biden had no business being the one to deliver the ultimatum.
Hunter Biden's business dealings, in Ukraine and elsewhere, are crying out for investigation. That does not mean it was appropriate for Trump to raise them with the Ukrainian president. But the fact that Trump did so does not give the media carte blanche to make excuses for the Biden family.

Texto completo: Acclaimed investigative journalist Bob Woodward was booed by a crowd while interviewing two New York Times journalists who wrote a book about reporting on the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse scandal.
The event happened Thursday in Washington, D.C., and was attended by a number of reporters. Some took to Twitter to describe how the audience reacted to Woodward’s questioning of the Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor. The event centered around the duo’s book, She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story That Helped Ignite a Movement.
Woodward, 76, reportedly kept interrupting the women during the public interview. He also tried to steer the conversation toward talking about sex, according to the Washington Post.
About 20 minutes into the interview, after Woodward continued to interrupt and ask for clarification on facts, one person shouted, “You’re interrupting her!”
Woodward at one point told Twohey and Kantor that they were dodging his question about motivations behind Weinstein’s abuse, prompting a number of those in attendance to yell, “Stop!”
Journalist Kara Swisher tweeted that Woodward was “blowing this interview.”
“Interruptive, not focused on the women who were victimized by Harvey Weinstein and weirdly obsessed with that creep, it’s a exercise in how not to interview. The crowd no like,” Swisher said.

Some people reportedly walked out of the event.

At one point, Woodward accused the two of dodging a question about the motivation behind Weinstein’s behavior.
“I’ll tell you what we know. It’s that this story is an X-ray into power, and how power works,” Kantor responded.
“It’s also about sex, isn’t it?” Woodward queried, but was met by derision from the audience, with many shouting, “No!”
Woodward addressed the event in an email afterward.
“As a longtime believer in the First Amendment, I am glad people got to express themselves. Jodi and Megan signed a copy of their book for me after the session, which I enjoyed very much, and said, 'Thank you for the fabulous questions.’ So there may be a difference of opinion,” he wrote.
Twohey and Kantor didn’t address the matter in an email after the event.
“We’re just starting our book tour, and we’re grateful to all the moderators — Bob Woodward, Katie Couric, America Ferrera and many others — who have agreed to join us onstage,” they wrote.
“We welcome all questions, from them and especially from the audience, because each one is an opportunity to relate the wrenching decisions that many of our sources had to make and grapple with MeToo as an example and test of social change in our time,” the two added.

Maine GOP will follow Democrats in holding a new presidential primary in 2020

Texto completo: AUGUSTA, Maine -- The Maine Republican Party will hold a presidential primary in March as it looks to renominate President Donald Trump, following Democrats in using a new law allowing a move from party-run caucuses to the first nominating primaries here since 2000.
The Democratic-led Legislature passed a law allowing the switch to state-run primaries this year after the 2016 election was marked by crowded municipal caucuses on the Democratic side and hard-to-reach regional caucuses on the Republican side. The shift is optional for parties.
The two parties are in much different positions approaching the 2020 election. The Republican National Committee has melded with Trump's re-election campaign and he faces only longshot challengers in his own party, while 19 well-known Democrats are running for the nomination.
Six Republican state parties have canceled presidential caucuses or primaries, according to the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. Republicans in 19 states did that for incumbent George W. Bush in 2004 and Democrats in 13 states did it in 2012 for Barack Obama, neither of whom faced serious primary opposition.
Maine won't be one of them. The party's state committee voted unanimously in September to hold a primary, said Jason Savage, the executive director of the Maine Republican Party. He said it was the best way to conform to state law and party rules while ensuring the highest turnout by allowing Republicans to vote in their towns.
"It seemed like the smart thing to do and the most people will be able to participate," he said.
Savage said all of Maine's delegates will be awarded to a candidate who wins more than 50 percent of votes. The New York Times reported Wednesday that state delegate plans -- due to the national party this week -- follow a Trump campaign effort to avoid a contentious national convention in 2020. Maine Republicans had a similar 50 percent rule during the 2016 caucuses.
The decision leaves a small opening for Trump's challengers -- former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford and former U.S. Rep. Joe Walsh of Illinois -- though a national poll released Wednesday by The Economist and YouGov said Trump had 87 percent support from Republicans, while Weld had 2 percent. The others had 1 percent each.
Under the new law, all Republican and Democratic primary candidates will still have to get signatures from at least 2,000 registered voters to appear on the ballot. Savage said that would be "a heavy lift for anybody who doesn't have organizational infrastructure here."
Savage said the party made its decision in part because of how Democratic Gov. Janet Mills handled a new law enshrining ranked-choice voting in presidential races. It will be used in the general election, but she delayed the law's effective date until after the March 3 primaries.
Republicans generally oppose the voting method that Maine became the first state to use in after a 2016 referendum. Savage said members do not want to be forced to use it.

LEADING OFF
Happy Thursday and welcome to Rhode Map, your daily guide to everything happening in the Ocean State. I'm Dan McGowan and I prefer Pizza Hut over Domino's. Follow me on Twitter @DanMcGowan or send tips to Dan.McGowan@globe.com.
Barrington High School has won the bragging rights for best average SAT score among Rhode Island's public schools during the 2018-19 school year, narrowly edging out East Greenwich for the crown.
A school-by-school breakdown of SAT and PSAT scores released by the state Thursday shows the average Rhode Island student scored 957 (out of 1,600) on the math and English sections of the SAT, and 904 (out of 1,520) on the PSAT.
The high school exams don't typically get as much attention as tests given to students in grades three through eight, but Rhode Island is now among the states that are using the PSAT and SAT as the go-to standardized assessment for high school students. The tests are now administered in school, and are free of charge.
Here's a look of the top performers on each test.
SAT
Barrington High – 1,194
East Greenwich High – 1,191
Classical High – 1,144
North Kingstown High – 1,115
South Kingstown High – 1,097
PSAT
Barrington High – 1,083
Classical High – 1,049
East Greenwich High – 1,045
North Kingstown High – 1,030
Exeter-West Greenwich High – 1,014
When you dig a little deeper, the results offer mixed news for the state.
More than 50 percent of 11th graders are meeting or exceeding expectations in English based on their SAT scores, but only 31 percent are reading at grade level. Roughly 60 percent of PSAT takers are at grade level in English, while 31 percent are proficient in math.
There are still wide achievement gaps between students with disabilities and English learners compared to their peers, and low-income students continue to score far behind more affluent kids.
In a statement, Education Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green called on districts to create action plans to increase participation and improve outcomes in the future. She said she remains alarmed that too many students are graduating from high school without being ready for college or their careers.
“There is a disconnect, and I want to work with our partners across the state to set explicit goals to get our high school students where they need to be in order to be successful after graduation," she said.
Now all eyes shift to results for younger students on the Rhode Island Comprehensive Assessment System (RICAS) exam, which are expected to be released by the end of the month.

Texto completo: Bruce Springsteen has a story to tell.
That's one aspect of a young Springsteen that former manager Carl "Tinker" West noticed early on.
"He's a good storyteller," said West, who's also a giant in the surfing world thanks to his founding of Challenger Eastern Surfboards in Ocean Township. "Vini (Lopez of the future E Street Band) brought him over to the shop (in Ocean Township). He was a smart kid, sort of quiet and he wrote songs. I said, 'You just keep writing something, you guys rehearse — work here all day, make surfboards and rock 'n' roll.'"
That was the plan. It worked.
Springsteen has sold millions of records, plays to stadiums around the world, is enshrined in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016, all for his rock 'n' rolling.
Now Springsteen, who turned 70 Monday, he's in an era of new artistic pursuits, new creative formats. The latest is the movie "Western Stars," a filmed version of his latest album. He co-directed "Western Stars" with frequent collaborator Thom Zimny. The film features a performance of the folk-rock orchestral album, and vignettes starring a solo Springsteen.
The film follows the hit "Springsteen on Broadway," which featured the Boss baring his life story, set to song and remembrance. "Springsteen on Broadway" ran from October 2017 to December 2018.
The music play was based on his New York Times best-selling memoir "Born to Run," which was released in September 2016. Springsteen did a nine-city book tour, where he greeted thousands of fans in person for hours at a stretch in a feat of physical and mental stamina.
The Boss stood on a platform, under lights, while he met fans.
Cindy Marselis of Huntington Valley, Pennsylvania, was in tears after meeting Springsteen at the Freehold Barnes and Noble signing on Sept. 27, 2016.
"I met the person I always wanted to meet," said Marselis, at the signing. "I got to kiss him. It was awesome."
Springsteen is still telling stories, and still on stage. But now he's exploring new formats for the stories, and the stories he's telling are largely his own these days.
"I think he's said this before, but he truly envisions himself as an artist and I feel that all of these projects are in service of him wanting to tap into all of the different facets of who he is," said Caroline Madden, 26, of Toms River.
Madden is set to release a book on Springsteen's music in films and TV, "Springsteen as Soundtrack: The Sound of the Boss in Film and Television," from McFarland & Co. "That's why he's so unique and has endured as an artist for so long – he doesn't settle. He's always looking to renew himself or try something new."
West saw that creative energy up close when Springsteen fronted the band Steel Mill, which West managed and did sound for.
"I liked Springsteen because those guys would go in the back of the shop and they would rehearse," West said. "Vini Lopez, Danny Federici, they would write lots of music and whenever we'd get a couple of songs together that were pretty good, we'd go and try it out at Pandemonium, right at the bottom of Sunset Avenue."
The club was less than a mile from West's surfboard factory.
"What changes his music is that he wants to write something different," West said. "He writes some great stories. Stories to me are what makes great music, especially the early stuff. The first two albums ('Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.' and 'The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle'), people are still asking for those songs. Even so, he's written a lot of stuff after that's pretty damn good."
West and Springsteen's enduring friendship is explored in the book "Born to Run" and, subsequently in "Springsteen on Broadway." A highlight of the play is West, Springsteen and West's dog driving out west in West's 1950 Chevy flat-bed truck to play a concert and meet music industry contacts.
Springsteen didn't know how to drive until he drove the Chevy truck with West in the passenger seat. West still owns the truck.
"He knew what he wanted to do, I'm pretty sure," said West of Springsteen's artistic drive. "He wanted to wow an audience and he did. He had a great band. Federici was great. Lopez was great. Little Vinnie Roslin was great."
West used his connections and hustle to get a deal with Paramount Records.
"I finally found a deal that wouldn't screw him over," West said. "Then he said 'I don't want to do Steel Mill anymore.' (I said) That's up to you."
"I introduced him to Mike Appel. He introduced him to John Hammond and the rest is history," said West of Springsteen's subsequent manager and the of the famed Columbia Records talent scout. .
The stories Springsteen has been telling in recent years are stark, revealing and confessional.
"For a long time, if I loved you or if I felt a deep attachment to you, I would hurt you if I could," says Springsteen in "Western Stars."
He talked without censor of his troubled relationship with his father in "Springsteen on Broadway" and has been candid about his struggles with mental illness.
"I have come close enough to (mental illness) where I know I am not completely well myself," Springsteen previously told Esquire. "I've had to deal with a lot of it over the years, and I'm on a variety of medications that keep me on an even keel; otherwise I can swing rather dramatically and ... just ... the wheels can come off a little bit. So we have to watch, in our family. I have to watch my kids, and I've been lucky there. It ran in my family going way before my dad."
Springsteen is married to Patti Scialfa and they have three children, Evan, 29; Jessica, 27; and Sam, 25.
Springsteen's non-rock 'n' roll work of the past few years has also framed the aging process for fans. He's showing the way to baby boomers about what to do, how to do it, and what's important in life when you get to a certain age.
The fans of his generation might have looked to John Lennon for the answers, but he didn't get to grow old like Springsteen. Lennon would have been 78 if he were still alive.
"Aging is scary but fascinating, and great talent morphs in strange and often enlightening ways," said Springsteen in "Born to Run."
There no official events planned to recognize Springsteen's 70th birthday, but"Springsteen: His Hometown," an exhibit presented by the Monmouth County Historical Association and the Bruce Springsteen Archives and Center for American Music at Monmouth University, opens Sunday at the historical association in Freehold. Ticket information is at www.SpringsteenHisHometown.com.
Preview showings of "Western Stars" are scheduled for Oct. 19 and 23 in area movie theaters. Visit www.fathomevents.com for more info and tickets.
As for the E Street Band, Springsteen ain't done yet, despite the success he's had with his new avenues of artistic expression.
"We want the band to get back together," Springsteen said to applause at the Toronto International Film Festival. "I've got some songs written for the band and I'd like to make a really good rock band record with the E Street Band.
"We'll be seeing you."

Did President Trump commit treason?

Texto completo: Let's say we had a president who did the following: Redistributed wealth by taxing the rich and giving to the poor. Boosted entitlements. Signed a law to strengthen workplace safety. Poured money into cleaning up the environment. Even helped finance National Public Radio. Liberals would be pleased, right?
We did have such a president. His name was Richard Nixon.
Of course, all this is largely forgotten today, overshadowed by Nixon's involvement in Watergate -- the scandal that drove him from the Oval Office in 1974, as House impeachment and possibly even Senate conviction were nipping at his heels.
Because of this mixed legacy, Nixon ranks as the 28th best president (or the 16th worst, depending on how you look at it) in a 2017 C-SPAN survey of historians. In 10 categories, he scores near the middle for most, though 10th for "International Relations." But in terms of "Moral Authority" he's near the bottom, ranked 42nd. Lying to the American people and covering up a Constitution-shredding crime will do that to a guy.
President Donald Trump will be included in the next survey, which is taken every time we have a new president. Where do you think he'll rank? For starters, let's compare his actions with all the Nixon accomplishments mentioned above.
Trump is the anti-Nixon. After lying through his teeth in 2017 about how "the rich will not be gaining at all with this plan," he gave them (and himself) a huge tax break.
Entitlements? He has reportedly told Senate Republicans that cutting Social Security and Medicare could be a second-term project. We got a preview of his plans to do just that in his 2020 budget blueprint. Funny, Trump likes to run his mouth on Twitter and at his rallies, but this is something he hasn't blabbed to his wide-eyed, believe-whatever-he-says base.
Strengthen workplace safety? "We want to protect our workers," Trump said in 2017. But that was another lie. His administration has rolled back worker protections, making already dangerous jobs like coal mining, working on oil rigs and in meat processing plants even more so. Overall, "they've done more things to hurt workers than they have to help them," AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said last month on Fox News Sunday.
Public health endangered
And cleaning up the environment? Nixon proposed a new Environmental Protection Agency in July 1970, and it began operations five months later. Trump has gutted it, and when he brags about all the regulations he has cut -- to the wild applause of his base -- what he's not telling them is that he is endangering the air they breathe and the water they drink. They applaud and then go home, apparently oblivious to the 85 (and counting) rules he has rolled back. Air pollution, water pollution, toxic substances, on and on and on.
There's more, but you get the point: Trump is worse than Nixon. And I haven't even gotten to the scandals. What Trump has done is far more damaging to our country. To me, it can be summed up from just one event: his infamous meeting in the Oval Office in May 2017 with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.
It was bad enough that Trump revealed highly classified information that, according to two unnamed officials cited in The New York Times, exposed an intelligence source in the Middle East. But we've since learned -- based on three sources obtained by The Washington Post -- that Trump told his Kremlin guests he didn't care that the Russians had interfered in our 2016 election.
'Aid and comfort' to an enemy
An enemy attacks us and our commander in chief doesn't care? If this is true then I will use, for the first time, a word that distresses me deeply: treason. This isn't just my view. Article 3, Section 3 of our beloved Constitution says: "Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort."
The Russians attacked us. If the commander in chief who swore to defend us said it didn't bother him, this is "giving them aid and comfort." The Russians are surely gearing up for more mayhem in 2020, and what does Trump care? Treason.
Now we learn that Trump has leaned on foreign governments like Ukraine and Australia to dig up dirt that would help him politically. For all his dirty tricks, Richard Nixon never would have dreamed of doing that.
Trump is a man with no ethical compass or shred of decency. Worse than Nixon? Worse in every way. And worse than all the rest.

BUSINESS BEAT; Future of Boeing CEO tied to fate of 737 Max jetliner; Crucial tests loom for grounded plane as it tries to resume flight.

Texto completo: Boeing Co. is entering a crucial month for its grounded 737 Max jetliner and its chief executive.
Dennis Muilenburg's future is inextricably tied to that of the plane, which is nearing a key test with the Federal Aviation Administration amid a flying ban in its seventh month after two deadly crashes. If regulators approve the aircraft to return to the skies, Boeing's bestselling jet must still win acceptance from flight crews and the flying public.
For Muilenburg, there's no playbook for charting a comeback from one of the worst calamities in the history of the aerospace industry. But investors have been betting on Boeing's resurgence in recent weeks, and any fresh setback for the company's biggest source of profit would increase the murmurs for a leadership change.

"This is not about me, right? It's about our company and what we do for our customers," Muilenburg said in an interview when asked if he is the right person to lead Boeing through the crisis. "I will serve in this role with everything that I have as long as the board wants me serving in this role."
Muilenburg, an aerospace engineer by training and a Boeing lifer, has served as the plane maker's public face throughout the Max crisis. That's made him a target of critics who contend Boeing was too slow to fully explain the role its flight-control software played in the crashes that killed 346 people and prompted the global grounding in March.
The Max's design and safety face renewed scrutiny after the Seattle Times and New York Times published excerpts from a whistleblower complaint filed internally by a Boeing engineer who helped design the Max's flight controls. Boeing tumbled 2%, closing at $367.56 after the reports, amid a broad market sell-off.
In the document, later shared with U.S. Justice Department investigators, Curtis Ewbank said his managers and Michael Teal, the 737 Max's chief project engineer, repeatedly rejected adding a safety backstop on the basis of cost and impact on pilot training. The synthetic airspeed system, used on Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, might have counteracted a sensor that malfunctioned in both crashes.
Muilenburg faces a grilling before the U.S. Congress on Oct. 30, a year and a day after a Lion Air jet plunged into the Java Sea off the coast of Indonesia. An Ethiopian Airlines jet fell out of the sky less than five months later.
Inside Boeing, Muilenburg is carrying out a board-ordered revamp that gives directors an unfiltered view of concerns flagged by employees, while adding initiatives of his own to sharpen the focus on safety.
The overhaul is "a very clear note that the board is paying very, very close attention and monitoring things," said Jim Schrager, a professor of entrepreneurship and strategy at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business.
"Dennis has, and has always had, the full, unequivocal and enthusiastic support of the Boeing board of directors," the company's lead outside director, David Calhoun, said in a statement.
Muilenburg has been "incredibly supportive" of the board's new Aerospace Safety Committee, said Edmund Giambastiani, a Boeing director who will lead the oversight panel. "Dennis has the board's confidence," he said in an interview Sept. 25.
Boeing has taken to heart the aerospace industry's tradition of studying tragedies for ways to make flying safer, Muilenburg said in the interview at Boeing's Chicago headquarters. But he reiterated Boeing's oft-repeated refrain that there was no breakdown in the design and testing of the software feature known as MCAS that was implicated in both tragedies.
A report by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said Boeing classified MCAS' risk of failure as "major," the second-lowest of four hazard assessments. In addition, the manufacturer failed to conduct simulator testing of failure modes, such as a broken angle-of-attack vane, that could confuse pilots with multiple alarms.
"While that accident investigation and all the work we've been doing has been deep and intensive, we haven't found anything there that I would characterize as a problem or issue we're trying to solve," Muilenburg said. "Rather, when we look across what we've learned from both accidents, we always identify areas where we can improve."
In addition to the board oversight panel, Boeing is establishing a new product and services safety organization, which will have sweeping responsibility including investigating concerns raised anonymously by employees.
The head of the new unit, Beth Pasztor, will report to the board's safety committee as well as to Boeing's chief engineer, Greg Hyslop. Muilenburg is also restructuring Boeing's engineering corps. They will now report to Hyslop instead of business-unit managers.
Boeing is tackling the final technical work to persuade U.S. regulators to lift the grounding. Although no date has been set, the company is discussing the timing of the crucial certification flight with U.S. officials, and Muilenburg says the process is in the "endgame." Boeing is working to clear the plane for service in the fourth quarter.
Regulatory approval would be followed by the logistical challenges of putting hundreds of airplanes back in the sky after months in storage -- and eventually nursing the Max's 600-company supply chain back to working at full speed.
Before the grounding, the 737 program generated about 35% of Boeing's operating profit and cash flow, and 30% of the plane maker's revenue, according to Bloomberg Intelligence estimates.
"If you're Dennis, the program that matters absolutely the most to you beyond any other at the company is the 737," said George Ferguson, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. "You have to get that right."
Boeing shares have rallied over the last six weeks on the first signs of the Max's reentry into the commercial market. Since closing at $320.42 on Aug. 14, the stock had risen 17% through Tuesday.
But the profit Boeing is able to reap from the Max ultimately will hinge on the willingness of flight crews and travelers to set aside months of deep anxiety and bruising publicity surrounding a keystone of Boeing's future, said Schrager, the University of Chicago professor.
"The great unknown is how they fix this," he said, "and whether the 737 goes back into the world again as one of the safest airplanes ever made."

Texto completo: The process could be better, the judge said, but that was no reason to "dismantle a very fine admissions program."
In one of the most closely watched lawsuits concerning affirmative action and higher education, a federal judge on Tuesday ruled that Harvard could continue considering race in its admissions process in pursuit of a diverse class.
The plaintiffs, Students for Fair Admissions, made four claims: that Harvard had intentionally discriminated against Asian-Americans, used race as a predominant factor in admissions decisions, used racial balancing and considered the race of applicants without first exhausting race-neutral alternatives.
In her ruling, Judge Allison D. Burroughs detailed in a 130-page document why she believed the Harvard admissions process was not only fair, but committed to attracting applicants "who are exceptional across multiple dimensions."
An applicant's race was 'never viewed as a negative.'
The judge acknowledged that the Harvard admissions process was "not perfect," but that when the university considered race, it did so only to benefit applicants' chances -- as a "plus" factor -- not to hurt them.
Harvard admissions officers are allowed to take students' race directly into account only when assigning their "overall rating," at the end of the process, when race is one of several factors on the table. The magnitude of the plus factors that Harvard gives for race, the judge said, is modest, and never a "defining feature" of applications. On the whole, "race has no specified value in the admissions process and is never viewed as a negative attribute," the judge wrote.
The plaintiffs had argued that Harvard had given considerable weight to applicants' race, violating strict guidance by the Supreme Court.
In 2018, Harvard provided its admissions officers with more explicit guidelines on when and when not to use race in reviewing applications and during interviews.
There was no pattern in stereotyping Asian-Americans.
Asian-Americans have long been dogged by stereotypes that categorize them as "quiet," "hardworking," "bland" and "not exciting" -- stereotypes that the plaintiffs said appeared in Asian-American admissions files.
But the judge's ruling noted that the plaintiffs did not show that any applicant had been "referred to by these types of descriptors because of their race or that there was any sort of systemic reliance on racial stereotypes."
She also pointed out that African-American and Hispanic applicants had been described as "quiet," "shy" and "understated" by admissions officers.
The plaintiffs had argued that Asian-American applicants scored consistently lower than other races on their so-called personal ratings, a subjective measure that takes into account a student's background and character. The judge recognized that there was a disparity, but said that it was "small" and reflected neither intentional discrimination nor a process that failed to take unintended discrimination seriously.
'Sparse country' disparities did not sway the judge.
Students for Fair Admissions pointed out that in some of its search and recruitment efforts, Harvard lowered the required test scores for students from "sparse country" -- rural areas with historically low numbers of Harvard admits -- who identified as white, other or unidentified, but it did not lower the score for students from the same states who identified as Asian-American.
The judge dismissed the argument that this was proof the Asian-American population at Harvard was being intentionally suppressed. She pointed out that in more urban states where Asian-American and white students had similar backgrounds, Harvard had identified Asian-Americans for recruitment based on their lower ACT scores.
"Overall, the inconsistencies in the search criteria do not seem to be linked to efforts to advantage or disadvantage any particular racial group, and it was unclear from the testimony at trial whether these variations were accidental or intentional," she wrote.
'Race-neutral alternatives' are not sufficient.
The judge accepted Harvard's argument that it had adequately studied and exhausted race-neutral ways to maintain diversity on campus.
Some race-neutral alternatives, like admitting only students at the top of their classes, were simply unworkable, the judge said. To admit every applicant with a perfect grade-point average, Harvard would need to expand its class size by approximately 400 percent and then reject every applicant with an imperfect grade point average without regard to other factors, including extracurricular activities and life experiences.
The plaintiff had put forth other ideas, including considering socioeconomic background instead of race and eliminating strong admissions preferences for so-called A.L.D.C. students -- athletes, legacies (or children of alumni), those on the dean's and director's interest lists, and the children of faculty or staff.
The judge was skeptical that a socioeconomic approach would be truly race-neutral.
On A.L.D.C. students, the judge was somewhat deferential. Removing these preferences "would improve socioeconomic diversity," she wrote, but have limited impact on racial diversity and come at a steep cost to the university's athletics, donor relations and student life. Reasonable minds could differ on the importance of these things, she said, but the court "takes no position on these issues other than to note that these are topics best left to schools to figure out for themselves."
The admissions process at Harvard remains flawed.
While the judge found there was no intentional discrimination, the admissions process could likely be improved, she wrote.
Judge Burroughs made note of implicit bias a number of times in her decision, saying that it was conceivable that the unintentional biases of admissions officers -- and the guidance counselors and teachers who write recommendations -- could explain some of the statistical disparities between Asian-American students and other races.
But the likely effects of unintentional bias, while regrettable, were very slight, the judge said, and could not be totally eliminated in a process that requires judgments about individuals.
Harvard has made some changes since the plaintiff brought the lawsuit. The admissions procedures for the current freshman class explicitly directed officers that they "should not take an applicant's race or ethnicity into account in making any of the ratings other than the overall rating" and that for the overall rating the "consideration of race or ethnicity may be considered only as one factor among many."
The personal rating criteria has also been changed. Officers are instead asked to consider "qualities of character" such as "courage in the face of seemingly insurmountable obstacles," "leadership," "maturity," "genuineness, selflessness, humility," "resiliency," "judgment," "citizenship," and "spirit and camaraderie with peers."
"Harvard perhaps should have instituted an explicit written policy stating which ratings could take race into account before 2018, but that error has now been remedied," Judge Burroughs wrote. She also wrote that the process would likely benefit from implicit bias trainings for admissions officers.

Texto completo: RENO, Nev. -- Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Wednesday night delivered his most forceful response yet to President Trump's attacks on him and his son, accusing the Trump team of waging a campaign of "lies, smears, distortions and name calling" geared at knocking him out of the presidential race.
Mr. Biden made his comments during a campaign swing through Nevada after days of internal debate among his advisers over how best to refute unsubstantiated claims by the president and his personal lawyer that Mr. Biden improperly assisted his son's business ventures in Ukraine and China.
The counterattack, people close to Mr. Biden said, was intended to demonstrate what he had been promising supporters for the past week: that he would not let Mr. Trump "hijack" his campaign by allowing the president's narrative to take root. It was also intended to prove, in a walk-and-chew-gum kind of way, that he could multitask even when facing withering political fire -- unveiling a serious policy proposal on guns early Wednesday in Las Vegas, then pivoting to a sharp political attack by nightfall in the north.
In the speech, the former vice president said the attacks on his family were intended to divert attention from the widening impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump's attempts to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens -- and he cited them as proof that the White House feared him more than any other Democratic presidential contender.
"Let me make something clear to Trump and his hatchet men and the special interests funding his attacks against me: I'm not going anywhere," Mr. Biden told a crowd of about 500 at the Truckee Meadows Community College here.
"You're not going to destroy me," he said to cheers from supporters, a handful wearing "Impeach 45" jerseys. "And you're not going to destroy my family. I don't care how much money you spend or how dirty the attacks get."
The American people, Mr. Biden said, "know me and they know him. The idea of Donald Trump attacking anyone's credibility is a joke."
Earlier in the day, speaking at a gun safety forum in Las Vegas, Mr. Biden blasted the president and jokingly pretended to mispronounce the last name of his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who had communicated with Ukrainian officials on Mr. Trump's behalf.
He said there was "zero, zero, zero" evidence that his family had done anything wrong.
Mr. Biden's increasingly bitter fight with Mr. Trump comes at a potential tipping point in the 2020 Democratic presidential race. Until recently, Mr. Biden had been leading in most national polls since he entered the field last spring. But Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, fueled by a highly disciplined campaign, has surged in many early-voting states.
A Monmouth University national poll released Wednesday showed Mr. Biden locked in a statistical dead heat with Ms. Warren, who garnered 28 percent support from Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters to his 25 percent, a difference within the survey's margin of error.
At Wednesday night's rally, Mr. Biden took a swipe at some of his Democratic opponents who had accused him of focusing too much on Mr. Trump and not enough on issues facing voters.
"A lot of my opponents say we have to do more than just beat Donald Trump," he said. "I agree. We have to do more than beat Donald Trump. We have to beat him like a drum."
Mr. Biden's team has been alarmed by reports that Mr. Trump's supporters plan to launch an aggressive advertising campaign to portray the former vice president as the person who had acted improperly -- despite the lack of any evidence to support that claim.
And Mr. Biden's top advisers have been equally incensed by what they view as the news media's willingness to air unsupported allegations by Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani.
The president and his lawyer have alleged that Mr. Biden, as vice president, pressured the Ukrainians to force out a top prosecutor in order to derail an inquiry into a Ukrainian company that had paid his son, Hunter Biden. But Mr. Biden said Wednesday that he had been enforcing the demands of the Obama administration and other Western nations by seeking to replace the prosecutor with an official more committed to fighting corruption.
On Sunday, Anita Dunn and Kate Bedingfield, two senior Biden strategists, wrote to several major television networks asking them to stop booking Mr. Giuliani on their news programs, accusing him of spreading "debunked conspiracy theories."
Mr. Biden amplified that argument on Wednesday, urging reporters to regard Mr. Trump's statements, and his tweets, as not simply fodder for controversy but as a dangerous "abuse of power" that included enlisting foreign leaders as allies in his re-election effort.
Mr. Trump, he said, is "afraid of just how badly I would beat him next November."
The president, in his own remarks on Wednesday, did not agree.
"I'd rather run against Biden than almost any of those candidates," Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House.

Texto completo: Rather than split the contenders into two groups, party officials will guarantee that the leading candidates have a chance to face off against one another.
It's official: Biggest. Debate. Ever.
The next Democratic presidential primary debate, on Oct. 15 in Westerville, Ohio, will feature a super-size lineup of a dozen candidates onstage at once, party officials said on Wednesday.
Never before have so many presidential candidates shared a single stage in a primary debate, according to political historians who keep track of such things.
Eleven Republicans appeared together in September 2015 at a debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California. And lineups of 10 candidates have been relatively common in recent campaign years.
But the 12-candidate milestone had yet to be reached, setting up a challenge for the event's moderators, the CNN anchors Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooper and the national editor of The New York Times, Marc Lacey.
[What question would you ask the Democratic candidates? Our debate moderator wants your suggestions. ]
The Ohio debate, on the campus of Otterbein University, will feature the 10 candidates who appeared at last month's matchup in Houston. In addition, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and Tom Steyer, a billionaire and former hedge fund investor, qualified to appear, the party said.
Candidates had until 11:59 p.m. on Tuesday to meet the Democratic National Committee's requirements: amassing 130,000 individual donors and receiving 2 percent support in at least four qualifying polls.
The number of hopefuls sharing the stage is on the rise, but the overall field has grown smaller. Earlier this year, 20 candidates qualified for Democratic debates in Miami and Detroit. The party split those events into two nights, so that a maximum of 10 candidates appeared together.
This time around, Democratic officials opted for the jumbo format to ensure that viewers could see the party's top presidential contenders face off.
The 12-candidate format is likely to generate more than a few moments of cross talk and interruptions, particularly as lower-polling candidates seek a possible last opportunity to break out in front of a national audience.
But for party officials, the alternative formats carried drawbacks, too. One option -- dividing the candidates across two nights -- might have separated the leading candidates through a random drawing. Splitting the candidates by polling performance, as the Republican Party did for its initial round of 2015 debates, would likely have prompted criticism about unfair treatment.
The Oct. 15 debate will broadcast on CNN from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. Excluding commercials, explanations of the rules and closing questions, it is expected to have a running time of less than two and a half hours.
Television audiences remain deeply invested in the 2020 race, judging from recent ratings. One of the Miami debates, hosted by NBC and Telemundo in June, drew 18.1 million viewers, a record viewership for a Democratic primary matchup. Last month's debate in Houston, broadcast by ABC News and Univision, surpassed 14 million viewers, the second-highest audience on record.
The candidates appearing at this month's Democratic primary debate are:

-
Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
- Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey
-
Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.
- Julián Castro, the former housing secretary
-
Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii
- Senator Kamala Harris of California
-
Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota
- Former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas
-
Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont
- Tom Steyer, a former hedge fund investor
-
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts
- Andrew Yang, a tech entrepreneur

'It's a scam': Trump accuses Schiff of helping to write whistleblower complaint

Texto completo: President Trump accused House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff of helping write the whistleblower report during a press conference with Finnish President Sauli Niinistö.
Trump, who has repeatedly attacked Schiff since the whistleblower complaint became public, ramped up the attacks on Wednesday after it was reported that the CIA officer who filed the complaint went to a House Intelligence aide before filing it.
While taking questions from reporters, Trump was asked about that report.
'It's a scam': Trump accuses Schiff of helping to write whistleblower complaint
"I love that question. It shows that Schiff is a fraud. I love that question. Thank you, John," Trump began. "I think it's a scandal that he knew before."
"I think he probably helped write it, OK, that's what the word is. I give a lot of respect for The New York Times for putting it out. It just happened as I’m walking up here, they handed it to me, and I said to Mike, I said, 'Whoa, that is something. That is big stuff.' That's a big story. He knew long before, and he helped write it, too. It’s a scam," he said. "It’s a scam. Just to finish on this, I appreciate it, I love that second question by the way. Should’ve asked it first. But let me just tell you, the whole thing is a scam."
Trump has repeatedly called for Schiff's resignation after he read a fake copy of the president's conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire's testimony in front of his committee last week. The president asked Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.

Texto completo: First came the diplomacy, the gentle celebration in the grand White House East Room of close ties with Finland in honor of the day’s guest. Then came the questions about the whistleblower, impeachment proceedings, and subpoenas.
“It’s a whole hoax, and you know who’s playing into the hoax? People like you and the fake news media,” said President Trump, voice raised as he tried to shut down the freewheeling press conference. “And I say in many cases the corrupt media, because you’re corrupt.”
He paused and pointed to his guest, who had stood silently beside him for almost 15 minutes.
“Ask the president of Finland a question,” he said, before wading in to answer the next question on free trade himself.
It marked a stark contrast to his most recent press conference, a muted affair on the fringes of the United Nations General Assembly in New York last week. Then Trump cut a sober figure as he rounded off an exhausting three days of meetings and speeches.
But the whistleblower story has not gone away, and this time he deployed his full range of emotions, from weary resignation to righteous indignation, and then red-faced fury. For 40 blistering minutes, he threatened legal action against his accusers, dismissed the Bidens as “stone cold crooked,” and vented against reporters who wanted their questions answered.
He cast allegations that he sought foreign help in collecting dirt on Joe Biden as nothing but the latest in a plot to discredit him that began with the Mueller investigation.
"I probably will be bringing a lot of litigation against a lot of people having to do with the corruption investigation having to do with the 2016 election," he said.
He did not elaborate, but his administration is currently investigating the origins of the Mueller investigation.
Minutes later the president had a chance to gloat. He was asked about a breaking story in the New York Times claiming that the whistleblower at the heart of the probe had discussed his complaint with a congressional aide who then passed on the details to Adam Schiff, the committee chairman now leading the House of Representatives' impeachment investigation
“I love that question. It shows that Schiff is a fraud,” said Trump. “I think it’s a scandal that he knew before. I’d go a step further: I think he probably helped write it.”
Beside him, Sauli Niinistö lowered his eyes, looking for all the world as if he was wishing he had asked to stand behind a bigger lectern.
The press conference was merely the latest chance for Trump to go on the offensive.
“The Do Nothing Democrats should be focused on building up our Country, not wasting everyone’s time and energy on BULLSHIT, which is what they have been doing ever since I got overwhelmingly elected in 2016,” he tweeted as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Schiff addressed reporters on Capitol Hill.
Half an hour later, Niinistö sat beside him in the Oval Office as he continued his verbal assault on “shifty Schiff,” ending by suggesting he was not fit to carry an intimate piece of Mike Pompeo’s sporting apparel.
“You know there’s an expression: He couldn’t carry his ‘blank’ strap,” said Trump. “I won’t say it because they’ll say it was so terrible.”
One of the observers present described Trump as “effusive” and “feisty.”
He carried that mindset into the East Room later in the afternoon, keeping up the attacks on a “hoax” against the American people. In particular, he targeted Schiff for his performance in Congress last week when he paraphrased and satirically embellished the White House account of Trump’s conversation with the Ukrainian president.
“He should resign,” Trump said. “Some people are even saying it was treason.”
And he did not miss a high-volume opportunity to re-raise questions about what exactly Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, was doing for a Ukrainian energy company. Even though there is no specific evidence of anything untoward, he knows how to keep one half of the audience focused on his Democratic opponent.
“Biden and his son are stone cold crooked,” he said. “You know it. The son walked out with millions of dollars and the kid knows nothing.”
Lost in the mix was the other news: An endorsement of the Finnish mobile phone company Nokia as a provider of 5G infrastructure, an agreement to protect the Arctic, and an announcement that Finland would be returning antiquities and burial remains taken from Mesa Verde in the 19th century.
Isn’t it wearying, asked a member of the Finnish press corps, to deal with the nonstop controversy?
“I’m used to it,” answered Trump. “It’s like putting on a suit in the morning.”

Texto completo: She also became a victim when her longtime friend, Christine Blasey Ford, decided to hit refresh on a decades-old high school incident that apparently only Ford remembers.
Keyser is the other female student whom Ford named as having been at the small party where Kavanaugh allegedly pinned her down on a bed and groped her. She is also the friend who swore under penalty of perjury that she doesn't recall such a party or, in fact, ever having met Kavanaugh. Her comments echoed those of the other partygoers Ford named, none of whom remembered such a gathering.
This isn't what places Keyser on the heroes' roster. What earns her that distinction is her steadfastness, at great personal suffering, in refusing to change her story despite what she describes as pressure to rethink her initial statement. According to a new book, "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh" by New York Times reporters Kate Kelly and Robin Pogrebin, some of Keyser's erstwhile friends and acquaintances tried to persuade her to say she didn't remember the party, not that it didn't happen.
Keyser, reportedly a registered Democrat, has become increasingly convinced that Ford's story isn't true and doesn't make sense, according to the book. Given their close friendship during their school days, isn't it likely that Ford would have told her about such an attack? And, had Keyser been at the alleged party, since she already had her drivers license and often gave Christine a ride, wouldn't she have taken her younger friend home?
According to the book, Ford's team of friends and advisers apparently saw Keyser as an obstacle to Ford's narrative and brainstormed ways for her to get onboard. The book cites a group text among Ford's acquaintances from soon after her testimony. Cheryl Amitay, who attended the same girls' high school as Ford, wrote: "Maybe one of you guys who are friends with [Keyser] can have a heart-to-heart." And, "I don't care, frankly, how f--ed up her life is."
A man who had gone to a neighboring boys' school chimed in: "Perhaps it makes sense to let everyone in the public know what her condition is." To which Amitay responded, "Leland is a major stumbling block."
Keyser, a former professional golfer who has undergone numerous operations on her back and neck, has suffered addiction during her adult life. Although recovering, she told Kelly and Pogrebin she was concerned that this history would be used against her if she didn't come up with a more-acceptable recollection of events. When pressed, however, she refused to take the easy route and protect herself.
For her integrity and valor under perceived pressure, she has been punished. Even Ford seemed to turn on her old friend, mentioning Keyser's "significant health challenges," during her testimony, and seeming to suggest that her friend might have diminished capacities: "I'm happy that she's focusing on herself and getting the health treatment that she needs."
This may have been one of the sweetest condemnations in the history of tossing inconvenient friends under the bus. But, importantly, Ford planted a seed of doubt about Keyser's credibility, which has been cultivated by the Times writers. On CNN's "Reliable Sources," Kelly pointed to Keyser's "memory issues ... because she has a history of substance abuse, which she acknowledges."
Oof. What a gut punch. If no one in recovery can ever be trusted again, then the world of rehabilitative addiction therapy may as well shutter its doors.
In fact, Keyser remembers very well the summer of 1982, when Ford believes the alleged incident occurred. It was the year after her grandmother introduced her to golf and Keyser became consumed with the sport, according to another book published this past summer, "Justice on Trial," by Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino. Keyser worked full-time in the golf pro shop at a Washington-area country club and had little time for socializing. Her hard work at school and in sports paid off with stellar grades, seven varsity letters, and acceptance to the University of Virginia, followed by a professional golfing career and a coaching position at Georgetown University.
Today, Keyser keeps a low profile, as was always her preference. She is, indeed, in fragile health from her injuries and surgeries. But Keyser can stand tall for having remained true to her convictions despite being exposed and pressured by those who seemed to have used her struggles against her. In my book, that's heroic.

How journalism student broke Kurt Volker story

Texto completo: Andrew Howard, a 20-year-old student at Arizona State University, broke international news in the State Press on Friday night.
Then he finished his shift as an intern at The Arizona Republic, went home, woke up Saturday and fielded calls from the New York Times, the Washington Post and other major news outlets. Sunday he did more interviews, finished a six-page paper due in his politics class and Monday woke up at 3 a.m. so he could appear on the MSNBC show "Morning Joe." Then he slept a little and went to his data journalism class.
And how was your weekend?
"It's been crazy," said Howard, a managing editor for the student-run State Press. "I mean really, it's been sort of absurd. I've been interviewed by outlets I never imagined."
Howard broke the story Friday on Kurt Volker resigning as the U.S. special envoy for Ukraine after reports that President Donald Trump had asked Ukraine's president to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, who is running as a Democratic candidate for president, hoping to unseat Trump in 2020.
Volker is the executive director of the McCain Institute at ASU. Howard pursued the story through that angle, and wound up beating everyone.
He's part of a team of interns at The Republic All this while working on an advance obituary during his shift at The Arizona Republic. The internship program allows students to work as actual journalists in the newsroom — something Howard, as he suggests, was doing when the story published, which gave him pause."I sort of looked over and said (to his editor), 'Sorry about that, that was me, that's my bad.' It was funny. I was just sitting in there and that story with my name on it broke."
All is forgiven.
Howard knew he had a good story. He just wasn't sure how big.
"We knew we had the scoop," he said. "I'm not sure we ever thought that the reaction would be as big as it was that we broke the news. None of us expected that."
'It's just so exciting for a young journalist' He has been pleasantly surprised at the reaction from the media he scooped — the request by a couple of outlets to pass along his source notwithstanding.
"Everyone seems to be happy about it," he said. "No one's said a single bad thing about us breaking the story and some other newsroom didn't. It's been really motivating that people have been so supportive of us. As a student newsroom, it's great to feel like you're supported by the media and not an outlier just because we're students."
Why not? It's a great story about a great story. And pretty unique, too.
"I am in my 12th year here at ASU and I don't remember another story like this, in terms of importance and worldwide response," said Jason Manning, director of student media and an adviser to the State Press. "One fairly recent story that received national attention was the university's investigation into alleged misconduct by Professor Lawrence Krauss. The State Press led out on certain aspects of that story and received well-deserved recognition, but the response to the Volker story has been unique in its scope and intensity."
What comes next Like any good journalist, Howard is busily working on following the story. That, coupled with a crazy weekend, has prevented him from fully grasping the enormity of it all.
"Even though it's Monday, I think tomorrow might be the first day where I can sit down and process everything that happened," he said.
That said, these are still heady times.
"I've been talking about it 24/7," Howard said, laughing. "I bet all my friends hate me. I can't not talk about it. It's just so exciting for a young journalist. I don't think it's going to be easy for me to try and forget that I was in the New York Times this weekend."

Sec'y calls Dem probe 'baseless'

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Democrats' investigation of corruption allegations against Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao are based on a "web of innuendo and baseless inferences" crafted by the media, the Transportation Department argues in a letter to Congress.
The letter comes in response to a probe launched more than two weeks ago by the House Oversight Committee seeking explanations for why Chao (inset) appeared in numerous broadcast interviews in China with the official department seal, talking up her family's shipping business and her father's book. Using official symbols for private interests is barred under federal law.
The committee also is demanding to know why Chao said on her financial disclosure statements in 2017 that she was essentially cashing out her shares in a company that does business with the department, but didn't until the middle of 2018 after news reports.
The committee listed 18 different categories of information it wanted, including unredacted copies of emails that were released in redacted form to media outlets.
In its letter to the committee, the department provided documents that mostly appear to be in the committee's custody already, such as Chao's financial disclosures. It promised further information, but also flatly denied any impropriety.
"The allegation that the secretary has used her official position to benefit her family's business is simply false," wrote Assistant Transportation Secretary Adam Sullivan in the letter sent Monday.
A senior Democratic committee aide told the News the response was not impressive.
"Unfortunately, the department provided only generic denials and mostly public documents, but it failed to produce the majority of documents the committee requested relating to these troubling ethics allegations," the aide said.
Various reports that include transcripts and photos of Chao with her father on Chinese television have pointed out that high-level connections are vital for winning business in China. According to a New York Times report, emails obtained from the State Department raised red flags over one proposed trip by Chao to China where her family members would attend official meetings.

LIKELY TO BACKFIRE IS THE BEST OPTION FOR TRUMP IMPEACHMENT?

Texto completo: Here's a take no one will like: I'm confident he did it. I'm confident it's impeachable. I'm just not so sure he should be impeached for it.
Let's start at the top. It's obvious to me that President Donald Trump pressured the Ukrainian government to launch a probe of former Vice President Joe Biden in order to tarnish the image of the Democrat best positioned to defeat him in 2020.
In the rough transcript of his conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Mr. Trump says America has been very good to Ukraine, but he wants the relationship to be more "reciprocal." Mr. Zelenskiy agrees and asks for more anti-tank missiles to deter ongoing Russian military aggression. Mr. Trump responds by asking for a two-part "favor."
First, he asks Mr. Zelenskiy to look into the 2016 hacking of the Democratic National Committee's servers (a bat-guano-crazy request, but whatever). Then, Mr. Trump mentions "the other thing" he wants.
"There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution, and a lot of people want to find out about that, so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great," Mr. Trump says.
The context matters as much as the text. Mr. Trump had already blocked the transfer of congressionally approved military aid. Rudy Giuliani, his personal lawyer, had been hectoring the Ukrainians for months to go after Mr. Biden (and it remains his singular obsession even now). Mr. Giuliani even admitted it last May in an interview with The New York Times. He said he was lobbying the Ukrainians to investigate Mr. Biden because "that information will be very, very helpful to my client."
And that's why Mr. Trump asked Mr. Zelenskiy to work with Mr. Giuliani.
There's more context as well. There were reportedly other calls in which Mr. Trump importuned the Ukrainians this way. Mr. Trump's explanation for why he froze the military aid to Ukraine in the first place keeps changing. On Sept. 21, he said he blocked it out of concern over Ukrainian corruption (the only corruption in the world he's passionate about, apparently). On Sept. 22, he said the real reason was that he wanted our allies to pony up even more money for the government he claimed was too corrupt for our aid in the first place.
Normally you'd think an inadvertent confession would settle things. But when Mr. Trump said of his call with Ukraine, "There was no pressure put on them whatsoever. But there was pressure put on with respect to Joe Biden," the assumption was that he misspoke.
We also learned Sept. 24 that the "whistleblower" alleges the White House took extraordinary measures to hide the transcript of the call, which, if true, suggests wiser heads understood that the conversation crossed a line.
Regardless, I think Mr. Trump did it. I think it's obvious he did it. I think as more facts come to light, it will become even more obvious he did it. I also think it's obvious that this is an impeachable offense.
However, that doesn't mean I'm persuaded he must be impeached over it.
Impeachment doesn't mean "removal from office." It's the political equivalent of a grand jury indictment, with the House fully empowered to impeach any action it deems impeachable. It's up to the Senate to decide whether a president should be removed.
The Federalist Papers are clear: Impeachment is a political process, not a legal one. Illegal acts are surely impeachable, but not all impeachable acts are illegal.
Impeachment is ultimately a question of whether a president violated the public trust. But there's nothing in the Constitution that says a president must be impeached for violating the public trust.
It's a prudential question with good arguments on both sides. If I were Nancy Pelosi, I'd be even more torn than she's clearly been. In the modern era, we've never had the drama of an impeachment process in a president's first term or in the run-up to a re-election. We've never had a lot of things that we've had under Mr. Trump.
Absent new facts, the GOP-controlled Senate will not remove Mr. Trump. The president would claim "exoneration," and his behavior would become normalized for future presidents. So I'm not sure Democrats are right to pursue impeachment. I'm sure Republicans are wrong to pretend that what Mr. Trump did was totally fine.

Texto completo: One question predominates among Democratic voters assessing which candidate to nominate as the Democratic standard-bearer for 2020: “Can they beat Donald Trump?”
One person who thus far has not been deemed up to the task by prospective voters is New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who has been languishing deep in the second tier of candidates in national polls. So dire was the situation that his campaign put out a memo a little over a week ago warning that if it didn’t raise $1. 7 million by Sept. 30, Booker would be forced to drop out of the race. His supporters rallied, and on Monday his campaign announced he had reached its target.
Is there a place for politeness?
Booker has been dogged by concerns that his message of love and togetherness might not be right for the times. The New York Times summed it up in a headline: “Is Cory Booker too nice? (And is that bad?)”
But Booker believes strongly that his approach is the winning way.
In a recent interview, Booker told me that “grace and decency is the way to beat Trump. You can't beat him using his tactics, fighting him on his turf. ” Put another way: Never wrestle with a pig. The pig likes it and you get dirty.
Bad news for Biden and Sanders: Democratic activists want youth and diversity
What we need is to have “a revival of civic grace, to have a more courageous empathy, to get back to understanding that we share a common cause and common purpose, and most certainly share a common destiny. ” He lamented that Americans are “falling into tribalism in this country where we hate each other so much. ”
On some level, we all know this is true. Yet to many Americans, this kind of talk sounds weak. This is because we have a real misunderstanding about what strength is in politics. There is “this sort of toxic masculinity that is this idea that to be strong, you have to be an ass,” Booker noted. “The antidote to this moment and time is not more Trumpiness. That's why I constantly remind people that love is not weak. Do not confuse strength with meanness. Do not confuse being tough with being cruel. In fact, they are opposites. ”
Still, grace for your political enemies feels unnatural, even wrong. It’s a posture that takes a lot of work to achieve. Booker himself admitted on "Late Night with Seth Meyers" in July that he sometimes feels like punching Trump. Many of us know that feeling, so Booker is in no way suggesting that anyone stop hating what Trump is doing to the country. He’s not suggesting we have to be perfect and never utter a bad word about Trump or his allies. He’s just outlining an approach to beating Trump that sounds counterintuitive in the era of clapbacks and cancel culture.
Kindness does not mean never scrutinizing
It also doesn’t mean that Booker can never criticize his Democratic opponents. When Booker pointed out after the last debate that some people were concerned former Vice President Joe Biden might fumble the ball if he became the nominee, many commentators said he was off brand. But that’s because our culture is confused about what grace looks like. Grace does not ask you to be a doormat or have no opinions or never criticize. Loving people does not require you to stay silent when you see something that merits being called out. Certainly, Booker’s concerns about Biden deserved to be heard and considered.
Dem debates don't match the moment: Time to get serious about beating Trump
When I presented Booker with the disturbing math I’ve heard from too many Democrats behind the scenes that it will take a white man to beat Trump, he replied, “This idea that we need a safe candidate that we may not all be excited about, but he's the safe choice, is so contrary to our self-interest. ” He added, “And by the way, you make a big mistake if during the campaign the person says something that's racially offensive. That steps in it. And that's why, as a lot of people have written after the last debate, please, Joe Biden, clarify what you were saying about black parents. Please give the guy a chance to clarify because what he said was offensive to black people. ”
This pointed criticism is certainly within bounds. A lack of grace involves much more than critiquing an opponent. It looks a lot more like the ad hominem attacks the president launches nearly daily against all who aren’t actively worshiping him. It looks like Trump’s relentless attempts to pit Americans against one another. Trump does this because he cannot survive in an ordered universe free of hatred and chaos, so he works overtime to create disorder. His best hope is that Democrats will sink into the mud with him so that voters will ultimately tune out in disgust, leaving only the most hardened partisans showing up to vote.
Cory Booker gets this. Whether he will break through with his message and vision remains to be seen. But he deserves a real hearing.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — A book excerpt published Tuesday describes a turbulent week inside the Trump administration in March as the president ordered staff to shut down the United States' 2,000-mile border with Mexico.
According to reporting from the New York Times, President Donald Trump had at times privately talked about “fortifying a border wall with a water-filled trench, stocked with snakes or alligators, prompting aides to seek a cost estimate. He wanted the wall electrified, with spikes on top that could pierce human flesh. ”
Additionally, after aides told him that his public suggestion of soldiers shooting migrants if they threw rocks was illegal, he backed down. But, he later suggested that they “shoot migrants in the legs to slow them down. ”
"That’s not allowed either, (staff) told him," according to the excerpt.
The article published Tuesday was adapted from “Border Wars: Inside Trump’s Assault on Immigration,” a book to be published on Oct. 8 by Times reporters Michael Shear and Julie Hirschfeld Davis.
The article is based on interviews with more than a dozen White House administration officials who were granted anonymity, describing a "frenzied week of presidential rages" that included "around-the-clock staff panic and far more White House turmoil than was known at the time," according to the Times.
Adding profanity, Trump shouted, "You are making me look like an idiot! I ran on this. It's my issue,” during a meeting that included White House Aide Stephen Miller, former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, then-Customs and Border Protection chief Kevin McAleenan, acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, as well as presidential adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, according to the book excerpt.
The comments came around the same time the President publicly threatened to close the border, saying he would if “Mexico doesn’t get with it. " Trump later backed off from that threat.
“The president was frustrated and I think he took that moment to hit the reset button,” Thomas D. Homan, who served as Trump’s acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told the Times. “The president wanted it to be fixed quickly. ’’
The book excerpt includes details that Trump “routinely berated” Nielsen as “ineffective and, worse — at least in his mind — not tough-looking enough. "
During a briefing over the necessity for new legal authority to bring down drones, Trump reportedly told Nielsen that she “didn’t hear me the first time, honey. Shoot ’em down. Sweetheart, just shoot ’em out of the sky, OK?”
“The happiest [Trump] had been with [DHS Secretary] Nielsen was a few months earlier, when American border agents had fired tear gas into Mexico to try to stop migrants from crossing into the United States," the Times reported.
The cruelty has always been the point. https://t. co/DUSNwFR6W4
— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 1, 2019
Democrats were quick to express their outrage after the excerpt published.
Rep. Alexandria-Ocasio Cortez said that “cruelty has always been the point,” with the president. Rep. Eric Swalwell tweeted that Trump’s actions usually fall “into one of three buckets: cruel, childish, or corrupt. ”

Global trade is deteriorating fast, sapping the world’s economy

Texto completo: London • A weakening world economy, President Donald Trump’s trade war with China and fears of a potentially tumultuous Brexit have combined to produce a dramatic slowdown in global commerce, the World Trade Organization said Tuesday.
The Geneva-based organization slashed its forecast for trade growth for this year and 2020, a troubling indicator as economists warn of continued weakness in the global economy.
World trade in merchandise is now expected to expand by only 1.2% during 2019, less than half the 2.6% pace of growth anticipated in April, the WTO said in a statement. World trade is forecast to expand 2.7% next year, below the 3% previously foreseen.
“Risks to the forecast are heavily weighted to the downside and dominated by trade policy,” the organization said.
The pronounced deterioration of trade reflects risks that have been building around the globe in recent months, diminishing fortunes in major economies.
“China has been slowing noticeably,” said Per Hammarlund, chief emerging markets strategist at SEB Group, a global investment bank based in Stockholm. “India is slowing. The United States is slowing as well, and Europe in particular is slowing quite sharply. That’s the main reason behind the slowdown in world trade.”
But if the slowdown in trade is still largely an outgrowth of broader economic weakness, concerns are building that less trade could itself spur retrenchment going forward.
Germany has become a prominent source of concern in Europe as its factory orders plunge, a trend that deepened in September, according to a survey released Tuesday. German manufacturing troubles stem in part from the fact that Chinese companies facing tariffs on exports to the United States are shrinking their purchases of German-made machinery. German companies are also reluctant to invest amid perpetual uncertainty over Brexit.
As German companies produce and export less, some are cutting jobs. That is likely to dampen German consumer spending, contributing to weakness in other European economies like Spain and Italy.
These strains are only intensifying as Trump ratchets up his trade war with China. In April, when the WTO released its last forecast, sentiments were influenced by hopes that Washington and Beijing were nearing a deal to resolve their trade disputes. That now seems like a long time ago.
In September, Trump increased tariffs on $112 billion worth of Chinese imports, threatening American consumers with higher costs for shoes, apparel and electronics. As China slapped retaliatory tariffs on $75 billion of American imports, Trump threatened to extend tariffs to $550 billion worth of Chinese imports.
The president last month delayed by two weeks a planned increase in tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, briefly rekindling hopes for a deal. But many experts are skeptical that, with both sides dug in, an agreement will be struck.
The United States and China are the world’s two largest economies, collectively comprising 40% of the world’s annual output. As they are locked in conflict, every other trading nation is vulnerable to the effects.
Singapore’s economy is now contracting, and Japan, South Korea and Taiwan have suffered diminished prospects as their exports to China slow.
“The policy uncertainty about the future and the real enforcement of trade restrictions is starting to be felt in other places,” said Meredith Crowley, an international trade expert at the University of Cambridge in England.
The WTO, which promotes global trade and adjudicates disputes, warned that intensifying trade conflicts pose a direct threat to jobs and livelihoods, while discouraging companies from expanding and innovating.
The organization issued its forecast on the assumption that global economic growth would register a disappointing pace of 2.3% this year and in 2020.
“Trade conflicts heighten uncertainty, which is leading some businesses to delay the productivity-enhancing investments that are essential to raising living standards,” the organization’s director-general, Roberto Azevêdo, said in a statement. “Job creation may also be hampered as firms employ fewer workers to produce goods and services for export.”
The organization singled out as an especially potent risk the threat that Britain could crash out of the European Union without a deal governing future trade.
Ever since Britain set Brexit in motion through a referendum in June 2016, Europe has faced uncertainty over the rules that will govern trade across the English Channel. With weeks to go before the deadline, the situation is especially bewildering.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed to take Britain out of the Europe Union on Oct. 31, regardless of whether he can secure a deal with authorities in Brussels, and despite widespread assumptions that a no-deal Brexit would entangle trade in bureaucratic and logistical chaos.
He has demanded a scrapping of a provision negotiated by his predecessor, Theresa May, to prevent the reimposition of a hard border separating Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, from the independent Republic of Ireland to the south. The Europeans have held firm, while Johnson has proposed no formal alternative.
But the British Parliament, alarmed by the possibility of an unruly no-deal Brexit, last month adopted emergency legislation that would force Johnson to seek an extension of the deadline if he fails to strike a deal. Speculation persists that he might opt to ignore that directive, setting up a constitutional crisis. He is also dealing with allegations that, while he was mayor of London, he directed government funds to a woman with whom he was having an affair.
That an election will soon transpire is accepted as a given, but no one knows when.
None of this enhances the motivation of companies to invest in Britain. The British economy contracted between April and June. Across Europe, the spectacle of Britain at once getting poorer and stuck in the Brexit quagmire is not good for business.
“The British situation is much more uncertain today,” said Crowley, the Cambridge trade expert. “That is feeding into the weakness of trade growth for other European countries.”

Ruchir Sharma: Why Wall Street loves strongmen

Texto completo: Wall Street has long existed as a parallel universe where leaders cast by critics in the media as autocratic villains can be feted as heroes if their actions bode well for the economy. Lately, this split has reached new extremes.
In the critics’ view, we live in an increasingly illiberal age, populated by dangerously erratic strongmen. Leading examples include President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, who at the United Nations this week defiantly defended his government against charges that it is turning a blind eye as the Amazon burns; President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, whose tough, military-backed regime has been the target of protests over the past week; and Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, widely reviled for the assassination of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi operatives.
Yet global investors view the same trio as promising economic reformers, following a mainstream playbook that could have been written (indeed sometimes is written) by analysts at the International Monetary Fund. Markets reward them accordingly. For much of their recent tenures, Brazil under Mr. Bolsonaro and Saudi Arabia under Prince Mohammed have all ranked among the world’s hottest stock markets. Until this week, this year’s top-performing market was Egypt.
The harsh reality is that markets are amoral, instinctively neutral barometers of economic performance, and they will at times ignore the brutality and excesses of strongmen for a simple reason: Facing little or no resistance from legislatures, courts or independent watchdogs, strongmen can push through sweeping reforms — particularly in emerging economies, where political institutions and the rule of law are relatively weak. Looking at the records for 150 countries between 1950 and 2010, I found 43 cases in which an economy grew at an annual pace of 7 percent or more for a full decade. An astonishing 35 of those economies — more than 80 percent of them — were run by an autocrat.
The downside is that nations subject to the unchecked whims of autocrats are also vulnerable to wild growth swings — and long slumps. Among the same 150 countries, I found 138 cases in which an economy grew at a pace of 3 percent or slower for a decade, and 100 of those economies were led by an autocrat.
Markets sense the erratic nature of economies run by strongmen and will bet big on these figures until the moment economic reforms lose momentum. Stock markets enjoyed bull runs under autocrats who instituted high-growth policies, like Augusto Pinochet of Chile, Suharto of Indonesia and Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.
After 2000 a new generation of autocratic market darlings arose, led by President Vladimir Putin of Russia and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. In their first terms, the stock markets of Russia and Turkey rose, respectively, by about 100 percentage points and 300 percentage points faster than the average for emerging countries. Later, investors would turn on Russia and Turkey, not because their leaders grew more troublesomely autocratic but because they stopped pushing tough economic reforms.
What markets look for perhaps above all is financial stability, a necessary condition for solid growth. Today, while there are many differences among Mr. Bolsonaro, Mr. el-Sisi and Prince Mohammed, they have each taken steps to put their financial houses in order.
Mr. Bolsonaro plans to downsize the bureaucracy, sell off state companies and cut up to $250 billion from pension payments that could bankrupt Brazil. Mr. el-Sisi, in part to secure I.M.F. help, has raised taxes on capital gains and on the rich, and slashed fuel subsidies by more than 50 percent. Prince Mohammed has cracked down on rich tax dodgers, including fellow Saudi royals, raised sales taxes and cut energy subsidies as a way to pare back a large budget deficit.
Wall Street research reports on Brazil, Egypt and Saudi Arabia barely mention autocratic tendencies. Instead, they say that reforms are “still on track” in Saudi Arabia, Egypt is “the best reform story” in its region, and “market considers Bolsonaro Brazil’s ‘last chance’ to reform economy.” The gap between market and mainstream media narratives is now a yawning chasm.
In May, Mr. Bolsonaro was driven out of Manhattan by headline-grabbing demonstrators chanting “fascista,” shortly after his University of Chicago-educated economic minister, Paulo Guedes, was greeted as a savior by global investors at the I.M.F.’s semiannual meeting in Washington. One participant (a Wall Street liberal) told me Mr. Guedes’s speech, outlining Mr. Bolsonaro’s free-market plans, was “the most inspiring” she had ever heard at this confab.
One trait the new strongmen share is a tendency to blur ideological lines. Illiberal politics often combine with eclectic economics in ways that make them hard to place on the traditional left-right political spectrum. President Trump, a champion of blue-collar jobs and tax cuts for the rich, is a prominent example. More than any other American president, he has tried to please the stock market. And as the impeachment battles heat up, he is likely to try to please it more, in his erratic way — perhaps by looking for a quick trade deal with China or further badgering the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again.
Not coincidentally, Mr. Trump has lavished praise on Mr. Bolsonaro, Mr. el-Sisi and Prince Mohammed, who occupy the same gray area. The crown prince has freed women to drive as part of an economic modernization campaign while suppressing activists who push for broader women’s rights. Is he right or left, progressive or reactionary, or beyond the old categories?
It is not that people on Wall Street themselves are amoral or aren’t often appalled by the excesses of autocrats. But it is their job to filter out headlines casting strongman presidents and prime ministers as cruel villains, and focus instead on whether their policies are likely to spur growth.
With illiberal leaders still on the rise worldwide, this political age is likely to produce more strongmen the market can love.

Texto completo: Last year was very good for Sara Bareilles. She co-hosted the Tony Awards and was nominated for an Emmy and a Grammy for her role as Mary Magdalene in NBC’s “Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert.” The Songwriters Hall of Fame also honored her with the Hal David Starlight Award, acknowledging her talents as a gifted songwriter.
This year those good vibes are continuing. Bareilles recently celebrated her three-year anniversary with her boyfriend, actor Joe Tippett. Meanwhile, she’s crisscrossing the country on her “Amidst the Chaos Tour.” Bareilles, 39, will be at Mohegan Sun Arena on Saturday, Oct. 12, with special guest Emily King. The tour is in support of her critically-acclaimed new album of the same name.
“Amidst The Chaos,” her fifth full-length record, is her first collection of original material since 2013. Among its standout tunes is “A Safe Place to Land,” featuring John Legend. Others include “Poetry by Dead Men” and “Saint Honesty.”

Variety said the album “establishes that there’s no one in contemporary pop better at flexing mezzo-soprano sensitivity and social empathy like a muscle. It’s the perfect album for anyone who could use a little fierce snowflake pride.”
Bareilles achieved mainstream praise in 2007 with “Love Song,” a hit from her debut album, “Little Voice.” The song reached No. 1 in 22 countries. She’s received seven Grammy nominations since then, and her 2015 memoir, “Sounds Like Me: My Life (So Far) in Song,” was a New York Times best seller.
The California native made her Broadway acting debut in 2017, when she stepped into the lead role in “Waitress.” Bareilles also composed the music and lyrics for that show; she received her first Tony Award nomination for Best Score and a 2017 Grammy Award nomination for Best Musical Theater Album.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Attorney General William Barr has held private meetings overseas with foreign intelligence officials seeking their help in a Justice Department inquiry that President Donald Trump hopes will discredit U.S. intelligence agencies’ examination of possible connections between Russia and members of the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.
And Trump has assisted with Barr’s efforts by calling other countries’ leaders, including the Australian prime minister in a recent phone call.
Justice Department and White House spokesmen, as well as an Australian government spokesman, confirmed and defended the efforts after The Washington Post and The New York Times reported them, citing people familiar with the matter.
Barr’s personal involvement is likely to stoke further criticism from Democrats pursuing impeachment that he is helping the Trump administration use executive branch powers to augment investigations aimed primarily at the president’s adversaries.
But the high-level Justice Department focus on intelligence operatives’ conduct matches Trump’s and conservatives’ "investigate the investigators" rallying cry. Barr has voiced his own concerns, telling lawmakers in April that he believed "spying did occur" when it came to the U.S. investigation of the Trump campaign.
The direct involvement of the nation’s top law enforcement official shows the priority Barr places on the investigation being conducted by John Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, who has been assigned the sensitive task of reviewing U.S. intelligence work surrounding the 2016 election and its aftermath.
Current and former intelligence and law enforcement officials expressed frustration and alarm Monday that the head of the Justice Department was taking such a direct role in re-examining what they view as conspiracy theories and baseless allegations of misconduct in the three-year-old election.
Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec did not name the countries in her statement. But Barr has already made overtures to British intelligence officials, and last week the attorney general traveled to Italy, where he and Durham met senior Italian government officials and Barr asked the Italians to assist Durham, according to one person familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue.
It was not Barr’s first trip to Italy to meet intelligence officials, the person said. The Trump administration has made similar requests of Australia, said people who discussed the interactions on the condition of anonymity.
In a recent phone call, Trump urged Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to provide assistance to the ongoing Justice Department inquiry, the people said. Trump made the request at Barr’s urging, they said. The Trump phone call was first reported by The New York Times and later confirmed by an Australian government spokesman who said his government was ready to "help shed further light on the matters under investigation," Bloomberg reported.
Trump administration officials defended the moves as above board.
"I’m old enough to remember when Democrats actually wanted to find out what happened in the 2016 election," White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said. "The Democrats clearly don’t want the truth to come out anymore as it might hurt them politically, but this call relates to a DOJ inquiry publicly announced months ago to uncover exactly what happened. The DOJ simply requested the President provide introductions to facilitate that ongoing inquiry, and he did so, that’s all."
Kupec said, "Mr. Durham is gathering information from numerous sources, including a number of foreign countries. At Attorney General Barr’s request, the President has contacted other countries to ask them to introduce the Attorney General and Mr. Durham to appropriate officials."
In a statement, a spokesperson for the Australian government said it has "always been ready to assist and cooperate with efforts that help shed further light on the matters under investigation. The [prime minister] confirmed this readiness once again in a conversation with the President."
Trump still complains frequently that those involved in the investigation of his campaign should be charged with crimes, asserting the FBI search for possible election season collusion between Russia and Trump campaign officials was a witch hunt spurred by agents and bureaucrats opposed to Trump becoming president. That investigation ended earlier this year when special counsel Robert Mueller determined there was insufficient evidence to charge any Americans with conspiring with Russia and declined to reach a decision about whether the president had sought to obstruct justice.
David Laufman, a former Justice Department official who was involved in the early stages of the Russia probe, said it was "fairly unorthodox for the attorney general personally to be flying around the world as a point person to further evidence-gathering for a specific Justice Department investigation," and especially so in Barr’s case.
Barr’s direct involvement in the effort also helps explain part of the controversial July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. A rough transcript of that call shows Trump said he wanted Ukrainian assistance to help find out "what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine," and possible involvement with the Democratic National Committee computer system that U.S. agencies have determined was hacked by Russian intelligence ahead of the 2016 election.
Some of the president’s supporters have suggested Ukraine had a more direct role in the 2016 investigation than currently known, an assertion denied by current and former officials who were involved in the original probe.
A spokesperson for the CIA declined to comment, citing the ongoing review.
A former senior U.S. intelligence official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation denied that the CIA was involved in monitoring any members of the Trump campaign. Any such operations were conducted by the FBI and were lawful, the former official said, emphasizing that the CIA focused on Russia’s interference in the election, and the role that Russian officials and intelligence agencies played.

Economics Needs More Black Women

Texto completo: Black women are underrepresented in economics, which is bad for everyone.
Economics is neither a welcoming nor a supportive profession for women. In 2017, Alice H. Wu, now a doctoral student in economics at Harvard, published an eye-opening study of online conversations among economists that provided convincing evidence that overt sexism was a serious problem in the field. Last year the economist Roland G. Fryer Jr., a star of the Harvard department, faced sexual misconduct allegations, prompting calls to condemn the widespread sexual harassment and discrimination in the profession. (In July, Harvard suspended Professor Fryer for two years.)
But if economics is hostile to women, it is especially antagonistic to black women. Black women account for 6.8 percent of bachelor's degrees in the social sciences. But in 2017, only 0.6 percent of doctoral degrees in economics and only 2 percent of bachelor's degrees in economics were awarded to black women.
Sadie T.M. Alexander, who in 1921 became the first African-American to receive a Ph.D. in economics, switched to law because of the racism and sexism she encountered. A century later the experience of black female economists is disturbingly similar.
This month the American Economic Association published a survey finding that black women, compared to all other groups, had to take the most measures to avoid possible harassment, discrimination and unfair or disrespectful treatment. Sixty-two percent of black women reported experiencing racial or gender discrimination or both, compared to 50 percent of white women, 44 percent of Asian women and 58 percent of Latinas. Twenty-nine percent and 38 percent of black women reported experiencing discrimination in promotion and pay, respectively, compared to 26 percent and 36 percent for whites, 28 percent and 36 percent for Asians and 32 percent and 40 percent for Latinas.
"I would not recommend my own (black) child to go into this field," said one of the black female respondents. "It was a mistake for me to choose this field. Had I known that it would be so toxic, I would not have."
Many black women who might want to study economics are effectively prevented from doing so at a young age. Research by the economist Dania V. Francis provides evidence that, all else being equal, black girls are disproportionately recommended less by teachers for Advanced Placement calculus (a gateway course for taking economics), STEM classes and college preparation in general.
Black women who do become economists face discrimination when it comes to publication citations, which play a critical role in recognition and promotion in the profession. "There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that underrepresented minorities and women are under-cited," another respondent to the American Economic Association survey noted, "and that publication lags are longer for them."
Change in the profession will require addressing the lack of information black women are given about the field and the profession's climate. Fortunately, several efforts to do to this are already underway, including by various committees of the American Economic Association and the newly formed Sadie Collective, which one of us (Ms. Opoku-Agyeman) co-founded.
A small practical step that the American Economic Association and individual economics departments could take is to find alternatives to student evaluations of teachers. A large and growing literature finds evidence of the ineffectiveness of student evaluations in assessing instruction as well as evidence of gender and racial bias. "As a black and female lecturer," another respondent to the survey said, "I believe my student/course evaluations would be higher if I were white and/or male. The majority of my students are white" and some still "have a problem in seeing a black woman as an expert/authority figure."
Last year, Janet Yellen, the former head of the Federal Reserve Board, argued that a lack of diversity among economists was a liability for the profession because it could lead to a myopic sense of the most pressing problems and the most relevant solutions. "Women and men have significantly different approaches and views on public policy issues," she said, "which means that women's voices and those of minorities need to be heard."
The American Economic Association's survey is cause for optimism, since it takes the first step of acknowledging the problem for black women in the profession. Now senior economists and institutions employing economists must meaningfully tackle it.
